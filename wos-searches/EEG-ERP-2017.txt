Time is of the Essence: A Review of Electroencephalography (EEG) and Event-Related Brain Potentials (ERPs) in Language Research	APPLIED PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY AND BIOFEEDBACK			English	Review						EEG; ERPs; Electroencephalography; Event-related brain potentials; Language	ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; PHONEME REPRESENTATIONS; PICTURES; INCONGRUITY; INTEGRATION; VIOLATIONS; SENTENCES; SPEECH; WORDS; MUSIC	The discovery of electroencephalography (EEG) over a century ago has changed the way we understand brain structure and function, in terms of both clinical and research applications. This paper starts with a short description of EEG and then focuses on the event-related brain potentials (ERPs), and their use in experimental settings. It describes the typical set-up of an ERP experiment. A description of a number of ERP components typically involved in language research is presented. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of using ERPs in language research are discussed. EEG has an extensive use in today's world, including medical, psychology, or linguistic research. The excellent temporal resolution of EEG information allows one to track a brain response in milliseconds and therefore makes it uniquely suited to research concerning language processing.

This study investigated whether frontal electroencephalography (EEG) alpha asymmetry at resting conditions predicted the evaluation of emotional picture stimuli by event-related potentials (ERPs). In this study, participants first completed a 2-min resting task, and then passively viewed emotional pictures. The results showed that left active individuals had smaller frontal EEG alpha asymmetry scores to negative pictures than to positive and neutral pictures, whereas right active individuals had similar frontal EEG alpha asymmetry scores to negative, positive, and neutral pictures. Furthermore, the study showed a larger P300 to negative pictures than to positive and neutral pictures for left active individuals; however, there were no significant ERP differences to negative, positive, and neutral pictures for right active individuals. These findings suggest that frontal EEG alpha asymmetry at resting conditions can reflect interindividual differences in emotional perception tendencies to emotional picture stimuli.

Algorithm performance is measured in terms of space and time complexities required to solve a particular problem. The proposed approach correlates the performance with input data and output results. Initial theory of performance model generation is based on polynomial regressing and curve fitting of least mean square (LMS) algorithm for adaptive filtering. Testing and validation of the generated model has been done through the coefficient of determination parameters calculated over interpolation and extrapolation results. Other measures like adjusted R-2, sum of square error and mean square error are also reported. Overall study is summarised in form of algorithm, and is tested with LMS and recursive LMS algorithm of adaptive filtering applied over electroencephalography/event related potentials (EEG/ERP) noise removal to build up relation between input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and output fidelity parameters (like output SNR and correlation (r)).

Most studies looking at differences between extroverts and introverts are pen and paper based studies. However, in a few studies, electrophysiological signals were involved. In this paper, we reviewed studies examining extraversion personality using electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERP). It was found that some of the EEG studies claimed that extroverts and introverts can be differentiated using baseline EEG, while some others claimed otherwise. Conflicting findings were also observed in the ERP studies; higher/lower P300 amplitude in extroverts compared to that of introverts in visual stimuli tasks. These various findings are probably due to differences in their experimental protocols, sample size, or age of subjects. Other possible reasons include no consideration given on the main feature of extraversion and the studies only focused on EEG power spectral analysis. We are thus suggesting for future investigations to involve the main feature such as sociability and/or to incorporate more EEG features in the analysis to produce more robust and reliable results. This review constitutes a guidance for research on brain-related conditions of extroverts and introverts and shall be useful in many areas. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This chapter highlights the contribution of EEG to the study of human asymmetries in cognition. In the first part, we discuss the main methodological issues related to EEG recording, and describe a distinction between Event-Related Potential (ERP) responses and induced frequency activity. In the second part, we review some key findings on human lateralization in perception, language, and emotion. We conclude with some recent attempts to combine EEG with other neuroimaging techniques in the study of lateralized cognitive functions.

Each stimulus presentation, or trial, generates an ERP waveform which is an instance of functional data. The experiments are made up of sequences of multiple trials, resulting in longitudinal functional data and moreover, responses are recorded at multiple electrodes on the scalp, adding an electrode dimension. Traditional EEG analyses involve multiple simplifications of this structure to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, effectively collapsing the functional and longitudinal components by identifying key features of the ERPs and averaging them across trials. Motivated by an implicit learning paradigm used in autism research in which the functional, longitudinal, and electrode components all have critical interpretations, we propose a multidimensional functional principal components analysis (MD-FPCA) technique which does not collapse any of the dimensions of the ERP data. The proposed decomposition is based on separation of the total variation into subject and subunit level variation which are further decomposed in a two-stage functional principal components analysis. The proposed methodology is shown to be useful for modeling longitudinal trends in the ERP functions, leading to novel insights into the learning patterns of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and their typically developing peers as well as comparisons between the two groups. Finite sample properties of MD-FPCA are further studied via extensive simulations.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is an effective method to read user's intention with high temporal resolution. Our proposed system is mainly contributed to detecting driver's braking intention prior to stepping on the brake pedal in the emergency situation. We investigated early event-related potential (ERP) curves evoked by visual sensory process in emergency situation by using recurrent convolutional neural networks (RCNN) model. RCNN model has advantages to capture contextual and spatial patterns of brain signal. RCNN model is composed of a convolutional layer, two recurrent convolutional layers (RCLs), and a softmax layer. Fourteen participants drove for 120 minutes with two types of emergency situations and a normal driving situation in a virtual driving environment. In this article, early ERP showed a potential to be used for classifying the driver's braking intention. The classification performances based on RCNN and regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) at 200 ms post-stimulus time were 0.86 AUC score and 0.61 AUC score respectively. Following the results, braking intention was recognized at 380 ms earlier based on early ERP patterns using RCNN model than the brake pedal. Our system could be applied to other brain-computer interface (BCI) system for minimizing detection time by capturing early ERP curves based on RCNN model.

As the treatment of AD is very costly and the early discovery is beneficial, a low-cost, early detection mechanism is needed. In this study, Electroencephalography (EEG) data from seventeen subjects was used to determine if brain activity could be used to distinguish MCI with cognitively normal individuals and compare classification performance. Event-related brain potentials (ERP) were recorded in response to auditory speech stimuli. We extracted spectral and temporal features of the ERPs and built a MCI detection process with Support vector machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF). We have compared behavioral response against EEG based time domain features, frequency domain features, and top-ranked features of time-frequency domains. Four feature groups of our study demonstrate that the ranked time and frequency domain features of the EEG perform better than behavioral features and other EEG/ ERP response metrics. Our results demonstrate the performance of the detection of MCI with a cross-validation accuracy of 87.9%, sensitivity 85%, specificity 90%, and F-score 94%. Ability to objectively and reliably detect MCI at early might lead to efficacious treatment of AD and related disorders.

In current discrete clinical cognitive assessment methods used to diagnose mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/ dementia, physicians see patients annually or biannually. Theyrely on patient's history and clinical cognitive assessments to identify changes in memory or functional ability as indications of MCI/dementia in conjunction with exclusionary tests. They are limited in these discrete assessments by their accuracy and infrequent occurrence. The episodic assessment framework proposed will allow better ongoing information about the true wellbeing of the patient through assessment of memory and functional cognitive ability on a weekly or even daily basis between appointments. This paper identifies features of EEG/ERP measurements during Neuropsychological Behavioral Testing that could allow the future inclusion in the framework using now available consumer EEG devices. A pilot group of 32 participants (17 healthy, 15 MCI) was studied using a 1-back test, while their brain activity was measured using EEG. Features of the ERP thus generated were identified and measured. These ERP features and associated behavioral measurements from the 1-back test were analyzed to identify features both alone and in combination that allowed the correct classification of the participants using a repeated leave-one-out train and test method. A feature pair (1back response time and CPz correlation) was identified that provides the best two-feature performance (1 false positive/1 false negative error) with a third feature (response required -Pz P1 to N1 latency) providing additional improvement. Given these results, it is possible that episodic ERP measurements may help with cognitive impairment diagnosis in the future.

The ERP responses are elicited a few milliseconds after attending to an oddball stimulus; target and non-target stimulus are repeatedly flashed while the electroencephalography (EEG) is recording. ERP responses in the EEG signal have a poor signal-to-ratio in single-trial analysis; therefore, the epochs of the target and non-target trials are averaged over time in order to improve their decoding accuracy. Furthermore, these exogenous potentials can be naturally evoked by just looking at a target symbol. Therefore, the BCI system could generate unintended commands without considering the user's intention. In this study, we approach this dilemma by assuming that a greater effort for the mental task would evoke a stronger positive/negative ERP deflection. Three mental states are defined: passive gazing, active counting, and pitch-imagery. The experiments results showed significantly enhanced ERP patterns and averaged decoding accuracies of 80%, 95.4%, and 95.6%, respectively. The decoding accuracies between both active tasks and the passive task showed an averaged accuracy of 57.5% (gazing vs. counting) and 72.5% (gazing vs. pitch-imagery). Following this result, we proposed a hierarchy classification strategy where the passive or active mental state is decoded in the first stage, and the target stimuli are estimated in the second stage. Our work is the first to propose a system that classifies an intended or unintended brain state by considering the measurable differences of mental effort in the EEG signal so that unintended commands to the system are minimized.

Hence, in this study, we investigate the effects of mental work load on brain activity during an emergency situation in driving simulator. We compare the differences of electroencephalography (EEG) signals between emergency situations without-and with mental work load on simulated driving. Visual stimuli for emergency situation and auditory stimuli for mental work load situation were presented independently and simultaneously. We used regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) for classifying event-related potentials (ERPs) on mental events which are related to brain activity in time domain. The classification results in the emergency situations with the mental work load were significantly reduced as compared with in the only emergency situations.

This paper investigates the potential to identify an individual using brain signals and highlight the challenges of using EEG as a biometric modality in a recognition system. The understanding of designing an effective acquisition protocol is essential to the performance of the EEG-based biometric system. Different acquisition protocols of EEG based recognition i.e. relaxation, motor and non-motor imaginary, and evoked potentials were presented and discussed. Universality, permanence, uniqueness, and collectability are suggested as key requirements for constructing a viable biometric recognition system. Lastly, a summary of recent EEG biometrics studies was depicted before concluding on the findings. It is observed that both motor and non-motor imagery and event-related potential (ERP) outperformed the method of relaxation in acquisition protocol.

However, they may introduce their own physiological signals and alter the EEG/ERP outcome. A reference electrode standardization technique (REST) that calculated a reference point at infinity was proposed to solve this problem. To confirm the advantage of REST in ERP analyses of synchronous EEG-fMRI studies, we compared the reference effect of AR, LM, and REST on task-related ERP results of a working memory task during an fMRI scan. As we hypothesized, we found that the adopted reference did not change the topography map of ERP components (N1 and P300 in the present study), but it did alter the task-related effect on ERP components. LM decreased or eliminated the visual working memory (VWM) load effect on P300, and the AR distorted the distribution of VWM location-related effect at left posterior electrodes as shown in the statistical parametric scalp mapping (SPSM) of N1. ERP cortical source estimates, which are independent of the EEG reference choice, were used as the golden standard to infer the relative utility of different references on the ERP task-related effect. By comparison, REST reference provided a more integrated and reasonable result. These results were further confirmed by the results of fMRI activations and a corresponding EEG-only study. Thus, we recommend the REST, especially with a realistic head model, as the optimal reference method for ERP data analysis in simultaneous EEG-fMRI studies.

Thus, event-related brain potentials (ERPs), response force (RF) and oscillatory electroencephalography (EEG) activity were measured while participants were presented with pictures of body parts in painful or neutral situations. Their task consisted in either judging the painfulness of the stimuli or counting the body parts displayed. ERP results supported the assumption of an early automatic component of empathy for pain, as reflected by the early posterior negativity (EPN), and of a late controlled component, as reflected by the late posterior positivity (P3). RF indicated that empathy-evoking stimuli facilitate motor responses if attention is directed toward the pain dimension, whereas EEG oscillations in the mu-and beta-band revealed, independent of the task, an enhanced activation of the sensorimotor cortex after the response to painful compared to neutral stimuli. In conclusion, present findings indicate that empathy-evoking stimuli produce automatic and controlled effects on both perceptual and motor processing.

EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS SOURCE SEPARATION BASED ON A WEAK EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE	2017 IEEE 14TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON BIOMEDICAL IMAGING (ISBI 2017)	IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 14th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) - From Nano to Macro	APR 18-21, 2017	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA	IEEE, EMB, IEEE Signal Proc Soc		Blind Source Separation (BSS); Event-Related Potentials (ERP); Electroencephalogram (EEG); Weak Exclusion Principle (WEP)	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS	Currently, the standard event-related potentials (ERP) technique consists in averaging many on-going electroencephalogram (EEG) trials using the same stimuli. Key questions are how to extract the ERP from on-going EEG with fewer average times and how to further decompose ERP into basic components related to cognitive process. In this paper we introduce a novel Blind Source Separation (BSS) approach based on a weak exclusion principle (WEP) to solve these problems. The superior aspect of this algorithm is that it is based on a deterministic principle, which is more appropriate to analyze non-stationary EEG signals than most other BSS methods based on statistical hypotheses. The results show that our BSS algorithm can quickly and effectively extract ERPs using fewer average times than the traditional averaging methods. We show that, via BSS, we can isolate two main ERP components, which are respectively related to an exogenous process and a cognitive process, and can discriminate between the occipital lobe and the frontal lobe responses from the brain, agreeing with the classical component modeling in ERPs. Single-trial ERP separation results have demonstrated the consistency of these two main ERP components. Thus, BSS based on WEP can provide a window to better understand ERP, not only in averaging behavior, but in the complexities of moment-to-moment dynamics as well.

To this end event-related potentials (ERP) were recorded in response to three-syllabic nonsense words (non-words) with three consonant-vowel transitions (CVCVCV). The first syllable of the non-words being fixed, ERPs were triggered from the onset of the middle syllable, which was established by manually segmenting the non-words at phoneme level. The ERP responses elicited by the second syllable were examined. Nonparametric t-tests were carried out to compare the different ERP responses of the middle syllable. The results show that different ERPs were produced by consonants belonging to different phonemic categories (fricatives, plosives, liquids, nasals and affricates). ERP amplitudes and their scalp distribution differed from each other across non-similar phonetic categories. Consonants from the same phonemic category elicited similar ERP responses. Further, the scalp distributions of the ERP responses were characteristically different for different phoneme classes of consonants. These results suggest that the manner of articulation is an important component of the phonetic representation of consonants in the brain.

In this paper, we propose to use the sparse common component and innovations model (SCCI) to extract ERPs from multiple EEG signals recorded across closely located electrodes. This model finds the sparse representation of the common component of the signals and their innovation components with respect to pre-determined common and innovation dictionaries, where the common component refer to an event captured by adjacent electrodes such as ERPs. However, different stimuli may produce different responses and predetermining the dictionary may not always be optimal. Therefore, we introduce a structured dictionary learning method to simultaneously learn the two dictionaries from training data. The proposed method is applied to a study of error monitoring where two different types of brain responses are elicited corresponding to the decision made by the subject. The learned dictionaries can discriminate between the response types and extract the ERP corresponding to the two responses.

Since some electrophysiological studies suggest differences between children with/without motor development problems, we prepared an experimental protocol and performed electrophysiological experiments with the aim of making a step toward a possible diagnosis of this disorder using the event-related potentials (ERP) technique. The second aim is to properly annotate the obtained raw data with relevant metadata and promote their long-term sustainability. Results: The data from 32 school children (16 with possible DCD and 16 in the control group) were collected. Each dataset contains raw electroencephalography (EEG) data in the BrainVision format and provides sufficient metadata (such as age, gender, results of the motor test, and hearing thresholds) to allow other researchers to perform analysis. For each experiment, the percentage of ERP trials damaged by blinking artifacts was estimated. Furthermore, ERP trials were averaged across different participants and conditions, and the resulting plots are included in the manuscript. This should help researchers to estimate the usability of individual datasets for analysis. Conclusions: The aim of the whole project is to find out if it is possible to make any conclusions about DCD from EEG data obtained. For the purpose of further analysis, the data were collected and annotated respecting the current outcomes of the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility Program on Standards for Data Sharing, the Task Force on Electrophysiology, and the group developing the Ontology for Experimental Neurophysiology. The data with metadata are stored in the EEG/ERP Portal.

The classification method based on compression sensing (CS) theory. First, we use CS theory to reduce the dimensionality of the ERP signal. Second, the ERP signal was reconstructed by using K-SVD method to construct the over-complete redundant dictionary. Finally, the ERP signal was classified by calculating the residuals between the reconstructed samples and the test samples. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively classify the noisy ERP signal and avoid the feature extraction process in the signal recognition.

The study evaluates re-usage of existing openEHR archetypes and proposes a set of new archetypes together with the openEHR templates covering the domain. The main goals of the study are to (i) link existing EEGBase data/metadata and openEHR archetype structures and (ii) propose a new openEHR archetype set describing the EEG/ERP domain since this set of archetypes currently does not exist in public repositories. Methods: The main methodology is based on the determination of the concepts obtained from EEGBase experimental data and metadata that are expressible structurally by the openEHR reference model and semantically by openEHR archetypes. In addition, templates as the third openEHR resource allow us to define constraints over archetypes. Clinical Knowledge Manager (CKM), a public openEHR archetype repository, was searched for the archetypes matching the determined concepts. According to the search results, the archetypes already existing in CKM were applied and the archetypes not existing in the CKM were newly developed. openEHR archetypes support linkage to external terminologies. To increase semantic interoperability of the new archetypes, binding with the existing odML electrophysiological terminology was assured. Further, to increase structural interoperability, also other current solutions besides EEGBase were considered during the development phase. Finally, a set of templates using the selected archetypes was created to meet EEGBase requirements. Results: A set of eleven archetypes that encompassed the domain of experimental EEG/ERP measurements were identified. Of these, six were reused without changes, one was extended, and four were newly created. All archetypes were arranged in the templates reflecting the EEGBase metadata structure. A mechanism of odML terminology referencing was proposed to assure semantic interoperability of the archetypes. The openEHR approach was found to be useful not only for clinical purposes but also for experimental data modeling.

However, the commonly used electroencephalography (EEG) provides signals of low signal-to-noise ratio, making the systems slow and inaccurate. As an alternative noninvasive recording technique, the magnetoencephalography (MEG) could provide more advantageous electrophysiological signals due to a higher number of sensors and the magnetic fields not being influenced by volume conduction. We investigated whether MEG provides higher accuracy in detecting event-related fields (ERFs) compared to detecting ERPs in simultaneously recorded EEG, both evoked by a covert attention task, and whether a combination of the modalities is advantageous. In our approach, a detection algorithm based on spatial filtering is used to identify ERP/ERF components in a data-driven manner. We found that MEG achieves higher decoding accuracy (DA) compared to EEG and that the combination of both further improves the performance significantly. However, MEG data showed poor performance in cross-subject classification, indicating that the algorithm's ability for transfer learning across subjects is better in EEG. Here we show that BCI control by covert attention is feasible with EEG and MEG using a data-driven spatial filter approach with a clear advantage of the MEG regarding DA but with a better transfer learning in EEG.

J	Jia, HB; Li, HY; Yu, DC				Jia, Huibin; Li, Huayun; Yu, Dongchuan			The relationship between ERP components and EEG spatial complexity in a visual Go/Nogo task	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						spatial complexity; visual Go/Nogo task; event-related potentials	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; MULTICHANNEL EEG; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MULTISCALE ENTROPY; NOGO TASK; BRAIN; GO; POTENTIALS; ATTENTION	The ERP components and variations of spatial complexity or functional connectivity are two distinct dimensions of neurophysiological events in the visual Go/Nogo task. Extensive studies have been conducted on these two distinct dimensions; however, no study has investigated whether these two neurophysiological events are linked to each other in the visual Go/Nogo task. The relationship between spatial complexity of electroencephalographic (EEG) data, quantified by the measure omega complexity, and event-related potential (ERP) components in a visual Go/Nogo task was studied. We found that with the increase of spatial complexity level, the latencies of N1 and N2 component were shortened and the amplitudes of N1, N2, and P3 components were decreased. The anterior Go/Nogo N2 effect and the Go/Nogo P3 effect were also found to be decreased with the increase of EEG spatial complexity. In addition, the reaction times in high spatial complexity trials were significantly shorter than those of medium and low spatial complexity trials when the time interval used to estimate the EEG spatial complexity was extended to 0 similar to 1,000 ms after stimulus onset. These results suggest that high spatial complexity may be associated with faster cognitive processing and smaller postsynaptic potentials that occur simultaneously in large numbers of cortical pyramidal cells of certain brain regions. The EEG spatial complexity is closely related with demands of certain cognitive processes and the neural processing efficiency of human brain. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The reaction times, the latencies/amplitudes of event-related potential (ERP) components, the Go/Nogo N2 effect, and the Go/Nogo P3 effect are linked to the electroencephalographic (EEG) spatial complexity level. The EEG spatial complexity is closely related to demands of certain cognitive processes and could reflect the neural processing efficiency of human brain. Obtaining the single-trial ERP features through single-trial spatial complexity may be a more efficient approach than traditional methods.

Preprocessing inter-rater reliability (IRR) and how differences in preprocessing may affect outcomes of primary event-related potential (ERP) analyses has not been previously assessed. Three raters independently preprocessed EEG data of 16 cognitively healthy adult participants (ages 18-39 years) who performed a memory task. Using intraclass correlations (ICCs), IRR was assessed for Early-frontal, Late-frontal, and Parietal Old/new memory effects contrasts across eight regions of interest (ROIs). IRR was good to excellent for all ROIs; 22 of 26 ICCs were above 0.80. Raters were highly consistent in preprocessing across ROIs, although the frontal pole ROI (ICC range 0.60-0.90) showed less consistency. Old/new parietal effects had highest ICCs with the lowest variability. Rater preprocessing differences did not alter primary ERP results. IRR for EEG preprocessing was good to excellent, and subjective rater-removal of EEG artifacts did not alter primary memory-task ERP results. Findings provide preliminary support for robustness of cognitive/memory task-related ERP results against significant inter-rater preprocessing variability and suggest reliability of EEG to assess cognitive-neurophysiological processes multiple preprocessors are involved.

This pilot study examined how the P300 latency component of event-related potentials (ERPs), measured using electroencephalography (EEG) while participants performed a go/no-go task, might be associated with cooccurring self-report of trauma and depression symptoms in a sample of college students (N = 38). Alpha-corrected independent sample t tests revealed statistically significant differences in ERP P300 peak latencies between those in the high cooccurring trauma and depression symptoms group (n = 12) and those in the low group (n = 26) for all 3 midline electrode sites (Fz, Cz, and Pz). This pilot study provides preliminary evidence of differential brain functioning in individuals experiencing cooccurring trauma and depression symptoms. Accordingly, these findings support future research examining brain functioning in cooccurring symptoms.

We systematically reviewed 100 randomly selected clinical human electrophysiology studies from six high impact journals that frequently publish electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potential (ERP) research to determine the proportion of studies that reported sample size calculations, as well as the proportion of studies reporting the necessary components to complete such calculations. Studies were coded by the two authors blinded to the other's results. Inter-rater reliability was 100% for the sample size calculations and kappa above 0.82 for all other variables. Zero of the 100 studies (0%) reported sample size calculations. 77% utilized repeated-measures designs, yet zero studies (0%) reported the necessary variances and correlations among repeated measures to accurately calculate future sample sizes. Most studies (93%) reported study statistical values (e.g., For t values). Only 40% reported effect sizes, 56% reported mean values, and 47% reported indices of variance (e.g., standard deviations/standard errors). Absence of such information hinders accurate determination of sample sizes for study design, grant applications, and meta-analyses of research and whether studies were adequately powered to detect effects of interest. Increased focus on sample size calculations, utilization of registered reports, and presenting information detailing sample size calculations and statistics for future researchers are needed and will increase sample size-related scientific rigor in human electrophysiology research.

Using Portable EEG to Assess Human Visual Attention	AUGMENTED COGNITION: NEUROCOGNITION AND MACHINE LEARNING, AC 2017, PT I	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Universal Access in Human-Computer Interaction (UAHCI) held as part of 19th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI International)	JUL 09-14, 2017	Vancouver, CANADA			EEG; ERP; Attention; Visuospatial attention; Portable technology	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; P300 COMPONENT; COGNITION; STIMULI; INDEX; ERP	Over the past ten years there has been a rapid increase in the number of portable electroencephalographic (EEG) systems available to researchers. However, to date, there has been little work validating these systems for event-related potential (ERP) research. Here we demonstrate that the MUSE portable EEG system can be used to quickly assess and quantify the ERP responses associated with visuospatial attention. Specifically, in the present experiment we had participants complete a standard "oddball" task wherein they saw a series of infrequently (targets) and frequently (control) appearing circles while EEG data was recorded from a MUSE headband. For task performance, participants were instructed to count the number of target circles that they saw. After the experiment, an analysis of the EEG data evoked by the target circles when contrasted with the EEG data evoked by the control circles revealed two ERP components - the N200 and the P300. The N200 is typically associated with stimulus/perceptual processing whereas the P300 is typically associated with a variety of cognitive processes including the allocation of visuospatial attention [1]. It is important to note that the physical manifestation of the N200 and P300 ERP components differed from reports using standard EEG systems; however, we have validated that this is due to the quantification of these ERP components at non-standard electrode locations. Importantly, our results demonstrate that a portable EEG system such as the MUSE can be used to examine the ERP responses associated with the allocation of visuospatial attention.

ERP has been introduced into brain computer interfaces (BCIs) to communicate the computer with the subject's intention. Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG, most ERP studies are based on grand-averaging over many trials. Recently single-trial ERP detection attracts more attention, which enables real time processing tasks as rapid face identification. All the targets needed to be retrieved may appear only once, and there is no knowledge of target label for averaging. More interestingly, how the features contribute temporally and spatially to single-trial ERP detection has not been fully investigated. In this paper, we propose to implement a local-learning-based (LLB) feature extraction method to investigate the importance of spatial-temporal components of ERP in a task of rapid face identification using single-trial detection. Comparing to previous methods, LLB method preserves the nonlinear structure of EEG signal distribution, and analyze the importance of original spatial-temporal components via optimization in feature space. As a data-driven methods, the weighting of the spatial-temporal component does not depend on the ERP detection method. The importance weights are optimized by making the targets more different from non-targets in feature space, and regularization penalty is introduced in optimization for sparse weights. This spatial-temporal feature extraction method is evaluated on the EEG data of 15 participants in performing a face identification task using rapid serial visual presentation paradigm. Comparing with other methods, the proposed spatial-temporal analysis method uses sparser (only 10% of the total) features, and could achieve comparable performance (98%) of single-trial ERP detection as the whole features across different detection methods. The interesting finding is that the N250 is the earliest temporal component that contributes to single-trial ERP detection in face identification. And the importance of N250 components is more laterally distributed toward the left hemisphere. We show that using only the left N250 component over-performs the right N250 in the face identification task using single-trial ERP detection. The finding is also important in building a fast and efficient (fewer electrodes) BCI system for rapid face identification.

This may contribute to recurrent seizures and behavioral problems that may be treated by agents that enhance GABAergic transmission by influencing chloride regulation. Case presentation: Here, we used the chloride transporter antagonist bumetanide to treat a female adolescent TSC patient with refractory seizures, sensory hyper-reactivity, and a variety of repetitive and compulsive behaviors. Methods: To evaluate the effect of bumetanide on behavior, auditory sensory processing, and hyperexcitability, we obtained questionnaire data, event-related potentials (ERP), and resting state EEG at baseline, after 3 and 6 months of treatment and after 1 month washout period. Discussion: Six months of treatment resulted in a marked improvement in all relevant behavioral domains, as was substantiated by the parent questionnaires. In addition, resting-state electroencephalography and ERP suggested a favorable effect of bumetanide on hyperexcitability and sensory processing. These findings encourage further studies of bumetanide on neuropsychiatric outcome in TSC.

At the lower end of both the arousal and awareness scales is coma, defined as a state of unresponsiveness, in which a patient cannot be awaken. Recovery from coma following brain injury occurs through a sequence of disorders of consciousness (DOC) ranging from unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS)/vegetative state (VS) which shows no signs of awareness to minimally conscious states (MCS) from which consciousness can emerge. The graded consciousness recovery parallels scales of brain injury severity suggesting that consciousness recovers by "turning on" hierarchical services. This sequence resembles a computer "booting" process, which may "hang" at a specific "intermediate levels of consciousness" such as UWS/VS or MCS. The recovery sequence can be assessed by electroencephalography (EEG), a large-scale measure of fluctuations in electrical activity of the brain. Resting state EEG assesses the graded recovery of brain oscillations from isoelectric line to burst-suppression (BS) to EEG slowing to wakefulness alpha activity and faster rhythms. Given that some degree of "connectivity" is required for consciousness, the assessment of DOC can be improved by testing the EEG in controlled stimulation paradigms addressing either the event related potential (ERP) or the event related changes in background EEG rhythms referred to as reactivity, which can be evoked even in BS. This grading of EEG changes provides the rationale for developing EEG indexes for monitoring the "booting process" during coma recovery to improve the diagnosis and prognostication of DOC.

However, how these processes are affected by the amputation of a limb is still unclear. Methods: Twenty-five right upper-limb amputees and the same number of matched healthy controls participated in a hand mental rotation task. Thirty-two-channel electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded and the event-related potentials (ERPs) were analyzed. Results: In the early visual processing phase, amputees and controls showed a similar P100. During the categorization phase, the amputees exhibited a decreased N200 compared with controls, and the decline was positively correlated with the time since amputation. In the mental rotation phase, controls had a larger ERP for the right upright hand than for the left upright hand, while amputees had a larger ERP for the left (intact) upright hand than for the right (affected) upright hand. Conclusions: Early visual processing was not affected by limb amputation. However, the perceptual salience of hand pictures decreased and the intact hand gained more significance in the amputees. Significance: Event-related potentials had the capability of showing the differences in categorization and mental rotation phases between amputees and controls.

Choosing MUSE: Validation of a Low-Cost, Portable EEG System for ERP Research	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; ERP; portable electronics; cognitive science; executive function	COGNITION; TOOLBOX	In recent years there has been an increase in the number of portable low-cost electroencephalographic (EEG) systems available to researchers. However, to date the validation of the use of low-cost EEG systems has focused on continuous recording of EEG data and/or the replication of large system EEG setups reliant on event-markers to afford examination of event-related brain potentials (ERP). Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to conduct ERP research without being reliant on event markers using a portable MUSE EEG system and a single computer. Specifically, we report the results of two experiments using data collected with the MUSE BEG system one using the well-known visual oddball paradigm and the other using a standard reward-learning task. Our results demonstrate that we could observe and quantify the N200 and P300 ERP components in the visual oddball task and the reward positivity (the mirror opposite component to the feedback-related negativity) in the reward-learning task. Specifically, single sample t-tests of component existence (all p's < 0.05), computation of Bayesian credible intervals, and 95% confidence intervals all statistically verified the existence of the N200, P300, and reward positivity in all analyses. We provide with this research paper an open source website with all the instructions, methods, and software to replicate our findings and to provide researchers with an easy way to use the MUSE EEG system for ERP research. Importantly, our work highlights that with a single computer and a portable EEG system such as the MUSE one can conduct ERP research with ease thus greatly extending the possible use of the ERP methodology to a variety of novel contexts.

Electrophysiological Correlates of Word Retrieval in Traumatic Brain Injury	JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Article						EEG; ERP; sports concussion; traumatic brain injury; word retrieval	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; OBJECT MEMORY RETRIEVAL; CONCUSSION; DYSFUNCTION; PLAYERS; ABNORMALITIES; SEPARATION; ARTIFACTS; INTEGRITY	Persons who have had a traumatic brain injury (TBI) often have word retrieval deficits; however, the underlying neural mechanisms of such deficits are yet to be clarified. Previous studies in normal subjects have shown that during a word retrieval task, there is a 750msec event-related potential (ERP) divergence detected at the left fronto-temporal region when subjects evaluate word pairs that facilitate retrieval compared with responses elicited by word pairs that do not facilitate retrieval. In this study, we investigated the neurophysiological correlates of word retrieval networks in 19 retired professional athletes with TBI and 19 healthy control (HC) subjects. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) in the participants during a semantic object retrieval task. In this task, participants indicated whether presented word pairs did (retrieval) or did not (non-retrieval) facilitate the retrieval of an object name. There were no significant differences in accuracy or reaction time between the two groups. The EEG showed a significant group by condition interaction over the left fronto-temporal region. The HC group mean amplitudes were significantly different between conditions, but the TBI group data did not show this difference, suggesting neurophysiological effects of injury. These findings provide evidence that ERP amplitudes may be used as a marker of disrupted semantic retrieval circuits in persons with TBI even when those persons perform normally.

An endogenous ERP component, P300, has been widely inspected in detecting deception. Detecting P300 from EEG signals is hard to find because P300 is overloaded with noise and other EEG signals. We typically use the features of the amplitude and latency of P300 to recognize P300. In this paper we are presenting several methods for the efficient detection of P300 detection algorithms such as; reconstruction algorithm for small P300 wave using Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) method using BackPropagation network, Multi-domain EEG signal processing. Each detection method has good effectiveness but the complexation level is dissimilar for each algorithm based on the constraints and optimal features used at the classification stage. This survey will brings you algorithms for the P300 detection and give you detail idea about the use of them.

At present, the systems available for the collection of high-quality EEG/ERP data make significant demands on children with developmental disabilities, such as those with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Children with ASD may have difficulty adapting to novel situations, tolerating uncomfortable sensory stimuli, and sitting quietly. This familiarization protocol uses Evidence-Based Practices (EBPs) to increase research participants' knowledge and understanding of the specific activities and steps of the research protocol. The tools in this familiarization protocol are a social narrative, a visual schedule, the Premack principle, role-playing, and modeling. The goal of this familiarization protocol is to increase understanding and agency and to potentially reduce anxiety for child participants, resulting in a greater likelihood of the successful completion of the research protocol for the collection of EEG/ERP data.

This study applied electroencephalography (EEG) in healthy subjects and investigated how high a concentration of oxygen in inhaled air (i.e., nor-mobaric hyperoxia) alters brain activity under resting-state and task-evoked conditions. Study 1 investigated its impact on resting EEG and revealed that hyperoxia suppressed alpha (8-13Hz) and beta (14-35Hz) band power (by 15.6 +/- 2.3% and 14.1 +/- 3.1%, respectively), but did not change the delta (1-3Hz),theta (4-7Hz), and gamma (36-75Hz) bands. Sham control experiments did not result in such changes. Study 2 reproduced these findings, and, furthermore, examined the effect of hyperoxia on visual stimulation event-related potentials (ERP). It was found that the main peaks of visual ERP, specifically N1 and P2, were both delayed during hyperoxia compared to normoxia (P = 0.04 and 0.02, respectively). In contrast, the amplitude of the peaks did not show a change. Our results suggest that hyperoxia has a pronounced effect on brain neural activity, for both resting-state and task-evoked potentials.

Local field potentials (LFPs) recorded via a multi-laminar microelectrode can provide a more detailed account of simultaneous neural activity across different cortical layers in the neocortex, but the technique is invasive. Combining EEG and LFP measurements in a pre-clinical model can greatly enhance understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in the generation of EEG signals, and facilitate the derivation of a more realistic and biologically accurate mathematical model of EEG. A simple procedure for acquiring concurrent and co-localized EEG and multi-laminar LFP signals in the anesthetized rodent is presented here. We also investigated whether EEG signals were significantly affected by a burr hole drilled in the skull for the insertion of a microelectrode. Our results suggest that the burr hole has a negligible impact on EEG recordings.

Using the Comprehension-Elaboration Theory of humor as the main research background, the experiment manipulated the head portraits of celebrities based on the independent variables of facial deformation (large/small) and addition of affective features (positive/negative). A 64-channel electroencephalography was recorded in 30 participants while viewing the incongruous drawings of celebrities. The electroencephalography temporal and spectral responses were measured during the three stages of humor which included incongruity detection, incongruity comprehension and elaboration of humor. Analysis of event-related potentials indicated that for humorous vs non-humorous drawings, facial deformation and the addition of affective features significantly affected the degree of humor elicited, specifically: large > small deformation; negative > positive affective features. The N170, N270, N400, N600-800 and N900-1200 components showed significant differences, particularly in the right prefrontal and frontal regions. Analysis of event-related spectral perturbation showed significant differences in the theta band evoked in the anterior cingulate cortex, parietal region and posterior cingulate cortex; and in the alpha and beta bands in the motor areas. These regions are involved in emotional processing, memory retrieval, and laughter and feelings of amusement induced by elaboration of the situation.	[Wang, Regina W.

The event-related potential (ERP)based BCI problem consists of a binary pattern recognition. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is widely used to solve this type of classification problems, but it fails when the number of features is large relative to the number of observations. In this work we propose a penalized version of the sparse discriminant analysis (SDA), called generalized sparse discriminant analysis (GSDA), for binary classification. This method inherits both the discriminative feature selection and classification properties of SDA and it also improves SDA performance through the addition of Kullback-Leibler class discrepancy information. The GSDA method is designed to automatically select the optimal regularization parameters. Numerical experiments with two real ERP-EEG datasets show that, on one hand, GSDA outperforms standard SDA in the sense of classification performance, sparsity and required computing time, and, on the other hand, it also yields better overall performances, compared to well-known ERP classification algorithms, for single-trial ERP classification when insufficient training samples are available. Hence, GSDA constitute a potential useful method for reducing the calibration times in ERP-based BCI systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Language is one of those cognitions that has been studied with this technique, which allows for more accurate temporal resolution between the stimulus presented and the time in which we observe an activation resulting from this stimulus. The area of language acquisition has especially benefited from this technique since it is possible to investigate relationships between linguistic data and brain activation without the need for an explicit response. The purpose of this article is to present the state of the art in children's sentence processing captured by the ERP technique.

EEG recordings were conducted biweekly at three time-points applying an ERP paradigm encompassing a passive condition involving hearing their own name randomly interspersed between an unfamiliar name (UN), and an active condition with instruction to count their own name. Functional and cognitive outcome 6 months post-injury was measured with Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) and neuropsychological tests of attention and memory. Ten patients demonstrated a significantly enhanced cognitive P3 in the active counting task compared with passive listening across recordings, and six presented with normalization of P3 in the counting task. Moreover, P3 amplitude to the counting task at the third time-point was positively correlated with both functional outcome (GOSE) and cognition (verbal learning, attentional set-shifting, and switching) 6 months post-injury. ERP can index cognitive capacities in the early phase following sTBI, and the cognitive P3 component in an active design is associated with functional and cognitive outcome, demonstrating that the cognitive P3 may yield valuable information of residual cognition and provide supplementary prognostic information.

J	Wu, DR				Wu, Dongrui			Online and Offline Domain Adaptation for Reducing BCI Calibration Effort	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON HUMAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); domain adaptation (DA); EEG; event-related potential (ERP); transfer learning	BRAIN; CLASSIFICATION; REGULARIZATION; FRAMEWORK; CORTEX; TASK	Many real-world brain-computer interface (BCI) applications rely on single-trial classification of event-related potentials (ERPs) in EEG signals. However, because different subjects have different neural responses to even the same stimulus, it is very difficult to build a generic ERP classifier whose parameters fit all subjects. The classifier needs to be calibrated for each individual subject, using some labeled subject-specific data. This paper proposes both online and offline weighted adaptation regularization (wAR) algorithms to reduce this calibration effort, i.e., to minimize the amount of labeled subject-specific EEG data required in BCI calibration, and hence to increase the utility of the BCI system. We demonstrate using a visually evoked potential oddball task and three different EEG headsets that both online and offline wAR algorithms significantly outperform several other algorithms. Moreover, through source domain selection, we can reduce their computational cost by about 50%, making them more suitable for real-time applications.

An attempt has been made to translate a cognitive activity (deliberate eye blink) of human subjects captured via electroencephalography (EEG) into action. Channel power spectral and the highest peak related features have been extracted to identify eye blink related instances. A significant rise in event related potential is observed across frontal lobes of cerebral cortex. The developed model has been deployed in arduino using simulink to control output devices independently. The results demonstrate the feasibility of cognitive control network to translate deliberate intentions into commands via EEG based BCI for rehabilitation of physically challenged patients.

To properly manage the psychological and emotional health caused by negative emotions in our daily life, we need to recognize the various emotional states firstly. In order to find out the special cognitive emotional characteristics to reach high emotional identification accuracy, the aim of this paper is to explore the brain emotional oscillatory activity induced by visual and audio stimuli from IAPS and IADS databases in the amplitude measurement. Event related potential (ERP) analysis is used to find out the pronounced emotional characteristics in the emotion recognition. Thirty subjects are employed in the visual and audio experiments. A significance level of p < 0.01 is combined with ERP to analyze the brain signal data in order to discover significant effects. The results show that, two narrow time ranges (650-750ms and 800-900ms) in the late positive potential (LPP) are come up with five emotional states in the several brain regions for the visual induced emotion state changes. Six narrow time ranges from 0 to 1s of ERP are proposed to study potential various with three emotional states in the several brain regions for the audio induced emotion state changes. The results provide preliminary evidence for narrowing the time range of ERP in the emotion recognition research.

We hypothesized that by reducing the standard inter-stimulus interval (ISI), the increased number of trial repetitions possible may increase SNR. In order to further investigate this, we performed the largest study to date assessing chemosensory ERP using short and long ISIs in 101 participants of varying olfactory function. Using rose odor (phenylethylalcohol, PEA) as a relatively selective olfactory stimulant, we found no significant difference in the proportion of individuals in whom ERPs were recorded using short or long ISIs. This was true in normosmic, hyposmic and functionally anosmic individuals. We also demonstrated significantly increased SNR using short PEA-ISIs, in the normosmic and functionally anosmic groups. Comparing between groups of different olfactory function, hyposmic patients achieved faster onsets and greater amplitudes than normosmics under the PEA-10s protocol. This could be due to increased stimulus attendance, but requires confirmation with further research. (C) 2017 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Whitcroft, K.

Applications include brain-computer interfaces, artifact removal, and identifying parallel neural processes. We wish to address the issue of applying BSS to event-related responses, which is challenging because of nonstationary data. Methods: We introduce a new BSS approach calledmomentary-uncorrelated component analysis (MUCA), which is tailored for event-related multitrial data. The method is based on approximate joint diagonalization of multiple covariance matrices estimated from the data at separate latencies. We further show how to extend the methodology for autocovariance matrices and how to apply BSS methods suitable for piecewise stationary data to eventrelated responses. We compared several BSS approaches by using simulated EEG as well as measured somatosensory and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) evoked EEG. Results: Among the compared methods, MUCA was the most tolerant one to noise, TMS artifacts, and other challenges in the data. Withmeasured somatosensory data, over half of the estimated components were found to be similar by MUCA and independent component analysis. MUCA was also stable when tested with several input datasets. Conclusion: MUCA is based on simple assumptions, and the results suggest that MUCA is robust with nonideal data. Significance: Event-related responses and BSS are valuable and popular tools in neuroscience. Correctly designed BSS is an efficient way of identifying artifactual and neural processes from nonstationary event-related data.

The combination of SVMs allows to handle the problem of EEG data variability between the different sessions of the acquisition process. This variability is caused by temporal non-stationarity of brain EEG signals. Hence, each SVM classifier is applied to a training set from the same session BMI data acquisition. A temporal extraction of P3 Event Related Potentials features is firstly conducted, then an offline classification of the extracted P3-speller responses is performed using the mixed SVMs. Simulation results show good performances classification, the ratio reach 84% after 15 test sequences.

To answer this question, we compared Event Related Potentials (ERPs) correlated with success and failure during a highly-ecological-virtual game. Participants played a tennis-like game in an immersive 3D virtual world, against a computer player, by controlling a virtual tennis racket with a force feedback robotic arm. Results showed that success, i.e. hitting the target, and failure, by missing the target, evoked ERP's that differ by peak, latencies, scalp signal distributions, sLORETA source estimation, and time-frequency patterns. The success related grand averaged ERP at the Cz electrode, had two peaks - a negative peak at 244 ms and a positive peak at 12 ms, prior to the actual successful hit, suggesting a possible process of prediction of success. The grand averaged ERP correlated with failure at Cz, had two peaks, a negative peak at about 107 ms and a positive peak at about 311 ms post failure. These results suggest different top-down and bottom-up loops for success and failure, which seem to be rooted in the spatial arrangement of the virtual game. Although the latency of the latter is consistent with the error related potentials reported in the literature, the characteristic is unique to this specific error, and differ significantly from other error related potentials in the same environment. These results further provide a basis for EEG based assessment and prediction of user's successful or erroneous movements, and design of the feedback loop in EEG based Brain-Computer Interfaces.

Emotional Granularity Effects on Event-Related Brain Potentials during Affective Picture Processing	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						emotional granularity; electroencephalography; event-related potentials; event-related desynchronization and synchronization; affective stimulus processing	WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DIFFERENTIATION; ERP; EXPERIENCE; DESYNCHRONIZATION; UNPLEASANT; CATEGORIZATION; METAANALYSIS	There is debate about whether emotional granularity, the tendency to label emotions in a nuanced and specific manner, is merely a product of labeling abilities, or a systematic difference in the experience of emotion during emotionally evocative events. According to the Conceptual Act Theory of Emotion (CAT) (Barrett, 2006), emotional granularity is due to the latter and is a product of on-going temporal differences in how individuals categorize and thus make meaning of their affective states. To address this question, the present study investigated the effects of individual differences in emotional granularity on electroencephalography-based brain activity during the experience of emotion in response to affective images. Event-related potentials(ERP) and eventrelated desynchronization and synchronization (ERD/ERS) analysis techniques were used. We found that ERP responses during the very early (60-90 ms), middle (270300 ms), and later (540- 570 ms) moments of stimulus presentation were associated with individuals ' level of granularity. We also observed that highly granular individuals, compared to lowly granular individuals, exhibited relatively stable desynchronization of alpha power (8-12 Hz) and synchronization of gamma power (30-50 Hz) during the 3 s of stimulus presentation. Overall, our results suggest that emotional granularity is related to differences in neural processing throughout emotional experiences and that high granularity could be associated with access to executive control resources and a more habitual processing of affective stimuli, or a kind of '' emotional complexity.'' Implications for models of emotion are also discussed.

J	Vareka, L; Mautner, P				Vareka, Lukas; Mautner, Pavel			Stacked Autoencoders for the P300 Component Detection	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain-computer interfaces; deep learning; event-related potentials; machine learning; P300; stacked autoencoders	CLASSIFICATION; BCI	Novel neural network training methods (commonly referred to as deep learning) have emerged in recent years. Using a combination of unsupervised pre-training and subsequent fine-tuning, deep neural networks have become one of the most reliable classification methods. Since deep neural networks are especially powerful for high-dimensional and non-linear feature vectors, electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) are one of the promising applications. Furthermore, to the authors' best knowledge, there are very few papers that study deep neural networks for EEG/ERP data. The aim of the experiments subsequently presented was to verify if deep learning-based models can also perform well for single trial P300 classification with possible application to P300-based brain-computer interfaces. The P300 data used were recorded in the EEG/ERP laboratory at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of West Bohemia, and are publicly available. Stacked autoencoders (SAEs) were implemented and compared with some of the currently most reliable state-of-the-art methods, such as LDA and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The parameters of stacked autoencoders were optimized empirically. The layers were inserted one by one and at the end, the last layer was replaced by a supervised softmax classifier. Subsequently, fine-tuning using backpropagation was performed. The architecture of the neural network was 209-130-100-50-20-2. The classifiers were trained on a dataset merged from four subjects and subsequently tested on different 11 subjects without further training. The trained SAE achieved 69.2% accuracy that was higher (p < 0.01) than the accuracy of MLP (64.9%) and LDA (65.9%). The recall of 58.8% was slightly higher when compared with MLP (56.2%) and LDA (58.4%). Therefore, SAEs could be preferable to other state-of-the-art classifiers for high-dimensional event-related potential feature vectors.

Social cognition requires the integration of several neural circuits in a time-sensitive fashion, so impairments in social interactions could arise as a result of alterations in network connectivity. Electroencephalography (EEG) has revealed abnormalities in event related potentials (ERPs) evoked by auditory and visual sensory stimuli in humans with ASD, indicating disruption of neural connectivity. Similar abnormalities in sensory-evoked ERPs have been observed in animal models of ASD, suggesting that ERPs have the potential to provide a translational biomarker of the disorder. People with ASD also have abnormal ERPs in response to auditory and visual social stimuli, demonstrating functional disruption of the social circuit. To assess the integrity of the social circuit and characterize biomarkers of circuit dysfunction, novel EEG paradigms that use social stimuli to induce ERPs should be developed for use in animal models. The identification of a socially-relevant ERP that is consistent in animal models and humans would facilitate the development of pharmacological treatment strategies for the social impairments in ASD and other neuropsychiatric disorders.

Psychometric considerations in the measurement of event-related brain potentials: Guidelines for measurement and reporting	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Event-related potentials; Psychometrics; Guidelines; Dependability; ERP reliability analysis toolbox	TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; SCORE RELIABILITY; P50 SUPPRESSION; STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE; COGNITIVE DEFICITS; MEASUREMENT ERROR; VALIDITY; POWER; EEG; ERP	Failing to consider psychometric issues related to reliability and validity, differential deficits, and statistical power potentially undermines the conclusions of a study. In research using event-related brain potentials (ERPs), numerous contextual factors (population sampled, task, data recording, analysis pipeline, etc.) can impact the reliability of ERP scores. The present review considers the contextual factors that influence ERP score reliability and the downstream effects that reliability has on statistical analyses. Given the context-dependent nature of ERPs, it is recommended that ERP score reliability be formally assessed on a study-by-study basis. Recommended guidelines for ERP studies include 1) reporting the threshold of acceptable reliability and reliability estimates for observed scores, 2) specifying the approach used to estimate reliability, and 3) justifying how trial-count minima were chosen. A reliability threshold for internal consistency of at least 0.70 is recommended, and a threshold of 0.80 is preferred. The review also advocates the use of generalizability theory for estimating score dependability (the generalizability theory analog to reliability) as an improvement on classical test theory reliability estimates, suggesting that the latter is less well suited to ERP research. To facilitate the calculation and reporting of dependability estimates, an open-source Matlab program, the ERP Reliability Analysis Toolbox, is presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In fact, there are many factors that affect its activity, and this has given rise to great controversy. The aim of this paper is to present the results for a higher education study group aged between 22 and 30 years during motion stimuli. This study investigated the EEG power suppression and phase synchrony in different sub-bands (theta, lower alpha and higher alpha). Significant differences were obtained by comparing biological (human) to non-biological (object), static/dynamic and observation/action execution of voluntary finger movement stimuli. These results suggest that alpha frequency suppression could be divided into two or more ranges in order to study it in more detail, and new signal processing techniques could also offer more information about its behaviour.

However, the research benefit of such cEEGrid recordings critically depends on their validity. To investigate whether visual and motor processing are reflected in the cEEGrid-EEG, a direct comparison of EEG that was concurrently recorded with the cEEGrids and with a high-density cap setup was conducted. Thirteen participants performed a classic Simon task in which letters were presented laterally and a lateralized choice response was executed. N1, P1 and P300 event-related potential (ERP) waveforms were extracted from cEEGrid-EEG: they were found to be strongly correlated with corresponding waveforms extracted from cap-EEG but with lower signal strength and lower signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). Event-related lateralizations (ERLs) recorded at posterior scalp sites were well reflected in middle cEEGrid pairs. Moreover, the effect size of the Simon correspondence effect on the extracted ERLs was similar between the two systems. However, lateralizations at central cap sites were less well reflected in the cEEGrid-EEG indicating a difficulty in capturing motor response preparation and execution. These results show that well-described visual and cognitive ERPs and ERLs can be measured using the cEEGrids, while motor-related cortical potentials are not well captured. This study further demonstrates the potential and possible limitations of unobtrusive cEEGrid-EEG recordings.

Also, individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are in a group of risk that should be followed and treated since there is a high probability of evolution to AD. In this study we carried out an Event-Related Potential (ERP) analysis on patient and control groups from 32-channel EEG recorded during N-back working memory (WM) tasks with the aim of finding an ERP-based biomarker for early diagnosis of both AD and MCI. Participants were 15 AD patients, 20 individuals diagnosed with MCI and 26 age-matched healthy elderly (HE) controls. Subjects underwent a three-level visual N-back task with ascending memory load difficulty. Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis tests with cluster correction and 5% significance level were used for statistical analysis. A considerable amount of significant differences between patient and control groups were found in the ERP during execution of the WM tasks, predominantly in fronto-centro-parietal electrodes. Such results are promising in the direction of achieving an early EEG-based diagnosis of MCI and AD.

Currently, event-related potential (ERP)-based BCI is an important branch of noninvasive electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCIs. Extracting ERPs from a limited number of trials remains challenging due to their low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and low spatial resolution caused by volume conduction. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model for trial-by-trial concatenated EEG, in which the concatenated ERPs are expressed as a linear combination of a set of discrete sine and cosine bases. The bases are simply determined by the data length of a single trial. A sparse prior on the rank of the spatio-spectral pattern matrix is introduced into the model to allow the number of components to be automatically determined. A maximum posterior estimation algorithm based on cyclic descent is then developed to estimate the spatiospectral patterns. A spatial filter can then be obtained by maximizing the SNR of the ERP components. Experiments on both synthetic data and real N170 ERP from 13 subjects were conducted to test the efficacy and efficiency of the algorithm. The results showed that the proposed algorithm can estimate the ERPs more accurately than the several state-of-the-art algorithms.

EEG was recorded to assess feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the magnitude of the stress response through autonomic nervous system activity and salivary cortisol. Physiological measures other than EEG included heart rate, respiration rate, heart rate variability, blood pressure and salivary cortisol. These measures were collected at several time points throughout the task. Feedback-related negativity evoked-potential responses were elicited and they significantly differed depending on whether positive or negative feedback was received. The PAST also increased systolic blood pressure, heart rate variability and respiration rates compared to a control condition attentional task. These preliminary results suggest that the PAST is an effective cognitive stressor. Successful measurement of the feedback-related negativity suggests that the PAST is conducive to EEG and time-sensitive ERP experiments. Moreover, the physiological findings support the PAST as a potent method for inducing stress in older adult participants. Further research is needed to confirm these results, but the PAST shows promise as a tool for cognitive stress induction for time-locked event-related potential experiments.

The goal of this review was to give a comprehensive overview of the most frequently studied EEG spectral and event-related potential (ERP) measures in social anxiety during rest, anticipation, stimulus processing, and recovery. A Web of Science search yielded 35 studies reporting on electrocortical measures in individuals with social anxiety or related constructs. Social anxiety was related to increased delta-beta cross-frequency correlation during anticipation and recovery, and information processing biases during early processing of faces (P1) and errors (error-related negativity). These electrocortical measures are discussed in relation to the persistent cycle of information processing biases maintaining SAD. Future research should further investigate the mechanisms of this persistent cycle and study the utility of electrocortical measures in early detection, prevention, treatment and endophenotype research.

In spite of more than 40 years of research, fundamental questions regarding the nature of its neural generators remain unresolved. While most studies conclude that the P3 is a true classical endogenous potential, and that its surface potential distribution remains constant across sensory modalities, these results are largely based on low-density EEG recordings, without the use of high-resolution methods such as the spherical spline Laplacian (SSL). Seventeen healthy participants performed a three-stimulus oddball task in visual and auditory modality while their EEG was recorded using a 128-channel system. Comparison of amplitude-normalized SSL estimated P3 brain-surface potentials, and analysis of spatial and temporal correlations revealed significant differences between visual and auditory evoked P3 topographies from target and distractor stimuli (but not target minus frequent or distractor minus frequent comparisons). Based on these results, we postulate the likely existence of at least some sensory modality-specific neuronal generators of the P3.

However, the electroencephalographic (EEG) dynamics underlying these ERPs remain largely unexplored in ADHD. Methods: We investigate the event-related spectral perturbation and inter-trial coherence linked to the ERP triggered by visual Cue-Go/NoGo stimuli, in 14 children (7 ADHD and 7 TDC) aged 8 to 12 years. Results: Compared to TDC, the EEG dynamics of children with ADHD showed a lower theta-alpha ITC concomitant to lower occipito-parietal P1-N2 and frontal N1-P2 potentials in response to Cue, Go and Nogo stimuli; an upper alpha power preceding lower central Go-P3; a lower theta-alpha power and ITC were coupled to a lower frontal Nogo-N3; a lower low-gamma power overall scalp at 300 ms after Go and Nogo stimuli. Conclusion: These findings suggest impaired ability in children with ADHD to conserve the brain oscillations phase associated with stimulus processing. This physiological trait might serve as a target for therapeutic intervention or be used as monitoring of their effects.

Because of the provided time resolution, Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals and derived versions have recently gained increased attention for studying event-related potentials (ERPs). Moreover, relate to the ADHD diagnosis , techniques of EEG/ERP source imaging (ESI) are effective to locate brain areas related to attention task and analyze spatiotemporal patterns of the P300 wave. Therefore, with the aim to accurately determine the spatial location and temporal patterns involved in attention task, there is a need for implementing an adequate ERP marker able to incorporate the spatial and temporal prior information to the ESI solution. In this paper, the influence of the source reconstruction is evaluated on visual and auditory evoked potentials through an ESI solution, namely, Dynamic Sparse Coding that is based on physiological motivated spatio-temporal constraints over the source representation. As a result, the DSC-based approach improves the characterization of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the attentional evoked potentials processes, including reduced amplitudes in the P300 components of the ERPs in the ADHD group.

However, since EEG signals are prone to artifacts, denoising is a crucial step that enables adequate subsequent data processing and interpretation. The aim of this study is to compare manual denoising to unsupervised online denoising, which is essential to real-time applications. Methods. - Denoising EEG for real-time applications requires the implementation of unsupervised and online methods. In order to permit genericity, these methods should not rely on electrooculography (EOG) traces nor on temporal/spatial templates of the artifacts. Two blind source separation (BSS) methods are analyzed in this paper with the aim of automatically correcting online eye-blink artifacts: the algorithm for multiple unknown signals extraction (AMUSE) and the approximate joint diagonalization of Fourier cospectra (AJDC). The chosen gold standard is a manual review of the EEG database carried out retrospectively by a human operator. Comparison is carried out using the spectral properties of the continuous EEG and event-related potentials (ERP). Results and conclusion. - The AJDC algorithm addresses limitations observed in AMUSE and out-performs it. No statistical difference is found between the manual and automatic approaches on a database composed of 15 healthy individuals, paving the way for an automated, operator-independent, and real-time eye-blink correction technique.

It is often assumed that the specific choice of EEG system has limited impact on the data and does not add variance to the results. However, many low cost and mobile EEG systems are now available, and there is some doubt as to the how EEG data vary across these newer systems. We sought to determine how variance across systems compares to variance across subjects or repeated sessions. We tested four EEG systems: two standard research-grade systems, one system designed for mobile use with dry electrodes, and an affordable mobile system with a lower channel count. We recorded four subjects three times with each of the four EEG systems. This setup allowed us to assess the influence of all three factors on the variance of data. Subjects performed a battery of six short standard EEG paradigms based on event-related potentials (ERPs) and steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP). Results demonstrated that subjects account for 32% of the variance, systems for 9% of the variance, and repeated sessions for each subject-system combination for 1% of the variance. In most lab-based EEG research, the number of subjects per study typically ranges from 10 to 20, and error of uncertainty in estimates of the mean (like ERP) will improve by the square root of the number of subjects. As a result, the variance due to EEG system (9%) is of the same order of magnitude as variance due to subjects (32%/sqrt(16) = 8%) with a pool of 16 subjects. The two standard research-grade EEG systems had no significantly different means from each other across all paradigms. However, the two other EEG systems demonstrated different mean values from one or both of the two standard research-grade EEG systems in at least half of the paradigms. In addition to providing specific estimates of the variability across EEG systems, subjects, and repeated sessions, we also propose a benchmark to evaluate new mobile EEG systems by means of ERP responses.

J	Lin, HY; Schulz, C; Straube, T				Lin, Huiyan; Schulz, Claudia; Straube, Thomas			Contextual effects of surprised expressions on the encoding and recognition of emotional target faces: An event- related potential (ERP) study	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Surprised context; Angry faces; Happy faces; Event-related potentials (ERPs); Encoding; Recognition	AMBIGUOUS FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; PERCEPTUAL LOAD; HAPPY FACES; ATTENTION; MEMORY; FEARFUL; ANXIETY; CONGRUENCY; VALIDATION	Several studies reported that the encoding and recognition of emotional target faces are modulated by negative contextual expressions. However, it is unknown whether other contextual expressions, such as emotionally ambiguous expressions, affect the encoding and recognition of target faces. To this end, electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded during the presentation of angry or happy target faces after a random sequence of surprised or neutral contextual faces that did not differ in normative valence ratings. Subsequently, participants were asked to perform an unexpected old/ new recognition task in which target faces were shown in either the encoded or a non-encoded expression. During the encoding phase, event-related potential (ERP) results showed that surprised as compared to neutral contextual faces led to smaller late positive potentials (LPP) for happy but not for angry target faces. Similar effects were also observed in the N170, even though the interaction of context and target expression failed to reach statistical significance. In the later recognition phase, recognition rates were lower for encoded happy faces when they had been encountered in surprised as compared to neutral context, regardless of whether the target face showed the encoded or a non-encoded expression. However, this context effect was not observed for angry-encoded faces. Taken together, the present study indicates that ambiguous contextual expressions, e. g., surprised faces, affect structural and cognitive encoding and later recognition of happy target faces to a larger extent than neutral contextual faces; whereas angry faces are more resistant to context effects.

One suggested mechanism behind such influence is that group membership triggers divergent visual facial representations for in-group and out-group members, which could constrain face processing. Here, using electroencephalography (EEG) under functional magnetic resonance imagery (fMRI) during a group categorization task, we investigated the impact of mere affiliation to an arbitrary group on the processing of emotional faces. The results indicate that in-and out-group members trigger differential event-related potential activity, appearing 150 ms after presentation of group membership information, which correlated with medial prefrontal fMRI activity. Additionally, EEG activity in the earliest stages of face processing (30-100 ms after expression onset) dissociated unexpected group-related emotions (in-group anger and out-group joy) from expected ones and correlated with temporo-parietal junction fMRI activity. We discuss the possibility that such dissociation may result from top-down influences from divergent representations for in-group and outgroup members. Taken together, the present results suggest that mere membership in an arbitrary group polarized expectations which constrain the first steps of face processing.

However, it is still not understood how the positive and negative deflections (e.g. P1, N1 etc) observed in ERP recordings are related to the underlying excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic activity. We investigated the neurogenesis of P1 and N1 in ERPs by pharmacologically manipulating inhibitory post-synaptic activity in the somatosensory cortex of rodent, and concurrently recording EEG and local field potentials (LFPs). We found that the P1 wave in the ERP and LFP of the supragranular layers is determined solely by the excitatory post-synaptic activity of the local pyramidal neural population, as is the initial segment of the N1 wave across cortical depth. The later part of the N1 wave was modulated by inhibitory post-synaptic activity, with its peak and the pulse width increasing as inhibition was reduced. These findings suggest that the temporal delay of inhibition with respect to excitation observed in intracellular recordings is also reflected in extracellular field potentials (FPs), resulting in a temporal window during which only excitatory post -synaptic activity and leak channel activity are recorded in the ERP and evoked LFP time series. Based on these findings, we provide clarification on the interpretation of P1 and N1 in terms of the excitatory and inhibitory post -synaptic activities of the local pyramidal neural population(s). 2016 The Authors.

Transitioning EEG experiments away from the laboratory using a Raspberry Pi 2	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Hardware; Software; Raspberry Pi; Portable; Ecological	TOOLBOX; SYSTEM	Background: Electroencephalography (EEG) experiments are typically performed in controlled laboratory settings to minimise noise and produce reliable measurements. These controlled conditions also reduce the applicability of the obtained results to more varied environments and may limit their relevance to everyday situations. New method: Advances in computer portability may increase the mobility and applicability of EEG results while decreasing costs. In this experiment we show that stimulus presentation using a Raspberry Pi 2 computer provides a low cost, reliable alternative to a traditional desktop PC in the administration of EEG experimental tasks. Results: Significant and reliable MMN and P3 activity, typical event-related potentials (ERPs) associated with an auditory oddball paradigm, were measured while experiments were administered using the Raspberry Pi 2. While latency differences in ERP triggering were observed between systems, these differences reduced power only marginally, likely due to the reduced processing power of the Raspberry Pi 2. Comparison with existing method: An auditory oddball task administered using the Raspberry Pi 2 produced similar ERPs to those derived from a desktop PC in a laboratory setting. Despite temporal differences and slight increases in trials needed for similar statistical power, the Raspberry Pi 2 can be used to design and present auditory experiments comparable to a PC. Results: Our results show that the Raspberry Pi 2 is a low cost alternative to the desktop PC when administering EEG experiments and, due to its small size and low power consumption, will enable mobile EEG experiments unconstrained by a traditional laboratory setting.

Action Monitoring Cortical Activity Coupled to Submovements	ENEURO			English	Article						EEG; error; kinematics; monitoring; submovements; supplementary motor area	MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; MANUAL TRACKING; NEURAL SYSTEM; MOVEMENT; THETA; FEEDBACK; MECHANISMS; DYNAMICS; INTERMITTENCY; ATTENTION	Numerous studies have examined neural correlates of the human brain's action-monitoring system during experimentally segmented tasks. However, it remains unknown how such a system operates during continuous motor output when no experimental time marker is available (such as button presses or stimulus onset). We set out to investigate the electrophysiological correlates of action monitoring when hand position has to be repeatedly monitored and corrected. For this, we recorded high-density electroencephalography (EEG) during a visuomotor tracking task during which participants had to follow a target with the mouse cursor along a visible trajectory. By decomposing hand kinematics into naturally occurring periodic submovements, we found an event-related potential (ERP) time-locked to these submovements and localized in a sensorimotor cortical network comprising the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the precentral gyrus. Critically, the amplitude of the ERP correlated with the deviation of the cursor, 110 ms before the submovement. Control analyses showed that this correlation was truly due to the cursor deviation and not to differences in submovement kinematics or to the visual content of the task. The ERP closely resembled those found in response to mismatch events in typical cognitive neuroscience experiments. Our results demonstrate the existence of a cortical process in the SMA, evaluating hand position in synchrony with submovements. These findings suggest a functional role of submovements in a sensorimotor loop of periodic monitoring and correction and generalize previous results from the field of action monitoring to cases where action has to be repeatedly monitored.

Due to the high trail-to-trial variability and low signal-to-noise ratio caused by volume conduction, analyzing brain states corresponding to ERP on a single trial is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient method for ERP feature extraction, termed spatial filtering and temporal down-sampling (SFTDS). The spatial filters and the temporal down-sampling weight vectors can be optimized under a single objective function by SFTDS. Experiments on real P300 data from 10 subjects show the superiority of SFTDS over other algorithms.

This study sought to understand how attentional gating affects cortical processing of visual and tactile stimuli at early stages of modality specific representation. Specifically, alterations in early somatosensory and visual processing based on attentional relevance were examined, along with the effect of an unattended sensory stimulus on cortical processing and behavioural performance. Electroencephalography (EEG) was collected from healthy participants as they performed a sensory selection task. This task required participants to make a scaled motor response to the amplitudes of visual and tactile stimuli presented individually or concurrently. Results showed that the somatosensory N70 ERP was significantly attenuated when tactile stimuli were unattended. When visual stimuli were unattended, modulation of visual potentials occurred later, at the visual P2 potential. Since unattended tactile stimuli were gated at early cortical processing stages, when they were used as distractors, no changes in cortical responses to target stimuli were observed. Additionally, there was no decrease in task accuracy when grading attended stimuli in the presence of a tactile distractor. However, since early gating was not observed in the visual modality, a visual stimulus used as an unattended distractor resulted in smaller-amplitude cortical responses to attended tactile stimuli and less accurate task performance when grading attended stimuli. In conclusion, this study suggests that early gating of unattended stimuli supports modality-specific cortical processing of target stimuli and maintains behavioural task performance.

It can diminish efficiency and increase errors. However, the related physiological features are still not clear and under exploration. The present study investigated changes of inter-hemispheric synchronization in event-related potentials (ERPs) due to mental fatigue during sustained memory processing. Twentysix participants performed a continuous two-back memory task for around 2.5 h. Prefrontal and frontal synchronies in the alpha frequency band (8-13 Hz) were analyzed because of their close relationships with memory functions. Coherence was used to examine bilateral synchronization changes of ERP power and phase. We compared ERP coherences in both non-fatigued and fatigued states. We also observed the variation of ERP coherences during the continuous task. High overlaps of inter-hemispheric ERP waveforms were observed at prefrontal and frontal cortex in both non-fatigued and fatigued conditions. During the whole experimental procedure, ERP alpha coherences at frontal regions (FP1-FP2 and F3-F4) were significantly higher than at central (C3-C4), parietal (P3-P4) and occipital (01-02) regions. Alpha synchronization in anterior electrode pairs showed significant declines with increasing mental fatigue during the memory task. Our findings about changes in frontal ERP alpha synchronization might be used as biomarkers to assess mental fatigue induced by prolonged memory demands. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is unclear whether pitch detection deficits impact amusic individuals perception of musical emotion. In the current work, 19 amusics and 21 healthy controls were subjected to electroencephalography (EEG) while being exposed to music excerpts and emotional faces. We assessed each individual's ability to discriminate positive- and negative-valenced emotional faces and analyzed electrophysiological indices, in the form of event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded at 32 sites, following exposure to emotionally positive or negative music excerpts. We observed smaller N2 amplitudes in response to facial expressions in the amusia group than in the control group, suggesting that amusics were less affected by the musical stimuli. The late-positive component (LPC) in amusics was similar to that in controls. Our results suggest that the neurocognitive deficit characteristic of congenital amusia is fundamentally an impairment in musical information processing rather than an impairment in emotional processing.

Examining the effects of emotion regulation on the ERP response to highly negative social stigmas	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Emotion regulation; social stigma; ERP	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ELECTROCORTICAL RESPONSE; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; COGNITIVE CONTROL; NEURAL SIGNALS; TIME-COURSE; RACE BIAS; ATTENTION; PICTURES; GENDER	In order to determine if highly negative stigma is a more salient cue than other negative emotional, non-stigmatized cues, participants underwent electroencephalography while passively viewing or actively regulating their emotional response to images of highly negative stigmatized (e.g., homeless individuals, substance abusers) or highly negative non-stigmatized (e.g., a man holding a gun, an injured person) individuals. Event-related potential (ERP) analyses focused on the N2 (associated with detecting novelty), the early positive potential (associated with processing emotion), and a sustained late positive potential (associated with modulating regulatory goals). A salience effect for highly negative stigma was revealed in the early positive potential, with higher magnitude ERP responses to images of highly negative stigmatized as compared to highly negative non-stigmatized individuals 355ms poststimulus onset. Moreover, the amplitude of this effect was predicted by individual differences in implicit bias. Our results also demonstrated that the late positivity response was not modulated by regulatory goals (passively view versus to reappraise) for images of highly negative stigmatized individuals, but was for images of highly negative, non-stigmatized individuals (replicating previous findings). Our findings suggest that the neural response to highly negative stigma is salient and rigid.

Previous studies aimed at evaluating the underlying neuronal substrates of these computational processes have used a mnemonic discrimination paradigm and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An alternative method is electroencephalography and eventrelated potentials (ERPs), which have a superior time resolution to fMRI. Here, we use ERP analysis to examine neuronal activity during performance of a mnemonic discrimination task. We examined both the late positive component and FN400 components, which have previously been shown to demonstrate an old-new effect. We hypothesized that pattern separation processes would be reflected in correct rejection of similar lures while pattern completion processes would be reflected in falsely categorizing lures as repeated. We did not observe differences between the ERPs associated with these two processes.	[Anderson, Malia L.; Kirwan, C.

Comparing active dry EEG electrodes to active and passive wet electrodes	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Impedance; P3; Dry electrodes; Active electrodes; Event-related potential	GUIDELINES; IMPEDANCE; RISK	Dry electrodes are becoming popular for both lab-based and consumer-level electrophysiological-recording technologies because they better afford the ability to move traditional lab-based research into the real world. It is unclear, however, how dry electrodes compare in data quality to traditional electrodes. The current study compared three EEG electrode types: (a) passive-wet electrodes with no onboard amplification, (b) actively amplified, wet electrodes with moderate impedance levels, and low impedance levels, and (c) active-dry electrodes with very high impedance. Participants completed a classic P3 auditory oddball task to elicit characteristic EEG signatures and event-related potentials (ERPs). Across the three electrode types, we compared single-trial noise, average ERPs, scalp topographies, ERP noise, and ERP statistical power as a function of number of trials. We extended past work showing active electrodes' insensitivity to moderate levels of interelectrode impedance when compared to passive electrodes in the same amplifier. Importantly, the new dry electrode system could reliably measure EEG spectra and ERP components comparable to traditional electrode types. As expected, however, dry active electrodes with very high interelectrode impedance exhibited marked increases in single-trial and average noise levels, which decreased statistical power, requiring more trials to detect significant effects. This power decrease must be considered as a trade-off with the ease of application and long-term use. The current results help set constraints on experimental design with novel dry electrodes, and provide important evidence needed to measure brain activity in novel settings and situations.

Acute dosing of vortioxetine strengthens event-related brain activity associated with engagement of attention and cognitive functioning in rats	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Vortioxetine; Rat; Electrophysiology; P300 event-related potential; Neuronal oscillation; Phase-locking factor	MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; MULTIMODAL ANTIDEPRESSANT VORTIOXETINE; AUDITORY CHANGE-DETECTION; GAMMA-BAND RESPONSES; LU AA21004; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; 5-HT DEPLETION; PHASE-LOCKING; DOUBLE-BLIND	Studies of the antidepressant vortioxetine have demonstrated beneficial effects on cognitive dysfunction associated with depression. To elucidate how vortioxetine modulates neuronal activity during cognitive processing we investigated the effects of vortioxetine (3 and 10 mg/kg) in rats performing an auditory oddball (deviant target) task. We investigated neuronal activity in target vs non-target tone responses in vehicle-treated animals using electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. Furthermore, we characterized task performance and EEG changes in target tone responses of vortioxetine vs controls. Quantification of event-related potentials (ERPs) was supplemented by analyses of spectral power and inter-trial phase-locking. The assessed brain regions included prelimbic cortex, the hippocampus, and thalamus. As compared to correct rejection of non-target tones, correct target tone responses elicited increased EEG power in all regions. Additionally, neuronal synchronization was increased in vehicle treated rats during both early and late ERP responses to target tones. This indicates a significant consistency of local phases across trials during high attentional load. During early sensory processing, vortioxetine increased both thalamic and frontal synchronized gamma band activity and EEG power in all brain regions measured. Finally, vortioxetine increased the amplitude of late hippocampal P3-like ERPs, the rodent correlate of the human P300 ERP. These findings suggest differential effects of vortioxetine during early sensory registration and late endogenous processing of auditory discrimination. Strengthened P3 like ERP response may relate to the pro-cognitive profile of vortioxetine in rodents. Further investigations are warranted to explore the mechanism by which vortioxetine increases network synchronization during attentive and cognitive processing. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Traditionally, EEG signals are recorded by positioning electrodes on the scalp and keeping them in place with glue, rubber bands, or elastic caps. This setup provides good coverage of the head, but is impractical for EEG acquisition in natural daily-life situations. Here, we propose the transparent EEG concept. Transparent EEG aims for motion tolerant, highly portable, unobtrusive, and near invisible data acquisition with minimum disturbance of a user's daily activities. In recent years several ear-centered EEG solutions that are compatible with the transparent EEG concept have been presented. We discuss work showing that miniature electrodes placed in and around the human ear are a feasible solution, as they are sensitive enough to pick up electrical signals stemming from various brain and non-brain sources. We also describe the cEEGrid flex-printed sensor array, which enables unobtrusive multi-channel EEG acquisition from around the ear. In a number of validation studies we found that the cEEGrid enables the recording of meaningful continuous EEG, event-related potentials and neural oscillations. Here, we explain the rationale underlying the cEEGrid ear-EEG solution, present possible use cases and identify open issues that need to be solved on the way toward transparent EEG.

The method incorporates spatial correlation between EEG channels to form a cooperative coupled particle filtering method that tracks the P300 subcomponents, P3a and P3b, over trials. Using state space systems, the amplitude, latency, and width of each subcomponent are modeled as the main underlying parameters. With four electrodes, two coupled Rao-Blackwellised particle filter pairs are used to recursively estimate the system state over trials. A number of physiological constraints are also imposed to avoid generating invalid particles in the estimation process. Motivated by the bilateral symmetry of ERPs over the brain, the channels further share their estimates with their neighbors and combine the received information to obtain a more accurate and robust solution. The proposed algorithm is capable of estimating the P300 subcomponents in single trials and outperforms its non-cooperative counterpart.

EEG evoked potentials in oddball task and fluid intelligence score are correlated because both reflect the cognitive processing and attention. A system for prediction of an individual's fluid intelligence level using single trial Electroencephalography (EEG) signals has been proposed. For this purpose, we employed 2D and 3D contents and 34 subjects each for 2D and 3D, which were divided into low-ability (LA) and high-ability (HA) groups using Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAPM) test. Using visual oddball cognitive task, neural activity of each group was measured and analyzed over three midline electrodes (Fz, Cz, and Pz). To predict whether an individual belongs to LA or HA group, features were extracted using wavelet decomposition of EEG signals recorded in visual oddball task and support vector machine (SVM) was used as a classifier. Two different types of Haar wavelet transform based features have been extracted from the band (0.3 to 30 Hz) of EEG signals. Statistical wavelet features and wavelet coefficient features from the frequency bands 0.0-1.875 Hz (delta low) and 1.875-3.75 Hz (delta high), resulted in the 100 and 98% prediction accuracies, respectively, both for 2D and 3D contents. The analysis of these frequency bands showed clear difference between LA and HA groups. Further, discriminative values of the features have been validated using statistical significance tests and inter-class and intra-class variation analysis. Also, statistical test showed that there was no effect of 2D and 3D content on the assessment of fluid intelligence level. Comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques showed the superiority of the proposed system.

Sentence Context Prevails Over Word Association in Aphasia Patients with Spared Comprehension: Evidence from N400 Event-Related Potential	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						aphasia; event-related potentials; lexical association; N400; comprehension deficit; P600	BRAIN POTENTIALS; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; LEFT-HEMISPHERE; BROCAS-APHASIA; LEVEL CONTEXT; STROKE; INTEGRATION; FREQUENCY; REFLECT; ERP	Behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) studies on aphasia patients showed that lexical information is not lost but rather its integration into the working context is hampered. Studies have been conducted on the processing of sentence-level information (meaningful versus meaningless) and of word-level information (related versus unrelated) in aphasia patients, but we are not aware of any study that assesses the relationship between the two. In healthy subjects the processing of a single word in a sentence context has been studied using the N400 ERP. It was shown that, even when there is only a weak expectation of a final word in a sentence, this expectation will dominate word relatedness. In order to study the effect of semantic relatedness between words in sentence processing in aphasia patients, we conducted a crossed design ERP study, crossing the factors of word relatedness and sentence congruity. We tested aphasia patients with mild to minimum comprehension deficit and healthy young and older (age-matched with our patients) controls on a semantic anomaly judgment task when simultaneously recording EEG. Our results show that our aphasia patient's N400 amplitudes in response to the sentences of our crossed-design study were similar to those of our age-matched healthy subjects. However, we detected an increase in the N400 ERP latency in those patients, indicating a delay in the integration of the new word into the working context. Additionally, we observed a positive correlation between comprehension level of those patients and N400 effect in response to meaningful sentences without word relatedness contrasted to meaningless sentences without word relatedness.

Cumulative evidence has revealed that individuals with schizotypy, as well as schizophrenia patients, have emotional processing deficits. In the present study, we investigated multimodal emotion perception in schizotypy and implemented the machine learning technique to find out whether a schizotypy group (ST) is distinguishable from a control group (NC), using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Forty-five subjects (30 ST and 15 NC) were divided into two groups based on their scores on a Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire. All participants performed an audiovisual emotion perception test while EEG was recorded. After the preprocessing stage, the discriminatory features were extracted using a mean subsampling technique. For an accurate estimation of covariance matrices, the shrinkage linear discriminant algorithm was used. The classification attained over 98% accuracy and zero rate of false-positive results. This method may have important clinical implications in discriminating those among the general population who have a subtle risk for schizotypy, requiring intervention in advance.

We identified 55 articles using PubMed. After application of the rejection criteria, in a two-step procedure, based on abstract and full-text reading, we selected 16 studies for review. We identified group differences and emotion by group interactions in most of the studies during facial emotion-processing tasks. Nine articles reported main effects of facial expression type. Smaller amplitudes and delayed latencies were consistently reported to emotional expressions in ASD subjects compared to controls. Right hemisphere dominance was found in both groups. Our systematic review confirms facial emotion-processing deficits in ASD, which are often linked with emotion recognition deficits.

Research topics range from acoustic feature processing and listening to melodies to composition and music performance. Before designing an experiment, researchers might find it helpful to be informed about the efficiency of methods and their pros and cons. The chapter at hand gives an overview of several methods used in the neurosciences with a special emphasis on their principles, constraints and fields of application. The focus is on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), electroencephalography (EEG) and on event-related potentials (ERP). The reader will also become acquainted with trends and recent developments towards whole-brain analyses and real life studies based on the idea to improve ecological validity.

Lately, the combination of multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and Gaussian process classification (GPC) has gained interest in the neuroscientific community. Here, we demonstrate how a MVPA-GPC approach can be applied to electrophysiological data. Furthermore, in order to account for the temporal information of ERPs, we develop a novel method that integrates interregional synchrony of ERP time signatures. By using real-life ERP recordings of a prospective AD cohort study (PRODEM), we empirically investigate the usefulness of the proposed framework to build neurophysiological markers for single subject classification tasks. GPC outperforms the probabilistic reference method in both tasks, with the highest AUC overall (0.802) being achieved using the new spatiotemporal method in the prediction of rapid cognitive decline.

Several neuroimaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography and near-infrared spectroscopy have been used to explore healthy and pathological aging by relying on hemodynamic or metabolic changes that occur in response to brain activity. Since electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are able to measure neural activity directly with a high temporal resolution of milliseconds, these neurophysiological techniques are particularly important to investigate the dynamics of brain activity underlying neurocognitive aging. It is well known that age is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and that synaptic dysfunction represents an early sign of this disease associated with hallmark neuropathological findings. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying AD are not fully elucidated. This review addresses healthy and pathological brain aging from a neurophysiological perspective, focusing on oscillatory activity changes during the resting state, event-related potentials and stimulus-induced oscillatory responses during cognitive or motor tasks, functional connectivity between brain regions, and changes in signal complexity. We also highlight the accumulating evidence on age-related EEG/MEG changes and biological markers of brain neurodegeneration, including genetic factors, structural abnormalities on magnetic resonance images, and the biochemical changes associated with A beta deposition and tau pathology.

Numerous neuropsychological studies have investigated the neural basis of the sense of control during action performance; however, most previous studies have focused on responses to a single discrete action outcome rather than real-time processing of action-outcome sequences. In the present study, we aimed to identify whether certain patterns of brain activation are associated with the perceived control during continuous movement. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) signals while participants continuously moved a right-handed mouse in an attempt to control multiple visual stimuli. When participants perceived a sense of control over the stimuli, we observed a positive potential approximately 550 ms after the onset of movement, while no similar potential was observed when participants reported a lack of control. The appearance of this potential was consistent with the time window of awareness of control in a behavioral test using the same task, and likely reflected the explicit allocation of attention to control. Moreover, we found that the alpha-mu rhythm, which is linked to sensorimotor processing, was significantly suppressed after participants came to a conclusion regarding the level of control, regardless of whether control or lack of control was perceived. In summary, our results suggest that the late positive potential after the onset of the movement and the suppression of alpha-mu rhythm can be used as markers of the perception of control during continuous action performance and feedback monitoring.

Circadian course of the P300 ERP in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - implications for brain-computer interfaces (BCI)	BMC NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; ALS; P300; Auditory; Visual; Brain computer interface; BCI	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TIME; TRANSITION; COMPONENT; FOOD	Background: Accidents or neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) can lead to progressing, extensive, and complete paralysis leaving patients aware but unable to communicate (locked-in state). Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) based on electroencephalography represent an important approach to establish communication with these patients. The most common BCI for communication rely on the P300, a positive deflection arising in response to rare events. To foster broader application of BCIs for restoring lost function, also for end-users with impaired vision, we explored whether there were specific time windows during the day in which a P300 driven BCI should be preferably applied. Methods: The present study investigated the influence of time of the day and modality (visual vs. auditory) on P300 amplitude and latency. A sample of 14 patients (end-users) with ALS and 14 healthy age matched volunteers participated in the study and P300 event-related potentials (ERP) were recorded at four different times (10, 12 am, 2, & 4 pm) during the day. Results: Results indicated no differences in P300 amplitudes or latencies between groups (ALS patients v. healthy participants) or time of measurement. In the auditory condition, latencies were shorter and amplitudes smaller as compared to the visual condition. Conclusion: Our findings suggest applicability of EEG/BCI sessions in patients with ALS throughout normal waking hours. Future studies using actual BCI systems are needed to generalize these findings with regard to BCI effectiveness/efficiency and other times of day.	[Erlbeck, Helena; Kuebler, Andrea; Real, Ruben G.

An exploratory high-density EEG investigation of the misinformation effect: Attentional and recollective differences between true and false perceptual memories	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article						Late positive component; P3b; Misinformation effect; False memory; Source monitoring; EEG	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; CONSCIOUS RECOLLECTION; ILLUSORY RECOGNITION; SEMANTIC INTEGRATION; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; NEURAL ACTIVITY; ERP; RETRIEVAL; FMRI	The misinformation effect, a phenomenon in which eyewitness memories are altered via exposure to post-event misinformation, is one of the most important paradigms used to investigate the reconstructive nature of human memory. The aim of this study was to use the misinformation effect paradigm to investigate differences in attentional and recollective processing between true and false event memories. Nineteen participants completed a variant of the misinformation paradigm in which recognition responses to true and misinformation based event details embedded within a narrative context, were investigated using high-density(256-channel) EEG with a 1-day delay between event exposure and test. Source monitoring responses were used to isolate event -related -potentials (ERPs) associated with perceptual (i.e. event) source attributions. Temporal-spatial analyses of these ERPs showed evidence of an elevated P3b and Late -Positive Component, associated with stronger context-matching responses and recollective activity respectively, in true perceptual memories relative to false misinformation based ones. These findings represent the first retrieval focused EEG investigation of the misinformation effect and highlight the interplay between attention and retrieval processes in episodic memory recognition.

Income, neural executive processes, and preschool children's executive control	DEVELOPMENT AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EFFORTFUL CONTROL; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; INHIBITORY CONTROL; CHILDHOOD POVERTY; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; SELF-REGULATION; YOUNG-CHILDREN; BRAIN NETWORKS	This study aimed to specify the neural mechanisms underlying the link between low household income and diminished executive control in the preschool period. Specifically, we examined whether individual differences in the neural processes associated with executive attention and inhibitory control accounted for income differences observed in performance on a neuropsychological battery of executive control tasks. The study utilized a sample of preschool-aged children (N = 118) whose families represented the full range of income, with 32% of families at/near poverty, 32% lower income, and 36% middle to upper income. Children completed a neuropsychological battery of executive control tasks and then completed two computerized executive control tasks while EEG data were collected. We predicted that differences in the event-related potential (ERP) correlates of executive attention and inhibitory control would account for income differences observed on the executive control battery. Income and ERP measures were related to performance on the executive control battery. However, incomewas unrelated to ERP measures. The findings suggest that income differences observed in executive control during the preschool period might relate to processes other than executive attention and inhibitory control.

N400 and Emotional Word Processing in Parkinson's Disease	NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; emotion processing; electroencephalography; event related potentials; affective priming	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MOVEMENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; AUTOMATIC ACTIVATION; LEXICAL DECISION; RATING-SCALE; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; SEMANTIC ACTIVATION; BRAIN POTENTIALS	Objective: Emotional and cognitive disturbances are common complications in Parkinson's disease (PD). N400 is an event related potential (ERP) strongly linked to lexical-semantic processing and has demonstrated alterations in amplitude and latency when PD patients performed semantic priming tasks. The present study investigated the role of N400 in an automatic affective priming paradigm in PD. Other ERP components relevant to emotion processing were also examined. Method: Twenty-two PD patients and 17 healthy adults performed an automatic affective priming task while ERPs were recorded using 128 channels. Prime-target word pairs of negative or neutral valence were presented at a stimulus onset asynchrony of 250 ms. Participants were asked to evaluate the valence of the target word by button press. Results: A larger N400 amplitude for incongruent compared with congruent neutral targets was observed at right central and parietal regions and did not differ between PD and controls. PD and controls also displayed larger P300 and late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes for negative compared with neutral targets at central parietal and right frontal regions. In contrast, whereas controls showed a larger slow negative wave (SNW) for negative targets compared with neutral targets at left frontal and left central regions, PD group demonstrated a significant reduction in SNW amplitude difference at the left central region. Conclusion: N400 is intact in PD when processing evaluative judgments of emotional words. P300 and LPP were also intact in PD. The altered left central SNW in PD suggests an ERP marker for emotional dysfunction in PD.	[Dissanayaka, Nadeeka N.

A preliminary trial is described, in which EEG, DCS, and exerted force were simultaneously recorded during a cue-triggered hand grip task. Eight channels of EEG were acquired from frontal, central, and occipital regions, and DCS signals were collected from locations over frontal and motor cortex. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) was observed at the onset of hand movement and lasted until movement ceased. EEG from the motor area showed a significant ERD in the 8-13 Hz mu band (p<0.001). Mean CBF increased during the task by 6.8 %(p<0.001) in the motor location and by 4.5 % (p<0.001) in the frontal location, respectively. These preliminary observations suggest that a combination of electrical and optical measurements may provide a more complete characterization of brain dynamics related to movement. A broader study is required to explore the potential benefit of these combined measurements when used as command signals for brain-computer interfaces.

Here we test how the brain processes insults, and whether and how the neurocognitive processing of insults is changed by the presence of a laughing crowd. Event-related potentials showed that insults, compared to compliments, evoked an increase in N400 amplitude (indicating increased lexical-semantic processing) and LPP amplitude (indicating emotional processing) when presented in isolation. When insults were perceived in the presence of a laughing crowd, the difference in N400 amplitude disappeared, while the difference in LPP activation increased. These results show that even without laughter, verbal insults receive additional neural processing over compliments, both at the lexical-semantic and emotional level. The presence of a laughing crowd has a direct effect on the neurocognitive processing of insults, leading to stronger and more elongated emotional processing.

Adapted wavelet transform improves time-frequency representations: a study of auditory elicited P300-like event-related potentials in rats	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						electroencephalography; P300 event-related potentials; phase-locking factor; spectral power; wavelet; rat	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; THETA OSCILLATION; P300; SCHIZOPHRENIA; BRAIN; RESPONSES; DISORDER; MECHANISM; CAPACITY; NOVELTY	Objective. Active auditory oddball paradigms are simple tone discrimination tasks used to study the P300 deflection of event-related potentials (ERPs). These ERPs may be quantified by time-frequency analysis. As auditory stimuli cause early high frequency and late low frequency ERP oscillations, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is often chosen for decomposition due to its multi-resolution properties. However, as the conventional CWT traditionally applies only one mother wavelet to represent the entire spectrum, the time-frequency resolution is not optimal across all scales. To account for this, we developed and validated a novel method specifically refined to analyse P300-like ERPs in rats. Approach. An adapted CWT (aCWT) was implemented to preserve high time-frequency resolution across all scales by commissioning of multiple wavelets operating at different scales. First, decomposition of simulated ERPs was illustrated using the classical CWT and the aCWT. Next, the two methods were applied to EEG recordings obtained from prefrontal cortex in rats performing a two-tone auditory discrimination task. Main results. While only early ERP frequency changes between responses to target and non-target tones were detected by the CWT, both early and late changes were successfully described with strong accuracy by the aCWT in rat ERPs. Increased frontal gamma power and phase synchrony was observed particularly within theta and gamma frequency bands during deviant tones. Significance. The study suggests superior performance of the aCWT over the CWT in terms of detailed quantification of time-frequency properties of ERPs. Our methodological investigation indicates that accurate and complete assessment of time-frequency components of short-time neural signals is feasible with the novel analysis approach which may be advantageous for characterisation of several types of evoked potentials in particularly rodents.

While the neural processes of face perception have been widely studied, it was only recently that fMRI identified occipito-temporal areas sensitive to static images of hands as body parts. To complement these studies with fine-grained timing information, we measured event-related EEG potentials (ERPs) from 33 subjects who were presented with static images of hands versus faces, whole bodies, and inanimate objects as controls. Already at N1 latency, similar to 170 ms, hand-related ERP patterns were manifest in two results: (1) significant differences in amplitudes for images of hands versus bodies in occipito-temporal N1 responses; (2) left lateralization of responses to images of hands, and also of the difference waveforms (hands minus bodies), quantifying hand-related responses. In line with fMRI studies of hand sensitive areas distinct from extrastriate body area (EBA), the current findings provide electrophysiological evidence for hand-sensitive brain activation, occurring at a similarly early latency as N1 responses to faces.

It can be used either as a sensor, e.g., for emotion detection, or as an input device that allows to take actions based on the brain's response to the presented stimuli. For the latter, it is crucial to be able to reliably detect event-related potentials (ERPs), which can be a hard task because of the noise in the signal, especially when using affordable consumer-oriented devices, such as Emotiv Epoc. In the paper, we present a method of EEG signal processing and classification for detection of ERP P300 wave. We particularly focus on the adaptive channel selection and propose to use genetic algorithm combined with linear discriminant analysis to determine the optimal subset of electrodes for signal processing for each individual user. We evaluated our proposed method on a standard data set outperforming the existing approaches even with decreasing size of a training set. In addition, we conducted a user study with Emotiv Epoc device on a standard P300 Speller task in order to compare the results of our method and to find out, whether this device is suitable for P300 detection.

The present study proposed an even-trelated complexity analysis (ERC) method for detecting the time-locked changes in the diversity of neural activity. This information is important for investigating higher cognitive functions, such as language. ERC method was applied in this study to explore the neural correlates of semantic processing in the context of written German sentence comprehension. Experiment results show that ERC method can provide more information compared with ERP, and thus is valuable in the investigation of cognitive processes.

The research on laboratory animals provide insights to various practical applications involving human beings and other animals such as working animals, pets, and livestock. An experimental framework targeting the laboratory animals has the potential to lead to successful translational research when it closely resembles the environment of real applications. To serve scalp electroencephalography (EEG) research environments for the laboratory mice, the dry non-invasive scalp EEG sensor with sixteen electrodes is proposed to measure brainwaves over the entire brain area without any surgical procedures. We validated the proposed sensor system with visual evoked potential (VEP) experiments elicited by flash stimulations. The VEP responses obtained from experiments are compared with the existing literature, and analyzed in temporal and spatial perspectives. We further interpret the experimental results using time-frequency distribution (TFD) and distance measurements. The developed sensor guarantees stable operations for in vivo experiments in a non-invasive manner without surgical procedures, therefore exhibiting a high potential to strengthen longitudinal experimental studies and reliable translational research exploiting non-invasive paradigms.

EEG based BCIs for typing popularly utilize event related potentials (ERPs) for inference. Presentation paradigm in current ERP-based letter by letter typing BCIs typically query the user with an arbitrary subset of characters. However, the typing accuracy and speed can potentially be enhanced with more informed subset selection. In this manuscript, we introduce the active recursive Bayesian state estimation (active-RBSE) framework for inference and sequence optimization. Prior to each iteration of presentation, rather than showing a subset of randomly selected characters, this framework optimally selects a subset based on a query function. Selected queries are made adaptively specialized for users during each intent detection. Through a simulation-based study, we assess the effect of active-RBSE on the performance of a language-model assisted typing BCI in terms of typing speed and accuracy. To provide a baseline for comparison, we also utilize standard presentation paradigms namely, row and column matrix presentation paradigm and also random rapid serial visual presentation paradigms. The results show that utilization of active-RBSE can enhance the online performance of the system, both in terms of typing accuracy and speed. Moreover, we conduct online experiments with human participants to study the human-in-the-loop effect on the performance of the proposed framework and the results were consistent with the simulations.

The neuroscience of language experiment conducted sheds new light into the quantification processing complexity of sohoji-sohoji when different quantitative scenarios were previously presented. We use the ERPs extraction technique (Event-Related Brain Potential) to observe and to extract the wave's amplitude in order to conduct statistical analysis from the chronometric data monitored online by the electroencephalogram (EEG). The results from statistical analysis conducted (ANOVA and/test) suggest that the event-distributive interpretation is the first activated because the violation of event items exhaustiveness was more complex than violation of subject exhaustiveness. Plurality, cardinality and event differentiation also displayed significant effects during Karaja distributive sentence comprehension.

A pilot investigation of audiovisual processing and multisensory integration in patients with inherited retinal dystrophies	BMC OPHTHALMOLOGY			English	Article						Power spectral density analysis; Electroencephalography; Inherited retinal dystrophies; Event-related brain potentials	BARDET-BIEDL-SYNDROME; AUDITORY-CORTEX; LOOMING SIGNALS; SPEECH; MECHANISMS; FACES; GENE; EEG	Background: In this study, we examined audiovisual (AV) processing in normal and visually impaired individuals who exhibit partial loss of vision due to inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs). Methods: Two groups were analyzed for this pilot study: Group 1 was composed of IRD participants: two with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP), two with autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophy (CORD), and two with the related complex disorder, Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS); Group 2 was composed of 15 non-IRD participants (controls). Audiovisual looming and receding stimuli (conveying perceptual motion) were used to assess the cortical processing and integration of unimodal (A or V) and multimodal (AV) sensory cues. Electroencephalography (EEG) was used to simultaneously resolve the temporal and spatial characteristics of AV processing and assess differences in neural responses between groups. Measurement of AV integration was accomplished via quantification of the EEG's spectral power and event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Results: Results show that IRD individuals exhibit reduced AV integration for concurrent audio and visual (AV) stimuli but increased brain activity during the unimodal A (but not V) presentation. This was corroborated in behavioral responses, where IRD patients showed slower and less accurate judgments of AV and V stimuli but more accurate responses in the A-alone condition. Conclusions: Collectively, our findings imply a neural compensation from auditory sensory brain areas due to visual deprivation.

The PSEN1 E280A ( E280A) mutation has an autosomal dominant inheritance and is involved in the production of amyloid-beta. The largest family group of carriers with E280A mutation is found in Antioquia, Colombia. The study of mutation carriers provides a unique opportunity to identify brain changes in stages previous to AD. Electroencephalography ( EEG) is a low cost and minimally invasiveness technique that enables the following of brain changes in AD. Objective: To examine how previous reported differences in EEG for Theta and Alpha-2 rhythms in E280A subjects are related to specific regions in cortex and could be tracked across different ages. Methods: EEG signals were acquired during resting state from non-carriers and carriers, asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects from E280A kindred from Antioquia, Colombia. Independent component analysis (ICA) and inverse solution methods were used to locate brain regions related to differences in Theta and Alpha-2 bands. Results: ICA identified two components, mainly related to the Precuneus, where the differences in Theta and Alpha-2 exist simultaneously at asymptomatic and symptomatic stages. When the ratio between Theta and Alpha-2 is used, significant correlations exist with age and a composite cognitive scale. Conclusion: Theta and Alpha-2 rhythms are altered in E280A subjects. The alterations are possible to track at Precuneus regions using EEG, ICA, and inverse solution methods.

Two scenarios of an oddball experiment were performed among 9 students of University of Silesia at the age of 20-25 years, with the use of standard, deviant and distractor events. Difference deviant-standard waveforms were obtained, which presented posterior negativity in the range 140-200 ms after stimulus onset. Subtraction of the standard from deviant ERP waveforms, irrelevance to participant's task, and independence from stimulus physical parameters imply that the posterior negativity evoked in this study seems to be a visual mismatch negativity as a result of pre-attentive central visual processing.

The effect that produces those auditory stimuli is, however, not well understood yet. Furthermore, the conventional clinical protocol is based on a trial-error procedure, and there is not a formal and adequate treatment follow-up. At present, the only way to evaluate acoustic therapies is by means of subjective methods such as analog visual scale and ad-hoc questionnaires. Methods: This protocol seeks to establish an objective methodology to treat tinnitus with acoustic therapies based on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity evaluation. On the hypothesis that acoustic therapies should produce perceptual and cognitive changes at a cortical level, it is proposed to examine neural electrical activity of patients suffering from refractory and chronic tinnitus in four different stages: at the beginning of the experiment, at one week of treatment, at five weeks of treatment, and at eight weeks of treatment. Four of the most efficient acoustic therapies found at the moment are considered: retraining, auditory discrimination, enriched acoustic environment, and binaural. Discussion: EEG has become a standard brain imaging tool to quantify and qualify neural oscillations, which are basically spatial, temporal, and spectral patterns associated with particular perceptual, cognitive, motor and emotional processes. Neural oscillations have been traditionally studied on the basis of event-related experiments, where time-locked and phase-locked responses (i.e., event-related potentials) along with time-locked but not necessary phase-locked responses (i.e., event-related (de) synchronization) have been essentially estimated. Both potentials and levels of synchronization related to auditory stimuli are herein proposed to assess the effect of acoustic therapies.

Older adults display diminished error processing and response in a continuous tracking task	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG/ERP; error processing; feedback negativity; older adults; young adults	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; BRAIN DOPAMINE ACTIVITY; MEDIAL-FRONTAL CORTEX; AGE-RELATED DECLINE; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; NEURAL SYSTEM; ERP COMPONENTS; PERFORMANCE; DRIVERS; POTENTIALS	Advancing age is often accompanied by a decline in motor control that results in a decreased ability to successfully perform motor tasks. While there are multiple factors that contribute to age-related deficits in motor control, one unexplored possibility is that age-related deficits in our ability to evaluate motor output result in an increase in motor errors. In line with this, previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that motor errors evoked an error-related negativity (ERN)-a component of the human ERP associated with error evaluation originating within the human medial-frontal cortex. In the present study, we examined whether or not deficits in the medialfrontal error evaluation system contribute to age-related deficits in motor control. Two groups of participants (young, old) performed a computer-based tracking task that paralleled driving while EEG data were recorded. Our results show that older adults committed more behavioral errors than young adults during performance of the tracking task. An analysis of our ERP data revealed that the amplitude of the ERN was reduced in older adults relative to young adults following motor errors. Our results make an important extension from previous work demonstrating agerelated reductions in the ERN during performance of cognitive tasks. Importantly, our results imply the possibility of understanding motor deficits in older age.	[Colino, Francisco L.; Howse, Harvey; Norton, Angela; Trska, Robert; Pluta, Anthony; Luehr, Stephen J.

Inter-trial coherence of medial frontal theta oscillations linked to differential feedback processing in youth and young adults with autism	RESEARCH IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS			English	Article						Autism spectrum disorders (ASD); Reward processing; Theta oscillations; Event-related spectral analysis; Inter-trial phase coherence	HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURAL SYNCHRONIZATION; REPETITIVE BEHAVIOR; REWARD EXPECTATION; DECISION-MAKING; EEG DYNAMICS	Background: Impairment in prediction and appreciation for choice outcomes could contribute to several core symptoms of ASD. We examined electroencephalography (EEG) oscillations in 27 youth and young adults diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 22 IQ-matched neurotypical controls while they performed a chance-based reward prediction task. Method: We re-analyzed our previously published ERP data (Larson et al., 2011) and examined theta band oscillations (4-8 Hz) at frontal midline sites, within a timing window that overlaps with the feedback-related negativity (FRN). We focused on event-related changes after presentation of feedback for reward (WIN) and punitive (LOSE) outcomes, both for spectral power and inter-trial phase coherence. Results: In our reward prediction task, for both groups, medial frontal theta power and phase coherence were greater following LOSE compared to WIN feedback. However, compared to controls, inter-trial coherence of medial frontal theta was significantly lower overall (across both feedback types) for individuals with ASD. Our results indicate that while individuals with ASD are sensitive to the valence of reward feedback, comparable to their neurotypical peers, they have reduced synchronization of medial frontal theta activity during feedback processing. Conclusions: This finding is consistent with previous studies showing neural variability in ASD and suggest that the processes underlying decision-making and reinforcement learning may be atypical and less efficient in ASD.

Cognitive event-related potentials (ERPs) measure synchronized synaptic neural activity associated with a cognitive event. Loss of synapses is a hallmark of the neuropathology of early Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that ERP responses during working memory retrieval discriminate aMCI from cognitively normal controls (NC) matched in age and education. Methods: Eighteen NC, 17 subjects with aMCI, and 13 subjects with AD performed a delayed match-to-sample task specially designed not only to be easy enough for impaired participants to complete but also to generate comparable performance between subjects with NC and those with aMCI. Scalp electroencephalography, memory accuracy, and reaction times were measured. Results: Whereas memory performance separated the AD group from the others, the performance of NC and subjects with aMCI was similar. In contrast, left frontal cognitive ERP patterns differentiated subjects with aMCI from NC. Enhanced P3 responses at left frontal sites were associated with nonmatching relative to matching stimuli during working memory tasks in patients with aMCI and AD, but not in NC. The accuracy of discriminating aMCI from NC was 85% by using left frontal match/nonmatch effect combined with nonmatch reaction time. Conclusions: The left frontal cognitive ERP indicator holds promise as a sensitive, simple, affordable, and noninvasive biomarker for detection of early cognitive impairment.

Acute Phencyclidine Alters Neural Oscillations Evoked by Tones in the Auditory Cortex of Rats	NEUROPSYCHOBIOLOGY			English	Article						N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonism; Phencyclidine; Auditory event-related potential; Neural synchrony; Schizophrenia; Rat model	NMDA RECEPTOR HYPOFUNCTION; STEADY-STATE RESPONSE; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DOPAMINE RELEASE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; SYNCHRONY; KETAMINE; DEFICITS	Background/Aims: The onset response to a single tone as measured by electroencephalography (EEG) is diminished in power and synchrony in schizophrenia. Because neural synchrony, particularly at gamma frequencies (30-80 Hz), is hypothesized to be supported by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) system, we tested whether phencyclidine (PCP), an NMDAr antagonist, produced similar deficits to tone stimuli in rats. Methods: Experiment 1 tested the effect of a PCP dose (1.0, 2.5, and 4.5 mg/kg) on response to single tones on intracranial EEG recorded over the auditory cortex in rats. Experiment 2 evaluated the effect of PCP after acute administration of saline or PCP (5 mg/kg), after continuous subchronic administration of saline or PCP (5 mg/kg/day), and after a week of drug cessation. In both experiments, a time-frequency analysis quantified mean power (MP) and phase locking factor (PLF) between 1 and 80 Hz. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were also measured to tones, and EEG spectral power in the absence of auditory stimuli. Results: Acute PCP increased PLF and MP between 10 and 30 Hz, while decreasing MP and PLF between approximately 50 and 70 Hz. Acute PCP produced a dose-dependent broad-band increase in EEG power that extended into gamma range frequencies. There were no consistent effects of sub-chronic administration on gamma range activity. Acute PCP increased ERP amplitudes for the P16 and N70 components. Conclusions: Findings suggest that acute PCP-induced NMDAr hypofunction has differential effects on neural power and synchrony which vary with dose, time course of administration and EEG frequency. EEG synchrony and power appear to be sensitive translational biomarkers for disrupted NMDAr function, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders.

Socio-emotionally significant experience and children's processing of irrelevant auditory stimuli	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Socio-emotionally significant experiences; Children; Event-related potential (ERP); Probe ERP paradigm; Adjustment problems	MARITAL CONFLICT TACTICS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BRAIN RESPONSES; ERP; ATTENTION; COMPONENT; BEHAVIOR; LATENCY; TASK; EEG	Theory and research indicate considerable influence of socio-emotionally significant experiences on children's functioning and adaptation. In the current study, we examined neurophysiological correlates of children's allocation of information processing resources to socio-emotionally significant events, specifically, simulated marital interactions. We presented 9- to 11-year-old children (n = 24; 11 females) with 15 videos of interactions between two actors posing as a married couple. Task-irrelevant brief auditory probes were presented during the videos, and event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited to the auditory probes were measured. As hypothesized, exposure to higher levels of interparental conflict was associated with smaller P1, P2, and N2 ERPs to the probes. This finding is consistent with the idea that children who had been exposed to more interparental conflict attended more to the videos and diverted fewer cognitive resources to processing the probes, thereby producing smaller ERPs to the probes. In addition, smaller N2s were associated with more child behavior problems, suggesting that allocating fewer processing resources to the probes was associated with more problem behavior. Results are discussed in terms of implications of socio-emotionally significant experiences for children's processing of interpersonal interactions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Tucker decomposition is the most used tensor decomposition in multidimensional discriminant analysis and tensor extension of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), called Higher Order Discriminant Analysis (HODA), is a popular tensor discriminant method used for analyzing Event Related Potentials (ERP). In this paper, we introduce a new tensor-based feature reduction technique, named Higher Order Spectral Regression Discriminant Analysis (HOSRDA), for use in a classification framework for ERP detection. The proposed method (HOSRDA) is a tensor extension of Spectral Regression Discriminant Analysis (SRDA) and casts the eigenproblem of HODA to a regression problem. The formulation of HOSRDA can open a new framework for adding different regularization constraints in higher order feature reduction problem. Additionally, when the dimension and number of samples is very large, the regression problem can be solved via efficient iterative algorithms. We applied HOSRDA on data of a P300 speller from BCI competition III and reached average character detection accuracy of 96.5% for the two subjects. HOSRDA outperforms almost all of other reported methods on this dataset. Additionally, the results of our method are fairly comparable with those of other methods when 5 and 10 repetitions are used in the P300 speller paradigm. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recently available wearable electroencephalography (EEG) opens new opportunities for objective and continuous evaluation of operators' attention, which may provide a new paradigm in ergonomics. In this study, wearable EEG was recorded during simulated assembly operation, with the aim to analyse P300 event-related potential component, which provides reliable information on attention processing. In parallel, reaction times (RTs) were recorded and the correlation between these two attention-related modalities was investigated. Negative correlation between P300 amplitudes and RTs has been observed on the group level (p < .001). However, on the individual level, the obtained correlations were not consistent. As a result, we propose the P300 amplitude for accurate attention monitoring in ergonomics research. On the other hand, no significant correlation between RTs and P300 latency was found on group, neither on individual level. Practitioner Summary: Ergonomic studies of assembly operations mainly investigated physical aspects, while mental states of the assemblers were not sufficiently addressed. Presented study aims at attention tracking, using realistic workplace replica. It is shown that drops in attention could be successfully traced only by direct brainwave observation, using wireless electroencephalographic measurements.

In this vein, the localization of neuronal generators of event-related potential (ERP) components, that is, the mismatch negativity and the P300, based on high-density electroencephalogram data, was explored as a means to enhance their sensitivity as markers of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). A 2-tone oddball experiment was conducted, involving 21 healthy elderly, 21 mild cognitive impairment, and 21 mild AD patients, while high-density electroencephalogram data were recorded. The results revealed longer latencies of both mismatch negativity and P300 and slower and far less accurate responses as neurodegeneration progressed. Standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography revealed that source differences between healthy and mild cognitive impairment and healthy and AD patients for both ERP components were present in the same Brodmann area independently of the ERP and the stage of cognitive decline. This finding indicates an early change of source activation related to cognitive performance and may be used to improve the diagnostic and prognostic value of ERPs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Inverse solutions for Brain-Computer Interfaces: Effects of regularisation on localisation and classification	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS (SMC)	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	OCT 05-08, 2017	Banff, CANADA	IEEE			HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; RECONSTRUCTION; POTENTIALS; HEAD	Estimation of intracranial sources, using inverse solutions methods, has been proposed as a mean to improve performance in non-invasive brain-computer interfaces. These methods estimate the activity of a large number of neural sources from a smaller number of scalp electroencephalography (EEG) channels. This is a highly undetermined problem and regularisation constraints need to be applied. In this paper we compared the effect of several regularisation constraints and parameters in the localisation error and classification performance. Results on three event-related potential protocols -rapid serial visual processing, P300-speller and error-related potentials- showed no significant difference in the maximum performance between minimum norm or weighted minimum norm regularisation constraints. Standardised methods despite yielding lower localisation error resulted in decreased classification performance. Noteworthy, testing on data acquired in different days than the training suggests that discriminant features extracted from intracranial sources are stable across sessions.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of a second task on a main task of motor execution and on the ability to detect the cortical potential related to the main task from non-invasive electroencephalographic (EEG). Participants were asked to perform a series of cue-based ankle dorsiflexions as the primary task (single task level). In some experimental runs, in addition to the primary task they concurrently attended an auditory oddball paradigm consisting of three tones while they were asked to count the number of sequences of special tones (dual task level). EEG signals were recorded from nine channels centered on Cz. Analysis of event-related potential (ERP) signals from Cz confirmed that the oddball task decreased the attention to the ankle dorsiflexion significantly. Furthermore, movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) analysis revealed that the amplitude of the MRCP and pre-movement slopes were changed significantly. These variations were significantly greater for the EEG channels corresponding to the motor cortex and the frontal-central cortex.	[Aliakbaryhosseinabadi, S.; Kamavuako, E.

This paper proposes a novel method which can significantly increase the spelling bit rate while also maintaining the desired accuracy. We provide an adaptive real-time stopping method based on the scores of ensemble support vector machine classifiers. We apply a criteria assessment process on the classifiers' scores to dynamically stop the ERP-evoked paradigms at any flashing sequence. Our experiments were conducted on three different P300-Speller data sets (BCI Competition II, BCI Competition III and Akimpech). Our proposed framework significantly outperformed the related state-of-the-art studies in terms of character output accuracy and elicitation bit rate rise between static and dynamic stopping schemes. We improve the average bit rate by over 80% while perfectly maintaining the best original static accuracy of over 96%.

Switching direction affects switching costs: Behavioral, ERP and time frequency analyses of intra-sentential codeswitching	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Intra-sentential codeswitching; Bilingualism; Event-related potentials; Time-frequency analysis	BILINGUAL WORD RECOGNITION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; BRAIN POTENTIALS; LANGUAGE; COMPREHENSION; OSCILLATIONS; UNIFICATION; INHIBITION; DYNAMICS; LEVEL	Bilinguals have the unique ability to produce utterances that switch between languages. Most language switching research has focused on isolated, unrelated items, which emphasizes separation of the languages. Fewer studies examined the cognitive and neural mechanisms of switching languages in natural discourse. The present study examined the effect of codeswitching direction on the comprehension of intra-sentential codeswitching in Spanish-English bilinguals, using self-paced reading behavioral measurements (Experiment 1) and electroencephalography (EEG) measurements (Experiment 2), analyzed via both event-related potentials (ERPs) and time-frequency analysis (TFR). Reading times showed a significant switching cost for codeswitched sentences in both codeswitching directions, though switching costs were somewhat higher into the dominant language than into the weaker language. ERPs showed that codeswitched as compared to non-switched words elicited a late positivity, but only when switching from the dominant into the weaker language, not in the reverse direction. TFRs showed complementary and converging results: switches into the weaker language resulted in a power decrease in lower beta band while switches into the dominant language resulted in a power increase in theta band. These multi-method findings provide novel insights into neurocognitive resources engaged in the comprehension of intra-sentential codeswitches related to sentence-level restructuring processes to activate and access the weaker language.

A Review of Issues Related to Data Acquisition and Analysis in EEG/MEG Studies	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Review						EEG; MEG; artifacts; data acquisition; reference electrode; data analysis; sensor space; source space	HUMAN CONNECTOME PROJECT; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; AVERAGE REFERENCE; SIMULTANEOUS EEG; NEURAL ACTIVITY; MEG ANALYSIS; HEAD; FMRI	Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are non-invasive electrophysiological methods, which record electric potentials and magnetic fields due to electric currents in synchronously-active neurons. With MEG being more sensitive to neural activity from tangential currents and EEG being able to detect both radial and tangential sources, the two methods are complementary. Over the years, neurophysiological studies have changed considerably: high-density recordings are becoming de rigueur; there is interest in both spontaneous and evoked activity; and sophisticated artifact detection and removal methods are available. Improved head models for source estimation have also increased the precision of the current estimates, particularly for EEG and combined EEG/MEG. Because of their complementarity, more investigators are beginning to perform simultaneous EEG/MEG studies to gain more complete information about neural activity. Given the increase in methodological complexity in EEG/MEG, it is important to gather data that are of high quality and that are as artifact free as possible. Here, we discuss some issues in data acquisition and analysis of EEG and MEG data. Practical considerations for different types of EEG and MEG studies are also discussed.

Neurocognitive assessment of emotional context sensitivity	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Event related potential (ERP); Regulatory flexibility; Emotion; Context sensitivity	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; GO/NO-GO TASK; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; BEHAVIORAL-INHIBITION; SOCIAL ANXIETY; TIME-COURSE; DEPRESSION; ATTENTION	Sensitivity to emotional context is an emerging construct for characterizing adaptive or maladaptive emotion regulation, but few measurement approaches exist. The current study combined behavioral and neurocognitive measures to assess context sensitivity in relation to self-report measures of adaptive emotional flexibility and well-being. Sixty-six adults completed an emotional go/no-go task using happy, fearful, and neutral faces as go and no-go cues, while EEG was recorded to generate event-related potentials (ERPs) reflecting attentional selection and discrimination (N170) and cognitive control (N2). Context sensitivity was measured as the degree of emotional facilitation or disruption in the go/no-go task and magnitude of ERP response to emotion cues. Participants self-reported on emotional flexibility, anxiety, and depression. Overall participants evidenced emotional context sensitivity, such that when happy faces were go stimuli, accuracy improved (greater behavioral facilitation), whereas when fearful faces were no-go stimuli, errors increased (disrupted behavioral inhibition). These indices predicted emotional flexibility and well-being: Greater behavioral facilitation following happy cues was associated with lower depression and anxiety, whereas greater disruption in behavioral inhibition following fearful cues was associated with lower flexibility. ERP indices of context sensitivity revealed additional associations: Greater N2 to fear go cues was associated with less anxiety and depression, and greater N2 and N170 to happy and fear no-go cues, respectively, were associated with greater emotional flexibility and well-being. Results suggest that pleasant and unpleasant emotions selectively enhance and disrupt components of context sensitivity, and that behavioral and ERP indices of context sensitivity predict flexibility and well-being.

J	Kissler, J; Strehlow, J				Kissler, Johanna; Strehlow, Janine			SOMETHING ALWAYS STICKS? HOW EMOTIONAL LANGUAGE MODULATES NEURAL PROCESSES INVOLVED IN FACE ENCODING AND RECOGNITION MEMORY	POZNAN STUDIES IN CONTEMPORARY LINGUISTICS			English	Article						Emotion; language; faces; perception; memory; EEG	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PERCEPTION; PICTURES; AROUSAL; CONTEXT; ATTENTION; WORDS	Language can serve to constrain cognitive and emotional representations. Here, we investigate to what extent linguistic emotional information alters processing of faces with neutral expressions. Previous studies have shown that cortical processing of emotional faces differs from that of neutral faces. Electroencephalography (EEG) has revealed emotion effects for early and late event-related potentials (ERPs) such as the N1, the Early Posterior Negativity (EPN) and the Late Positive Potential (LPP). In order to study the effect of language information on face processing, 30 negative and 30 neutral descriptive phrases were presented, each followed by a neutral expression face. Participants were instructed to remember the association. We analyzed the immediate effect of information type on face processing during encoding as well as delayed effects during subsequent recognition. During encoding, faces following negative language information elicited a larger left frontal positivity between 500-700 ms after stimulus onset. During recognition, a left centro-parietal LPP was likewise increased for faces previously associated with a negative description. In addition, the parietal old/new effect was significantly increased for faces with negative information compared to new ones, while no significant effect was observed for faces with neutral information. No information effects on early perceptual ERPs (N1, EPN) were found. Reaction times (RTs) for source memory decisions (negative versus neutral) were significantly shorter for faces with negative versus neutral information. In sum, ERP results indicate that emotional significance can be linguistically induced in faces on a cortical level and, at least in an explicit memory task, this information modulates later stages of face processing and memory. Implications for cognitive effects of public media design are discussed.

Although great efforts have been devoted to searching for diagnostic biomarkers of schizophrenia over the past several decades, no study has yet investigated how accurately these biomarkers are able to estimate an individual patient's symptom severity. In this study, we applied electrophysiological biomarkers obtained from electroencephalography (EEG) analyses to an estimation of symptom severity scores of patients with schizophrenia. EEG signals were recorded from 23 patients while they performed a facial affect discrimination task. Based on the source current density analysis results, we extracted voxels that showed a strong correlation between source activity and symptom scores. We then built a prediction model to estimate the symptom severity scores of each patient using the source activations of the selected voxels. The symptom scores of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) were estimated using the linear prediction model. The results of leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) showed that the mean errors of the estimated symptom scores were 3.34 +/- 2.40 and 3.90 +/- 3.01 for the Positive and Negative PANSS scores, respectively. The current pilot study is the first attempt to estimate symptom severity scores in schizophrenia using quantitative EEG features. It is expected that the present method can be extended to other cognitive paradigms or other psychological illnesses.

In a learning phase of about 20 min, subjects acquired the meaning of 20 Kanji characters. As control stimuli 20 different Kanji characters were presented. Electrical brain activity was obtained before and after learning, The mean learning performance of all subjects was 92.5% correct responses. EEG was measured simultaneously from 30 channels, artifacts were removed offline, and the data before and after learning were compared. We found five spatial principal components that accounted for 83.8% of the variance. A significant interaction between training time (before/after learning) and stimulus (learning/control) illustrates a significant relation between successful learning and topographical changes of brain activity elicited by Kanji characters. Effects that were induced by learning were seen at short latencies in the order of 100 ms. In addition, we present evidence that differences in the weighted combination of spatial components allow to identify experimental conditions successfully by linear discriminant analysis using topographical ERP data of a single time point. In conclusion, semantic meaning can be aquired rapidly and it is associated with specific changes of ERP components.

Its underlying neural mechanisms have been explored through both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). Trial-by-trial coupling of simultaneously collected EEG and fMRI signals has become an important and promising approach to study the spatio-temporal dynamics of such cognitive processes. Previous studies have demonstrated a modulation effect of the WM load on both the BOLD response in certain brain areas and the amplitude of P3. However, much remains to be explored regarding the WM load-dependent relationship between the amplitude of ERP components and cortical activities, and the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the EEG signal still poses a challenge to performing singlo-trial analyses. In this paper, we investigated the spatio-temporal activities of P3 during an n-back verbal WM task by introducing an adaptive wavelet denoiser into the extraction of single-trial P3 features and using general linear model (GLM) to integrate simultaneously collected EEG and fMRI data. Our results replicated the modulation effect of the WM load on the P3 amplitude. Additionally, the activation of single-trial P3 amplitudes was detected in multiple brain regions, including the insula, the cuneus, the lingual gyrus (LG), and the middle occipital gyrus (MOG). Moreover, we found significant correlations between P3 features and behavioral performance. These findings suggest that the single-trial integration of simultaneous EEG and fMRI signals may provide new insights into classical cognitive functions. (C) 2017 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Unlike the norm in studies, where mostly concrete categories are used (imaginable objects), we considered a total of 6 basic categories: three abstract and unimaginable (emotion, event, illness), one abstract yet clearly imaginable (color), and two concrete categories, a coherent (mammals) and an incoherent one (furniture). We also investigated the source of the observed N400 ERPs in the brain to detect possible differences between the semantic processing of these categories. Our results show that, independently of word abstractness or concreteness, word typicality has a clear effect on N400 both in terms of amplitude and scalp localization as well as in N400 sources, all of which in turn is indicative of differences in difficulty of word processing.

J	Lafuente, V; Gorriz, JM; Ramirez, J; Gonzalez, E				Lafuente, Victor; Gorriz, Juan M.; Ramirez, Javier; Gonzalez, Eduardo			P300 brainwave extraction from EEG signals: An unsupervised approach	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Artifacts; P300 classification; Matched filters; ICA	COMPUTER-INTERFACE SYSTEMS; BCI-COMPETITION-III; MENTAL PROSTHESIS; COMPONENT	The P300 is an endogenous event-related potential (ERP) that is naturally elicited by rare and significant stimuli, arisen from the frontal, temporal and occipital lobe of the brain, although is usually measured in the parietal lobe. P300 signals are increasingly used in brain-computer interfaces (BCI) because the users of ERP-based BCIs need no special training. In order to detect the P300 signal, most studies in the field have been focused on a supervised approach, dealing with over-fitting filters and the need for later validation. In this paper we start bridging this gap by modeling an unsupervised classifier of the P300 presence based on a weighted score. This is carried out through the use of matched filters that weight events that are likely to represent the P300 wave. The optimal weights are determined through a study of the data's features. The combination of different artifact cancelation methods and the P300 extraction techniques provides a marked, statistically significant, improvement in accuracy at the level of the top-performing algorithms for a supervised approach presented in the literature to date. This innovation brings a notable impact in ERP-based communicators, appointing to the development of a faster and more reliable BCI technology. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The goal of this study was to examine and compare the time course and the event related potential (ERP) components in OCD patients and healthy controls (HC) to reveal the complex brain activation pattern associated with attentional bias in OCD. The behavioural and electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded while the participants performed an emotional Stroop task. Compared to HC, the individuals with OCD exhibited slower response time, prolonged N1 latency and larger N1 and P2 amplitudes across different emotional words. In addition, we discovered that the OCD group showed an enlarged NI component to OCD-related threat words compared to neutral words. Moreover, the OCD group had decreased P3 and later positive potential (LPP) amplitudes towards all types of words compared to the HC group. More importantly, the OCD group manifested smaller LPP amplitude to threat words compared to the HC group. Our findings suggest that OCD individuals may excessively direct their attention away from the threat at the late processing stage, probably due to the intensive processing or overestimation of the stimuli in the early automatic processing stage.

New types of robotic assistive technologies that enable children with disabilities to interact with their environment, which prove to be beneficial for their cognitive and perceptual skills development, have emerged in recent years. In this study, a human-robot interface that uses Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) brain response during movement was developed. A haptic robot generates force feedback to constrain the user's hand motion into a defined region using a Forbidden Region Virtual Fixture (FRVF). Two channels of electroencephalography (EEG) brain signals were acquired and used to design classifiers to discriminate the pattern of brain signals between "movement" and "rest" during the operation of the robot. The highest ERD classification accuracy achieved was 69.4%. With the classifier, ERD-based FRVFs were tested in a simple robot operation task with two non-disabled adults. The virtual wall triggered by ERD successfully blocked the motion of the two participants on average 7 and 6.4 out of 10 times, respectively. Although further improvement of the system is still needed, the experimental results demonstrate the potential of the ERD-based FRVFs in robot control for a clinical population.

These predictive coding processes can disturb performance in concurrent perceptual decision-making and are known to depend on fronto-striatal circuits. However, it is unknown whether, and if so, to what extent striatal microstructural properties modulate these processes. We addressed this question in a human disease model of striosomal dysfunction, i.e. X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP), using high-density EEG recordings and source localization. The results show faster and more accurate perceptual decision-making performance during distraction in XDP patients compared to healthy controls. The electrophysiological data show that sensory memory and predictive coding processes reflected by the mismatch negativity related to lateral prefrontal brain regions were weakened in XDP patients and thus induced less cognitive conflict than in controls as reflected by the N2 event-related potential (ERP). Consequently, attentional shifting (P3a ERP) and reorientation processes (RON ERP) were less pronounced in the XDP group. Taken together, these results suggests that striosomal dysfunction is related to predictive coding deficits leading to a better performance in concomitant perceptual decision-making, probably because predictive coding does not interfere with perceptual decision-making processes. These effects may reflect striatal imbalances between the striosomes and the matrix compartment.

Exploring potential social influences on brain potentials during anticipation of tactile stimulation	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Mu rhythm; Somatosensory anticipation; CNV	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; SOMATOSENSORY ACTIVATIONS; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; SENSORY CORTEX; VARIATION CNV; EEG; PAIN; TOUCH	This study explored interpersonal influences on electrophysiological responses during the anticipation of tactile stimulation. It is well-known that broad, negative-going potentials are present in the event-related potential (ERP) between a forewarning cue and a tactile stimulus. It has also been shown that the alpha range mu rhythm shows a lateralized desynchronization over central electrode sites during anticipation of tactile stimulation of the hand. The current study used a tactile discrimination task in which a visual cue signaled that an upcoming stimulus would either be delivered 1500 ms later to the participant's hand, to a task partner's hand, or to neither person. For the condition in which participants anticipated the tactile 'stimulation to their own hand, a negative potential (contingent negative variation, CNV) was observed in the ERP at central sites in the 1000 ms prior to the tactile stimulus. Significant mu rhythm desynchronization was also present in the same time window. The magnitudes of the ERPs and of the mu desynchronization were greater in the contralateral than in the ipsilateral hemisphere prior to right hand stimulation. Similar ERP and EEG changes were not present when the visual cue indicated that stimulation would be delivered to the task partner or to neither person. The absence of social influences during anticipation of tactile stimulation, and the relationship between the two brain signatures of anticipatory attention (CNV and mu rhythm) are discussed.

As discussed in this special issue, a renewed focus on questions of reliability and stability marks the need for intuitive, quantitative descriptors that allow researchers to communicate the robustness of ERP measures used in a given study. This report argues that well-established indices of internal consistency and effect size meet this need and can be easily extracted from most ERP datasets, as demonstrated with example analyses using a representative dataset from a feature-based visual selective attention task. We demonstrate how to measure the internal consistency of three aspects commonly considered in ERP studies: voltage measurements for specific time ranges at selected sensors, voltage dynamics across all time points of the ERP waveform, and the distribution of voltages across the scalp. We illustrate methods for quantifying the robustness of experimental condition differences, by calculating effect size for different indices derived from the ERP. The number of trials contributing to the ERP waveform was manipulated to examine the relationship between signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), internal consistency, and effect size. In the present example dataset, satisfactory consistency (Cronbach's alpha > 0.7) of individual voltage measurements was reached at lower trial counts than were required to reach satisfactory effect sizes for differences between experimental conditions. Comparing different metrics of robustness, we conclude that the internal consistency and effect size of ERP findings greatly depend on the quantification strategy, the comparisons and analyses performed, and the SNR.

Normal brain activity (cognitive processes, etc.) has been extensively studied using electroencephalography (EEG) since the 1930's, in the form of spontaneous fluctuations in rhythms, and patterns, and in a more experimentally-driven approach in the form of event-related potentials (ERPs) allowing us to relate scalp voltage waveforms to brain states and behavior. The use of EEG recorded during functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) is a more recent development that has become an important tool in clinical neuroscience, for example for the study of epileptic activity. The purpose of this review is to explore the magnetic resonance imaging safety aspects specifically associated with the use of scalp EEG and other brain-implanted electrodes such as intracranial EEG electrodes when they are subjected to the MRI environment. We provide a theoretical overview of the mechanisms at play specifically associated with the presence of EEG equipment connected to the subject in the MR environment, and of the resulting health hazards. This is followed by a survey of the literature on the safety of scalp or invasive EEG-fMRI data acquisitions across field strengths, with emphasis on the practical implications for the safe application of the techniques; in particular, we attempt to summarize the findings in terms of acquisition protocols when possible.

The first is defined as emotional, located in the limbic system, develops earlier, quicker, and more intensively than the second one in the prefrontal cortex, called the judgement network, which fulfils the role of control and inhibition of emotional reactions. The domination of the emotional network in adolescence is manifested by hyperactivity of the limbic system, accompanied by intensified undertaking of courageous, reckless, risky, or even sometimes dangerous actions, so very characteristic in the maturation. The aim of the article is to present the state of the art in the field of latest achievements in experimental neurophysiology related to the maturation of the structural end functional processes in adolescents, and to alcohol vulnerability. Alcohol effect initiation starts in early adolescence, and therefore is connected with alcohol abuse and addiction in adulthood, which confirms the necessity for provision of an early prophylactic protection for juveniles, even before entering the phase of early adolescence. Some electrophysiological characteristics, such as low P3 amplitude of the Event-Related Potential (ERP) and Event-Related Oscillations (EROs), are manifested by their high risk offspring, and are considered to be biological markers (endophenotypes) of a predisposition to develop alcohol use disorders. Electroencephalographic oscillations induced within the range of the theta and delta waves (Event-Related Oscillation-ERO), considered as endophenotypes and markers of increased vulnerability for addiction, present three groups of genes and three types of neurotransmitters, with gamma aminobutyric acid, acetylcholine and glutamate as neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. A new research approach consisting in the application of electroencephalographic methods and techniques in developmental and genetic studies of the conditioning of varied vulnerability, and especially increased preferences for alcohol tasting and abuse in adolescence, provide unique possibilities for comprehensive and deepened studies which may contribute to the prevention of alcohol addiction, the genesis of which, to a great extent, is related with the effect of causative environmental and genetic factors during adolescent development.

However, a more easy-to-use toolbox for re-referencing scalp EEG data to zero reference is still lacking. Here, we have therefore developed two open-source MATLAB toolboxes for REST of scalp EEG. One version of REST is closely integrated into EEGLAB, which is a popular MATLAB toolbox for processing the EEG data; and another is a batch version to make it more convenient and efficient for experienced users. Both of them are designed to provide an easy-to-use for novice researchers and flexibility for experienced researchers. All versions of the REST toolboxes can be freely downloaded at http://www.neuro.uestc.edu.cn/rest/Down. html, and the detailed information including publications, comments and documents on REST can also be found from this website. An example of usage is given with comparative results of REST and average reference. We hope these user-friendly REST toolboxes could make the relatively novel technique of REST easier to study, especially for applications in various EEG studies.

The purpose of the present study was to examine potential deficits in three aspects of inhibitory control - conflict monitoring, conflict resolution, and overt behavioral inhibition - in the context of depressive symptoms. Depressed (n = 15) and non-depressed (n = 15) participants completed a stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) task while electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded. EEG results indicate that depression impacts only the conflict resolution phase of inhibitory control, with higher levels of depressive and reflective pondering symptoms associated with poorer conflict resolution. Findings have clear implications for treatments of depression, many of which do not currently target the inhibitory control deficits present in this disorder.

Best practice for single-trial detection of event-related potentials: Application to brain-computer interfaces	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Event-related potentials; Brain-computer Interface; Biomedical engineering; Spatial filtering; Multivariate pattern analysis; Classification	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MENTAL CHRONOMETRY; ERP COMPONENTS; P300; CLASSIFICATION; EEG; PROSTHESIS; ALGORITHMS; SPEED; MEG	The detection of event-related potentials (ERPs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is a fundamental component in non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) research, and in modern cognitive neuroscience studies. Whereas the grand average response across trials provides an estimation of essential characteristics of a brain evoked response, an estimation of the differences between trials for a particular type of stimulus can provide key insight about the brain dynamics and possible origins of the brain response. The research in ERP single trial detection has been mainly driven by applications in biomedical engineering, with an interest from machine learning and signal processing groups that test novel methods on noisy signals. Efficient single-trial detection techniques require processing steps that include temporal filtering, spatial filtering, and classification. In this paper, we review the current state-of-the-art methods for single-trial detection of event-related potentials with applications in BCI. Efficient single-trial detection techniques should embed simple yet efficient functions requiring as few hyper-parameters as possible. The focus of this paper is on methods that do not include a large number of hyper-parameters and can be easily implemented with datasets containing a limited number of trials. A benchmark of different classification methods is proposed on a database recorded from sixteen healthy subjects during a rapid serial visual presentation task. The results support the conclusion that single-trial detection can be achieved with an area under the ROC curve superior to 0.9 with less than ten sensors and 20 trials corresponding to the presentation of a target.

Neurophysiological assessment of acute pain in infants: a scoping review of research methods	ACTA PAEDIATRICA			English	Review						Acute pain; Infant; Neuroimaging; Neurophysiological assessment; Pain assessment	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; BREAST-FEEDING ANALGESIA; TERM NEWBORN-INFANTS; PROCEDURAL PAIN; PRETERM INFANTS; BRAIN; FMRI; VALIDATION; VOLUNTEERS; PERCEPTION	A systematic scoping search to describe the neurophysiological methods used in infant acute pain assessment research was conducted. Of the 2411 abstracts screened, 19 articles were retained. Nine studies utilised near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), two utilised functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and eight utilised electroencephalography (EEG). There was methodological variability in studies utilising NIRS, whereas EEG and fMRI studies reported consistent methods. Of the eight EEG studies, six identified a nociceptivespecific event-related potential. Conclusion: While more methodologically rigorous studies are needed, ERPs appear to hold some promise as indicators of infant nociception during clinical procedures to supplement existing measures.

To this, we compare the source localization accuracy using generic and atlas-based head models, constructed with the Finite Difference Reciprocity method (FDRM). Additionally, we analyze the influence of including several tissues, as skull, scalp, gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. Comparison is carried out under a parametric empirical Bayesian (PEB) framework, that allows contrasting different forward modeling approaches using real data. Obtained results, based on event-related potentials (ERPs) of 31 subjects, show that the more realistic and more dependent on the study population the used head model, the better the ESI estimation.

To study the interaction between neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and serotonin, pharmacological models can be used. In this study, we tested the effects of the muscarinic M1 antagonist biperiden, acute tryptophan depletion (ATD), and the interaction between the two on episodic memory using the verbal learning task. Methods The study was conducted according to a double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-way crossover design. Seventeen participants received biperiden (2.0 mg), ATD (SolugelP), a combination of both, or a placebo in counterbalanced order with a wash out of at least 7 days. A verbal learning task was performed while recording electroencephalography. The task consisted of an immediate and delayed recall as well as a recognition part. Results Results revealed decreased scores on the delayed recall after biperiden and ATD separately but no significant interaction between the two. However, the event-related potential components P3b, N400, and P600 did show an interaction during encoding. Conclusion These results indicate that both BIP and ATD impair episodic memory. However, an interaction between the serotonergic and cholinergic system on memory performance is not supported.	[Borghans, Laura G. J.

Brain mechanisms of the Tip-of-the-Tongue state: An electroencephalography-based source localization study	PSYCHOLOGY IN RUSSIA-STATE OF THE ART			English	Article						tip-of-the-tongue (TOT); memory retrieval; verbatim recollection; electroencephalography (EEG); source localization; event related potentials (ERP); posterior cingulate cortex; parahippocampal gyrus; isthmus of cingulate gyrus	HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; ACCESSIBILITY MODEL; POLE; MEG	Background. The Tip-Of-the-Tongue (TOT) state occurs when a person fails to retrieve a familiar word, e.g., a name, from long-term memory, while knowing perfectly well that the forgotten word exists in memory and being able to report some information about it (semantic associations, the first letter, the number of syllables, etc.). Objective and Method. In the present work, we studied the activation of brain structures during the TOT state. The participants (N = 20; age 21.5 +/- 4.1) viewed portraits of movie stars whose names they were asked to remember. Event related potentials (ERP) were registered in three conditions: 1) the participant remembered the name; 2) the participant did not know the name; 3) the participant knew the name but could not remember it (TOT-state). The sources of cortical activation were computed (dSPM algorithm). Results. Time intervals demonstrating significant differences (t-test) in activation among the three conditions were calculated for each activated area, so that up to four different stages of processing could be delineated. According to our analysis, face perception involves activation of the visual cortex (left cuneus and right precuneus cortices), banks of the superior temporal sulci, poles of frontal and temporal lobes, and fusiform gyrus. The early activation does not depend on the successful retrieval of the name. A second increase in activation of the visual cortex is present at a later stage of processing, when name retrieval fails or if it is impeded. Conclusion. We have shown that successful face recognition involves activation of the posterior cingulate cortex and the isthmus of the cingulate cortex in both hemispheres. Additionally, the parahippocampal gyrus is less active at the early stages and more active at the later stages of processing in the TOT-state, when name retrieval from the long-term memory fails.

Impaired Error Processing and Semantic Processing During Multitasking	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						multitasking; error; aging; post-error slowing; event-related potential	DUAL-TASK PERFORMANCE; PSYCHOLOGICAL REFRACTORY PERIOD; BRAIN POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; DIVIDED ATTENTION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; WORD PERCEPTION; AGE-DIFFERENCES; ERP COMPONENTS; NEGATIVITY	Neuronal mechanisms of error processing under multitasking and their impact on the processing of a concurrent task were examined. Twenty-one younger and twenty older healthy adults performed a visual-motor flanker task or an auditory-vocal semantic task or both tasks simultaneously. During task performance the electroencephalogram (EEG) was continuously recorded. The event-related potential (ERP) was derived from the EEG, and ERP components associated with error processing (Ne and Pe) and semantic processing (N400) were analyzed. Older participants responded more slowly than younger ones in the flanker task regardless of the multitasking condition, while accuracy was equal in both groups. In the flanker task, multitasking led to an increase of error rates, a reduction of reaction times, and a disappearance of post-error slowing (PES). Error detection (Ne) was delayed and error awareness (Pe) attenuated in the single flanker task relative to the multitasking condition. In the semantic task, multitasking led to an increase of reaction times and a delay of the N400 in particular when an error in the flanker task occurred. First, these results indicate that multitasking impaired error processing, in particular conscious error perception (Pe) and abolished post-error adjustments of performance (PES) which may have resulted in a more risky response tendency in the flanker task. Second, multitasking impaired semantic processing, in particular after an error in the concurrent flanker task. Hence, multitasking compromised error processing and error prevention in one of the tasks, and semantic processing in the other task. Consequently, multitasking should be avoided at workplaces with error-prone job assignments or where poor understanding of communication may have serious consequences.

This study examines effects of Ad Type (Positive, Negative, and Comparison) on recognition memory for candidate issue positions. Potential moderators (Ad Sponsor Partisanship X Viewer Partisanship, Ad Type X Viewer Ideology, Ad Type X Viewer Partisanship) of political ad memory are explored, and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are used to examine whether semantic processing (indexed as brain activity in the gamma band frequency range) mediates main or moderated effects of Ad Type on Memory. Results reveal a significant interaction between Ad Type and Partisanship, with Republicans remembering more from positive relative to negative ads (significant), and Democrats remembering more from negative ads (marginally significant). A direct effect of Gamma on Memory highlights the considerable potential that EEG (in general) and the gamma frequency band (in particular) may hold for the study of message processing.

Methods: Eleven CWS and 19 TDC participated. Event related potentials (ERP) were recorded using a 64-channel EEG-cap during an equiprobable visual Go/Nogo task. The global field power (GFP) as well as the mean amplitudes in the P3 time frame were compared between groups. Additionally, the potential maps of the groups were investigated visually in the N2 and P3 time windows. Results: The groups differed significantly in the right frontal area especially in the Nogo condition (p < 0.001) with CWS showing smaller (less positive) mean amplitudes, most likely due to a prolonged and asymmetrical N2 component. Also the fronto-central Nogo P3 component was rather indistinct in CWS, but easily recognizable in TDC in the potential maps. Conclusions: The CWS show atypical brain activation compared to the TDC in a Go/Nogo task as indexed by the excessive N2-related activity in both conditions and reduced P3-related activity in Nogo condition. Significance: These findings indicate atypical stimulus evaluation and response inhibition processes in CWS. (C) 2016 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Participants were presented with auditory stimuli consisting of pure sound tones with 1000 Hz (non-target) and 2000 Hz (target) frequency. Frontal EEG and EDA recordings were taken using a biopotential amplifier system. Results P1, N1, P2, N2 (p<0.001) responses obtained from the frontal region to target stimuli were higher in HIV group; while the P3 response was higher in control group. The latencies of all responses to target stimuli were significantly delayed in HIV group compared to control group. In HIV group, amplitudes of P1, N2 and P3 responses to target stimuli were found to be higher than to non-target stimuli; N1 and P2 responses to non-target stimuli had higher amplitude. Conclusion The findings of this study demonstrate the effects of HIV on both the peripheral (EDA) and central nervous system (EEG). The differences in neuroelectrical activity found between HIV patients and healthy individuals can be concluded to be due to the direct or indirect effects of the virus and antiretroviral medication on neurons. The method of simultaneous monitoring of auditory ERP and EDA may contribute to the detection of subclinical neural deterioration in HIV patients.

The Spatiotemporal Neural Dynamics of Infant Face Processing	ADAPTIVE HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Orbital frontal cortex; Fusiformface area; Kindchenschema; Source modelling; Electroencephalography; Infant; Baby	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HUMAN PARENTAL BRAIN; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; CORTICAL NETWORK; ROMANTIC LOVE; BABY SCHEMA; PERCEPTION; ADULT; ATTRACTIVENESS; CUTENESS	Substantial evidence indicates that infant faces are a salient stimulus that receive attentional priority, motivate caretaking behavior, and are rewarding. There is strong support for an early role of reward circuitry, including the orbital frontal cortex, in processing infant faces. Although it is hypothesized that this early activity promotes subsequent positive emotional reactions and greater attention to infant faces, supporting evidence of the spatiotemporal cortical dynamics of infant face processing is lacking. In this study we used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the spatiotemporal brain dynamics of face processing to better understand how we process infant faces relative to adult faces. EEG was acquired while participants viewed infant faces and adult faces of the same or opposite sex. Source analysis of the event related potentials revealed activity across a broad face processing network. In keeping with existing work, early increases were observed at the time of the N170 in the orbitofrontal cortex, the inferior occipital gyrus and the fusiform gyrus. Later increases were observed between 300 and 500 milliseconds in the anterior cingulate, the superior temporal sulcus and the precuneus. We argue that the overall pattern of results is compatible with the hypothesis that the rewarding nature of infant features motivates increased activity and motivation of caretaking infants, in part by enhancing processing of the face and heightening attention related circuitry in the brain.

EEG Recording and Online Signal Processing on Android: A Multiapp Framework for Brain-Computer Interfaces on Smartphone	BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; ERROR; CLASSIFICATION; COMPONENTS; FEEDBACK; PATIENT; HEALTH	Objective. Our aim was the development and validation of a modular signal processing and classification application enabling online electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing on off-the-shelf mobile Android devices. The software application SCALA (Signal Processing and Classification on Android) supports a standardized communication interface to exchange information with external software and hardware. Approach. In order to implement a closed-loop brain-computer interface (BCI) on the smartphone, we used a multi app framework, which integrates applications for stimulus presentation, data acquisition, data processing, classification, and delivery of feedback to the user. Main Results. We have implemented the open source signal processing application SCALA. We present timing test results supporting sufficient temporal precision of audio events. We also validate SCALA with a well-established auditory selective attention paradigm and report above chance level classification results for all participants. Regarding the 24-channel EEG signal quality, evaluation results confirm typical sound onset auditory evoked potentials as well as cognitive event-related potentials that differentiate between correct and incorrect task performance feedback. Significance. We present a fully smartphone-operated, modular closed-loop BCI system that can be combined with different EEG amplifiers and can easily implement other paradigms.

An ERP Study of Response Inhibition in the Auditory Domain in Children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders	ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Event-Related Potentials; Response Inhibition; Fetal Alcohol Syndrome; Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders; Prenatal Alcohol Exposure; Go/NoGo	GO/NO-GO TASKS; PRENATAL ALCOHOL; EVOKED POTENTIALS; EEG DYNAMICS; EXPOSURE; BRAIN; SUPPRESSION; PERFORMANCE; PREVALENCE; CHILDHOOD	Background: Previous event-related potential (ERP) studies of response inhibition in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) have used a visual Go/NoGo task to study the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on response inhibition. No studies exist using auditory versions of the task; thus, it is unclear how the deficits observed in visual tasks translate into the auditory domain. Methods: This study examined ERPs using an auditory Go/NoGo paradigm in a sample of 35 school-age children-18 with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and 17 normally developing controls. Results: Alcohol-exposed children performed as well as controls in terms of inhibiting their responses; however, their reaction times were significantly slower under the Go condition. As in the ERP visual Go/NoGo task previously administered to these children, group differences were seen in early perceptual processing, specifically related to stimulus discrimination, with a decrease in P2 amplitude in the alcohol-exposed group. The control group exhibited greater N2 amplitude in the NoGo compared to the Go condition while the alcohol-exposed group did not, suggesting a group difference in the neural substrates underlying conflict monitoring. The alcohol-exposed group demonstrated longer latency P3 with reduced amplitude, suggesting poorer allocation of attention. The alcohol-exposed group also exhibited a late positive component (LPC) similar to the one observed in the previous visual ERP study. This LPC may indicate compensatory neurophysiological function related to resetting of attentional control networks in preparation for the next trial. None of the ERP outcomes in this study were related to potential confounders which included cognitive and socioeconomic measures as well as ADHD diagnosis. Conclusions: The observed ERP group differences point to elements of perceptual and attentional processing likely to be involved in the performance deficits often observed in children with FASD. We also observed changes in ERPs related to conflict monitoring/response inhibition, highlighting fetal alcohol-related effects on how the brain responds when there is need to identify and respond to environmental cues by switching away from a prepotent motor response to an inhibited state.

Circular Organization of the Instantaneous Phase in ERPs and the Ongoing EEG due to Selective Attention	2017 8TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	MAY 25-28, 2017	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE, EMBS			LISTENING EFFORT; CONTRIBUTES; GENERATION; BRAIN; RESET	It is known that signs of early auditory selective attention are reflected in the N1-wave of auditory late potentials. In recent years, we used instantaneous phase synchronization measures related to this N1-effect to assess the attentional effort in listening. In particular, we showed that listening effort induced by task difficulty can be quantified by using this method. Subsequently, in order to not be restricted to short transient stimuli in event-related paradigms, we translated the idea of an objective listening effort estimation to the ongoing EEG activity in arbitrary, non-event-related listening tasks. Here we could again quantify effortful listening by analyzing the circular organization of the ongoing instantaneous phase. In this paper, we apply for the first time circular measures to segmented ERP and unsegmented EEG data from a repetition of the seminal dichotic tone detection experiment of Hillyard et al. who first described the N1-effect. In particular, we show that correlates of selective attention can be extracted from both data types by assessing the organization of the instantaneous phase. It is concluded that our study suggests a unified framework to analyze neural correlates of selective attention in ERPs and the ongoing EEG activity.

Effects of touch on emotional face processing: A study of event-related potentials, facial EMG and cardiac activity	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Emotion; EEG; ERP; EMG; Emotional faces; Touch; Non-verbal communication	VIRTUAL MIDAS TOUCH; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; INTERPERSONAL TOUCH; SENSITIVE N170; ERP; PERCEPTION; EXPRESSION; RESPONSES; COMPONENT; MIMICRY	Being touched is known to affect emotion, and even a casual touch can elicit positive feelings and affinity. Psychophysiological studies have recently shown that tactile primes affect visual evoked potentials to emotional stimuli, suggesting altered affective stimulus processing. As, however, these studies approached emotion from a purely unidimensional perspective, it remains unclear whether touch biases emotional evaluation or a more general feature such as salience. Here, we investigated how simple tactile primes modulate event related potentials (ERPs), facial EMG and cardiac response to pictures of facial expressions of emotion. All measures replicated known effects of emotional face processing: Disgust and fear modulated early ERPs, anger increased the cardiac orienting response, and expressions elicited emotion-congruent facial EMG activity. Tactile primes also affected these measures, but priming never interacted with the type of emotional expression. Thus, touch may additively affect general stimulus processing, but it does not bias or modulate immediate affective evaluation. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Spape, M.

Specifically, color can induce feelings (color attractiveness) and or the perception of some affordances ("color affordance") in users. Researchers define "color affordance" as the inducing of a certain behavior, perception or understandings in direct or indirect ways due to the color of an artifact. In order to know the amount of internal cognitive resources and information process speed that users experience, this study explores the effect of saturation/brightness variation on color attractiveness and "color affordance" by means of event-related potentials. The results of this study show that color attractiveness is influenced by its brightness, while, color affordance is involved in the cognitive process earlier than color attractiveness.

Some of the most studied components (i.e., P3 or MMN) have received more attention regarding the stability of their main parameters, such as latency, amplitude or topography. However, spectral modulations have not been as extensively evaluated considering that different analysis methods are available. The main aim of the present study is to assess the reliability of the latency, amplitude and topography of event-related desynchronization (ERD) for the alpha band (10-14 Hz) observed in a cognitive task (visual oddball). Topography reliability was analysed at different levels (for the group, within-subjects individually and between-subjects individually). Results The latency for alpha ERD showed stable behaviour between two sessions, and the amplitude exhibited an increment (more negative) in the second session. Alpha ERD topography exhibited a high correlation score between sessions at the group level (r = 0.903, p<0.001). The mean value for within-subject correlations was 0.750 (with a range from 0.391 to 0.954). Regarding between-subject topography comparisons, some subjects showed a highly specific topography, whereas other subjects showed topographies that were more similar to those of other subjects. Conclusion ERD was mainly stable between the two sessions with the exception of amplitude, which exhibited an increment in the second session. Topography exhibits excellent reliability at the group level; however, it exhibits highly heterogeneous behaviour at the individual level. Considering that the P3 was previously evaluated for this group of subjects, a direct comparison of the correlation scores was possible, and it showed that the ERD component is less reliable in individual topography than in the ERP component (P3).

Individual differences in EEG correlates of recognition memory due to DAT polymorphisms	BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						DAT; item memory; old; new effect; oscillations	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; LONG-TERM-MEMORY; EPISODIC MEMORY; THETA OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL DISSOCIATION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; POWER CHANGES	IntroductionAlthough previous research suggests that genetic variation in dopaminergic genes may affect recognition memory, the role dopamine transporter expression may have on the behavioral and EEG correlates of recognition memory has not been well established. ObjectivesThe study aims to reveal how individual differences in dopaminergic functioning due to genetic variations in the dopamine transporter gene influences behavioral and EEG correlates of recognition memory. MethodsFifty-eight participants performed an item recognition task. Participants were asked to retrieve 200 previously presented words while brain activity was recorded with EEG. Regions of interest were established in scalp locations associated with recognition memory. Mean ERP amplitudes and event-related spectral perturbations when correctly remembering old items (hits) and recognizing new items (correct rejections) were compared as a function of dopamine transporter group. ResultsParticipants in the dopamine transporter group that codes for increased dopamine transporter expression (10/10 homozygotes) display slower reaction times compared to participants in the dopamine transporter group associated with the expression of fewer dopamine transporters (9R-carriers). 10/10 homozygotes further displayed differences in ERP and oscillatory activity compared to 9R-carriers. 10/10 homozygotes fail to display the left parietal old/new effect, an ERP signature of recognition memory associated with the amount of information retrieved. 10/10 homozygotes also displayed greater decreases of alpha and beta oscillatory activity during item memory retrieval compared to 9R-carriers. ConclusionCompared to 9R-carriers, 10/10 homozygotes display slower hit and correct rejection reaction times, an absence of the left parietal old/new effect, and greater decreases in alpha and beta oscillatory activity during recognition memory. These results suggest that dopamine transporter polymorphisms influence recognition memory.

Abnormal self-schema in semantic memory in major depressive disorder: Evidence from event-related brain potentials	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Major depressive disorder; Semantic memory; Self-schema; Electroencephalography; Event-related potentials; Language	COGNITIVE THERAPY; POSITIVITY BIAS; DSM-IV; N400; BIOMARKERS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; COMPREHENSION; ACTIVATION; ATTENTION; MODEL	An overly negative self-schema is a proposed cognitive mechanism of major depressive disorder (MDD). Self - schema one's core conception of self, including how strongly one believes one possesses various characteristics - is part of semantic memory (SM), our knowledge about concepts and their relationships. We used the N400 event-related potential (ERP) elicited by meaningful stimuli, and reduced by greater association of the stimulus with preceding context to measure association strength between self-concept and positive, negative, and neutral characteristics in SM. ERPs were recorded from MDD patients = 16) and controls (n = 16) who viewed trials comprising a self-referential phrase followed by a positive, negative, or neutral adjective. Participants' task was to indicate via button-press whether or not they felt each adjective described themselves. Controls endorsed more positive adjectives than did MDD patients, but the opposite was true for negative adjectives. Patients had smaller N400s than controls specifically for negative adjectives, suggesting that MDD is associated with stronger than normal functional neural links between self-concept and negative characteristics in SM.

To help understand why, this study investigated the neural correlates of audiovisual synchrony judgments in older adults using electroencephalography (EEG). Fourteen younger (18-32 year old) and 16 older (61-74 year old) adults performed an audiovisual synchrony judgment task on flash-pip stimuli while EEG was recorded. All participants were assessed to have healthy vision and hearing for their age. Observers responded to whether audiovisual pairs were perceived as synchronous or asynchronous via a button press. The results showed that the onset of predictive sensory information for synchrony judgments was not different between groups. Channels over auditory areas contributed more to this predictive sensory information than visual areas. The spatial-temporal profile of the EEG activity also indicates that older adults used different resources to maintain a similar level of performance in audiovisual synchrony judgments compared with younger adults.

Further studies have revealed constructional prototype effects, both at the word level as well as for phrases. The present speech production study investigates the time course of these effects for the production of prepositional phrases in English, using event related potentials (ERPs). For word frequency, oscillations in the theta range emerged. By contrast, phrase frequency showed a persistent effect over time. Furthermore, independent effects with different temporal and topographical signatures characterized phrasal prototypicality. In a simulation study we demonstrate that naive discrimination learning provides an alternative account of the data that is as least as powerful as a standard lexical predictor analysis. The implications of the current findings for models of language processing are discussed.

Cerebral Dynamics during the Observation of Point-Light Displays Depicting Postural Adjustments	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography; superior temporal sulcus; point-light display; action observation; balance	BIOLOGICAL MOTION PERCEPTION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; REAL-WORLD EVENTS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; SEMANTIC INTEGRATION; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; MOTOR IMAGERY; BODY SWAY; RECOGNITION	Objective: As highly social creatures, human beings rely part of their skills of identifying, interpreting, and predicting the actions of others on the ability of perceiving biological motion. In the present study, we aim to investigate the electroencephalographic (EEG) cerebral dynamics involved in the coding of postural control and examine whether upright stance would be codified through the activation of the temporal-parietal cortical network classically enrolled in the coding of biological motion. Design: We registered the EEG activity of 12 volunteers while they passively watched point light displays (PLD) depicting quiet stable (QB) and an unstable (UB) postural situations and their respective scrambled controls (QS and US). In a pretest, 13 volunteers evaluated the level of stability of our two biological stimuli through a stability scale. Results: Contrasting QB vs. QS revealed a typical ERP difference in the right temporal-parietal region at an early 200-300 ms time window. Furthermore, when contrasting the two biological postural conditions, UB vs. QB, we found a higher positivity in the 400-600 ms time window for the UB condition in central parietal electrodes, lateralized to the right hemisphere. Conclusions: These results suggest that PLDs depicting postural adjustments are coded in the brain as biological motion, and that their viewing recruit similar networks with those engaged in postural stability control. Additionally, higher order cognitive processes appear to be engaged in the identification of the postural instability level. Disentangling the EEG dynamics during the observation of postural adjustments could be very useful for further understanding the neural mechanisms underlying postural control.

We used the event-related potential (EEG/ERP) technique to investigate the ability to automatically recognize a subtle difference between very similar novel contemporary dance movements. Twelve professional dancers and twelve non-dancers were shown 212 pairs of videos of complex whole body movements that lasted 3 s. The second of each pair was the repetition of the previous movement or a slight variation of it (deviance). The participants were engaged in a secondary attentional task. Modulation of a larger centro-parietal N400 effect and a reduction of the Late Positivity amplitude (repetition suppression effect) were identified in response to deviant stimuli only in the dancers. Source reconstruction (swLORETA) showed activations in biological motion, body and face processing related areas, and fronto-parietal and limbic systems. The current findings provide evidence that acquired dance expertise modifies the ability to visually code whole-body complex movements.

Data on the auditory duration mismatch negativity for different sound pressure levels and visual perceptual loads	DATA IN BRIEF			English	Article; Data Paper						Event-related potential; Mismatch negativity; Perceptual load; Sound pressure level		The data presented in this article are related to our research article entitled "Effects of sound pressure level and visual perceptual load on the auditory mismatch negativity" (M. Szychowska, R. Eklund, M.E. Nilsson, S. Wiens, 2016) [1]. The duration MMN was recorded at three sound pressure levels (SPLs) during two levels of visual perceptual load. In an oddball paradigm (standard = 75 ms, deviant = 30 ms, within-subjects design), participants were presented with tones at 56, 66, or 76 dB SPL (between-subjects design). At the same time, participants focused on a letter detection task (find X in a circle of six letters). In separate blocks, perceptual load was either low (the six letters were the same) or high (the six letters differed). In the first data collection, tones had only 76 dB SPL [2]. In a follow-up data collection with exactly the same procedure, tones had 56 and 66 dB SPL [1]. Here, we report the procedure, the recording of electroencephalography (EEG) and its preprocessing in terms of event-related potentials (ERPs), the preprocessing of behavioral data, as well as the grand mean ERPs in figures. For each participant, the reported ERP data include mean amplitudes for standards, deviants, and the difference wave (MMN) at Fz (with tip of nose as a reference), separately for the combinations of SPL and load. Reported behavioral data include the signal-detection measure d' as an index of detection performance. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier lnc.

J	Shtyrov, Y; Lenzen, M				Shtyrov, Yury; Lenzen, Maria			First-pass neocortical processing of spoken language takes only 30 msec: Electrophysiological evidence	COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Language; ERP (event-related potential); EEG (electroencephalography); P50 (P1); Lexical access; Word representation	AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; ULTRA-RAPID ACCESS; HUMAN BRAIN; CORTEX; SPEECH; MEG; COMPONENT; RESPONSES; SOUNDS; HUMANS	Fast real-time processing of external information by the brain is vital to survival in a highly dynamic environment. A ubiquitous information medium used by humans is spoken language, but the neural dynamics of its comprehension is still poorly understood. Here, we scrutinized the earliest electrophysiological activity elicited in the human brain by spoken words and matched meaningless word-like stimuli using a lexical auditory oddball paradigm, an established technique for investigating cortical activation patterns underlying early automatic stages of language processing. We show that the earliest cortical reflection of word comprehension takes place during the electrophysiological P1 evoked response, at about 30 ms following the word disambiguation point, and takes the form of an enhanced brain activation for familiar meaningful words, even when they are presented outside the focus of attention. This previously unknown ultra-early lexicality effect is underpinned by left temporo-frontal cortical circuits and likely reflects a first-pass automatic lexical access that precedes later stages of lexical and semantic processing described in previous literature. The results suggest that the brain operates with maximum speed and efficiency to extract meaningful (including linguistic) information from the sensory input, which is a neurobiological capacity essential for timely and appropriate reactions to external events.

The association between high levels of cumulative life stress and aberrant resting state EEG dynamics in old age	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Cognitive aging; Experienced stress; Electroencephalography (EEG); Delta power; Cognitive pathology	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; STAGE ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; LONGITUDINAL EEG; SOCIAL SUPPORT; HIPPOCAMPAL; DISORDER; DEMENTIA; MEMORY	Cumulative experienced stress produces shortcomings in old adults' cognitive performance. These are reflected in electrophysiological changes tied to task execution. This study explored whether stress-related aberrations in older adults' electroencephalographic (EEG) activity were also apparent in the system at rest. To this effect, the amount of stressful life events experienced by 60 young and 60 elderly participants were assessed in conjunction with resting state power changes in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequencies during a resting EEG recording. Findings revealed elevated levels of delta power among elderly individuals reporting high levels of cumulative life stress. These differed significantly from young high and low stress individuals and old adults with low levels of stress. Increases of delta activity have been linked to the emergence of conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment. Thus, a potential interpretation of our findings associates large amounts of cumulative stress with an increased risk of developing age-related cognitive pathologies in later life.

How to Reduce Classification Error in ERP-Based BCI: Maximum Relative Areas as a Feature for P300 Detection	ADVANCES IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, IWANN 2017, PT II	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	14th International Work-Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (IWANN)	JUN 14-16, 2017	Cadiz, SPAIN	Univ Granada, Univ Malaga, Polytechn Univ Catalonia		Brain Computer Interface; Event-related potentials; P300; Online; LDA	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; MENTAL PROSTHESIS; COMPETITION 2003; SPELLER; FATIGUE	Currently, one of the challenges in a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) technologies is the improvement real-time event-related potential (ERP) detection. Variability and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) impair detection methods. We hypothesized that if in a P300-based BCI we find the electrodes with the maximum relative voltage area (the "maximum relative" term refers to the area within each trial, but not between trials) where a P300 can be located, we will improve the performance of a classifier and reduce the number of trials necessary to achieve 100% success. We propose a method that calculates successively the maximum relative voltage areas in the P300 region of the EEG signal for each stimulus. In this way, differences between a target and a non-target stimulus are maximized. This method was tested with a linear classifier (LDA), known for its good performance and low computational cost. We observed that a single electrode with maximum relative voltage area in a P300 region can give more information than the traditional 4 electrode measurement. The preliminary results show that by detecting appropriate characteristics in the EEG signal, we can reduce the error by trial as well as the number of electrodes. The detection of the maximum relative voltage area in the EEG electrodes is a characteristic that can contribute to increase the SNR and decrease the prediction error with the smallest number of trials in the P300-based BCI systems. This type of methods that seek specific characteristics in the signals can also contribute to the management of the variability present in the BCI systems. This method can be used both for an online and offline analysis.

Spatiotemporal characteristics of the pharyngeal event-related potential in healthy subjects and older patients with oropharyngeal dysfunction	NEUROGASTROENTEROLOGY AND MOTILITY			English	Article						brain; deglutition disorders; evoked potentials; neurophysiology; pharynx	CEREBRAL CORTICAL REPRESENTATION; MOTOR CORTEX; SENSORY COMPONENTS; HUMAN BRAIN; STIMULATION; AGE; DYSPHAGIA; NERVE; SUPPLEMENTARY; CONNECTIVITY	BackgroundOropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) is a highly prevalent symptom in older people. Appropriate oropharyngeal sensory feedback is essential for safe and efficient swallowing. However, pharyngeal sensitivity decreases with advancing age and could play a fundamental role in the physiopathology of swallowing dysfunction associated with aging. We aimed to characterize pharyngeal sensitivity and cortical response to a pharyngeal electrical stimulus in healthy volunteers (HV) and older patients with and without OD. MethodsEight young HV, eight older HV without OD, and 14 older patients with OD were studied by electroencephalography through 32 scalp electrodes. Pharyngeal event-related potentials (ERP) were assessed following electrical stimulation of the pharynx. Sensory and tolerance thresholds to the electrical stimulus and latency, amplitude, and scalp current density of each ERP component were analyzed and compared. An ERP source localization study was also performed using the sLORETA software. Key ResultsOlder participants (with and without OD) presented an increased sensory threshold to pharyngeal electrical stimulation (10.21.7mA and 11.5 +/- 1.9mA respectively), compared with young HV (6.0 +/- 1.2mA). The cortical activation of older HV in response to pharyngeal electrical stimulus was reduced compared with young HV (N2 amplitude: 0.22 +/- 0.79 vs -3.10 +/- 0.59, P<.05). Older patients with OD also presented disturbances to the pharyngo-cortical connection together with disrupted pattern of cortical activation. Conclusions and InferencesOlder people present a decline in pharyngeal sensory function, more severe in older patients with OD. This sensory impairment might be a critical pathophysiological element and a potential target for treatment of swallowing dysfunction in older patients.

Behavioral data showed that professional drivers were slower and less sensitive in identifying notifications compared to their counterparts. Such differences can be difficult to interpret and frustrates the deployment of implementations from the laboratory to more realistic settings. Our EEG recordings of brain activity reveal that these differences were not due to differences in the detection and recognition of the notifications. Instead, it was due to differences in EEG activity associated with response generation. Thus, we show how measuring brain activity can deliver insights into how notifications are processed, at a finer granularity than can be afforded by behavior alone.

The Relation between Infant Covert Orienting, Sustained Attention and Brain Activity	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Infant covert orienting; Sustained attention; ERPs; Cortical source analysis	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PERIPHERAL STIMULUS LOCALIZATION; VISUAL-ATTENTION; CORTICAL SOURCES; SELECTION; LOCATION; SACCADES; SHIFTS; EEG; ERP	This study used measures of event-related potentials (ERPs) and cortical source analysis to examine the effect of covert orienting and sustained attention on 3- and 4.5-month-old infants' brain activity in a spatial cueing paradigm. Cortical source analysis was conducted with current density reconstruction using realistic head models created from age-appropriate infant MRIs. The validity effect was found in the P1 ERP component that was greater for valid than neutral trials in the electrodes contralateral to the visual targets when the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) was short. Cortical source analysis revealed greater current density amplitude around the P1 peak latency in the contralateral inferior occipital and ventral temporal regions for valid than neutral and invalid trials. The processing cost effect was found in the N1 ERP component that was greater for neutral than invalid trials in the short SOA condition. This processing cost effect was also shown in the current density amplitude around the N1 peak latency in the contralateral inferior and middle occipital and middle and superior temporal regions. Infant sustained attention was found to modulate infants' brain responses in covert orienting by enhancing the P1 ERP responses and current density amplitude in their cortical sources during sustained attention. These findings suggest that the neural mechanisms that underpin covert orienting already exist in 3- to 4.5-month-old, and they could be facilitated by infant sustained attention.

Two English consonants differing in place of articulation were selected: [labial]/b/and [coronal]/d/. It was assumed that the phonological representation of/d/contained less distinctive feature information due to its [coronal] place of articulation, as compared to/b/. English-speaking adults were presented with two syllables,/ba/anclida/, in an ERP oddball paradigm where both syllables served as the standard and deviant stimulus in opposite stimulus sets. Three types of analyses were conducted: traditional mean amplitude measurements, cluster-based permutation tests, and single-trial general linear model (GLM) analyses of group-level and single-subject data. The less specified/do/deviant elicited a large MMN while no MMN was elicited by the more specified deviant/ba/. Additionally, the/de/standard syllable elicited larger responses than did the/be/standard, while deviant syllables did not differ. This implies that the MMN was driven by responses elicited by the standards rather than the deviants. At the single-subject level, not all participants demonstrated significant MMN responses, though all had measurable differences between the standard syllables. Thus, to continue to propose that [coronal] underspecification is a language universal phenomenon, ERP indices other than the MMN should be examined. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ERN is an ERP component that is generated in the anterior cingulate cortex and peaks 60-150 ms after making an error response on a task. The amplitude of the ERN after making a mistake reflects individual differences in emotional traits and performance concerns. Past researchers have found that participants higher in perfectionistic doubts displayed larger ERN amplitudes; however, researchers have not yet differentiated between type of perfectionism (i.e., adaptive or maladaptive) in relation to ERN. Additionally, previous researchers have found affective processes are reflected in ERN, but have not yet examined whether differences in ERN could be influenced by EIQ. Participants in the present study were 34 adults who responded to surveys and completed a computerized ERN paradigm utilizing a flanker task while neural activity was recorded using EEG. The paradigm was designed to elicit a high error rate, thereby allowing capture and measurement of the ERN component. ANOVA results indicated maladaptive perfectionists had the greatest negativity, followed by adaptive perfectionists, followed by nonperfectionists. ANOVA results indicated individuals with high EIQ had lower ERN than individuals with low EIQ. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It employs the classification of event-related potential to control the equipment rather than using language or limb movement. Currently, one of the most important issues for ERP-based BCIs is that the ERP classification performance degrades when the training number of samples is small. In order to solve this problem, semi-supervised regularized discriminant analysis (SRDA) was proposed to extract features and classify ERP patterns by integrating semi-supervised learning and regularization approach. The labeled data was used to maximize the separability between different classes and calculate the within-class covariance matrix by regularization. The labeled and unlabeled data were employed to construct the penalty term by neighbor graph. Our proposed approach was evaluated on the BCI Competition Challenge Dataset and the simulation results indicated that it achieved a better accuracy than the traditional algorithms.

A direct comparison of both components is challenging because of the huge discrepancy in experimental designs and stimulus choice between language and 'classic' P300 experiments. In the present study, we develop a new approach to mimic the interplay of sequential position as well as categorical and relational information in natural language syntax (word category and agreement) in a non-linguistic target detection paradigm using musical instruments. Participants were instructed to (covertly) detect target tones which were defined by instrument change and pitch rise between subsequent tones at the last two positions of four-tone sequences. We analysed the EEG using event-related averaging and time-frequency decomposition. Our results show striking similarities to results obtained from linguistic experiments. We found a P300 that showed sensitivity to sequential position and a late positivity sensitive to stimulus type and position. A time-frequency decomposition revealed significant effects of sequential position on the theta band and a significant influence of stimulus type on the delta band. Our results suggest that the detection of non-linguistic targets defined via complex feature conjunctions in the present study and the detection of syntactic anomalies share the same underlying processes: attentional shift and memory based matching processes that act upon multi-feature conjunctions. We discuss the results as supporting domain-general accounts of the P600 during natural language comprehension. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Event-related potentials (ERPs), especially the negative component around and after 400 ms, are related to language processing and could therefore represent a complementary method of language lateralization assessment. Methods: Scalp EEG was recorded from 64 locations in 36 epilepsy patients and 37 controls during three visually presented language tasks: A short-term language memory task (differentiation memorized vs. unknown words), a phonological task (detection of rhymes in word pairs), and a semantic decision task (differentiation words vs. pseudowords). ERPs were analyzed in the 300 ms-800 ms epoch. Language fMRI was routinely obtained in patients. Results: ERPs were significantly more negative over the left compared to the right hemisphere in all three tasks in patients and controls. Laterality indices showed highest concordance with fMRI for the Word/Pseudoword Task. Conclusions: ERPs of language processing were lateralized to the left hemisphere in the majority of epilepsy patients and controls. In patients, single-subject laterality indices showed high concordance with fMRI results. Significance: Results indicate that scalp-derived ERPs are a promising tool to investigate lateralization of language function in epilepsy patients.

At 18 months of age, half of the infant population typically shows signs of self-recognition in the classic mirror test. The current study examined the functional neural correlates of the perception of self in infancy. Eighteen-month-old infants observed photographs of their own face, the face of an unfamiliar infant, the face of their caregiver, and the face of an unfamiliar caregiver, while their EEG was registered. The results show that infants show an enhanced response to their own face compared to other faces. The N290, an established face-selective ERP component in infants, was larger for observation of their own face compared to others' faces. In addition to the EEG task, the mirror test was administered. Half of the infants in our sample recognized themselves in the mirror. However, there were no differences in the ERP responses between the infants who did and did not recognize themselves in the mirror. This suggests that a distinction between the neural response to self and to others does not necessarily express itself in self-recognition behavior.

However, existing investigations of cortical oscillatory responses in stereoscopic depth perception are quite rare. Therefore, we investigated spatiotemporal and spatio-temporo-spectral features at four different stereoscopic depths within the comfort zone. We adopted a simultaneous EEG/MEG acquisition technique to collect the oscillatory responses of eight participants. We defined subject-specific retinal disparities and designed a single trial-based stereoscopic viewing experimental paradigm. In the group analysis, we observed that, as the depth increased from Level 1 to Level 3, there was a time-locked increase in the N200 component in MEG and the P300 component in EEG in the occipital and parietal areas, respectively. In addition, initial alpha and beta event-related desynchronizations (ERD) were observed at approximately 500 to 1000 msec, while theta, alpha, and beta event-related synchronizations (ERS) appeared at approximately 1000 to 2000 ms. Interestingly, there was a saturation point in the increase in cognitive responses, including N200, P300, and alpha ERD, even when the depth increased only within the comfort zone. Meanwhile, the magnitude of low beta ERD decreased in the dorsal pathway as depth increased. From these findings, we concluded that cognitive responses are likely to become saturated in the visual comfort zone, while perceptual load may increase with depth.

FPGA implementation of wavelet coherence for EEG and ERP signals	MICROPROCESSORS AND MICROSYSTEMS			English	Article						Event related potential (ERP); Electroencephalogram (EEG); Field programmable gate array (FPGA); Image quality; Wavelet coherence (WC)	TRANSFORM	This paper presents the design and implementation of wavelet coherence (WC) processor on low cost field-programmable gate array (FPGA). This design is adapted to estimate the wavelet coherence between two EEG signals in a minimal delay in order to support real time applications. The produced CWT coefficients were saved in static RAM chips and prepared for the WC analysis starting with the smoothing operation as an essential computation for the WC algorithm. The WC algorithm was analyzed in the means of choosing the suitable word length for the stages of the design and to simplify the employed functions in the algorithm. Several controllers that handle signal transmission among the design components were designed using hardware description language (VHDL). By using 4 parallel-processing smoothing circuits, the design is capable to calculate the coherogram between two EEG signals (1024 point each) in a total time of 128.64 ms. Image quality methods were applied for coherogram comparison between hardware and software. Hardware results were compared against the rigorous software standard WC according to the following measures; normalized mean square error (NMSE), normalized average difference (NAD) and structural content (SC) are 0.0045, 0.0485 and 0.921 respectively.

The Error Related Potentials serve as a passive correction mechanism that originates directly from the user's brain. In this paper we propose a novel approach to spatial filtering, based on a supervised variant of Collaborative Representation Projections (CRP) offering a more discriminant representation of electroencephalography signals for detecting Error Related Potentials. This new approach enhances the detectability of Error Related Potentials by projecting the spatial information of signals into a new space where samples of the same class tend to form local neighborhoods. Moreover, the limitations under which the Error Related Potentials positively contribute to the performance of a SSVEP-based BCI are explored. For this reason we also provide a new methodology, namely Inverse Correct Response Time (ICRT), that reliably captures the trade-off, between the gain of the automated error detection and the induced time delay of a BCI system that potentially incorporates Error Related Potentials.

There is a lack in the worldwide literature of reports on the Neuromarkers of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in patients after bilateral hand amputation The aim of this study was to test a hypothesis regarding developing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in a patient after bilateral hand amputation with the use of Event Related Potentials (ERPs). On the basis of previous research, the amplitudes of P3 ERP components elicited in the cued GO/NOGO tasks have been chosen as candidates for neuromarkers of PTSD. Case study. A 24-year-old patient had undergone bilateral hand amputation 12 months previously. The patient was repeatedly operated on (he had undergone successful bilateral hand replantation) and despite the severity of the injuries, he recovered. However, the patient complained of flashbacks, anxiety and sleep difficulties. Specialist tests showed the presence of PTSD. The patient participated in the cued GO/NOGO task (Kropotov, 2009) with recording 19-channel EEG. P3 GO and NOGO waves in this task were found to be significantly smaller, in comparison to a group of healthy control subjects of the same age (N=23) taken from the HBI normative database (https://www.hbimed.com/). This observed pattern of ERP waves in the patient corresponds to the pattern found in PTSD patients. Conclusions. ERPs in a GO/NOGO task can be used in the assessment of the functional brain changes induced by chronic PTSD.

However, it still remains unclear when and how a cortical system integrates and retains information across sensory modalities during learning. Here we investigated the neural dynamics underlying crossmodal associations and memory by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) when human participants performed visuotactile (crossmodal) and visuo-visual (unimodal) paired associate (PA) learning tasks. In a trial of the tasks, the participants were required to explore and learn the relationship (paired or non-paired) between two successive stimuli. EEG recordings revealed dynamic ERP changes during participants' learning of paired-associations. Specifically, (1) the frontal N400 component showed learning-related changes in both unimodal and crossmodal tasks but did not show any significant difference between these two tasks, while the central P400 displayed both learning changes and task differences; (2) a late posterior negative slow wave (LPN) showed the learning effect only in the crossmodal task; (3) alpha-band oscillations appeared to be involved in cross modal working memory. Additional behavioral experiments suggested that these ERP components were not relevant to the participants' familiarity with stimuli per se. Further, by shortening the delay length (from 1300 ms to 400 ms or 200 ms) between the first and second stimulus in the cross modal task, declines in participants' task performance were observed accordingly. Taken together, these results provide insights into the cortical plasticity (induced by PA learning) of neural networks involved in crossmodal associations in working memory. (C) 2017 IBRO.

The current study investigated whether information regarding the general desirability (`Wanting') of visually presented 'everyday' objects was rapidly and automatically processed. Participants completed a foreground task while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded, and task-irrelevant images were presented in the background. Following this, participants rated the images with regards to Wanting and the potentially related attributes of Relevance, Familiarity, Aesthetic Pleasantness and Time Reference. Multivariate pattern classification was used to predict the ratings from patterns of EEG data. Prediction of Wanting and Relevance was possible between 100 and 150 ms following stimulus presentation. The other dimensions could not be predicted. Wanting and Relevance ratings were highly correlated and displayed similar feature weight maps. The current results suggest that the general desirability and subjective relevance of everyday objects is rapidly and automatically processed for a wide range of visual stimuli.

Participants up- and down-regulated emotional responses using cognitive reappraisal to low and high arousing unpleasant pictures while the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Up-regulation resulted in more negative self-reported valence, while down-regulation resulted in less negative self-reported valence regardless of stimulus arousal, suggesting that subjective reappraisal success does not vary with emotional intensity. Participants felt that down-regulation of emotional responses to low arousing unpleasant pictures was easiest, which is in line with previous findings that participants showed a greater preference for reappraisal in low than high arousing situations. The late positive potential (LPP) amplitude was enhanced by down-regulation of high arousing unpleasant pictures. Even though this effect was unexpected and is opposite to the typical effect of down-regulation on the LPP, it is in line with several previous studies. Potential explanations for LPP regulation effects in the unexpected direction, such as strategy selection and task design, are evaluated. Suggestions and recommendations for future research are discussed, including using trial-by-trial manipulation of regulation instructions and studying the effect of stimulus arousal on up- and down-regulation of positive emotions.

It was shown that motor imagery involving distal muscles, e.g. finger movements, results in contralateral ERD correlating with increased excitability of the contralateral corticospinal tract (c-CST). Following the rationale that purposefully increasing c-CST excitability might facilitate motor recovery after stroke, ERD recently became an attractive target for brain-computer interface (BCI)-based neurorehabilitation training. It was unclear, however, whether ERD would also reflect excitability of the ipsilateral corticospinal tract (i-CST) that mainly innervates proximal muscles involved in e.g. shoulder movements. Such knowledge would be important to optimize and extend ERD-based BCI neurorehabilitation protocols, e.g. to restore shoulder movements after stroke. Here we used single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) targeting the ipsilateral primary motor cortex to elicit motor evoked potentials (MEPs) of the trapezius muscle. To assess whether ERD reflects excitability of the i-CST, a correlation analysis between between MEP amplitudes and ipsilateral ERD was performed. Methods: Experiment 1 consisted of a motor execution task during which 10 healthy volunteers performed elevations of the shoulder girdle or finger pinching while a 128-channel EEG was recorded. Experiment 2 consisted of a motor imagery task during which 16 healthy volunteers imagined shoulder girdle elevations or finger pinching while an EEG was recorded; the participants simultaneously received randomly timed, single-pulse TMS to the ipsilateral primary motor cortex. The spatial pattern and amplitude of ERD and the amplitude of the agonist muscle's TMS-induced MEPs were analyzed. Results: ERDs occurred bilaterally during both execution and imagery of shoulder girdle elevations, but were lateralized to the contralateral hemisphere during finger pinching. We found that trapezius MEPs increased during motor imagery of shoulder elevations and correlated with ipsilateral ERD amplitudes. Conclusions: Ipsilateral ERD during execution and imagery of shoulder girdle elevations appears to reflect the excitability of uncrossed pathways projecting to the shoulder muscles. As such, ipsilateral ERD could be used for neurofeedback training of shoulder movement, aiming at reanimation of the i-CST.

Typically, in the P300 BCI paradigm the subjects' attention to the exact stimulus is caused by their practical interest to this stimulus, researcher's instructions or deviance of this stimulus (its clear distinction from other stimuli). In this work we investigate the properties of perception of stimuli with subjective emotional significance presented in oddball-paradigm. We also research the possibility of using P300 BCI for detection of covert focuses of attention. Hypothetically, this technology can be used for testing the person's ability of the emotional stimuli perception, which could be applied for the instrumental diagnostics of accentuated conditions or emotional perception disorders like autism. This study on 14 healthy subjects showed that the accuracy of the passively presented emotional stimuli recognition (without the stimuli discrimination task) significantly exceeded the random level more than twice. We also found out the characteristic features of the ERP components evoked by the various images and under the conditions of low and high level of attention to the presented stimuli. The obtained results prove the hypothesis that P300 BCI paradigm can be used to detect covert attentional focuses to the external stimuli and complete the existing findings of the brain mechanisms responsible for the unconscious perception of the subjectively significant stimuli.

We used concurrent TMS-EEG to directly test for hemispheric differences in causal influences of the right and left intraparietal cortex on visual event related potentials (ERPs). We stimulated the left and right posterior part of intraparietal sulcus (IPS1) while the participants were viewing and rating the visibility of bilaterally presented Gabor patches. Subjective visibility ratings showed that TMS of right IPS shifted the visibility toward the right hemifield, while TMS of left IPS did not have any behavioral effect. TMS of right IPS, but not left one, reduced the amplitude of posterior N1 potential, 180-220 ms after stimulus-onset. The attenuation of N1 occurred bilaterally over the posterior areas of both hemispheres. Consistent with previous TMS-fMRI studies, this finding suggests that the right IPS has top down control on the neural processing in visual cortex. As N1 most probably reflects reactivation of early visual areas, the current findings support the view that the posterior parietal cortex in the right hemisphere amplifies recurrent interactions in ventral visual areas during the time-window that is critical for conscious perception.

Pressure pain tolerance, electrical pain detection thresholds, pain ratings to repetitive suprathreshold electrical stimulation (SES) and conditioned pain modulation (CPM) were assessed in 18 patients with acute LBP and 18 healthy control participants. Furthermore, event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to repetitive SES were obtained from high-density electroencephalography. Results showed that the LBP group presented lower pressure pain tolerance and higher pain ratings to SES compared with the control group. Both groups displayed effective CPM, with no differences in CPM magnitude between groups. Both groups presented similar reductions in ERP amplitudes during CPM, but ERP responses to repetitive SES were significantly larger in the LBP group. In conclusion, acute LBP patients presented enhanced pain facilitatory mechanisms, whereas no significant changes in pain inhibitory mechanisms were observed. These results provide new insight into the central mechanisms underlying acute LBP. Perspective: This article present evidence that acute LBP patients show enhanced pain facilitation and unaltered pain inhibition compared with pain-free volunteers. These results provide new insight into the central mechanisms underlying acute LBP.

Anxiety and neural responses to infant and adult faces during pregnancy	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Anxiety; Pregnancy; EEG/ERP; Face perception	SOCIAL ANXIETY; DEPRESSION; POSTPARTUM; DISORDERS; MOTHERS; THREAT; BASES; ERP	Women are vulnerable to anxiety during pregnancy and postpartum. However, little is known about antenatal anxiety and neural processing of infant-relevant information. In this experiment, the N170, P300, and LPP (late positive potential) event-related potentials were measured from 43 pregnant women as they viewed infant and adult faces, which were either neutral or distressed in expression. Mother's self reported anxiety levels were also assessed. The N170 was comparable across face conditions and was not associated with anxiety. However, our central finding was that greater levels of antenatal anxiety were associated with a larger LPP, but only for neutral infant faces. Results suggest that antenatal anxiety may result in deeper processing of neutral, emotionally ambiguous, infant faces during pregnancy. These findings are discussed in light of other work indicating an interpretive bias toward threat in response to neutral stimuli in anxiety. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To better comprehend the processing of empathic pain, we report the frequency-dependent modulation of cortical oscillations induced by watching movies depicting pain using high-density electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and motor evoked potentials (MEP). Methods: Event-related desynchronization of EEG and MEG was assessed while participants viewed videos of painful (needle) or neutral (cotton swab) situations. The amplitudes of MEPs were also compared between the needle and cotton swab conditions. Results: The degree of suppression in alpha/beta band power was significantly increased, whereas that of. band power was significantly decreased, in the needle condition compared with the cotton swab condition. EEG revealed that significant differences in alpha/beta band were distributed in the right frontocentral and left parietooccipital regions, whereas significant. band differences were distributed predominantly over the right hemisphere, which were confirmed by source estimation using MEG. There was a significant positive correlation between the difference in. power of the two conditions and the visual analog scale subjective rating of aversion, but not in the alpha/beta band. The amplitude of MEPs decreased in the needle condition, which confirmed the inhibition of the primary motor cortex. Conclusion: MEP suppression supports that modulation of cortical oscillations by viewing movies depicting pain involves sensorimotor processing. Our results suggest that alpha/beta oscillations underlie the sensory qualities of others' pain, whereas the. band reflects the cognitive aspect. Therefore, alpha/beta and. band oscillations are differentially involved in empathic pain processing under the condition of motor cortical suppression.

Intranasal oxytocin and the neural correlates of infant face processing in non-parent women	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Intranasal oxytocin; Infant; Face processing; EEG/ERP	RESPONSES; MOTHERS; BRAIN; EXPRESSION; BASES	Event-related potentials (ERPs) have been widely employed to identify different stages of face processing, with recent research probing the neural dynamics of adult's processing of infant faces. Infant faces represent a salient category of visual stimuli, especially in parents, likely prioritized for processing through activity of the oxytocinergic system. Here we employed a randomized, double-blind, and within-subject crossover study of 24 nonparent women to examine the impact of intranasal oxytocin administration, relative to placebo, on processing infant and adult faces. Our main finding was that, relative to placebo, the P300 ERP elicited by infant faces was greater than the P300 elicited by adult faces in the oxytocin condition. Therefore, oxytocin administration may enhance the allocation of attention towards infant cues, even in non-parent women.	[Rutherford, Helena J.

After a concise historical overview and a schematic of the hearing mechanisms, experimental studies on music listeners and on music performers are discussed, starting with the presentation of characteristic musical stimuli and the basic features of tomographic imaging of emotional activation in the brain, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), which offer high spatial resolution in the millimeter range. The progress in correlating activation imaging in the brain to the psychological understanding of music-evoked emotion is demonstrated and some prospects for future research are outlined. Research in psychoneuroendocrinology and molecular markers is reviewed in the context of music-evoked emotions and the results indicate that the research in this area should be intensified. An assessment of studies involving measuring techniques with high temporal resolution down to the 10ms range, as, e.g., electroencephalography (EEG), event-related brain potentials (ERP), magnetoencephalography (MEG), skin conductance response (SCR), finger temperature, and goose bump development (piloerection) can yield information on the dynamics and kinetics of emotion. Genetic investigations reviewed suggest the heredity transmission of a predilection for music. Theoretical approaches to musical emotion are directed to a unified model for experimental neurological evidence and aesthetic judgment. Finally, the reports on musical therapy are briefly outlined. The study concludes with an outlook on emerging technologies and future research fields.

Impulsive personality dimensions are associated with altered behavioral performance and neural responses in the monetary incentive delay task	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Impulsivity; Monetary incentive delay (MID) task; Event-related potential (ERP); Feedback-related negativity (FRN); P3 component; Late positive component (LPC)	FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; DRUG-ABUSE VULNERABILITY; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; SENSATION-SEEKING; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; DECISION-MAKING; REWARD SENSITIVITY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; RASH IMPULSIVENESS; PREDICTION ERRORS	Individual differences in dimensions of impulsivity personality including disinhibition and sensation seeking modulate approach responses to reinforcing stimuli, such as drugs and money. The current study examined the effects of monetary incentive on both behavioral performance and electrophysiological activity among individuals varying in disinhibition and sensation seeking. The monetary incentive delay (MID) task was completed under electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. Behavioral data showed that higher disinhibition and sensation-seeking were associated with lower performance accuracy. Event-related potential (ERP) data showed that high reinforcement cues elicited a larger late positive component (LPC) than other conditions among high disinhibition participants, indicating its strong emotional influence. Additionally, in the neutral incentive condition, the feedback-related negativity (FRN) elicited by correct outcomes was larger than that elicited by incorrect outcomes in the high disinhibition group only. This novel finding indicates that high disinhibition participants were less likely to expect correct outcomes compared to incorrect outcomes in the neutral incentive condition. Finally, the P3 component elicited by outcome presentation showed an interaction between two impulsivity dimensions; when disinhibition level was low, the P3 was larger among high than low sensation seeking participants.

The neural underpinning of sustained attentional control processes involves a fronto-parietal network. However, it has not been well-defined yet whether this cortical circuit acts irrespective of the specific material to be monitored and whether this mediates sustained as well as transient monitoring processes. In the current study, the functional activity of brain during an event monitoring task was investigated and compared between two cognitive domains, whose processing is mediated by differently lateralized areas. Namely, participants were asked to monitor sequences of either faces (supported by right-hemisphere regions) or tools (left-hemisphere). In order to disentangle sustained from transient components of monitoring, a simultaneous EEG-fMRI technique was adopted within a block design. When contrasting monitoring versus control blocks, the conventional fMRI analysis revealed the sustained involvement of bilateral fronto-parietal regions, in both task domains. Event-related potentials (ERPs) showed a more positive amplitude over frontal sites in monitoring compared to control blocks, providing evidence of a transient monitoring component. The joint ERP-fMRI analysis showed that, in the case of face monitoring, this transient component relies on right-lateralized areas, including the inferior parietal lobule and the middle frontal gyrus. In the case of tools, no fronto-parietal areas correlated with the transient ERP activity, suggesting that in this domain phasic monitoring processes were masked by tonic ones. Overall, the present findings highlight the role of bilateral fronto-parietal regions in sustained monitoring, independently of the specific task requirements, and suggest that right-lateralized areas subtend transient monitoring processes, at least in some task contexts.

In addition, neural activity, measured with electroencephalograms (EEGs), was recorded while participants completed the IRAP. On some blocks of trials, participants were required to respond quickly and accurately in a pro-White and anti-Black manner, whereas on other blocks they were required to respond in the opposite manner (anti-White or pro-Black). The difference in response latencies between these two types of trials provided an index of racial bias, and event-related potentials (ERPs), derived from the EEG signals, provided a simultaneous measure of brain activity during these responses. Results revealed anti-Black and pro-White biased responding on the IRAP in terms of differential response latencies. In addition, greater positivity in the ERP signals located in the frontal sites was recorded when participants responded in a pro-Black or anti-White pattern relative to a pro-White or anti-Black pattern. These results are broadly consistent with those of previous literature in the area and suggest that the IRAP is a potentially useful methodology for research in the field of affective neuroscience.

The relation between probability and potentials has been discussed by using a quantity called surprise that represents the self-information that humans receive from the event. Previous studies have estimated surprise based on the probability distribution in a stationary state. Our hypothesis is that state transitions also play an important role in the estimation of surprise. In this study, we compare the effects of surprise on the ERPs based on two models that generate an event sequence: a model of a stationary state and a model with state transitions. To compare these effects, we generate the event sequences with Markov chains to avoid a situation that the state transition probability converges with the stationary probability by the accumulation of the event observations. Our trial-by-trial model-based analysis showed that the stationary probability better explains P3b component and the state transition probability better explains the P3a component. The effect on P3a suggests that the internal model, which is constantly and automatically generated by the human brain to estimate the probability distribution of the events, approximates the model with state transitions because Bayesian surprise, which represents the degree of updating of the internal model, is highly reflected in P3a. The global effect reflected in P3b, however, may not be related to the internal model because P3b depends on the stationary probability distribution. The results suggest that an internal model can represent state transitions and the global effect is generated by a different mechanism than the one for forming the internal model.

J	Meyberg, S; Sommer, W; Dimigen, O				Meyberg, Susann; Sommer, Werner; Dimigen, Olaf			How microsaccades relate to lateralized ERP components of spatial attention: A co-registration study	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Fixational eye movements; Posner cueing; Visual search; EDAN; N2pc; ADAN	SACCADE TARGET SELECTION; COVERT VISUAL-ATTENTION; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; EYE-MOVEMENTS; CROSSMODAL LINKS; SHIFTS; VISION; GAZE; EEG; POTENTIALS	Covert shifts of attention that follow the presentation of a cue are associated with lateralized components in the event-related potential (ERP): the "early directing attention negativity" (EDAN) and the "anterior directing attention negativity" (ADAN). Traditionally, these shifts are thought to take place while gaze is fixated and, thus, in the absence of saccades. However, microsaccades of small amplitude ( < 1 degrees) occur frequently and involuntarily also during fixation and are closely correlated with spatial attention. To investigate potential links between microsaccades and lateralized ERP components, we simultaneously recorded eye movements and ERPs in a spatial cueing task. As a first major result, we show that both the posterior EDAN and the orientation of microsaccades align more strongly with the location of the task-relevant part of the cue stimulus than with the direction of the attention shift indicated by that cue. A coupling between microsaccades and EDAN was also present on the single-trial level: The EDAN was largest when microsaccades were oriented toward the relevant cue, but absent when microsaccades were oriented away from it, suggesting that EDAN and microsaccades are generated by the same neural network, which selects relevant stimuli and orients behavior toward them. As a second major result, we show that small corneoretinal artifacts from microsaccades, which fall below conventional EOG rejection thresholds, contaminate the measurement of the ADAN. After correcting the EEG for microsaccade-related artifacts with an optimized variant of independent component analysis, ADAN was abolished at frontal sites, but a genuine ADAN was still present at central sites. Thus, the combined measurement of microsaccades and lateralized ERPs sheds new light onto cue-elicited shifts of covert attention.

Don't touch me! autistic traits modulate early and late ERP components during visual perception of social touch	AUTISM RESEARCH			English	Article						autistic traits; interpersonal touch; ERP; LPP; P1	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; NEGATIVITY BIAS; ALPHA-RHYTHM; RESPONSES; ANXIETY; FACES; EXTRASTRIATE	Although individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have impaired responses to interpersonal touch, the underlying neural correlates remain largely unknown. Here, we examined the neural correlates that underlie interpersonal touch perception in individuals with either high or low autistic traits. Fifty-three participants were classified as having either high or low autistic traits based on their performance on the autism quotient (AQ) questionnaire. We hypothesized that individuals with high AQ scores would have relatively high touch hypervigilance, reflected as earlier P1 and stronger late positive potential (LPP) responses, two components of event-related potentials that serve as electrophysiological markers of anxiety bias. We recorded each participant's electroencephalography activity during presentation of images depicting human touch, object touch, and non-touch control images. Consistent with our hypothesis, AQ scores were positively correlated with social touch aversion. Moreover, participants with high AQ scores had earlier P1 and stronger LPP responses when presented with human touch compared to the control images. Importantly, a regression model revealed that earlier P1 and larger LPP amplitude measured during social touch observation can accurately predict higher autistic trait levels. Taken together, these findings indicate that individuals with high levels of autistic traits may have a hypervigilant response to observed social touch. Autism Res2017, 0: 000-000.

However, it is a matter of debate as to the contributions of high and low spatial frequency (HSF and LSF) information for visual word recognition. This study examined the role of different spatial frequencies in visual word recognition using event-related potential (ERP) masked priming. EEG was recorded from 32 scalp sites in 30 English-speaking adults in a go/no-go semantic categorization task. Stimuli were white characters on a neutral gray background. Targets were uppercase five letter words preceded by a forward-mask (#######) and a 50 ms lowercase prime. Primes were either the same word (repeated) or a different word (un-repeated) than the subsequent target and either contained only high, only low, or full spatial frequency information. Additionally within each condition, half of the prime-target pairs were high lexical frequency, and half were low. In the full spatial frequency condition, typical ERP masked priming effects were found with an attenuated N250 (sublexical) and N400 (lexical-semantic) for repeated compared to un-repeated primes. For HSF primes there was a weaker N250 effect which interacted with lexical frequency, a significant reversal of the effect around 300 ms, and an N400-like effect for only high lexical frequency word pairs. LSF primes did not produce any of the classic ERP repetition priming effects, however they did elicit a distinct early effect around 200 ms in the opposite direction of typical repetition effects. HSF information accounted for many of the masked repetition priming ERP effects and therefore suggests that HSFs are more crucial for word recognition. However, LSFs did produce their own pattern of priming effects indicating that larger scale information may still play a role in word recognition.

Each phenomenal difference must be supported by some neurophysiological differences. Differentiation analysis aims to quantify neurophysiological differentiation evoked by a given set of stimuli to assess its meaningfulness to the individual observer. As a proof of concept using high-density EEG, we show increased neurophysiological differentiation for a set of natural, meaningfully different images in contrast to another set of artificially generated, meaninglessly different images in nine participants. Stimulus-evoked neurophysiological differentiation ( over 257 channels, 800 ms) was systematically greater for meaningful vs. meaningless stimulus categories both at the group level and for individual subjects. Spatial breakdown showed a central-posterior peak of differentiation, consistent with the visual nature of the stimulus sets. Temporal breakdown revealed an early peak of differentiation around 110 ms, prominent in the central-posterior region; and a later, longer-lasting peak at 300-500 ms that was spatially more distributed. The early peak of differentiation was not accompanied by changes in mean ERP amplitude, whereas the later peak was associated with a higher amplitude ERP for meaningful images. An ERP component similar to visual-awareness-negativity occurred during the nadir of differentiation across all image types. Control stimulus sets and further analysis indicate that changes in neurophysiological differentiation between meaningful and meaningless stimulus sets could not be accounted for by spatial properties of the stimuli or by stimulus novelty and predictability.

However, the neural basis of this phenomenon, called duration adaptation, remains unclear. In this study, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate whether duration adaptation could modulate the subsequent temporal encoding represented by the contingent negative variation (CNV). Participants were asked to reproduce the duration of a test stimulus after adapting duration (Experiment 1) or after anchor duration (Experiment 2). We found that both adapting duration and anchor duration affected the reproduction duration of a subsequently presented test stimulus. The simultaneously recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) revealed that test stimuli evoked clearly identifiable Ni, P2 and CNV components in the fronto-central scalp. Further analyses showed that the CNV amplitude was modulated by duration adaptation: adaptation to shorter duration (200 ms) increased whereas adaptation to longer duration (800 ms) decreased the CNV amplitude. These findings suggest that the neural correlates of temporal encoding represented by the CNV amplitude reflect the duration aftereffect. Additionally, the duration adaptation effect observed on the P2 component also suggests an early expectancy effect on subsequent encoding processes. Finally, no effect of anchor duration was observed on the CNV amplitude, which implies that different mechanisms underlie the duration aftereffect and the anchor effect.

However, few studies have investigated the three-stage model of humor processing with readers' surprise, comprehensibility and funniness levels, and little discussion has been devoted to its biological underpinning. To verify the credibility of the three-stage model, electroencephalography (EEG) was utilized in corroboration with two types of stimuli including jokes and non-jokes in the present research. Participants were categorized into high vs. low score groups based on their rating scores of surprise, comprehension, and funniness to joke stimuli. The between-group analyses showed that compared with the less surprised group, highly surprised people elicited a primarily larger N400, which may suggest more incongruity perceived in reading jokes. Additionally, good comprehenders mainly elicited a larger P600, probably indicating a more successful resolution of detected incongruity in comparison with poor comprehenders. Finally, the highly amused group elicited a larger late positive potential (LPP) compared with the less amused group, which could reflect more affective elaboration of jokes. Participants' surprise, comprehension, and funniness levels had smaller impacts on other chief electrophysiological components, with the effects varying with different group contrasts. These results provided the evidence that different degrees of surprise, comprehensibility, and amusement to jokes would influence the three sub-stages (incongruity detection, incongruity resolution, and elaboration) respectively in humor processing. The current study thus generally re-verified the stability of the three-stage model through participants' behavioral ratings which had seldom been touched upon. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Event-related potentials index neural response to eye contact	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Eye-contact; EEG; N170; Face processing	AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER; BIOLOGICAL MOTION PERCEPTION; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; FACE PERCEPTION; ERP EVIDENCE; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ENDOPHENOTYPE CONCEPT; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; SOCIAL ATTENTION; SELF-FACE	Sensitivity to eye-contact is a foundation upon which social cognition is built. However, there are no known neural markers characterizing response to reciprocal gaze. Using co-registered EEG and eye-tracking, we measured brain activity while participants viewed faces that responded to their looking patterns. Contingent upon participant gaze, onscreen faces opened their eyes or mouths; in this way we measured brain response to reciprocal eye-contact. We identified two ERP components that were largest in response to reciprocal eye-contact: the N170 and the P300. The magnitude of the components' differences between reciprocal eye-contact and mouth movement predicted self-reported social function. Individuals with greater brain response to reciprocal eye-contact reported more normative scores on measures of autistic traits. These results present the first neural markers of eye-contact, revealing that reciprocal eye-contact is identified in less than 500 ms. Furthermore, individual differences in brain response to eye-contact predict meaningful variability in self-reports of social performance.

Evaluation of cortical local field potential diffusion in stereotactic electro-encephalography recordings: A glimpse on white matter signal	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Epilepsy; Stereotactic electroencephalography; White matter; Gray matter; Intracranial reference; Brain state	HUMAN INTRACRANIAL RECORDINGS; MASS UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED RESPONSES; SUBDURAL ELECTRODES; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; FOCAL EPILEPSY; BRAIN NETWORKS; GLOBAL SIGNAL; SODIUM-PUMP; PHASE	While there is a strong interest in meso-scale field potential recording using intracranial electroencephalography with penetrating depth electrodes (i.e. stereotactic EEG or S-EEG) in humans, the signal recorded in the white matter remains ignored. White matter is generally considered electrically neutral and often included in the reference montage. Moreover, re-referencing electrophysiological data is a critical preprocessing choice that could drastically impact signal content and consequently the results of any given analysis. In the present stereotactic electroencephalography study, we first illustrate empirically the consequences of commonly used references (subdermal, white matter, global average, local montage) on inter-electrode signal correlation. Since most of these reference montages incorporate white matter signal, we next consider the difference between signals recorded in cortical gray matter and white matter. Our results reveal that electrode contacts located in the white matter record a mixture of activity, with part arising from the volume conduction (zero time delay) of activity from nearby gray matter. Furthermore, our analysis shows that white matter signal may be correlated with distant gray matter signal. While residual passive electrical spread from nearby matter may account for this relationship, our results suggest the possibility that this long distance correlation arises from the white matter fiber tracts themselves (i.e. activity from distant gray matter traveling along axonal fibers with time lag larger than zero); yet definitive conclusions about the origin of the white matter signal would require further experimental substantiation. By characterizing the properties of signals recorded in white matter and in gray matter, this study illustrates the importance of including anatomical prior knowledge when analyzing S-EEG data.

Non-linear features can provide extra information about phase space. The Event-Related Potential (ERP) signals were recorded from 49 subjects who participated in concealed face recognition test. For feature extraction, at first, several morphological characteristics, frequency bands, and wavelet coefficients (we call them basic-features) are extracted from each single-trial ERP. Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) measures are then computed as non-linear features from each single-trial. We apply Genetic Algorithm (GA) to select the best feature set and this feature set is used for classification of data using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier. Next, we use a new approach to improve classification results based on introducing an adaptive threshold. Results indicate that our method is able to correctly detect 91.83% of subjects (45 correct detection of 49 subjects) using combination of basic and non-linear features, that is higher than 87.75% for basic and 79.59% for non-linear features. This shows that combination of non-linear and basic-features could improve classification rate.	[Mehrnam, A. H.; Nasrabadi, A.

Its conditions of appearance before terminal external error information suggest that the Ne/ERN is indicative of predictive processes in the evaluation of errors. The aim of the present study was to specifically examine the Ne/ERN in a complex motor task and to particularly rule out other explaining sources of the Ne/ERN aside from error prediction processes. To this end, we focused on the dependency of the Ne/ERN on visual monitoring about the action outcome after movement termination but before result feedback (action effect monitoring). Participants performed a semi-virtual throwing task by using a manipulandum to throw a virtual ball displayed on a computer screen to hit a target object. Visual feedback about the ball flying to the target was masked to prevent action effect monitoring. Participants received a static feedback about the action outcome (850 ms) after each trial. We found a significant negative deflection in the average EEG curves of the error trials peaking at similar to 250 ms after ball release, i.e., before error feedback. Furthermore, this Ne/ERN signal did not depend on visual ball-flight monitoring after release. We conclude that the Ne/ERN has the potential to indicate error prediction in motor tasks and that it exists even in the absence of action effect monitoring. NEW & NOTEWORTHY In this study, we are separating different kinds of possible contributors to an electroencephalogram (EEG) error correlate (Ne/ERN) in a throwing task. We tested the influence of action effect monitoring on the Ne/ERN amplitude in the EEG. We used a task that allows us to restrict movement correction and action effect monitoring and to control the onset of result feedback. We ascribe the Ne/ERN to predictive error processing where a conscious feeling of failure is not a prerequisite.

The EEG data were recorded when nineteen healthy human participants were performing a simplified category-based induction task. The ERP results showed that: in the subordinate conclusion condition, the basic premise elicited a larger N400, versus the superordinate promise; in the basic conclusion condition, the superordinate promise elicited a larger P300 relative to both the basic premise and subordinate premise; in the superordinate conclusion condition, however, no difference was found between different promise. Furthermore, the process that reasoning from a higher level to a lower level evoked a larger P300, compared to it did in the reverse direction. The divergent evidence suggested that category-based induction at superordinate, basic, and subordinate levels might be affected by various factors, such as abstract level, direction, and distance between premise and conclusion, which yielded new insights into the neural underpinnings of category-based induction with different inductive strengths.

For MI BCI, training a user is a difficult and time-consuming task This study aims at finding the pattern of Event-related Potentials, by which we can improve the training process, during training MI users. We designed the experiments, acquired the EEG signals and analyzed them during the periods when the subjects were executing the training trials and when they completed the training trials. The results show that the obvious potential patterns that are related to small probability events exist in the both situations and the elicited potentials on frontal lobe are commonly stronger than ones on other brain areas. We speculate that Attention Mechanism is deeply involved in the process of MI training. The finding would underlie our future work intending to develop the new MI training means and algorithm.

Here, we studied the possibility to elicit cortical responses in newborns by simple passive hand movements. Methods: We examined 13 newborns (postnatal age 1-46 days) during clinically indicated 19-channel electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in the neonatal intensive care unit; EEG indications included birth asphyxia and suspected epileptic seizures. The experimenter moved the infant's wrist or fingers at 1 or 2 Hz for 5-10 min, separately on both sides. We measured movement kinematics with an accelerometer attached to the infant's hand and computed coherence between the EEG and acceleration signals (corticokinematic coherence, CKC). Results: Statistically significant CKC (amplitude 0.020-0.511) with characteristic scalp topography was observed in all infants at twice the movement frequency. CKC was contralaterally dominant on the central scalp (median laterality index 0.48 for right-hand and -0.63 for left-hand movements). Conclusions: Passive movements elicit cortical responses that can be readily observed in clinical EEG recordings from newborns in the intensive-care environment.

Although the behavior of humans in this task is already well established, the underlying brain processes remain poorly understood. Previous investigations using event-related potentials (ERPs) revealed three major components related to cognitive processes in participants engaged in the responder condition, the early ERP component P2, the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and a late positive wave (late positive component, LPC). However, the comparison of the ERP waveforms between the responder and proposer conditions has never been studied. Therefore, to investigate conditionrelated electrophysiological changes, we applied the UG paradigm and compared parameters of the P2, LPC and FRN components in twenty healthy participants. For the responder condition, we found a significantly decreased amplitude and delayed latency for the P2 component, whereas the mean amplitudes of the LPC and FRN increased compared to the proposer condition. Additionally, the proposer condition elicited an early component consisting of a negative deflection around 190 ms, in the upward slope of the P2, probably as a result of early conflict-related processing. Using independent component analysis (ICA), we extracted one functional component time-locked to this deflection, and with source reconstruction (LAURA) we found the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as one of the underlying sources. Overall, our findings indicate that intensity and time-course of neuronal systems engaged in the decisionmaking processes diverge between both UG conditions, suggesting differential cognitive processes. Understanding the electrophysiological bases of decision-making and social interactions in controls could be useful to further detect which steps are impaired in psychiatric patients in their ability to attribute mental states (such as beliefs, intents, or desires) to oneself and others. This ability is called mentalizing (also known as theory of mind).	[Horat, Sibylle K.; Merlo, Marco C.

Previous studies were inconclusive about the temporal dynamics of involved neurocognitive processes during proactive and reactive motor control. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we investigated the time-course of proactive and reactive inhibition, measuring event-related oscillations and event-related potentials (ERPs). Participants performed in a cued go/nogo paradigm with cues indicating whether the motor response might or might not have to be inhibited. Based on the dual mechanisms of control (DMC) framework by Braver, we investigated the role of attentional effects, motor preparation in the sensorimotor cortex and prefrontal cognitive control mechanisms, separating effects before and after target onset. In the cue-target interval, proactive motor inhibition was associated with increased attention, reflected in reduced visual alpha power and an increased contingent negative variation (CNV). At the same time, motor inhibition was modulated by reduced sensorimotor beta power. After target onset, proactive inhibition resulted in an increased N1, indicating allocation of attention towards relevant stimuli, increased prefrontal beta power and a modulation of sensorimotor mu activity. As in previous studies, reactive stopping of motor actions was associated with increased prefrontal beta power and increased sensorimotor beta activity. The results stress the relevance of attentional mechanisms for proactive inhibition and speak for different neurocognitive mechanisms being involved in the early preparation for and in later implementation of motor inhibition.

Specifically, participants viewed and rated pictures of various goods on the extent to which they wanted each item, which they could potentially purchase afterwards. Using the event-related potentials (ERP) method, we found that variations in subjective preferences for consumer goods strongly modulated positive slow waves (PSW) from 800 to 3000 milliseconds after stimulus onset. We also found that subjective preferences modulated the N200 and the late positive potential (LPP). In addition, we found that both PSW and LPP were modulated by subsequent buying decisions. Overall, these findings show that well-known brain event-related potentials reflecting selective attention processes can reliably index preferences to consumer goods in a shopping environment. Based on a large body of previous research, we suggest that early ERPs (e.g. the N200) to consumer goods could be indicative of preferences driven by unconditional and automatic processes, whereas later ERPs such as the LPP and the PSW could reflect preferences built upon more elaborative and conscious cognitive processes.

Therefore, attentional selection is modulated by expectations regarding behavior of others (Perez-Osorio, Muller, Wiese, & Wykowska, 2015). In this article, we examinedusing the ERPs of the EEG signalwhich stages of processing are influenced by expectations about others' action steps. We used a paradigm in which a gaze-cueing procedure was embedded in successively presented naturalistic photographs composing an action sequence. Our results showed (a) behavioral gaze-cueing effects modulated by whether the observed agent gazed at an object that was expected to be gazed at, according to the action sequence; (b) the N1 component locked to the onset of a target was modulated both by spatial gaze validity and participants' expectations about where the agent would gaze to perform an action; (c) a more positive amplitude, locked to the shift of gaze direction for action-congruent gaze, relative to incongruent and neutral conditionsover parieto-occipital areas in the time window between 280 and 380 ms. Taken together, these findings revealed that confirmation or violation of expectations concerning others' goal-oriented actions modulate attentional selection processes, as indexed by early ERP components.

In particular, functional connectivity of brain mechanisms underlying disturbed cognition in depression is still not well understood in current neuroscience research. Based on the Stroop paradigm, specifically, the face-word Stroop task, we aimed to analyze task-based electroencephalography (EEG) functional connectivity in subjects with depression and in healthy controls, using concepts from time series clustering. In this study, EEG signals of 10 healthy subjects and 10 depressive patients were collected. Then EEG signals were segmented into temporal window corresponding to the event-related potentials (ERPs). For each duration, hierarchical clustering (HC) along with optimizations for the dynamic time warping (DTW) were employed to identify meaningful functionally connected regions and examine changes in depression. It was demonstrated that our method had the potential to become a useful tool for clinical investigators to identify the underlying impairments of brain functional connections in the patients with depression. One of the most representative functional connections obtained in the present study indicated that during the N450 component, the left and right frontal brain parts may discriminate depressive patients from healthy controls.

However, it remains unclear how the speech signal is transformed and represented in the brain at different stages of the auditory pathway. In this study, we characterized electroencephalography responses to continuous speech by obtaining the time-locked responses to phoneme instances (phoneme-related potential). We showed that responses to different phoneme categories are organized by phonetic features. We found that each instance of a phoneme in continuous speech produces multiple distinguishable neural responses occurring as early as 50 ms and as late as 400 ms after the phoneme onset. Comparing the patterns of phoneme similarity in the neural responses and the acoustic signals confirms a repetitive appearance of acoustic distinctions of phonemes in the neural data. Analysis of the phonetic and speaker information in neural activations revealed that different time intervals jointly encode the acoustic similarity of both phonetic and speaker categories. These findings provide evidence for a dynamic neural transformation of low-level speech features as they propagate along the auditory pathway, and form an empirical framework to study the representational changes in learning, attention, and speech disorders.

Beyond the "Bereitschaftspotential": Action preparation behind cognitive functions	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Review						MRCP; ERP; Cognitive action control; Pre-motor cognition; EEG; BP; pN	MOVEMENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES; EXTERNALLY TRIGGERED MOVEMENTS; PRECEDING VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AEROBIC FITNESS; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; REACTION-TIME	Research on preparatory brain processes taking place before acting shows unexpected connections with cognitive processing. From 50 years, we know that motor-related brain activity can be measured by electrocortical recordings 1-3 s before voluntary actions. This readiness potential has been associated with increasing excitably of premotor and motor areas and directly linked to the kinematic of the upcoming action. Now we know that the mere motor preparation is only one function of a more complex preparatory activity. Recent research shows that before any action many cognitive processes may occur depending on various aspects of the action, such as complexity, meaning, emotional valence, fatigue and consequences of the action itself. In addition to studies on self-paced action, the review considers also studies on externally-triggered paradigms showing differences in preparation processes related to age, physical exercise, and task instructions. Evidences from electrophysiological and neuroimaging recording indicate that in addition to the motor areas, the prefrontal, parietal and sensory cortices may be active during action preparation to anticipate future events and calibrate responses.

The electrophysiology of neuroHIV: A systematic review of EEG and MEG studies in people with HIV infection since the advent of highly-active antiretroviral therapy	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						HIV; Central nervous system infections; HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders; Electroencephalography; Magnetoencephalography	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; CORTICAL SOURCES; NEUROCOGNITIVE DISORDERS; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; SUBSTANCE DEPENDENCE; FAMILY-HISTORY; OLDER-ADULTS; BRAIN; RHYTHMS	Objective: The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has an impact on the brain, even when the infection is well-controlled with modern highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). While dementia is rare in those on HAART, milder cognitive impairment is common. The causes, patterns, and evolution of brain dysfunction in people living with HIV remain uncertain. We evaluate whether electrophysiological methods provide informative measures of brain dysfunction in this population. Methods: A systematic literature search identified studies that used EEG or MEG to evaluate persons living with HIV published between 1996 (when HAART became available) and 2016. Results: Twenty-eight studies were identified. Most involved small samples, and all but four were cross-sectional. Reduced amplitude of Event Related Potentials and decreased power in the alpha band at rest were the most frequent differences between people with and without HIV infection. Of the 16 studies that also assessed cognitive ability, 13 found a significant relationship between cognition and electrophysiological changes in the HIV+ groups. Five of those studies also reported a significant relationship with current immunosuppression, suggesting a direct effect of HIV on the brain. There were few longitudinal studies; whether these electrophysiological changes progress over time, or respond to treatment, remains unclear. Conclusions: EEG and MEG can provide useful information about brain dysfunction in people with HIV infection, but more consistent assessments of both cognition and EEG patterns, as well as longitudinal studies with larger, better characterized samples are needed.

The electrophysiological event-related (ERP) spatio-temporal dynamic has been repetitively investigated in referential word production, but the different designs, settings and analyses do not allow to conclude on the reliability of the microstate sequences across studies and individuals. Here the inter-studies and inter-individual consistency of sequences of scalp topographies were analysed in the ERP data of 118 individuals from five different oral picture naming studies. Averaging the individual ERP data across studies or across random groups yielded the same sequences of microstates, except in two periods of low topographic consistency (in the first 75 ms following picture presentation-C1 VEP component-and in the N170 time-window). In the other time-periods highly consistent patterns of 5 distinct microstates appeared up to 100 ms before the vocal response across studies and individuals. This same sequence of dominant scalp maps also explained a similar proportion of variance in a new dataset of 19 individual ERPs. The observed consistency of microstate sequences across picture naming studies constitutes the premise for the interpretation of the periods of quasi-stable global scalp potentials in terms of mental processes in referential word production but also for the study of deviant neurophysiological patterns in language impaired populations.

Pain Processing in a Social Context and the Link with Psychopathic Personality Traits-An Event-Related Potential Study	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electrophysiology; ERP; pain; psychopathy; empathy	EVOKED-POTENTIALS; NEURAL RESPONSES; ERROR-DETECTION; ERP COMPONENTS; OTHERS PAIN; EMPATHY; EXPERIENCE; ATTENTION; SYSTEM; CORTEX	Empathy describes the ability to understand another person's feelings. Psychopathy is a disorder that is characterized by a lack of empathy. Therefore, empathy and psychopathy are interesting traits to investigate with respect to experiencing and observing pain. The present study aimed to investigate pain empathy and pain sensitivity by measuring event-related potentials (ERPs) extracted from the ongoing EEG in an interactive setup. Each participant fulfilled subsequently the role of "villain" and "victim". In addition, mode of control was modulated resulting in four different conditions; passive villain, active villain, active victim and passive victim. Response-, visual-and pain ERPs were compared between the four conditions. Furthermore, the role of psychopathic traits in these outcomes was investigated. Our findings suggested that people experience more conflict when hurting someone else than hurting themselves. Furthermore, our results indicated that self-controlled pain was experienced as more painful than uncontrolled pain. People that scored high on psychopathic traits seemed to process and experience pain differently. According to the results of the current study, social context, attention and personality traits seem to modulate pain processing and the empathic response to pain in self and others. The within-subject experimental design described here provides an excellent approach to further unravel the influence of social context and personality traits on social cognition.

Recently, Event Related Potentials (ERPs) of Electroencephalograph (EEG) have garnered great attention from the researchers for their application in the task of vigilance assessment. However, till date the studies related to ERPs and their association with vigilance are in their nascent stage, and requires more rigorous research efforts. In this paper, we use P200 and N200 ERPs of EEG for studying vigilance. For this purpose, we perform Mackworth's clock test experiment with ten volunteers and measure their accuracy. From the measured accuracy and recorded EEG signals, we identify that amplitude of P200 and N200 ERPs is directly correlated with accuracy and thereby to vigilance task. Thus, both P200 and N200 ERPs can be applied to detect vigilance (in real-time) of people involved in continuous monitoring tasks.

We examined whether violation of non-local dependencies manifest in event related potentials (ERP) for Western and Iranian excerpts by recording EEG while participants passively listened to sequences of modified/original excerpts. We also investigated oscillatory and synchronization properties of brain responses during processing of hierarchical structures. For the Western excerpt, subjective ratings of conclusiveness were marginally significant and the difference in the ERP components fell short of significance. However, ERP and behavioral results showed that while listening to culturally familiar music, subjects comprehended whether or not the hierarchical syntactic structure was fulfilled. Irregularities in the hierarchical structures of the Iranian excerpt elicited an early negativity in the central regions bilaterally, followed by two later negativities from 450-700 to 750-950 ms. The latter manifested throughout the scalp. Moreover, violations of hierarchical structure in the Iranian excerpt were associated with (i) an early decrease in the long range alpha phase synchronization, (ii) an early increase in the oscillatory activity in the beta band over the central areas, and (iii) a late decrease in the theta band phase synchrony between left anterior and right posterior regions. Results suggest that rhythmic structures and melodic fragments, representative of Iranian music, created a familiar context in which recognition of complex non-local syntactic structures was feasible for Iranian listeners. Processing of neural responses to the Iranian excerpt indicated neural mechanisms for processing of hierarchical syntactic structures in music at different levels of cortical integration.

Central and Divided Visual Field Presentation of Emotional Images to Measure Hemispheric Differences in Motivated Attention	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Divided visual field; lateral presentation; event-related potentials; motivated attention; emotion; valence and arousal	BRAIN POTENTIALS; PERCEPTION; LATERALIZATION; PARADIGM; STIMULI	Two dominant theories on lateralized processing of emotional information exist in the literature. One theory posits that unpleasant emotions are processed by right frontal regions, while pleasant emotions are processed by left frontal regions. The other theory posits that the right hemisphere is more specialized for the processing of emotional information overall, particularly in posterior regions. Assessing the different roles of the cerebral hemispheres in processing emotional information can be difficult without the use of neuroimaging methodologies, which are not accessible or affordable to all scientists. Divided visual field presentation of stimuli can allow for the investigation of lateralized processing of information without the use of neuroimaging technology. This study compared central versus divided visual field presentations of emotional images to assess differences in motivated attention between the two hemispheres. The late positive potential (LPP) was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) methodologies to assess motivated attention. Future work will pair this paradigm with a more active behavioral task to explore the behavioral impacts on the attentional differences found.

There is increasing interest in using deep ConvNets for end-to-end EEG analysis, but a better understanding of how to design and train ConvNets for end-to-end EEG decoding and how to visualize the informative EEG features the ConvNets learn is still needed. Here, we studied deep ConvNets with a range of different architectures, designed for decoding imagined or executed tasks from raw EEG. Our results show that recent advances from the machine learning field, including batch normalization and exponential linear units, together with a cropped training strategy, boosted the deep ConvNets decoding performance, reaching at least as good performance as the widely used filter bank common spatial patterns (FBCSP) algorithm (mean decoding accuracies 82.1% FBCSP, 84.0% deep ConvNets). While FBCSP is designed to use spectral power modulations, the features used by ConvNets are not fixed a priori. Our novel methods for visualizing the learned features demonstrated that ConvNets indeed learned to use spectral power modulations in the alpha, beta, and high gamma frequencies, and proved useful for spatially mapping the learned features by revealing the topography of the causal contributions of features in different frequency bands to the decoding decision. Our study thus shows how to design and train ConvNets to decode task-related information from the raw EEG without handcrafted features and highlights the potential of deep ConvNets combined with advanced visualization techniques for EEG-based brain mapping.

This paper deals with design of an experiment investigating driver's attention, validation of collected data, and first preprocessing and processing steps used within data analysis. Brain activity is considered as a primary biosignal and is measured and analyzed using the techniques and methods of electroencephalography and event related potentials. Respiration is considered as a secondary biosignal that is captured together with brain activity. Validation of collected data using a stacked autoencoder is emphasized as an important step preceding data analysis.

Electrophysiological studies have reliably identified event-related potential (ERP) markers for evaluative feedback processing during PM: the Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN) and P3 components. The functional significance of FRN remains debated in the literature, with recent research suggesting that feedback's goal relevance can account for FRN (amplitude) modulation, apart from its valence or expectedness alone. Extending this account, the present study assessed whether graded differentiations in feedback's relevance or importance to one's goal (referred to as goal impact) would influence PM at the FRN (and P3) level. To this end, we ran a within-subject crossover design experiment in which 40 participants completed two standard cognitive control tasks (Go/No Go and Simon), while 64-channel electroencephalography was recorded. Critically, both tasks entailed similar reward processing but systematically varied in goal impact assignment (high vs. low), manipulated through their supposed diagnosticity for daily life functioning and activation of social comparison. ERP results showed that goal impact reliably modulated FRN in a general manner. Irrespective of feedback valence, it was overall less negative in the high compared to the low impact condition, suggesting a general decrease in feedback monitoring in the former compared to the latter condition. These findings lend support to the idea that PM is best conceived operating not solely based on motor cues, but is shaped by motivational demands.

Indeed, drug addicts prefer immediate rewards at the expense of future interests. Assessing the neurocognitive basis of decision-making related to drug dependence, combining event-related potential (ERP) analysis and source localization techniques, may provide new insights into understanding decision-making deficits in drug addicts and further guide withdrawal treatment. In this study, EEG was performed in 20 abstinent heroin addicts (AHAs) and 20 age-, education- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) while they participated in a simple two-choice gambling task (99 vs. 9). Our behavioral results showed that AHAs tend to select higher-risk choices compared with HCs (i.e., more "99" choices than "9"). ERP results showed that right hemisphere preponderance of stimulus-preceding negativity was disrupted in AHAs, but not in HCs, Feedback-related negativity of difference wave was higher in AHAs than HCs, with the P300 amplitude associated with risk magnitude and valence. Using source localization that allows identification of abnormal brain activity in consequential cognitive stages, including the reward expectation and outcome evaluation stages, we found abnormalities in both behavioral and neural responses on gambling in AHAs. Taken together, our findings suggest AHAs have risk-prone tendency and dysfunction in adaptive decision making, since they continue to choose risky options even after accruing considerable negative scores, and fail to shift to a safer strategy to avoid risk. Such abnormal decision-making bias to risk and immediate reward seeking may be accompanied by abnormal reward expectation and evaluation in AHAs, which explains their high risk-seeking and impulsivity.

Cognitive changes in PD are less observable than motor symptoms; thus, research on cognitive processes, which are known to be impaired from the early stages of PD, is minimal. The purpose of this study is to research the brain dynamics of cognitively normal PD patients and healthy elderly controls using event-related potentials (ERPs) and to evaluate their relationships with neuropsychological tests. Methods: Eighteen cognitively normal PD patients and 18 age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy controls were included in the study. Detailed neuropsychological tests were applied to all participants. Electroencephalography (EEG) was performed according to the international 10-20 system, and a classical visual oddball paradigm was used in the experiments. ERP responses in the 0.5 to 25 Hz frequency range were examined. P300 amplitude and latency values were measured from the F-3, F-z, F-4, C-3, C-z, C-4, P-3, P-z, P-4, O-1, O-z, and O-2 electrode sites. In addition, the correlations between P300 responses and neuropsychological test scores were analyzed. Results: Significant differences were found between the P300 amplitudes of cognitively normal PD patients and healthy elderly controls [F-(1,F-31)= 9.265; p=0.005]. P300 amplitudes were significantly lower for PD patients at the F-3, F-Z, C-z, C-4, P-z, and P-4 electrode sites than for healthy elderly controls. Moderate correlations were found between Stroop test score and P-4 amplitude, digit span forward and C-3 and P-z amplitude, and digit span backward and O-1 amplitude. Conclusion: The major finding of this study was the detection of cognitive changes by electrophysiological methods in PD patients who were indicated to be cognitively normal by neuropsychological tests. These finding suggests that cognitive changes in PD patients, which are not yet reflected in neuropsychological tests, may be detected by electrophysiological methods in earlier stages.

These stimuli are repeated several times to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and only one evoked potential is estimated inside the temporal window of interest. Consequently, the average estimation does not take into account other neural responses within the same epoch that are due to short inter stimuli intervals. These adjacent neural responses may overlap and distort the evoked potential of interest. This overlapping process is a significant issue for the eye fixation-related potential (EFRP) technique in which the epochs are time-locked on the ocular fixations. The inter fixation intervals are not experimentally controlled and can be shorter than the neural response's latency. To begin, the Tikhonov regularization, applied to the classical average estimation, was introduced to improve the SNR for a given number of trials. The generalized cross validation was chosen to obtain the optimal value of the ridge parameter. Then, to deal with the issue of overlapping, the general linear model (GLM), was used to extract all neural responses inside an epoch. Finally, the regularization was also applied to it. The models (the classical average and the GLM with and without regularization) were compared on both simulated data and real datasets from a visual scene exploration in co-registration with an eye-tracker, and from a P300 Speller experiment. The regularization was found to improve the estimation by average for a given number of trials. The GLM was more robust and efficient, its efficiency actually reinforced by the regularization.

Event Related Potentials Index Rapid Recalibration to Audiovisual Temporal Asynchrony	FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						audio-visual; multisensory; temporal; recalibration; EEG; plasticity	WINDOW; INTEGRATION; ACCUMULATION; EXPOSURE; SIGNAL	Asynchronous arrival of multisensory information at the periphery is a ubiquitous property of signals in the natural environment due to differences in the propagation time of light and sound. Rapid adaptation to these asynchronies is crucial for the appropriate integration of these multisensory signals, which in turn is a fundamental neurobiological process in creating a coherent perceptual representation of our dynamic world. Indeed, multisensory temporal recalibration has been shown to occur at the single trial level, yet the mechanistic basis of this rapid adaptation is unknown. Here, we investigated the neural basis of rapid recalibration to audiovisual temporal asynchrony in human participants using a combination of psychophysics and electroencephalography (EEG). Consistent with previous reports, participant's perception of audiovisual temporal synchrony on a given trial (t) was influenced by the temporal structure of stimuli on the previous trial (t-1). When examined physiologically, event related potentials (ERPs) were found to be modulated by the temporal structure of the previous trial, manifesting as late differences (> 125 ms post second-stimulus onset) in central and parietal positivity on trials with large stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs). These findings indicate that single trial adaptation to audiovisual temporal asynchrony is reflected in modulations of late evoked components that have previously been linked to stimulus evaluation and decision-making.

EEG was obtained from N = 21 ASD and N = 16 TDC. Task performance, visual (P100, N170) and cognitive (late positive potential) event-related-potentials, as well as coherence were compared across groups. TDC showed a task-dependent increase and a stronger lateralization of P100 amplitude during the explicit task and task-dependent modulation of intra-hemispheric coherence in the beta band. In contrast, the ASD group showed no task dependent modulation. Results indicate disruptions in early visual processing and top-down attentional processes as contributing factors to FER deficits in ASD.

Previous studies have established that drugs affect EEG characteristics in humans and rodents in a similar manner. However, there has been little work to establish correlations between drug effects on behavioral and EEG characteristics in rats. In the current study, we have simultaneously monitored EEG characteristics during a novel object recognition task (NORT) or open field (OF) test in rats. EEG was monitored using telemetric device from epidural and hippocampal regions during the choice trial in the NORT after treatment with scopolamine (0.1mg/kg, intraperitoneal) alone or in combination with donepezil (0.3mg/kg, subcutaneous). Power changes across spectral frequency bands during exploration of novel and familiar object were assessed separately. Amphetamine (2mg/kg, intraperitoneal) was used to monitor effects on locomotor activity and EEG changes in the OF test. In the NORT, scopolamine impaired object recognition, but no differences were observed in the power densities across spectral bands during exploration of novel and familiar objects. Treatment with donepezil reversed scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment, and the power density in the theta frequency band was increased during exploration of the novel object. In OF, amphetamine increased locomotion and produced an overall decrease in the power densities of all frequency bands. Overall, the results indicate that EEG characteristics are closely related to behavioral changes in the NORT and OF in rodents.

However, it is unclear how the strengthened S-R associations are represented and applied in the brain. We investigated with a between-subjects PC paradigm of the Hedge and Marsh task using electroencephalography (EEG). The behavioral results showed the reversal of the conflict effects, suggesting that task-irrelevant S-R associations were strengthened and used to prepare responses. The EEG results revealed the PC-related reversal of the conflict effects in the frontocentral N2 and parietal P3b amplitudes. Time-frequency analyses showed more pronounced PC-related reversal of the conflict effects in theta band (4-8 Hz) activity in frontocentral sites. These results suggest that the strengthened S-R associations due to PC manipulation modulated cognitive control. Importantly, the amplitude of lateralized readiness potential was higher in the high-PC condition than in the low-PC condition, suggesting that the strengthened short-term-memory spatial S-R associations that modulated cognitive control were applied similarly to long-term-memory spatial S-R associations.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a clinical condition characterized by emotional dysregulation and enhanced sensitivity to affective and social cues. In this study we wanted to investigate the temporal-spatial dynamics of spontaneous gaze processing in BPD. We used a 2-back-working-memory task, in which neutral faces with direct and averted gaze were presented. Gaze was used as an emotional modulator of event-related-potentials to faces. High density EEG data were acquired in 19 females with BPD and 19 healthy women, and analyzed with a spatio-temporal microstates analysis approach. Independently of gaze direction, BPD patients showed altered N170 and P200 topographies for neutral faces. Source localization revealed that the anterior cingulate and other prefrontal regions were abnormally activated during the N170 component related to face encoding, while middle temporal deactivations were observed during the P200 component. Post-task affective ratings showed that BPD patients had difficulty to disambiguate neutral gaze. This study provides first evidence for an early neural bias toward neutral faces in BPD independent of gaze direction and also suggests the importance of considering basic aspects of social cognition in identifying biological risk factors of BPD.

In particular, neuronal habituation processes have been shown to be altered in FXS patients. Yet, while such deficits have been primarily explored using auditory stimuli, less is known in the visual modality. Here, we investigated the putative alteration of repetition suppression using faces in FXS patients compared to controls that had the same age distribution. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were acquired while participants were presented with 18 different faces, each repeated ten times successively. The repetition suppression effect was probed by comparing the brain responses to the first and second presentation, based on task-evoked event related potentials (ERP) as well as on task-induced oscillatory activity. We found different patterns of habituation for controls and patients both in ERP and oscillatory power. While the N170 was not affected by face repetition in controls, it was altered in FXS patients. Conversely, while a repetition suppression effect was observed in the theta band (4-8 Hz) over frontal and parieto-occipital areas in controls, it was not seen in FXS patients. These results provide the first evidence for diminished ERP and oscillatory habituation effects in response to face repetitions in FXS. These findings extend previous observations of impairments in learning mechanisms and may be linked to deficits in the maturation processes of synapses caused by the mutation. The present study contributes to bridging the gap between animal models of synaptic plasticity dysfunctions and human research in FXS.

Endogenous spatial attention directed to intracutaneous electrical stimuli on the forearms involves an external reference frame	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Spatial attention; Reference frame; EEG; Crossed hands; Intracutaneous electrical stimuli	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SENSORY MODULATIONS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; MEMORY PROCESSES; PREMOTOR THEORY; ERP COMPONENTS; POWER SPECTRA; TACTILE; EEG; BRAIN	In the present study, we examined whether the direction of attention while anticipating intracutaneous electrical stimuli on the left or right forearm occurs within an internal somatotopic or an external body-based reference frame. Participants placed their hands on a table in front of them in a normal position or in a crossed-hands position. A symbolic cue with a validity of 80% instructed participants to attend to either the left or the right side, which varied from trial to trial. Crossing the hands induces a conflict of internal and external reference frames which allows to determine the dominating reference frame(s). Analyses of the electroencephalogram (EEG) during the orienting phase revealed that crossing the arms did not induce a reversal of neural activity over central sites as a late direction attention-related positivity and increased ipsilateral alpha power over occipital and central sites was observed in both conditions. Hand position influenced the processing of the electrical stimuli as no effect of cue validity was observed on the P3a component in the crossed-hands position. Our results indicate that endogenous spatial attention to intracutaneous electrical stimuli primarily occurs within an external reference frame.	[Blom, Jorian H. G.; Van der Lubbe, Rob H.

Practical goals of NF systems include treatment of neurological disorders, and even augmentation of normal brain function. Attention deficits are a class of disorders to which NF-based therapy is applicable. Here we review the challenges of NF implementations for the control and treatment of visual attention. These implementations generate close-loop feedback using electroencephalographic (EEG) and other recording methods that sample brain signals related to different aspects of attention. Despite the progress achieved in the studies of neural mechanisms of attention, extraction of information representing attention from brain activity is still a difficult problem because of the presence of other overlapping neural signals. Therefore, it is important that attentional NF systems employ behavioral tasks and computational algorithms that dissociate signals of interest from the interfering signals. Notwithstanding recent advancements in this field, fundamental challenges still exist for the development of efficient clinical applications.

J	Oh, SJ; Sung, JE				Oh, Seon Jeong; Sung, Jee Eun			Age-Related Differences in ERP Components during Korean Honorific Sentence Processing Depending on Listener's Social Status and Predicate Agreement	COMMUNICATION SCIENCES AND DISORDERS-CSD			English	Article						Aging; Honorifics; ERP; N400; P600; Sentence processing	WORKING-MEMORY; N400; YOUNG	Objectives: The purpose of this study is to use an event-related potential (ERP) experiment with normally developing young and elderly groups to investigate honorifics processing, a unique linguistic form of the Korean language. Methods: A total of 44 participants (young, 23; elderly, 21) took part in the study. Experimental sentences were made of 3 syntactic words, 'appellation+object+predicate'. According to the high/low social status exhibited in appellation and consistency with predicate final endings, two sentences were formed with a total of 4 experimental conditions. The last verbal word of the presented sentence was the critical word. The electroencephalography was recorded from 32 channels following the International 10-20 system, and mean amplitude was analyzed. Results: The behavioral results showed that the average positive response rate and the response time of the young group were much higher and faster, respectively, than that of the elderly group. The N400 component was observed in a time window of 300-500 ms when the relative social status was inconsistent with its predicate final ending due to pragmatic violations and failure of semantic integration during vocabulary processing. Also, the P600 component was observed in the time window of 500-800 ms due to grammatical abnormality. Conclusion: compared to the young group, delay of sentence process capability during linguistic processing occurs due to the weakened neurological condition of the elderly.

The Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) was used to identify discourse/reasoning lapses during the discussion of loss experiences via death that place speakers in the Unresolved/disorganized AAI category. In parents, Unresolved AAI status has been associated with Disorganized infant Strange Situation response, a known risk factor for psychopathology (e.g., internalizing/externalizing/dissociation). This association has been related to anomalous frightening (FR) parental behavior in the infant's presence, behavior presumed to be instigated by vulnerability to trauma-related fright. Here, psychophysiological methods were utilized to examine whether Unresolved AAI status could be detected in brain responses to subtle/symbolic reminders of loss. One year after AAI administration, 31 undergraduate women who had experienced loss (16 Unresolved) underwent continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) recording during a picture-viewing, valence-rating task. Picture onset-locked event-related potentials (ERPs) revealed millisecond responses to 4 picture categories: pleasant people, pleasant nature, cemetery (symbolic death), and gruesome death (dead or dying people). Participants' valence ratings did not differ between groups across picture categories. However, the N2 ERP, implicated in detecting stimulus salience, was selectively greater in Unresolved participants viewing cemetery scenes; it was in fact as high as the N2 for gruesome death images observed throughout the sample. Additionally, Unresolved participants exhibited a right-hemispheric P3 asymmetry across picture categories, suggestive of continuously heightened vigilance/arousal. Together, these results suggest that Unresolved AAI status is associated with greater neurophysiological sensitivity to subtle reminders of loss that may disrupt ongoing mental function.

Both techniques have the ability to refine cognitive models through a precise timeline description; nevertheless, they also have severe limitations. Combining measures of event-related potentials and eye movements can contribute to cognitive process capture, which provides the possibility to determine precisely when and in which order different cognitive operations occur. Combining of event-related potentials and eye movements has been recently conducted by synchronizing measures from an infrared eye tracker with an electroencephalograph to allow simultaneous data recording. Here, we describe in detail 4 types of co-registration methods for event-related potentials and eye movements on the Tobii platform. Moreover, the present investigation was designed to evaluate the temporal accuracy of data obtained using the 4 methods. We found that the method based on the Tobii Pro Analytics software development kit had a higher degree of temporal accuracy than the other co-registration methods. Furthermore, the reasons for the different temporal accuracies were assessed, and potential measures to correct clock drift were taken. General suggestions are made regarding timing in the co-registration of the electroencephalograph and eye tracker.

Recently we have been able to show progressive changes with training in gray and white matter, and higher order brain functioning using (f) MRI [(functional) Magnetic Resonance Imaging], as well as changes in musical and general cognitive functioning. The current study investigated the same population of non-musicians, amateur pianists and expert pianists using spatio-temporal ERP analysis, by means of microstate analysis, and ERP source imaging. The stimuli consisted of complex musical compositions containing three levels of transgression of musical syntax at closure that participants appraised. ERP waveforms, microstates and underlying brain sources revealed gradual differences according to musical expertise in a 300-500 ms window after the onset of the terminal chords of the pieces. Within this time-window, processing seemed to concern context-based memory updating, indicated by a P3b-like component or microstate for which underlying sources were localized in the right middle temporal gyrus, anterior cingulate and right parahippocampal areas. Given that the 3 expertise groups were carefully matched for demographic factors, these results provide evidence of the progressive impact of training on brain and behavior.

Atypical Processing of Novel Distracters in a Visual Oddball Task in Autism Spectrum Disorder	BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES			English	Article						event-related potential; autism spectrum disorder; attention; cognitive processes; reaction time	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; MEDIAL-FRONTAL-CORTEX; BRAIN POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; NEURAL BASIS; CHILDREN; P300; ABNORMALITIES	Several studies have shown that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show abnormalities in P3b to targets in standard oddball tasks. The present study employed a three-stimulus visual oddball task with novel distracters that analyzed event-related potentials (ERP) to both target and non-target items at frontal and parietal sites. The task tested the hypothesis that children with autism are abnormally orienting attention to distracters probably due to impaired habituation to novelty. We predicted a lower selectivity in early ERPs to target, frequent non-target, and rare distracters. We also expected delayed late ERPs in autism. The study enrolled 32 ASD and 24 typically developing (TD) children. Reaction time (RT) and accuracy were analyzed as behavioral measures, while ERPs were recorded with a dense-array EEG system. Children with ASD showed higher error rate without normative post-error RT slowing and had lower error-related negativity. Parietal P1, frontal N1, as well as P3a and P3b components were higher to novels in ASD. Augmented exogenous ERPs suggest low selectivity in pre-processing of stimuli resulting in their excessive processing at later stages. The results suggest an impaired habituation to unattended stimuli that incurs a high load at the later stages of perceptual and cognitive processing and response selection when novel distracter stimuli are differentiated from targets.

The orthonormal Hermite basis functions act as inputs of the adaptive linear combiner. To estimate and to adjust the parameters of the adaptive filter, the authors use the variable step-size least mean square algorithm which is well suited to track rapid changes of non-stationary signals. The performance of the method is tested with simulated evoked potentials and with real visual event-related potentials. For simulated data, the adaptive Hermite model gave significant enhancement in latency and amplitude estimation as well as in the observation of single-trial event-related potentials, in comparison with wavelet techniques and with other models of adaptive filters. For the real data, the proposed method filters the ongoing electroencephalogram activity, thus allowing a better identification of single-trial visual event-related potentials. The results confirm that the Hermite adaptive linear combiner model provides a simple and fast tool that helps to study single-trial event-related potential responses.

The components of interest were the parietal episodic (PE; 400-800 ms) and late posterior negativity (LPN; 500-900 ms), as these have previously been identified as reliable markers of recollection and post-retrieval monitoring, respectively. Fifteen young adults completed a visual matrix patterns task, assessing memory for low and high semantic visual representations. Matrices with either low semantic or high semantic content (containing familiar visual forms) were briefly presented to participants for study (1500 ms), followed by a retention interval (6000 ms) and finally a same/different recognition phase. The event-related potentials of interest were tracked from the onset of the recognition test stimuli. Analyses revealed equivalent amplitude for the earlier PE effect for the processing of both low and high semantic stimulus types. However, the LPN was more negative-going for the processing of the low semantic stimuli. These data are discussed in terms of relatively ` pure' and complete retrieval of high semantic items, where support can readily be recruited from semantic memory. However, for the low semantic items additional executive resources, as indexed by the LPN, are recruited when memory monitoring and uncertainty exist in order to recall previously studied items more effectively.

METHODS: Internal consistency (i.e., split-half reliability) was calculated for event-related potential (ERP) and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses to monetary gain and loss feedback from the same sample of 8- to 14-year-old girls (N = 177). Internal consistency for ERP (i.e., feedback negativity) and BOLD responses within the ventral striatum and medial and/or lateral prefrontal cortex to gain, loss, difference scores (gain - loss), and residual scores (gain controlling for loss) was compared. Moderation analyses were conducted to investigate whether internal consistency differed by age. RESULTS: ERP and BOLD responses to gain and loss feedback showed high internal consistency in all regions (Spearman-Brown coefficients >= .70). When considering difference and residual scores, however, responses showed lower internal consistency (Spearman-Brown coefficients <= .50), with particularly low internal consistency for subtraction-based scores (Spearman-Brown coefficients <= .36). Age was not a significant moderator of split-half relationships, indicating similar internal consistency across late childhood to early adolescence. CONCLUSIONS: Within the same subjects, high internal consistency was observed for both ERP and BOLD responses to gains and losses, which did not vary as a function of age. Moreover, excellent psychometric properties were evident even within the first half of the experiment. Difference scores were characterized by lower internal consistency, although regression-based approaches outperformed subtraction-based difference scores.

Although many studies have focused in the past on the influence of negative affect on this cognitive control process (and more specifically, on error monitoring), little is known about the possible modulatory effects of positive affect on it. To address this question, we used a standard (positive) mood induction procedure (based on guided imagery) and asked participants to carry out a speeded go/no-go task while high-density electroencephalography was recorded concurrently. As a control condition, we used a group with neutral mood. Event-related potential results showed that the error-related negativity (ERN) component, reflecting early error detection within the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, was not influenced by happy mood. In contrast, the subsequent error positivity (Pe) component, related to the appraisal of the motivational significance of errors, was reliably smaller in the happy than in the neutral mood group. Complementing source localization analyses showed that this effect was explained by decreased activation within the posterior cingulate and insular cortices. These results were obtained in the absence of group differences regarding behavioral performance and tonic arousal. These findings suggest that happy mood likely decreases and changes the motivational significance of worse-than-expected events (Pe), while leaving their earlier automatic detection (ERN) unaltered. We discuss these new results in terms of dynamic changes in the complex interplay of performance monitoring with motivation.

Previous research has demonstrated that ordinary object processing involves both a perceptual process for analyzing different features of the visual input and a higher-order process for evaluating the relevance of this visual information. However, it is unclear how and when these processes are influenced by the creative information of the object. This study utilized event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the time course of creative object processing. Behavioral results revealed that participants spent more time processing creative objects than they did ordinary objects. Analysis of scalp ERPs further revealed that creative objects elicited a more negative ERP deflection between 190 and 340ms (N190-340) with an anterior scalp distribution. Additionally, creative objects elicited more positive ERP deflection than did ordinary objects between 400 and 700ms (P400-700) with a right centro-parietal scalp distribution and between 700 and 1000ms (late positive component) with a right anterior-central scalp distribution. Such results suggest that the processing of creative objects is composed of two distinct stages. The early perceptual stage involves the detection of visual differences exhibited by the creative objects, while the late stage involves the right-lateralized processes of understanding and encoding the creative information.

In the present paper, we asked whether effects of intensive and adaptive computerized working memory training (CWMT) would generalize to enhancements in response control at behavioral and neural levels. A total of 135 postsecondary students with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), a condition associated with executive function impairments, were randomized into a Standard-length CWMT (45-mM /session, 25 sessions), Shortened-length CWMT (15 min/session, 25 sessions), and a waitlist group. Both training groups received CWMT for 5 days a week for 5 weeks long. All participants completed a Go-Nogo task while neural activity was measured using Electroencephalography (EEG), before and after CWMT. Behavioral results showed trend level evidence (p=0.061) for benefits of CWMT on response control (i.e., improved accuracy of Go responses). Among several neural measures results showed statistically significant changes after CWMT only for the Go trial ERP N2 and P3 in frontal electrodes (p=0.039 and 0.001, respectively). However, given the lack of relationship between behavioral and neural changes and especially the clear lack of predicted does effects (i.e., standard length > short length > control), we conclude that there is no convincing evidence that the working memory training per se changes neural activation patterns in untrained executive functions. The positive finding of general training related changes in this study should have no clinical implications, but may contribute to the literature in better understanding the relationship between neural plasticity and transfer.

Here, we combined event-related potentials with computational modelling of the time course of decision-making and outcome evaluation during the Iowa Gambling Task. Measures of choice probability generated using the Prospect Valence Learning Delta (PVL-Delta) model, in addition to objective trial outcomes (outcome magnitude and valence), were applied as regressors in a general linear model of the EEG signal. The resulting three-dimensional spatio-temporal characterization of task related neural dynamics demonstrated that outcome valence, outcome magnitude, and PVL-Delta choice probability were expressed in distinctly separate event related potentials. Our findings showed that the P3 component was associated with an experience-based measure of outcome expectancy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We review electrophysiological (EEG and event-related potential), behavioral (dichotic and visual perceptual asymmetry), and neuroimaging (PET, MRI, NIRS) evidence of right-left asymmetry in depressive disorders. Recent electrophysiological and fMRI studies of emotional processing have provided new evidence of altered laterality in depressive disorders. EEG alpha asymmetry and neuroimaging findings at rest and during cognitive or emotional tasks are consistent with reduced left prefrontal activity in depressed patients, which may impair downregulation of amygdala response to negative emotional information. Dichotic listening and visual hemifield findings for non-verbal or emotional processing have revealed abnormal perceptual asymmetry in depressive disorders, and electrophysiological findings have shown reduced right-lateralized responsivity to emotional stimuli in occipitotemporal or parietotemporal cortex. We discuss models of neural networks underlying these alterations. Of clinical relevance, individual differences among depressed patients on measures of right-left brain function are related to diagnostic subtype of depression, comorbidity with anxiety disorders, and clinical response to antidepressants or cognitive behavioral therapy.

Quantification of Movement-Related EEG Correlates Associated with Motor Training: A Study on Movement-Related Cortical Potentials and Sensorimotor Rhythms	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						movement-related cortical potentials; EEG; grasp; motor training; ERD/ERS	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; HUMAN BRAIN; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC ACTIVITY; TASK; CORTEX; STROKE; DESYNCHRONIZATION; ADAPTATIONS; MODULATION	The ability to learn motor tasks is important in both healthy and pathological conditions. Measurement tools commonly used to quantify the neurophysiological changes associated with motor training such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging pose some challenges, including safety concerns, utility, and cost. EEG offers an attractive alternative as a quantification tool. Different EEG phenomena, movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) and sensorimotor rhythms (event-related desynchronization-ERD, and event-related synchronization-ERS), have been shown to change with motor training, but conflicting results have been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate how the EEG correlates (MRCP and ERD/ERS) from the motor cortex are modulated by short (single session in 14 subjects) and long (six sessions in 18 subjects) motor training. Ninety palmar grasps were performed before and after 1 x 45 (or 6 x 45) min of motor training with the non-dominant hand (laparoscopic surgery simulation). Four channels of EEG were recorded continuously during the experiments. The MRCP and ERD/ERS from the alpha/mu and beta bands were calculated and compared before and after the training. An increase in the MRCP amplitude was observed after a single session of training, and a decrease was observed after six sessions. For the ERD/ERS analysis, a significant change was observed only after the single training session in the beta ERD. In conclusion, the MRCP and ERD change as a result of motor training, but they are subject to a marked intra-and inter-subject variability.

A total of 18 children with dyscalculia (ages 11.5-13.5) and 18 controls were tested, and their event-related potentials were digitally recorded simultaneously with behavior measurement. Behavioral data showed that the dyscalculia group had lower hit rates and higher false rates than the control group. The electroencephalography results showed that both groups had a significant old/new effect and that this effect was greater in the control group. In the 300 to 400 ms processing stages, both groups showed significant differences in digital memory retrieval in the frontal regions. In the 400 to 500 and 500 to 600 ms epochs, the old/new effect in the control group was significantly greater than it was in the dyscalculia group at the frontal, central, and parietal regions. In the 600 to 700 ms processing stages, both groups showed significant differences in digital memory retrieval in the frontal, central, parietal, and occipital regions. These results suggest that individuals with dyscalculia exhibit impaired digital memory retrieval. Extraction failure may be an important cause of calculation difficulties.

Parental reflective functioning and the neural correlates of processing infant affective cues	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Parental reflective functioning; infant faces; infant cries; EEG; ERP	BORDERLINE PERSONALITY-DISORDER; MOTHERS; BRAIN; ATTACHMENT; MENTALIZATION; TRANSMISSION; INFORMATION; PERCEPTION; RESPONSES; TODDLERS	Parental reflective functioning refers to the capacity for a parent to understand their own and their infant's mental states, and how these mental states relate to behavior. Higher levels of parental reflective functioning may be associated with greater sensitivity to infant emotional signals in fostering adaptive and responsive caregiving. We investigated this hypothesis by examining associations between parental reflective functioning and neural correlates of infant face and cry perception using event-related potentials (ERPs) in a sample of recent mothers. We found both early and late ERPs were associated with different components of reflective functioning. These findings suggest that parental reflective functioning may be associated with the neural correlates of infant cue perception and further support the value of enhancing reflective functioning as a mechanism in parenting intervention programs.

Participants read ambiguous idiom strings embedded in highly predictable, literal, and idiomatic contexts while their EEG was recorded. Control sentences only contained the idiom-final word whose cloze values were as high as in literal and idiomatic contexts. Event-related potentials data showed that differences in the amplitude of a frontal positivity (PNP) emerged at the beginning and at the end of the idiom strings, with the idiomatic context condition associated with more positive voltages. The time frequency analysis of the EEG showed an increase in power of the middle gamma frequency band only in the literal context condition. These findings suggest that sentence revision mechanisms, associated with the frontal PNP, are involved in idiom meaning integration, and that the literal semantic composition of the idiomatic constituents, associated with changes in gamma frequency, is not carried out after idiom recognition.

Non-linear features can provide extra information about phase space. The Event-Related Potential (ERP) signals were recorded from 49 subjects who participated in concealed face recognition test. For feature extraction, at first, several morphological characteristics, frequency bands, and wavelet coefficients (we call them basic-features) are extracted from each single-trial ERP. Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) measures are then computed as non-linear features from each single-trial. We apply Genetic Algorithm (GA) to select the best feature set and this feature set is used for classification of data using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier. Next, we use a new approach to improve classification results based on introducing an adaptive-threshold. Results indicate that our method is able to correctly detect 91.83% of subjects (45 correct detection of 49 subjects) using combination of basic and non-linear features, that is higher than 87.75% for basic and 79.59% for non-linear features. This shows that combination of non-linear and basic-features could improve classification rate. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Mehrnam, A. H.; Nasrabadi, A.

To manipulate the demands on model-based decision making, we applied two experimental conditions with different probabilities of transitioning from the first to the second stage of the task. As we expected, when the stage transitions were more predictable, participants showed greater model-based (planning) behavior. Consistent with this result, we found that stimulus-evoked parietal (P300) activity at the second stage of the task increased with the predictability of the state transitions. However, the parietal activity also reflected model-free information about the expected values of the stimuli, indicating that at this stage of the task both types of information are integrated to guide decision making. Outcome-related ERP components only reflected reward-related processes: Specifically, a medial prefrontal ERP component (the feedback-related negativity) was sensitive to negative outcomes, whereas a component that is elicited by reward (the feedback-related positivity) increased as a function of positive prediction errors. Taken together, our data indicate that stimulus-locked parietal activity reflects the integration of model-based and model-free information during decision making, whereas feedback-related medial prefrontal signals primarily reflect reward-related decision processes.

To better understand how this variability is related to central processing differences, the current electroencephalography (EEG) study compared hearing abilities and auditory-cortex activation in patients with electrical stimulation at different sites of the auditory pathway. Three different groups of patients with auditory implants (Hannover Medical School; ABI: n = 6, CI: n = 6; AMI: n = 2) performed a speeded response task and a speech recognition test with auditory, visual, and audio-visual stimuli. Behavioral performance and cortical processing of auditory and audio-visual stimuli were compared between groups. ABI and AMI patients showed prolonged response times on auditory and audio-visual stimuli compared with NH listeners and CI patients. This was confirmed by prolonged N1 latencies and reduced N1 amplitudes in ABI and AMI patients. However, patients with central auditory implants showed a remarkable gain in performance when visual and auditory input was combined, in both speech and non-speech conditions, which was reflected by a strong visual modulation of auditory-cortex activation in these individuals. In sum, the results suggest that the behavioral improvement for audio-visual conditions in central auditory implant patients is based on enhanced audio-visual interactions in the auditory cortex. Their findings may provide important implications for the optimization of electrical stimulation and rehabilitation strategies in patients with central auditory prostheses.

Ancillary methods to detect cognitive decline in these patients are, therefore, needed. Alterations in the latencies and amplitudes of evoked response potential (ERP) components N100 and P200 have been described in PD. Due to limited number of studies their relation to cognitive deficits in PD remains obscure. The present study was designed to examine if alterations in the N100- and P200-potentials associate with neuropsychological impairment in PD. EEG-ERP was conducted to 18 PD patients and 24 healthy controls. The patients underwent a thorough neuropsychological evaluation. The controls were screened for cognitive impairment with Consortium to Establish Alzheimer's disease (CERAD)-testing and a normal result were required to be included in the study. The N100-latency was prolonged in the patients compared to the controls (p = 0.05). In the patients, the N100 latency correlated significantly with a visual working memory task (p = 0.01). Also N100 latency was prolonged and N100 amplitude habituation diminished in the patients achieving poorly in this task. We conclude that prolonged N100-latency and diminished amplitude habituation associate with visual working memory impairment in PD.

The Relationship between Hoarding Symptoms, Intolerance of Uncertainty, and Error-Related Negativity	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Hoarding; Event-related potentials; Error-related negativity; Intolerance of uncertainty	OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; STRESS SCALES DASS; NEURAL MECHANISMS; PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; DECISION-MAKING; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ERP	Individuals who hoard report poor tolerance for uncertainty. They also exhibit error-monitoring abnormalities and increased activation of the anterior cingulate during possession-relevant decision-making, potentially reflecting a context-dependent error sensitivity. Together, these underlying vulnerabilities may lead individuals who hoard to avoid uncertain acquiring and discarding decisions. The current study explored electrophysiological indices of error-monitoring (error-related negativity; ERN) in possession-related and possession-unrelated contexts, and how this related to self-reported intolerance of uncertainty (IU). Undergraduate students (N = 29) completed self-report measures of hoarding symptoms and intolerance of uncertainty, and then engaged in a Go/NoGo task and a novel Discard/NoDiscard task with concurrent EEG measurement. Regression analyses revealed that hoarding symptoms predicted ERN amplitude for possession-related errors but not possession-unrelated errors, and that this relationship was influenced by IU in possession-related contexts. These findings have theoretical implications for understanding vulnerability in hoarding.

Current Tobacco-Smoking and Neural Responses to Infant Cues in Mothers	PARENTING-SCIENCE AND PRACTICE			English	Article							PARENTAL STATUS; BRAIN; FACES; SYMPTOMS; ANXIETY; MODEL; BASES	SYNOPSISObjective. Smoking has a detrimental impact on maternal physical health and exposes children to secondhand smoke, but the extent to which it affects maternal brain and behavior is not well-known and may have implications for parent and child development. We examined how current smoking status might relate to maternal neural responses to infant cues using event-related potentials. Design. Current smoking (n=35) and non-smoking (n=35) mothers viewed photographs of emotional infant faces while electroencephalography was simultaneously recorded. Results. The latency of the face-specific N170 event-related potential component was delayed in smoking mothers compared to non-smoking mothers, and the P300 was differentiated by smoking status. Conclusions. Postpartum smoking is associated with event-related potential measures that may reflect modulation of infant face perception in motherhood.	[Rutherford, Helena J.

Dynamic Responses in Brain Networks to Social Feedback: A Dual EEG Acquisition Study in Adolescent Couples	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						adolescent couples; social interaction; dense-array EEG; principal component analysis; event-related potential; source localization	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; CORTICAL GENERATORS; ATTENTIONAL SYSTEMS; TARGET DETECTION; TIME-COURSE; REJECTION; EXCLUSION	Adolescence is a sensitive period for the development of romantic relationships. During this period the maturation of frontolimbic networks is particularly important for the capacity to regulate emotional experiences. In previous research, both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and dense array electroencephalography (dEEG) measures have suggested that responses in limbic regions are enhanced in adolescents experiencing social rejection. In the present research, we examined social acceptance and rejection from romantic partners as they engaged in a Chatroom Interact Task. Dual 128-channel dEEG systems were used to record neural responses to acceptance and rejection from both adolescent romantic partners and unfamiliar peers (N = 75). We employed a two-step temporal principal component analysis (PCA) and spatial independent component analysis (ICA) approach to statistically identify the neural components related to social feedback. Results revealed that the early (288 ms) discrimination between acceptance and rejection reflected by the P3a component was significant for the romantic partner but not the unfamiliar peer. In contrast, the later (364 ms) P3b component discriminated between acceptance and rejection for both partners and peers. The two-step approach (PCA then ICA) was better able than either PCA or ICA alone in separating these components of the brain's electrical activity that reflected both temporal and spatial phases of the brain's processing of social feedback.

By offering the promise of excellent temporal resolution, event-related potential (ERP) technique has served as a primary tool for studying this process with reference of the linked mastoid (LM). However, given that LM may distort the ERP signals, it is still undetermined whether LM is the best reference choice. The goal of the current study was to systematically compare LM, reference electrode standardization technique (REST) and average reference (AR) for assessing the ERP correlates of change detection during a delayed matching task. Colored shapes were adopted as materials while both the task-relevant shape feature and - irrelevant color feature could be changed. The results of the ERP amplitude showed that both of the task-relevant and - conjunction feature changes elicited significantly more positive posterior P2 in REST and AR, but not in LM. Besides, significantly increased N270 was observed in task-relevant and - conjunction feature changes in both the REST and LM, but in the conjunction feature change in AR. Only the REST-obtained N270 revealed a significant increment in task-irrelevant feature change, which was compatible with the delayed behavioral performance. Statistical parametric scalp mapping (SPSM) results showed a left posterior distribution for AR, an anterior distribution for LM, and both the anterior and left posterior distributions for REST. These results indicate that different types of references may provide distinct cognitive interpretations. Interestingly, only the SPSM of REST was consistent with previous fMRI findings. Combined with the evidence of simulation studies and the current observations, we take the REST-based results as the objective one, and recommend using REST technology in the future ERP data analysis.

To control a device through BCI, brain activities of the user must be accurately translated to meaningful commands and a design of appropiate BCI paradigms play important roles in such tasks. This work presents a design and evaluation of a BCI system that is based on P300 Event-Related Potentials (ERP) in order to control a mobile robot platform into four directions (left, right, front, back). The ultimate goal of this research is to provide convienient way of controlling a mobile robot as an assistive home technology for disabled people. Low cost EPOC Emotiv headset was used in the BCI system to acquire brain signals with a Jaguar 4x4 Wheel robot as a control platform. We discuss a set of signal processing steps employed in detail and the utility of a regularized logistic regression classifier to detect visual stimuli induced P300 ERPs and, to control the Jaguar robot.

According to the dual system model (DSM), the development of alcohol dependence (AD) involves the imbalance between the automatic-affective system and the reflective system. However, the cognitive functions of non-AD hazardous drinkers (HDs) remain unclear. The present study aimed to explore how the HDs process facial expressions differently from the healthy subjects. Sixteen HDs and seventeen control subjects (CSs) completed an emotional working memory (WM) task while the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. We found that there was no significant group difference in behavioral performance between the two groups. In the ERP data, relative to the CSs, the HDs showed delayed latencies of P1 and N170. Moreover, the CSs showed significant differences between the amplitudes of neural/fear and disgust expressions while these differences were insignificant in the HDs. The current results suggest that the main deficits in the processing of facial expression in HDs existed in the early automatic-affective system instead of in the reflective system.

However, information on whether and how this feedback processing is affected by feedback valence, feedback type, and individual sensitivity in reward/punishment among children remains minimal. In this study, we used a guessing game task coupled with electroencephalography to investigate gender differences in feedback processing, in which feedback to reward and punishment was presented in the context of monetary and social conditions. Results showed that boys were less likely to switch their response after punishment, had generally less feedback-related negativity (FRN) amplitude, and longer FRN latency in monetary and punishment conditions than girls. Moreover, FRN for monetary punishment, which is related to individual difference in reward sensitivity, was observed only in girls. The study provides gender-specific evidence for the neural processing of feedback, which may offer educational guidance for appropriate feedback for girls and boys.

In this study, we adapted a social exclusion paradigm, the Lunchroom task, to investigate the use of social context cues in the formation of social outcome expectations as indexed by the P3b, an ERP component associated with attention orientation and context updating. In this task, Black and White participants were presented with either neutral or stereotyped cues prior to being exposed to simulated inclusion versus exclusion outcome scenarios. Black participants showed evidence of (1) a significantly reduced P3b response to exclusions preceded by stereotyped cues relative to neutral cue-related exclusions and (2) a marginally significant increase in the P3b response to inclusions relative to exclusions when both were preceded by stereotyped cues. Both of these findings suggest a key role for the use of social cues in the formation of outcome expectations. In line with our hypothesis that the random intermixing of inclusion and exclusion outcomes would prevent formation of outcome expectations when coupled with the absence of self-relevant cues, no overall P3b modulations were observed among a comparison group of White participants.

Cognitive control in children with learning disabilities: neuromarker for deficient executive functions	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						electroencephalogram; event-related potential; executive functions; Go-NoGo task; learning disability; visual continuous performance task	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; GO-NOGO TASKS; DISABLED CHILDREN; GO/NOGO TASK; INDEPENDENT COMPONENTS; ERP COMPONENTS; EEG ACTIVITY; INHIBITION; ATTENTION; CONFLICT	The neural underpinnings of learning disabilities (LD) are still not known. Recent discussions focus over whether domain-specific and/or domain-unspecific reasons might be responsible for LD either alone or in combination with each other. This study applied standard nonverbal Go-NoGo tasks (visual continuous performance test) to LD and healthy control children to examine whether they show deficient executive functions. During this Go-NoGo task, electroencephalogram was measured in addition to reaction times, hits, omissions, and commissions to the Go and NoGo stimuli. It was shown that children with LD reacted slower with variable responses to Go stimuli and made more omission errors in comparison with the healthy control children. The analysis of the event-related potential indicated that the deficient behavior in this task is associated with smaller - and in part nonexistent - P3d amplitudes. This neural activation indicates a different neural activation pattern during action inhibition in LD children. The neural networks involved in controlling action inhibition are mostly located in frontal brain areas, for which it has been shown that children with LD show neural activation deficiencies. This is possibly a consequence of a maturational delay of the frontal cortex. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

However, neural mechanisms underlying the effects of congruent and incongruent odours on facial expression perception are not clear. Moreover, the influence of emotional faces on odour perception is not established. We investigated the effects of one pleasant and one unpleasant odour paired with happy and disgusted faces, on subjective ratings and ERP responses to faces. Participants rated the pleasantness of happy and disgusted faces that appeared during 3 s pleasant or unpleasant odour pulses, or without odour. Odour pleasantness and intensity ratings were recorded in each trial. EEG was recorded continuously using a 128-channel system. Happy and disgusted faces paired with pleasant and unpleasant odour were rated as more or less pleasant, respectively, compared to the same faces presented in the other odour conditions. Odours were rated as more pleasant when paired with happy faces, and unpleasant odour was rated more intense when paired with disgusted faces. Unpleasant odour paired with disgusted faces also decreased inspiration. Odour-face interactions were evident in the N200 and N400 components. Our results reveal bi-directional effects of odours and faces, and suggest that odour-face interactions may be represented in ERP components. Pairings of unpleasant odour and disgusted faces resulted in stronger hedonic ratings, ERP changes, increased odour intensity ratings and respiratory adjustment. This finding likely represents heightened adaptive responses to multimodal unpleasant stimuli, prompting appropriate behaviour in the presence of danger.

Recent advances in Brain- Computer Interfaces (BCI) and cognitive training (CT) have provided new tools and evidence that NF improves cognitive functions, such as attention and working memory (WM), beyond what is provided by traditional CT. More published studies have demonstrated the efficacy of NF, particularly for treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. In contrast, there have been fewer studies done in older adults with or without cognitive impairment, with some notable exceptions. The focus of this review is to summarize current success in RT NF training of older brains aiming to match those of younger brains during attention/ WM tasks. We also outline potential future advances in RT brainwave- based NF for improving attention training in older populations. The rapid growth in wireless recording of brain activity, machine learning classification and brain network analysis provides new tools for combating cognitive decline and brain aging in older adults. We optimistically conclude that NF, combined with new neuro- markers (event- related potentials and connectivity) and traditional features, promises to provide new hope for brain and CT in the growing older population.

In the present research, we aim at identifying the neural networks and the autonomic responsiveness underlying the human ability to perceive and empathize with others' emotions when positive (cooperative) or negative (uncooperative) interactions are observed. A multimethodological approach was adopted to elucidate the reciprocal interplay of autonomic (peripheral) and central (cortical) activities in empathic behavior. Electroencephalography (EEG, frequency band analysis) and hemodynamic (functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy, fNIRS) activity were all recorded simultaneously with systemic skin conductance response (SCR) and heart rate (HR) measurements as potential biological markers of emotional empathy. Subjects were required to empathize in interpersonal interactions. As shown by fNIRS/EEG measures, negative situations elicited increased brain responses within the right prefrontal cortex (RFC), whereas positive situations elicited greater responses within the left EEC. Therefore, a relevant lateralization effect was induced by the specific valence (mainly for negative conditions) of the emotional interactions. Also, SCR was modulated by positive/negative conditions. Finally, EEG activity (mainly low-frequency theta and delta bands) intrinsically correlated with the cortical hemodynamic responsiveness, and they both predicted autonomic activity. The integrated central and autonomic measures better elucidated the significance of empathic behavior in interpersonal interactions.

Behavioral and electroencephalography responses were recorded to explore the stages of option assessment and outcome evaluation during decision making, respectively. Incidental emotions were elicited by facial expression pictures presented on the background, which included four conditions (control, neutral, fearful, and happy). Results showed smaller feedback-related negativity (FRN) amplitudes in high-anxious participants than low-anxious participants in the control, neutral, and fearful conditions, but not in the happy condition, for small outcomes. The P3 amplitudes were larger in high-anxious participants compared to their counterparts in the fearful and happy conditions, but not in the other conditions. In short, the interaction effects between trait anxiety and facial emotions manifested on the outcome evaluation stage of decision making. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to determine neurophysiological markers of P300 components associated with changes in symptoms after outpatient management with pharmacotherapy in patients with IGD. The present prospective longitudinal study included 18 patients with IGD and 29 healthy controls. The patients with IGD completed a 6-month outpatient management program including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-based pharmacotherapy. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were acquired during the auditory oddball task. ERPs of the patients with IGD were recorded before and after treatment. Between-group differences and the pre-to-post treatment differences in P300 components were investigated using repeated-measures analysis of variance. The primary treatment outcome was a change in score on Young Internet Addiction Test between before and after treatment. At baseline assessments, the IGD group showed significantly reduced P300 amplitudes and delayed latencies at the midline centro-parietal site compared with those in the healthy controls. No significant changes in the P300 indices were observed between pre and post-treatment in the patients with IGD after 6 months of treatment, even though the patients with IGD exhibited significant improvements in their IGD symptoms. Furthermore, no significant difference in ERPs was observed between responders and nonresponders to a 6-month treatment in patients with IGD. These results suggest that reduced P300 amplitudes and delayed latencies are candidate endophenotypes in the pathophysiology of IGD.

J	Mento, G				Mento, Giovanni			The role of the P3 and CNV components in voluntary and automatic temporal orienting: A high spatial-resolution ERP study	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Voluntary and automatic temporal orienting; P3a; P3b; CNV; Brain source analysis	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SIMPLE REACTION-TIME; BRAIN POTENTIALS; PARIETAL LESIONS; TARGET DETECTION; ATTENTION; FOREPERIOD; FMRI; CORTEX; EXPECTATIONS	A main distinction has been proposed between voluntary and automatic mechanisms underlying temporal orienting (TO) of selective attention. Voluntary TO implies the endogenous directing of attention induced by symbolic cues. Conversely, automatic TO is exogenously instantiated by the physical properties of stimuli. A well-known example of automatic TO is sequential effects (SEs), which refer to the adjustments in participants' behavioral performance as a function of the trial-by-trial sequential distribution of the foreperiod between two stimuli. In this study a group of healthy adults underwent a cued reaction time task purposely designed to assess both voluntary and automatic TO. During the task, both post-cue and post-target event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded by means of a high spatial resolution EEG system. In the results of the post-cue analysis, the P3a and P3b were identified as two distinct ERP markers showing distinguishable spatiotemporal features and reflecting automatic and voluntary a priori expectancy generation, respectively. The brain source reconstruction further revealed that distinct cortical circuits supported these two temporally dissociable components. Namely, the voluntary P3b was supported by a left sensorimotor network, while the automatic P3a was generated by a more distributed frontoparietal circuit. Additionally, post-cue contingent negative variation (CNV) and post target P3 modulations were observed as common markers of voluntary and automatic expectancy implementation and response selection, although partially dissociable neural networks subserved these two mechanisms. Overall, these results provide new electrophysiological evidence suggesting that distinct neural substrates can be recruited depending on the voluntary or automatic cognitive nature of the cognitive mechanisms subserving TO.

We aimed to evaluate gender effect on the behavioral and electrophysiological responses in an auditory equiprobable Go/NoGo task. The auditory equal probability Go/NoGo paradigm with two types of stimuli was presented to 79 healthy subjects (40 females and 39 males, age 18-30 years) during EEG recording. Behavioral performance, latency and amplitude of N2 and P3 waves in the Go and the NoGo conditions were evaluated and compared between genders. The response times did not differ between genders; however, females were less accurate on the task. They also exhibited slower N2s and P3s in both Go and NoGo conditions and higher P3 amplitudes. Our results suggest that females require longer times for monitoring of response conflict (N2s) and outcome inhibition (NoGo-P3) and more neural resources and longer processing times for motor response execution (Go-P3). The research provides evidence that gender factor is important in the Go/NoGo studies employing auditory equiprobable paradigm.

RTV captures a large proportion of the genetic risk in ADHD but, importantly, is malleable, improving significantly in a fast-paced, rewarded task condition. Using the temporal precision offered by event-related potentials (ERPs), we aimed to examine the neurophysiological measures of attention allocation (P3 amplitudes) and preparation (contingent negative variation, CNV), and their associations with the fluctuating RT performance and its improvement in ADHD. 93 participants with ADHD and 174 controls completed the baseline and fast-incentive conditions of a four-choice reaction time task, while EEG was simultaneously recorded. Compared to controls, individuals with ADHD showed both increased RTV and reduced P3 amplitudes during performance on the RT task. In the participants with ADHD, attenuated P3 amplitudes were significantly associated with high RTV, and the increase in P3 amplitudes from a slow baseline to a fast-paced, rewarded condition was significantly associated with the RTV decrease. Yet, the individuals with ADHD did not show the same increase in CNV from baseline to fast-incentive condition as observed in controls. ADHD is associated both with a neurophysiological impairment of attention allocation (P3 amplitudes) and an inability to adjust the preparatory state (CNV) in a changed context. Our findings suggest that both neurophysiological and cognitive performance measures of attention are malleable in ADHD, which are potential targets for non-pharmacological interventions.

The Influence of Emotional States on Short-term Memory Retention by using Electroencephalography (EEG) Measurements: A Case Study	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 10TH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES, VOL 4: BIOSIGNALS			English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies	FEB 21-23, 2017	Porto, PORTUGAL			Memory; Learning; Emotions; EEG; ERP; Neuroscience; Education	NEUROSCIENCE; ENGAGEMENT; FEEL	This study explored how emotions can impact short-term memory retention, and thus the process of learning, by analyzing five mental tasks. EEG measurements were used to explore the effects of three emotional states (e. g., neutral, positive, and negative states) on memory retention. The ANT Neuro system with 625Hz sampling frequency was used for EEG recordings. A public-domain library with emotion-annotated images was used to evoke the three emotional states in study participants. EEG recordings were performed while each participant was asked to memorize a list of words and numbers, followed by exposure to images from the library corresponding to each of the three emotional states, and recall of the words and numbers from the list. The ASA software and EEGLab were utilized for the analysis of the data in five EEG bands, which were Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, and Theta. The frequency of recalled event-related words and numbers after emotion arousal were found to be significantly different when compared to those following exposure to neutral emotions. The highest average energy for all tasks was observed in the Delta activity. Alpha, Beta, and Gamma activities were found to be slightly higher during the recall after positive emotion arousal.

Because of individual differences, usually some subject-specific calibration data are required to tailor the classifier for each subject. Transfer learning has been extensively used to reduce such calibration data requirement, by making use of auxiliary data from similar/relevant subjects/tasks. However, all previous research assumes that all auxiliary data have been labeled. This paper considers a more general scenario, in which part of the auxiliary data could be unlabeled. We propose active semi-supervised transfer learning (ASTL) for offline BCI calibration, which integrates active learning, semi-supervised learning, and transfer learning. Using a visual evoked potential oddball task and three different EEG headsets, we demonstrate that ASTL can achieve consistently good performance across subjects and headsets, and it outperforms some state-of-the-art approaches in the literature.

Back-Projection Cortical Potential Imaging: Theory and Results	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING			English	Article						Cortical potential imaging; back-projection; surface Laplacian; finite element method; head modeling	SOURCE LOCALIZATION; EEG; SURFACE; BRAIN; MEG; SKULL	Electroencephalography (EEG) is the single brain monitoring technique that is non-invasive, portable, passive, exhibits high-temporal resolution, and gives a direct measurement of the scalp electrical potential. A major disadvantage of the EEG is its low-spatial resolution, which is the result of the low-conductive skull that "smears" the currents coming from within the brain. Recording brain activity with both high temporal and spatial resolution is crucial for the localization of confined brain activations and the study of brain mechanism functionality, which is then followed by diagnosis of brain-related diseases. In this paper, a new cortical potential imaging (CPI) method is presented. The new method gives an estimation of the electrical activity on the cortex surface and thus removes the "smearing effect" caused by the skull. The scalp potentials are back-projected CPI (BP-CPI) onto the cortex surface by building a well-posed problem to the Laplace equation that is solved by means of the finite elements method on a realistic head model. A unique solution to the CPI problem is obtained by introducing a cortical normal current estimation technique. The technique is based on the same mechanism used in the well-known surface Laplacian calculation, followed by a scalp-cortex back-projection routine. The BP-CPI passed four stages of validation, including validation on spherical and realistic head models, probabilistic analysis (Monte Carlo simulation), and noise sensitivity tests. In addition, the BP-CPI was compared with the minimum norm estimate CPI approach and found superior for multi-source cortical potential distributions with very good estimation results (CC > 0.97) on a realistic head model in the regions of interest, for two representative cases. The BP-CPI can be easily incorporated in different monitoring tools and help researchers by maintaining an accurate estimation for the cortical potential of ongoing or event-related potentials in order to have better neurological inferences from the EEG.

Gating is typically computed as the ratio of the peak amplitude of the event related potential (ERP) to a second click (S2) divided by the peak amplitude of the ERP to a first click (S1). Higher gating ratios are purportedly indicative of incomplete suppression of S2 and considered to represent sensory processing dysfunction. In schizophrenia, hallucination severity is positively correlated with gating ratios, and it was hypothesized that a failure of sensory control processes early in auditory sensation (gating) may represent a larger system failure within the auditory data stream; resulting in auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH). EEG data were collected while patients (N = 12) with treatment-resistant AVH pressed a button to indicate the beginning (AVH-on) and end (AVH-off) of each AVH during a paired click protocol. For each participant, separate gating ratios were computed for the P50, N100, and P200 components for each of the AVH-off and AVH-on states. AVH trait severity was assessed using the Psychotic Symptoms Rating Scales AVH Total score (PSYRATS). The results of a mixed model ANOVA revealed an overall effect for AVH state, such that gating ratios were significantly higher during the AVH-on state than during AVH-off for all three components. PSYRATS score was significantly and negatively correlated with N100 gating ratio only in the AVH-off state. These findings link onset of AVH with a failure of an empirically-defined auditory inhibition system, auditory sensory gating, and pave the way for a sensory gating model of AVH.

The EEG is a very useful tool in understanding neurological dysfunction of stroke and likely improving the treatment and rehabilitation. The traditional method for diagnosing with EEG is mainly based on conventional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). FFT is known to be limited to linear and stationary signal processing. Previously, a technique known as Brain Symmetry Index (BSI) has been proposed to determine the index value for asymmetry of blood flow in right and left brain hemispheres. The estimated index between stroke patient and healthy person ranges between zero and one. Similarly, the existing standard BSI limit the frequency band until 25Hz to eliminate EMG artifact, but at higher frequency band some useful information can also be represented. Hence, highlighting the limitation of FFT in providing the coefficient to calculate BSI index. In this study, we employed the Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT) to extract important feature for this research to use as coefficient in calculating the BSI index for stroke patients with multifocal infarction and healthy individuals. The proposed BSI-HHT spectral analysis conducted in this research was compared with several existing BSI techniques. In order to validate the performance of BSI-HHT, we conducted two experiments 1) 1-25Hz and 2) 1-64Hz for both patients and healthy individuals. The proposed technique offers constant BSI index for two cases and providing better resolution results in determining the index as compared to the existing BSI techniques	[Aziz, Fathrul Azarshah Abdul; Shapiai, Mohd Ibrahim; Ismail, Zool Hilmi] UTM, Ctr Artificial Intelligence & Robot CAIRO, Elect Syst Engn MJIIT, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Fauzi, Hilman] Telkom Univ, Fac Elect Engn, Bandung, Indonesia; [Aziz, Aznida Firzah Abdul] UKM Med Ctr, Dept Family Med, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Remijn, Gerard] Kyushu Univ, Int Educ Ctr, Fukuoka, Japan		Aziz, FAA (corresponding author), UTM, Ctr Artificial Intelligence & Robot CAIRO, Elect Syst Engn MJIIT, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.	atoy92zx@gmail.com; hilmanfauzitsp@telkomuniversity.ac.id; md_jbrahim83@utm.my; draznida@ppukm.ukm.edu.my; remijn@design.kyushu-u.ac.jp; zool@utm.my	Shapiai, Mohd Ibrahim/AAG-3232-2020; Fauzi, Hilman/AAC-3828-2021; Aziz, Aznida Firzah Binti Abdul/AAC-4422-2020; Ismail, Zool H/A-8481-2011; Remijn, Gerard/CAF-9960-2022	Aziz, Aznida Firzah Binti Abdul/0000-0001-7620-4008; Ismail, Zool H/0000-0002-5918-636X; Remijn, Gerard/0000-0002-8681-9951	Universiti Teknologi Malaysia [Q.K130000.2543.13H71]; Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIRO) [U.K091303.0100.00000]	Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIRO)	The authors would like to thank Universiti Teknologi Malaysia for funding this research project through a Research University Grant entitled "Mask Covariance Of Common Spatial Pattern For Brain Computer Interface" (Q.K130000.2543.13H71) and also additional funding from Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIRO) (U.K091303.0100.00000).		27	0	0	0	4	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	2159-3442		978-1-5090-1134-6	TENCON IEEE REGION			2017							1651	1656						6	Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering	BJ5UT					2022-08-02	WOS:000426330001127

Many BCI studies have sought to investigate, detect, and recognize participants' emotional affective states. The applied domains for these studies are varied, and include such fields as communication, education, entertainment, and medicine. To understand trends in electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion recognition system research and to provide practitioners and researchers with insights into and future directions for emotion recognition systems, this study set out to review published articles on emotion detection, recognition, and classification. The study also reviews current and future trends and discusses how these trends may impact researchers and practitioners alike. We reviewed 285 articles, of which 160 were refereed journal articles that were published since the inception of affective computing research. The articles were classified based on a scheme consisting of two categories: research orientation and domains/applications. Our results show considerable growth of EEG-based emotion detection journal publications. This growth reflects an increased research interest in EEG-based emotion detection as a salient and legitimate research area. Such factors as the proliferation of wireless EEG devices, advances in computational intelligence techniques, and machine learning spurred this growth.

Translating cognitive neuroscience to neurotoxicology	ARCHIVES OF TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						Manganese; Toxicity; Cognitive functions; Neurobehavioral testing; Electrophysiology	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; GOAL ACTIVATION; NEUROBEHAVIORAL IMPACT; OCCUPATIONAL-EXPOSURE; ASYMPTOMATIC WELDERS; RESPONSE SELECTION; METAANALYSIS; MECHANISMS; HUMANS; PERFORMANCE	Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace element with well characterized neurotoxic effects in high concentrations. Neurochemically, the initial neurotoxic effect of Mn is the perturbation of striatal.-aminobutyric acid levels. Specific tasks for the assessment of cognitive functions subserved by fronto-striatal loops are available as the stop-change task (SCT) assessing control of multi-component behavior and action cascading. In a crosssectional study, fifty male welders and 28 age-matched controls completed the SCT during a whole day examination. Reaction times, responses accuracy, and event-related potentials (ERPs) from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were analyzed. The shift exposure of the welders to respirable Mn was stratified by 20 mu g/m(3) in 23 low-exposed (median = 4.7 mu g/m(3)) and 27 high-exposed welders (median = 86.0 mu g/m(3)). Welders graduation was lower and was therefore included in the analyses. The task-related factor (stop-change delay, SCD) modified the responses as expected; however, the lack of an interaction "SCD x group" revealed no differences between welders and controls. EEG data showed that the "SCD" modulated the amplitude of the P3 ERP in controls stronger than in welders. There was no difference between the two groups of welders and no association between airborne or systemic Mn and the P3 ERP. Moreover, the P3 amplitude was smaller in subjects with lower education. These results showed that multitasking performance and cognitive flexibility are not impaired in welders. The electrophysiological results gave a weak hint that relevant neurobiological processes were different in welders as compared to controls but this may be related to lower education.

Cognitive control in young heavy drinkers: An ERP study	DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE			English	Article						Performance monitoring; Drinking; Alcohol; Error processing; Inhibitory control; Event-related potentials	RESPONSE-INHIBITION; COLLEGE-STUDENTS; BINGE DRINKING; ALCOHOL-USE; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; DEPENDENCE; TASK; COMPONENTS; IMPULSIVITY; POPULATION	Substance use disorders have been frequently linked to an impaired cognitive control system. Whether this impaired control is also present in young adults who heavily drink alcohol is still subject to debate. The present study investigated possible impairments in cognitive control in heavy drinkers using behavioral and electrophysiological (EEG) measures. We studied behavioral performance on an inhibitory control and an error processing task, using a GoNogo task and an Eriksen Flanker task respectively, while ERPs (Nogo-N2/P3 and ERN/Pe) were measured in a group of heavy alcohol drinkers (n = 48) and a healthy control group of light drinkers (n = 49). Results showed very few impairments in the heavy drinking group either at the behavioral or physiological level. One exception was the error-related Pe amplitude. This ERP component was reduced in heavy drinkers as compared to controls. Given that the Pe reflects a motivational component (i.e., the salience attributed to the making of errors) rather than a basic cognitive deficit, it can be concluded that heavy drinking in this population is not associated with major impaired cognitive control, but rather with impairments that are associated with aberrant attribution of salience to the making of errors. The present EEG findings are consistent with recent reviews and large scale epidemiological studies showing that heavy thinking, in contrast to substance use disorders, in young persons is not necessarily associated with major behavioral impairments in cognitive control.

Electroencephalographic spectral power as well as amplitudes and latencies of mismatch negativity (MMN), P300, and P600 components were evaluated among 19 male heroin addicts and 19 healthy nonsmoker subjects using a paradigm consisting of three subparadigms, namely (1) digit span Wechsler test, (2) auditory oddball, and (3) visual cue-reactivity oddball paradigms. Task 1 provided auditory P300 and P600 in association with working memory. Task 2 provided auditory P300 as well as small and large deviant MMN event-related potential (ERPs). Finally, task 3 provided visual cue-reactivity P300. Results show that beta power was higher among heroin addicts while delta, theta, and alpha powers were decreased compared with healthy subjects. ERP analysis confirmed the decline of brain-evoked potential amplitudes when compared with healthy subjects, thus indicating a broad neurobiological vulnerability of preattentive and attentional processing including attentional deficits and compromise of discrimination abilities. The prolonged latency of ERPs reflects poor cognitive capacity in the engagement of attention and memory resources. On the other hand, an increase of attention towards the heroin-related stimuli could be concluded from the increase of P300 in the cue-reactivity condition among heroin addicts. Findings suggest that applying this paradigm in addiction studies benefits comprehensive evaluation of neuroelectrophysiological activity among addicts, which can promote a better understanding of drugs' effects on the brain as well as define new neuroelectrophysiological characteristics of addiction properties.

Especially for patients after spinal cord injury (SCI), futuristic devices that are controlled by thought via brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) might be of tremendous help in managing daily tasks and restoring at least some mobility. However, there are certain problems arising when trying to implement BCI technology especially in such a heterogenous patient group. A plethora of processes occurring after the injuries change the brain's structure as well as its functionality collectively referred to as neuroplasticity. These changes are very different between individuals, leading to an increasing interest to reveal the exact changes occurring after SCI. In this study we investigated event-related potentials (ERPs) derived fromelectroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded during the (attempted) execution and imagination of hand and foot movements in healthy subjects and patients with SCI. As ERPs and especially early components are of interest for BCI research we aimed to investigate differences between 22 healthy volunteers and 7 patients (mean age = 51.86, SD = 15.49) suffering from traumatic or non-traumatic SCI since 2-314 months (mean = 116,57, SD = 125,55). We aimed to explore differences in ERP responses as well as the general presence of component that might be of interest to further consider for incorporation into BCI research. In order to match the real-life situation of BCIs for controlling neuroprostheses, we worked on small trial numbers (< 25), only. We obtained a focal potential over Pz in ten healthy participants but in none of the patients after lenient artifact rejection. The potential was characterized by a high amplitude, it correlated with the repeated movements (6 times in 6 s) and in nine subjects it significantly differed from a resting condition. Furthermore, there are strong arguments against possible confounding factors leading to the potential's appearance. This phenomenon, occurring when movements are repeatedly conducted, might represent a possible potential to be used in futuristic BCIs and further studies should try to investigate the replicability of its appearance.

Twenty participants, 10 experts and 10 laypersons, judged the aesthetic value of a webpage in an EEG-experiment. Screenshots of 150 webpages, judged as aesthetic or as unaesthetic by another 136 participants, served as stimulus material. Behaviorally, experts and laypersons evaluated unaesthetic webpages similarly, but they differed in their evaluation of aesthetic ones: experts evaluated aesthetic webpages as unaesthetic more often than laypersons did. The ERP-data show main effects of level of expertise and of aesthetic value only. There was no interaction of expertise and aesthetics. In a time-window of 110-130 ms after stimulus onset, aesthetic webpages elicited a more negative EEG-amplitude than unaesthetic webpages. In the same time window, experts had more negative EEG-amplitudes than laypersons. This patterning of results continued until a time window of 600-800 ms in which group and aesthetic differences diminished. An interaction of perceiver characteristics and object properties that several interactionist theories postulate was absent in the EEG-data. Experts seem to process the stimuli in a more thorough manner than laypersons. The early activation differences between aesthetic and unaesthetic webpages is in contrast with some theories of aesthetic processing and has not been reported before.

Inefficient DM may occur due to poor option assessment or a deficit in the evaluation of choice outcomes. This study uses, for the first time, the event-related potential (ERP) technique to analyze these DM subprocesses in patients with MS. Sixteen MS patients and nineteen control subjects performed a DM task based on the Iowa Gambling Task while a digital EEG was recorded. The P3b was analyzed as an index of option assessment, and both the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and P3b were considered markers for choice outcome evaluation. We found that MS patients made a larger number of unfavorable choices during the DM task (P=0.02), with no differences between groups for reaction times. There were no significant differences in P3b for option assessment between the groups. In the control group, the type of feedback (gain, loss, or nothing) modified the FRN (F=3.72, P=0.033) and the P3b (F=3.15, P=0.059). This effect was not observed in the MS group. Also, FRN latencies were shorter in the MS group compared to controls (P=0.047). Finally, lesions in temporal regions revealed by MRI were associated with DM both in behavioral and electrophysiological terms. We conclude that the DM impairment of patients with MS may be due to a deficit in their evaluation of choice outcomes or a general alteration in emotional reactivity.

Notably, the aging ST, which largely influences older adults' cognitive ability, mental and physical health, did not receive much attention. In order to investigate these issues, electroencephalogram (EEG) data were obtained from older adults during a modified Stroop task using neutral words, positive and negative self-concept words in aging ST vs. neutral control conditions. Results showed longer reaction times (RTs) for identifying colors of words under the aging ST compared to the neutral condition. More importantly, the negative self-concept elicited more positive late P300 amplitudes and enhanced theta band activities compared to the positive self-concept or neutral words under the aging ST condition, whereas no difference was found between these self-concepts and neutral words in the control condition. Furthermore, the aging ST induced smaller theta band synchronization and enhanced alpha band synchronization compared to the control condition. Moreover, we also observed valence differences in self-concepts where the negative self-concept words reduced early P150/N170 complex relative to neutral words. These findings suggest that priming ST could activate negative self-concepts as current working self-concept, and that this influence occurred during a late neural time course.

Assessment of the state of consciousness in these patients is difficult since they are usually incapable of reproducible motor movements. The application of event-related potentials (ERP) recorded via EEG constitutes one promising approach to complement the assessment of cognitive functions in DOC patients. For these assessments, a hierarchical approach was suggested which means that paradigms aiming at higher order ERPs are only presented if early responses were found. In this study, 19 behaviorally unresponsive or low-responsive DOC patients were presented with three auditory paradigms using passive instructions. The paradigms aimed at eliciting the Mismatch Negativity (MMN) and N400 and were applied at two time points. One oddball paradigm (MMN) and two semantic paradigms (word-pairs: N400 Words; sentences: N400 Sentences) were included. The majority of patients (n = 15) did not show any response to the stimulation. In the MMN paradigm, an MMN was identified in two patients, in the N400 Words paradigm, only an N1 was identified in one patient, and in the N400 Sentences paradigm, a late positive complex (LPC) was identified in two patients. These data contradict the hierarchical approach since the LPC was identified in patients who did not exhibit an MMN. They further support the notion that even higher information processing as addressed with the N400 paradigms is preserved in a minority of DOC patients. Thus, in this sample, around 10% of the DOC patients exhibited indicators of preserved consciousness. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Erlbeck, Helena; Real, Ruben G.

J	Lei, X; Liao, KR				Lei, Xu; Liao, Keren			Understanding the Influences of EEG Reference: A Large-Scale Brain Network Perspective	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG reference; large-scale networks; average reference; reference electrode standardization technique	INFINITY REFERENCE; FUNCTIONAL SPECIALIZATION; AVERAGE REFERENCE; THEORETICAL BASIS; VOLUME CONDUCTOR; CORTEX; RECORDINGS; SEARCH; SYSTEM; ZERO	The influence of reference is a critical issue for the electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) studies. However, previous investigations concentrated less on the location of source at a systematic neuroscience level. Our goal was to examine the EEG signal associated with the locations from a common network parcellation of the human brain function, offering a system perspective of the influence of EEG reference. In our simulation, vertices uniformly distributed in eight large-scale brain networks were adopted to generate the scalp EEG. The brain networks contain the visual, somatomotor, dorsal attention, ventral attention, limbic, frontoparietal, default networks, and the deep brain structure. The distributions of the most sensitive and neutral electrodes were calculated for each network based on the lead-field matrix. While the most sensitive electrode had a network-specific symmetric pattern, the electrodes in scalp surface had approximately equal chance to be the most neutral electrode. Simulated data were referenced at the FCz, the Oz, the mean mastoids (MM), the average (AVE), and the infinity reference obtained by the reference electrode standardization technique (REST). Intriguingly, the relative error followed the pattern REST < AVE< MM < (Fez, Oz), regardless of the number of electrodes and signal-to-noise ratios. Our findings suggested that REST was a potentially preferable reference for all large-scale networks and AVE virtually performed as REST under several conditions. As EEG and ERPs experiments within the same behavioral domain always have activations in some specific brain networks, the comparisons revealed here may provide a valuable recommendation for reference selection in clinical and basic researches.

Electroencephalographic alpha wave power suppression above the somatosensory cortex is thought to reveal a movement or attention type pattern when contrasted to a baseline. The proposed research attempts to reveal whether there are ADHD-related differences in the activity and nature of alpha EEG wave oscillations during observation-execution tasks. To do so, alpha power suppression through time, frequency and spatial analysis was performed. It is reasonable to assume that different processes may be present in the alpha band, but new research advises about the strong relevance of the somatosensory system during observation-execution processes and indeed, a disruption of this mechanism can lead to some developmental disorders. The results show significant differences in suppressing Mu rhythm for the control group and ADHD group, and also for the combined and inattentive subtypes. Differences were detected for 8-10 and 10-12 Hz frequency ranges in the case of the ADHD group and the combined subtype, and 8-10, 8-12 and 10-12 Hz in the case of the inattentive and hyperactive subtypes. Hence, from these findings it could be interpreted that the ADHD groups have a different conceptualization of external stimuli, and this was perceived in different EEG activity within the somatosensory area. In conclusion, this research could help to understand the mechanism underlying conceptual representation and behavioral performance associated with this disorder.

J	Sabeti, M; Boostani, R				Sabeti, Malihe; Boostani, Reza			Separation of P300 event-related potential using time varying time-lag blind source separation algorithm	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						P300 component; Blind source separation; Schizophrenia		Synchronous averaging over time locked single-trial of event-related potential (ERP) is known as the simplest scheme to extract P300 component. This method assumes the P300 features are invariant through the time while they are affected by factors like brain fatigue and habitation. In this study, a new scheme is proposed termed as time-varying time-lag blind source separation (TT-BSS) which is upon the second order statistics of signal to separate P300 waveform from the background electroencephalogram (EEG) while it captures the time variation of P300 component. The time-lag parameter for all channels is determined by maximizing the correlation (similarity) between two successive trials. As the time-lag parameter is varying by time (trial to trial), an average is taken over the time-lag covariance matrices of all two consecutive trials. TT-BSS finally estimates a transform (separating matrix) by joint diagnolization of the covariance matrix of trials and the averaged covariance matrix of the time varying time-lag. To assess the proposed scheme, synthetic and real EEGs containing P300 are used. The EEG signals were collected from twenty schizophrenic and twenty age-matched normal subjects via 20 channels through the resting state and in presence of the oddball audio stimulus. Empirical achievements over the simulated and real EEGs imply on the superiority of TT-BSS in dynamic estimation of P300 characteristics compared to state-of-the-art counterparts such as constant time-lag BSS, constrained BSS and synchronous averaging.

While few studies have scientifically investigated their processing, in computer graphics, efforts are made to increase realism. Yet, close approximations of reality have been suggested to evoke sometimes a feeling of eeriness, the "uncanny valley" effect. Here, we used high-density electroencephalography to investigate brain responses to professionally stylized happy, angry, and neutral character faces. We employed six face-stylization levels varying from abstract to realistic and investigated the N170, early posterior negativity (EPN), and late positive potential (LPP) event-related components. The face-specific N170 showed a u-shaped modulation, with stronger reactions towards both most abstract and most realistic compared to medium-stylized faces. For abstract faces, N170 was generated more occipitally than for real faces, implying stronger reliance on structural processing. Although emotional faces elicited highest amplitudes on both N170 and EPN, on the N170 realism and expression interacted. Finally, LPP increased linearly with face realism, reflecting activity increase in visual and parietal cortex for more realistic faces. Results reveal differential effects of face stylization on distinct face processing stages and suggest a perceptual basis to the uncanny valley hypothesis. They are discussed in relation to face perception, media design, and computer graphics.

Here, we propose a layered approach to experimental design in which multiple tasks-from simple to complex-with additional layers of complexity introduced at each stage are incorporated for investigating decision making. This is demonstrated using tasks involving intertemporal choice between immediate and future prospects. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalographic (EEG) studies have separately investigated the spatial and temporal neural substrates, respectively, of specific factors underlying decision making. In contrast, we performed simultaneous acquisition of EEG/ fMRI data and fusion of both modalities using joint independent component analysis such that: 1) the native temporal/ spatial resolutions of either modality is not compromised and 2) fast temporal dynamics of decision making as well as involved deeper striatal structures can be characterized. We show that spatiotemporal neural substrates underlying our proposed complex intertemporal task simultaneously incorporating rewards, costs, and uncertainty of future outcomes can be predicted (using a linear model) from neural substrates of each of these factors, which were separately obtained by simpler tasks. This was not the case for spatial and temporal features obtained separately from fMRI and EEG, respectively. However, certain prefrontal activations in the complex task could not be predicted from activations in simpler tasks, indicating that the assumption of pure insertion has limited validity. Overall, our approach provides a realistic and novel framework for investigating the neural substrates of decision making with high spatiotemporal resolution.

J	Flynn, M; Liasis, A; Gardner, M; Towell, T				Flynn, Maria; Liasis, Alki; Gardner, Mark; Towell, Tony			Visual mismatch negativity to masked stimuli presented at very brief presentation rates	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Visual mismatch negativity; Subliminal; EEG; ERPs; Conscious perception	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MEMORY-BASED DETECTION; DEVIANCE DETECTION; ATTENTION; MMN; DISCRIMINATION; REGULARITIES; INFORMATION; RESPONSES; COMPONENT	Mismatch negativity (MMN) has been characterised as a 'pre-attentive' component of an event-related potential (ERP) that is related to discrimination and error prediction processes. The aim of the current experiment was to establish whether visual MMN could be recorded to briefly presented, backward and forward masked visual stimuli, given both below and above levels of subjective experience. Evidence of visual MMN elicitation in the absence of the ability to consciously report stimuli would provide strong evidence for the automaticity of the visual MMN mechanism. Using an oddball paradigm, two stimuli that differed in orientation from each other, a + and an x, were presented on a computer screen. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from nine participants (six females), mean age 21.4 years. Results showed that for stimuli that were effectively masked at 7 ms presentation, there was little variation in the ERPs evoked to standard and deviant stimuli or in the subtraction waveform employed to delineate the visual MMN. At 14 ms stimulus presentation, when participants were able to report stimulus presence, an enhanced negativity at around 175 and 305 ms was observed to the deviant and was evident in the subtraction waveform. However, some of the difference observed in the ERPs can be attributed to stimulus characteristics, as the use of a 'lonely' deviant protocol revealed attenuated visual MMN components at 14 ms stimulus presentation. Overall, results suggest that some degree of conscious attention is required before visual MMN components emerge, suggesting visual MMN is not an entirely pre-attentive process.

The aim of this paper was to characterize brain non-stationarity during an auditory oddball task in schizophrenia (SCH). The level of non-stationarity was measured in the baseline and response windows of relevant tones in SCH patients and healthy controls. Approach. Event-related potentials were recorded from 28 SCH patients and 51 controls. Non-stationarity was estimated in the conventional electroencephalography frequency bands by means of Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD). Relative power (RP) was also computed to assess a possible complementarity with KLD. Main results. Results showed a widespread statistically significant increase in the level of non-stationarity from baseline to response in all frequency bands for both groups. Statistically significant differences in nonstationarity were found between SCH patients and controls in beta-2 and in the alpha band. SCH patients showed more non-stationarity in the left parieto-occipital region during the baseline window in the beta-2 band. A leave-one-out cross validation classification study with feature selection based on binary stepwise logistic regression to discriminate between SCH patients and controls provided a positive predictive value of 72.73% and negative predictive value of 78.95%. Significance. KLD can characterize transient neural reorganization during an attentional task in response to novelty and relevance. Our findings suggest anomalous reorganization of neural dynamics in SCH during an oddball task. The abnormal frequency-dependent modulation found in SCH patients during relevant tones is in agreement with the hypothesis of aberrant salience detection in SCH. The increase in non-stationarity in the alpha band during the active task supports the notion that this band is involved in top-down processing. The baseline differences in the beta-2 band suggest that hyperactivation of the default mode network during attention tasks may be related to SCH symptoms. Furthermore, the classification improved when features from both KLD and RP were used, supporting the idea that these measures can be complementary.

J	Klein, A; Skrandies, W				Klein, Alexander; Skrandies, Wolfgang			Total variation for the analysis of event-related potentials	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Total variation; Event-related potential; Time-domain; Learning; Feedback; tANOVA	WAVELET-TRANSFORM; BRAIN POTENTIALS; FEEDBACK; EEG; TUTORIAL; FORMS; TASK	Background: Event-related potential waveforms are often analysed in the time-domain for changes of striking morphological features, like amplitudes or latencies of extrema, at the expense of missing less obvious changes in overall morphology. New method: The measure of total variation can capture a variety of changes in curve morphology. We show analytical examples, and the application to two sets of EEG data (n(1)= 41, n(2)=19) difficult to analyse with more traditional methods. Results: Total variation can be used to identify the effects of experimental manipulations on event-related potential waveforms, and can additionally be used to identify the respective time windows by means of hierarchical subdivision of longer signals. Comparison with existing methods: The ANOVA of total variation provided additional insights into effects already hinted at by the ANOVA of global field power in the first experiment, and identified a number of interactions missed by an ANOVA of amplitude as well as a topographic ANOVA in the second one. Conclusions: The analysis of total variation can be an interesting complement to more traditional analyses, especially when changes are hard to assess with traditional methods, e.g. in the absence of pronounced extrema, or the presence of noise or large interindividual variations of latency.

Time-frequency phase-synchrony approaches with ERPs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Time-frequency; Phase synchrony; Functional connectivity; Medial frontal theta	MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; COGNITIVE CONTROL; WAVELET ANALYSIS; ERROR-DETECTION; MIDLINE THETA; EEG COHERENCE; BRAIN; COMPONENTS	Time-frequency signal processing approaches are well-developed, and have been widely employed for the study of the energy distribution of event-related potential (ERP) data across time and frequency. Wavelet time frequency transform (TFT) and Cohen's class of time-frequency distributions (TFD) are the most widely used in the field. While ERP TFT approaches have been most extensively developed for amplitude measures, reflecting the magnitude of regional neuronal activity, time-frequency phase-synchrony measures have gained increased utility in recent years for the assessment of functional connectivity. Phase synchrony measures can be used to index the functional integration between regions (interregional), in addition to the consistency of activity within region (intertrial). In this paper, we focus on a particular class of time-frequency distributions belonging to Cohen's class, known as the Reduced Interference Distribution (RID) for quantifying functional connectivity, which we recently introduced (Aviyente et al., 2011). The present report first summarizes common time frequency approaches to computing phase-synchrony with ERP data in order to highlight the similarities and differences relative to the RID. In previous work, we demonstrated differences between the RID and wavelet approaches to indexing phase-synchrony, and have applied the RID to demonstrate that RID-based time frequency phase-synchrony measures can index increased functional connectivity between medial and lateral prefrontal regions during control processing, observed in the theta band during the error-related negativity (ERN). Because ERN amplitude measures have been associated with two other widely studied medial-frontal theta components (no-go N2; feedback negativity, FN), the application of the RID phase synchrony measure in the present report extends our previous work with ERN to include theta activity during the no-go N2 (inhibitory processing) and the feedback negativity (FN; loss feedback processing). Findings support the idea that similar medial-lateral prefrontal functional connectivity underlies the ERN, no-go N2, and FN components, and provide initial validation that the proposed RID-based time-frequency phase-synchrony measure can index this activity.

EEG-based Evaluation of Animated Virtual Characters	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2017 ACM SIGCHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS (CHI'17)			English	Proceedings Paper	ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI)	MAY 06-11, 2017	Denver, CO	Assoc Comp Machinery, ACM SIGCHI		EEG; Computer Graphics; Virtual Humans; Uncanny Valley	BRAIN POTENTIAL ERP; UNCANNY VALLEY; FACE PERCEPTION; COMPONENT; DYNAMICS; REALISM; OBJECT; N170	There is a continuous effort by animation experts to create increasingly realistic and more human-like digital characters. However, as virtual characters become more human they risk evoking a sense of unease in their audience. This sensation, called the Uncanny Valley effect, is widely acknowledged both in the popular media and scientific research but empirical evidence for the hypothesis has remained inconsistent. In this paper, we investigate the neural responses to computer-generated faces in a cognitive neuroscience study. We record brain activity from participants (N = 40) using electroencephalography (EEG) while they watch videos of real humans and computer-generated virtual characters. Our results show distinct differences in neural responses for highly realistic computer-generated faces such as Digital Emily compared with real humans. These differences are unique only to agents that are highly photorealistic, i.e. the 'uncanny' response. Based on these specific neural correlates we train a support vector machine (SVM) to measure the probability of an uncanny response for any given computer-generated character from EEG data. This allows the ordering of animated characters based on their level of 'uncanniness'.

J	Singh, MI; Singh, M				Singh, Moon Inder; Singh, Mandeep			Development of low-cost event marker for EEG-based emotion recognition	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL			English	Article						EEG; emotion recognition; event-related potential; event marker; low cost; synchronization; USB	MODEL; MOOD	The study of changes in physiological signals for emotion recognition in human subjects has generated immense interest in medical instrumentation. One of the effective ways of classifying emotions is by the use of the event-related potentials (ERPs) of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. This requires projection of an image on one computer system while simultaneously putting a marker on another computer system acquiring the EEG. This is achieved using costly modules to synchronize the stimulus presentation system with the data acquisition system. This paper describes an innovative low-cost technique to achieve this simultaneous triggering on the second computer system using the parallel operation of mechanical keyboards. The latency aspect of both USB and PS/2 keyboards with their two keys galvanically connected have been experimentally analysed and compared. It has been found experimentally that the USB keyboards, if used in cognition research, would give better latency results compared with the PS/2 keyboards. The synchronization error between the two USB keyboards has been found to be lower than or equal to 1 ms for the maximum number of keystrokes. The horizon of applications of this technique is unlimited and it can be used in almost every sphere of cognition enhancement and research, where a perfect synchronization of the brain stimulus with the corresponding physiological signals being acquired is required.

Methods: We train, test, analyze, and compare various machine learning classification approaches optimized in terms of the correct classification rate (CCR), the degenerated Youden's index (DYI) and the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). CAD system comprises five stages: electroencephalography (EEG) preprocessing, feature extraction, seven electrode groupings, discriminant feature selection, and binary classification. Results: With two optimal combinations of electrode grouping, filtering, feature selection algorithm, and classification machine, we get either a mean CCR= 93.42%, specificity = 0.9673, sensitivity = 0.8727, DYI= 0.9188, and AUC = 0.9567 (total-15 Hz-J5- MLP), or a mean CCR = 92.23%, specificity = 0.9499, sensitivity = 0.8838, DYI = 0.9162, and AUC = 0.9807 (right hemisphere-35 Hz-J5-SVM), which to our knowledge are higher than those available to date. Conclusions: We have verified that a more restrictive low-pass filtering achieves higher CCR as compared to others at higher frequencies in the P3b wave. In addition, results validate previous hypothesis about the importance of the parietal-temporal region, associated with memory processing, allowing us to identify powerful {feature, electrode} pairs in the diagnosis of schizophrenia, achieving higher CCR and AUC in classification of both right and left Hemispheres, and parietal-temporal EEG signals, like, for instance, the {PSE, P4} pair (J5 and mutual information feature selection). Significance: Diagnosis of schizophrenia is made thoroughly by psychiatrists but as any human-based decision that has a subjective component. This CAD system provides the human expert with an objective complimentary measure to help him in diagnosing schizophrenia.

Electrophysiological evidence of perceived sexual attractiveness for human female bodies varying in waist-to-hip ratio	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR); P1; N190; LPC; Appetitive stimuli; Biologically relevant stimuli; Sexual behaviour; Body; Attractiveness	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BODY-MASS INDEX; FACIAL ATTRACTIVENESS; PHYSICAL ATTRACTIVENESS; WOMENS ATTRACTIVENESS; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; HUMAN PHYSIQUE; AVERAGE FACES; PREFERENCES; BEAUTY	The dynamics of brain activation reflecting attractiveness in humans are unclear. Among the different features affecting attractiveness of the female body, the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is considered to be crucial. To date, however, no event-related potential (ERP) study has addressed the question of its associated pattern of brain activation. We carried out two different experiments: (a) a behavioural study, to judge the level of attractiveness of female realistic models depicting 4 different WHRs (0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9) with and without clothes; (b) an EEG paradigm, to record brain activity while participants (heterosexual men and women) viewed these same models. Behavioural results showed that WHRs of 0.7 were considered more attractive than the others. ERP analyses revealed a different pattern of activation for male and female viewers. The 0.7 ratio elicited greater positivity at the P1 level in male viewers but not females. Naked bodies increased the N190 in both groups and peaked earlier for the 0.7 ratio in the male viewers. Finally, the late positive component (LPC) was found to be greater in male than in female viewers and was globally more marked for naked bodies as well as WHRs of 0.7 in both groups of viewers. These results provide the first electrophysiological evidence of specific time periods linked to the processing of a body feature denoting attractiveness and therefore playing a role in mate choice.

Empirical evidence for the relationship between cognitive workload and attentional reserve	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; ER; Workload; Attention	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; EEG ALPHA; WORKING-MEMORY; FRONTAL THETA; PERFORMANCE; LOAD; BAND; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; DYNAMICS	While the concepts of cognitive workload and attentional reserve have been thought to have an inverse relationship for some time, such a relationship has never been empirically tested. This was the purpose of the present study. Aspects of the electroencephalogram were used to assess both cognitive workload and attentional reserve. Specifically, spectral measures of cortical activation were used to assess cognitive workload, while amplitudes of the event-related potential from the presentation of unattended "novel" sounds were used to assess attentional reserve. The relationship between these two families of measures was assessed using canonical correlation. Twenty-seven participants performed a flight simulator task under three levels of challenge. Verification of manipulation was performed using self-report measures of task demand, objective task performance, and heart rate variability using electrocardiography. Results revealed a strong, negative relationship between the spectral measures of cortical activation, believed to be representative of cognitive workload, and ERP amplitudes, believed to be representative of attentional reserve. This finding provides support for the theoretical and intuitive notion that cognitive workload and attentional reserve are inversely related. The practical implications of this result include improved state classification using advanced machine learning techniques, enhanced personnel selection/recruitment/placement, and augmented learning/training.

The Cl component of the visual event-related potential (ERP) at parietal occipital electrode sites was larger in the Landmark Cueing task, and source localisation suggested greater activation in the superior parietal lobule (SPL) in this task, compared to the Perceptual Discrimination task, indicating stronger early recruitment of the dorsal visual stream. In the Perceptual Discrimination task, source localisation suggested widespread activation of the inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) and fusiform gyms (FFG), structures associated with the ventral visual stream, during the early phase of the P1 ERP component. Moreover, during a later epoch (171-270 ms after stimulus onset) increased temporal occipital negativity, and stronger recruitment of ITG and FFG were observed in the Perceptual Discrimination task. These findings illuminate the contrasting functions of the dorsal and ventral visual streams, to support rapid shifts of attention in response to contextual landmarks, and conscious discrimination, respectively.

We investigated the formation of regularity representations for sound patterns in an event-related potential (ERP) study. A pattern, which consisted of six concatenated 50 ms tone segments differing in fundamental frequency, was presented 1, 2, 3, 6, or 12 times and then replaced by another pattern by randomly changing the pitch of the tonal segments (roving standard paradigm). In an absolute repetition condition, patterns were repeated identically, whereas in a transposed condition, only the pitch relations of the tonal segments of the patterns were repeated, while the entire patterns were shifted up or down in pitch. During ERP measurement participants were not informed about the pattern repetition rule, but were instructed to discriminate rarely occurring targets of lower or higher sound intensity. EPRs for pattern changes (mismatch negativity, MMN; and P3a) and for pattern repetitions (repetition positivity, RP) revealed that the auditory system is able to rapidly extract regularities from unfamiliar complex sound patterns even when absolute pitch varies. Yet, enhanced RP and P3a amplitudes, and improved behavioral performance measured in a post-hoc test, in the absolute as compared with the transposed condition suggest that it is more difficult to encode patterns without absolute pitch information. This is explained by dissociable processing of standards and deviants as well as a back propagation mechanism to early sensory processing stages, which is effective after less repetitions of a standard stimulus for absolute pitch.

The associated, high level of arousalmay disruptmotor-sensory processing and result in aberrant patterns of motor function, including functional neurological symptoms. We used the auditory oddball paradigm to assess cortical arousal in children and adolescents with functional neurological symptom disorder. Method: Electroencephalogram (EEG) data was collected in fifty-seven children and adolescents (41 girls; 16 boys, aged 8.5-18 years) with acute functional neurological symptoms and age-sex-matched controls during a conventional auditory oddball task. The high-resolution fragmentary decomposition technique was used to analyse the amplitude of event-related potentials (ERPs) to target tones at midline sites (Fz, Cz, and Pz). Results: Compared to age-and sex-matched controls, and across all three midline sites, children and adolescents with functional neurological symptoms showed increased amplitude of all ERP components (P50, N100, P200, N200, and P300) (t-value range 2.28-8.20; p value-range 0.023 to < 0.001) to the emotionally-neutral auditory stimulus. Conclusions: Our findings add to a growing literature indicating that a baseline state of high arousal may be a precondition for generating functional neurological symptoms, a finding that helps explain why a range of psychological and physiological stressors can trigger functional neurological symptoms in some patients. Interventions that target cortical arousal may be central to the treatment of paediatric patients with functional neurological symptom disorder. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Usually, experimental paradigms designed to study anticipatory activity make use of stimuli. The purpose of the present study is to expand the study of neural anticipatory activity upon the temporal occurrence of dichotomic, statistically unpredictable (random) stimuli within an ecological experimental paradigm. To this purpose, we used a simplified driving simulation including two possible, randomly-presented trial types: a car crash end trial and a no car crash end trial. Event Related Potentials (ERP) were extracted -3,000 ms before stimulus onset. We identified a fronto-central negativity starting around 1,000 ms before car crash presentation. By contrast, a whole-scalp distributed positivity characterized the anticipatory activity observed before the end of the trial in the no car crash end condition. The present data are in line with the hypothesis that the brain may also anticipate dichotomic, statistically unpredictable stimuli, relaying onto different pre-stimulus ERP activity. Possible integration with car-smart-systems is also suggested.

J	Finke, M; Billinger, M; Buchner, A				Finke, Mareike; Billinger, Martin; Buechner, Andreas			Toward Automated Cochlear Implant Fitting Procedures Based on Event-Related Potentials	EAR AND HEARING			English	Article						Cochlear implant; Event-related potentials; Fitting procedure; Objective measures; P3; Single-trial classification		Objectives: Cochlear implants (CIs) restore hearing to the profoundly deaf by direct electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. To provide an optimal electrical stimulation pattern the CI must be individually fitted to each CI user. To date, CI fitting is primarily based on subjective feedback from the user. However, not all CI users are able to provide such feedback, for example, small children. This study explores the possibility of using the electroencephalogram (EEG) to objectively determine if CI users are able to hear differences in tones presented to them, which has potential applications in CI fitting or closed loop systems. Design: Deviant and standard stimuli were presented to 12 CI users in an active auditory oddball paradigm. The EEG was recorded in two sessions and classification of the EEG data was performed with shrinkage linear discriminant analysis. Also, the impact of CI artifact removal on classification performance and the possibility to reuse a trained classifier in future sessions were evaluated. Results: Overall, classification performance was above chance level for all participants although performance varied considerably between participants. Also, artifacts were successfully removed from the EEG without impairing classification performance. Finally, reuse of the classifier causes only a small loss in classification performance. Conclusions: Our data provide first evidence that EEG can be automatically classified on single-trial basis in CI users. Despite the slightly poorer classification performance over sessions, classifier and CI artifact correction appear stable over successive sessions. Thus, classifier and artifact correction weights can be reused without repeating the set-up procedure in every session, which makes the technique easier applicable. With our present data, we can show successful classification of event-related cortical potential patterns in CI users. In the future, this has the potential to objectify and automate parts of CI fitting procedures.

In clinic, an objective indicator is needed for diagnosing and better controlling chronic pain. The abnormal neural responses in chronic pain are reflected by multiple event-related potentials (ERPs) in time, frequency, and location domain, respectively. However, multiple changes in ERPs are not applicable in clinic. So, the principal feature covered the most informative changes extracted from these three domains of ERP during the development of chronic pain is needed. In the present study, a parallel factor analysis method was employed to extract time-frequency-channel features of laser-evoked potential (LEP) simultaneously from rats with chronic inflammatory pain. Results showed that the main feature of LEP in channel domain locates in the frontal brain region in rats with chronic inflammatory pain while in the parietal brain region in control rats. In the frequency domain, the main frequency of LEP was significantly higher in chronic inflammatory pain rats than that in control rats. These findings indicate that the frontal region with higher frequency response to nociceptive information is the principal feature in the chronic pain state. Our study provided not only a principal feature of LEP but also a promising strategy for chronic pain, which is potential for clinic application.

EEG signals during the repeated stimuli were recorded from four disabled subjects and processed with a Butterworth bandpass filter and Singular Spectrum Analysis, normalized, separated into 2 groups of the target and non-target trial data, and averaged for every 5 trials for each group before classified using a neural network. The purpose of averaging every five target and non-target trials was to emerge the P300 component of even-related potentials so that the target trials could be differentiated from the non-target trials. Further processing by selecting 1 of every 5 processed non-target trials increased the value of sensitivity by 10.9%, it showed that the number of false negatives of target trials was reduced. The results of the classification gave the maximum accuracy of 92.5%. The average values of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 70.8%, 89,8%, and 84.6% respectively.

Stimulus-related neural responses are increased for the attended stimulus. Does alpha-band activity mediate this effect and is it restricted to conscious sensory events (suprathreshold), or does it also extend to unconscious stimuli (subthreshold)? To address these questions, we recorded EEG in healthy male and female volunteers undergoing subthreshold and suprathreshold somatosensory electrical stimulation to the left or right index finger. The task was to detect stimulation at the randomly alternated cued index finger. Under attention, amplitudes of somatosensory evoked potentials increased 50-60 ms after stimulation (P1) for both suprathreshold and subthreshold events. Prestimulus amplitude of peri-Rolandic alpha, that is mu, showed an inverse relationship to P1 amplitude during attention compared to when the finger was unattended. Interestingly, intermediate and high amplitudes of mu rhythm were associated with the highest P1 amplitudes during attention and smallest P1 during lack of attention, that is, these levels of alpha rhythm seemed to optimally support the behavioral goal ("detect" stimuli at the cued finger while ignoring the other finger). Our results show that attention enhances neural processing for both suprathreshold and subthreshold stimuli and they highlight a rather complex interaction between attention, Rolandic alpha activity, and their effects on stimulus processing.

However, using electroencephalography (EEG), several arousal states can be distinguished before sleep onset. Recently, the Vigilance Algorithm Leipzig (VIGALL 2.0) has been developed, which automatically attributes one out of seven EEG-vigilance stages to each 1-s EEG segment, ranging from stage 0 (associated with cognitively active wakefulness), to stages A1, A2 and A3 (associated with relaxed wakefulness), to stages B1 and B2/3 (associated with drowsiness) up to stage C (indicating sleep onset). Applying VIGALL, we specified the effects of these finely differentiated EEG-vigilance stages (indicating arousal states) on EPs (P1, N1, P2, N300, MMN and P3) and behavioral performance. Subjects underwent an ignored and attended condition of a 2-h eyes-closed oddball-task. Final analysis included 43 subjects in the ignored and 51 subjects in the attended condition. First, the effect of brain arousal states on EPs and performance parameters were analyzed between EEG-vigilance stages A (i. e. A1, A2 and A3 combined), B1 and B2/3& C (i. e. B2/3 and C combined). Then, in a second step, the effects of the finely differentiated EEG-vigilance stages were further specified. Results: Comparing stages A versus B1 versus B2/3& C, a significant effect of EEG-vigilance stages on all behavioral parameters and all EPs, with exception of MMN and P3, was found. By applying VIGALL, a more detailed view of arousal effects on EP and performance was possible, such as the finding that the P2 showed no further significant increase in stages deeper than B1. Stage 0 did not differ from any of the A-stages. Within more fine-graded stages, such as the A-substages, EPs and performance only partially differed. However, these analyses were partly based on small sample sizes and future studies should take effort to get enough epochs of rare stages (such as A3 and C). Conclusions: A clear impact of arousal on EPs and behavioral performance was obtained, which emphasize the necessity to consider arousal effects when interpreting EPs.

Such information can potentially be exploited to make devices and interfacesmore user aware. In this line of research, we took a further step by studying neural correlates of different levels of cognitive processes and developing a method that allows to quantify how deeply presented information is processed in the brain. Methods/Approach : Seventeen participants took part in an EEG study in which we evaluated different levels of cognitive processing (no processing, shallow, and deep processing) within three distinct domains (memory, language, and visual imagination). Our investigations showed gradual differences in the amplitudes of event-related potentials (ERPs) and in the extend and duration of event-related desynchronization (ERD) which both correlate with task difficulty. We performed multi-modal classification to map the measured correlates of neurocognitive processing to the corresponding level of processing. Results : Successful classification of the neural components was achieved, which reflects the level of cognitive processing performed by the participants. The results show performances above chance level for each participant and a mean performance of 70-90% for all conditions and classification pairs. Significance : The successful estimation of the level of cognition on a single-trial basis supports the feasibility of user-state adaptation based on ongoing neural activity. There is a variety of potential use cases such as: a user-friendly adaptive design of an interface or the development of assistance systems in safety critical workplaces.

J	Scharinger, M; Steinberg, J; Tavano, A				Scharinger, Mathias; Steinberg, Johanna; Tavano, Alessandro			Integrating speech in time depends on temporal expectancies and attention	CORTEX			English	Article						Mismatch negativity; Prediction; Omission; Speech; Temporal integration	AUDITORY INFORMATION; SENSORY MEMORY; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; ENTRAINMENT; WINDOW; POTENTIALS; MODULATION; PREDICTION	Sensory information that unfolds in time, such as in speech perception, relies on efficient chunking mechanisms in order to yield optimally-sized units for further processing. Whether or not two successive acoustic events receive a one-unit or a two-unit interpretation seems to depend on the fit between their temporal extent and a stipulated temporal window of integration. However, there is ongoing debate on how flexible this temporal window of integration should be, especially for the processing of speech sounds. Furthermore, there is no direct evidence of whether attention may modulate the temporal constraints on the integration window. For this reason, we here examine how different word durations, which lead to different temporal separations of sound onsets, interact with attention. In an Electroencephalography (EEG) study, participants actively and passively listened to words where word-final consonants were occasionally omitted. Words had either a natural duration or were artificially prolonged in order to increase the separation of speech sound onsets. Omission responses to incomplete speech input, originating in left temporal cortex, decreased when the critical speech sound was separated from previous sounds by more than 250 msec, i.e., when the separation was larger than the stipulated temporal window of integration (125-150 msec). Attention, on the other hand, only increased omission responses for stimuli with natural durations. We complemented the event-related potential (ERP) analyses by a frequency-domain analysis on the stimulus presentation rate. Notably, the power of stimulation frequency showed the same duration and attention effects than the omission responses. We interpret these findings on the background of existing research on temporal integration windows and further suggest that our findings may be accounted for within the framework of predictive coding.

Accordingly, and contrarily to their typically developed peers, adults with autism do not show a preferential response to voices in the superior temporal sulcus; this lack of voice-specific response was previously linked to atypical processing of voices. In electroencephalography, a slow event-related potential (ERP) called the fronto-temporal positivity to voice (FTPV) is larger for vocal than for non-vocal sounds, resulting in a voice-sensitive response over right fronto-temporal sites. Here, we investigated the neurophysiological correlates of voice perception in children with and without ASD. Methods: Sixteen children with autism and 16 age-matched typically developing children heard vocal (speech and non-speech) and non-vocal sounds while their electroencephalographic activity was recorded; overall IQ was smaller in the group of children with ASD. ERP amplitudes were compared using non-parametric statistical tests at each electrode and in successive 20-ms time windows. Within each group, differences between conditions were assessed using a non-parametric Quade test between 0 and 400 ms post-stimulus. Inter-group comparisons of ERP amplitudes were performed using non-paired Kruskal-Wallis tests between 140 and 180 ms post-stimulus. Results: Typically developing children showed the classical voice-sensitive response over right fronto-temporal electrodes, for both speech and non-speech vocal sounds. Children with ASD did not show a preferential response to vocal sounds. Inter-group analysis showed no difference in the processing of vocal sounds, both speech and non-speech, but significant differences in the processing of non-vocal sounds over right fronto-temporal sites. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate a lack of voice-preferential response in children with autism spectrum disorders. In contrast to observations in adults with ASD, the lack of voice-preferential response was attributed to an atypical response to non-vocal sounds, which was overall more similar to the event-related potentials evoked by vocal sounds in both groups. This result suggests atypical maturation processes in ASD impeding the specialization of temporal regions in voice processing.

Nevertheless, outcome information in daily life is often totally or partially ambiguous. Studying how people interpret this kind of information would provide important knowledge about the human evaluative system. Methods: This study concentrates on the neural processing of partially ambiguous feedback, that is, either its valence or magnitude is unknown to participants. To address this topic, we sequentially presented valence and magnitude information; electroencephalography (EEG) response to each kind of presentation was recorded and analyzed. The event-related potential components feedback-related negativity (FRN) and P3 were used as indices of neural activity. Results: Consistent with previous literature, the FRN elicited by ambiguous valence was not significantly different from that elicited by negative valence. On the other hand, the FRN elicited by ambiguous magnitude was larger than both the large and small magnitude, indicating the motivation to seek unambiguous magnitude information. The P3 elicited by ambiguous valence and ambiguous magnitude was not significantly different from that elicited by negative valence and small magnitude, respectively, indicating the emotional significance of feedback ambiguity. Finally, the aforementioned effects also manifested in the stage of information integration. Conclusion: These findings indicate both similarities and discrepancies between the processing of valence ambiguity and that of magnitude ambiguity, which may help understand the mechanisms of ambiguous information processing.

Cortical Sensitivity to Guitar Note Patterns: EEG Entrainment to Repetition and Key	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mobile EEG; music; oddball; guitar; SSAEP; frequency tagging	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY PARADIGM; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SENSORIMOTOR SYNCHRONIZATION; NEURONAL ENTRAINMENT; NEURAL ENTRAINMENT; AUDITORY-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; MUSIC; PERCEPTION	Music is ubiquitous throughout recent human culture, and many individual's have an innate ability to appreciate and understand music. Our appreciation of music likely emerges from the brain's ability to process a series of repeated complex acoustic patterns. In order to understand these processes further, cortical responses were measured to a series of guitar notes presented with a musical pattern or without a pattern. ERP responses to individual notes were measured using a 24 electrode Bluetooth mobile EEG system (Smarting mBrainTrain) while 13 healthy non-musicians listened to structured (i.e., within musical keys and with repetition) or random sequences of guitar notes for 10 min each. We demonstrate an increased amplitude to the ERP that appears similar to 200 ms to notes presented within the musical sequence. This amplitude difference between random notes and patterned notes likely reflects individual's cortical sensitivity to guitar note patterns. These amplitudes were compared to ERP responses to a rare note embedded within a stream of frequent notes to determine whether the sensitivity to complex musical structure overlaps with the sensitivity to simple irregularities reflected in traditional auditory oddball experiments. Response amplitudes to the negative peak at similar to 175 ms are statistically correlated with the mismatch negativity (MMN) response measured to a rare note presented among a series of frequent notes (i.e., in a traditional oddball sequence), but responses to the subsequent positive peak at similar to 200 do not show a statistical relationship with the P300 response. Thus, the sensitivity to musical structure identified to 4 Hz note patterns appears somewhat distinct from the sensitivity to statistical regularities reflected in the traditional "auditory oddball" sequence. Overall, we suggest that this is a promising approach to examine individual's sensitivity to complex acoustic patterns, which may overlap with higher level cognitive processes, including language.

It is not yet clear whether this parietal-to-frontal shift is a compensatory mechanism, or simply reflects a reduction in processing efficiency. In this study we aimed to investigate how the parietal-to-frontal shift with aging relates to selective attention. Fourteen young and 26 older healthy adults performed a color Flanker task under three conditions (incongruent, congruent, neutral) and event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured. The P3 was analyzed for the electrode positions Pz, Cz, and Fz as an indicator of the parietal-to-frontal shift. Further, behavioral performance and other ERP components (P1 and N1 at electrodes O1 and O2; N2 at electrodes Fz and Cz) were investigated. First young and older adults were compared. Older adults had longer response times, reduced accuracy, longer P3 latencies, and a more frontal distribution of P3 than young adults. These results confirm the parietal-to-frontal shift in the P3 with age for the selective attention task. Second, based on the differences between frontal and parietal P3 activity the group of older adults was subdivided into those showing a rather equal distribution of the P3 and older participants showing a strong frontal focus of the P3. Older adults with a more frontally distributed P3 had longer response times than participants with a more equally distributed P3. These results suggest that the frontally distributed P3 observed in older adults has no compensatory function in selective attention but rather indicates less efficient processing and slowing with age.

Up to now, it remains largely unknown how quickly neural networks adopt specific functions during audiovisual integration of linguistic information when prereading children learn letter-speech sound correspondences. Here, we simulated the process of learning letter-speech sound correspondences in 20 prereading children (6.13-7.17 years) at varying risk for dyslexia by training artificial letter-speech sound correspondences within a single experimental session. Subsequently, we acquired simultaneously event-related potentials (ERP) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans during implicit audiovisual presentation of trained and untrained pairs. Audiovisual integration of trained pairs correlated with individual learning rates in right superior temporal, left inferior temporal, and bilateral parietal areas and with phonological awareness in left temporal areas. In correspondence, a differential left-lateralized parietooccipitotemporal ERP at 400 ms for trained pairs correlated with learning achievement and familial risk. Finally, a late (650 ms) posterior negativity indicating audiovisual congruency of trained pairs was associated with increased fMRI activation in the left occipital cortex. Taken together, a short (<30 min) letter-speech sound training initializes audiovisual integration in neural systems that are responsible for processing linguistic information in proficient readers. To conclude, the ability to learn grapheme-phoneme correspondences, the familial history of reading disability, and phonological awareness of prereading children account for the degree of audiovisual integration in a distributed brain network. Such findings on emerging linguistic audiovisual integration could allow for distinguishing between children with typical and atypical reading development. Hum Brain Mapp 38:1038-1055, 2017.

Acquiring research-grade ERPs on a shoestring budget: A comparison of a modified Emotiv and commercial SynAmps EEG system	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EPOC; mismatch negativity; MMN; modified EMOTIV EPOC; wireless EEG	WIRELESS EEG; METAANALYSIS	This study compared the performance of a low-cost wireless EEG system to a research-grade EEG system on an auditory oddball task designed to elicit N200 and P300 ERP components. Participants were 15 healthy adults (6 female) aged between 19 and 40 (M=28.56; SD=6.38). An auditory oddball task was presented comprising 1,200 presentations of a standard tone interspersed by 300 trials comprising a deviant tone. EEG was simultaneously recorded from a modified Emotiv EPOC and a NeuroScan SynAmps RT EEG system. The modifications made to the Emotiv system included attaching research grade electrodes to the Bluetooth transmitter. Additional modifications enabled the Emotiv system to connect to a portable impedance meter. The cost of these modifications and portable impedance meter approached the purchase value of the Emotiv system. Preliminary analyses revealed significantly more trials were rejected from data acquired by the modified Emotiv compared to the SynAmps system. However, the ERP waveforms captured by the Emotiv system were found to be highly similar to the corresponding waveform from the SynAmps system. The latency and peak amplitude of N200 and P300 components were also found to be similar between systems. Overall, the results indicate that, in the context of an oddball task, the ERP acquired by a low-cost wireless EEG system can be of comparable quality to research-grade EEG acquisition equipment.

J	Steinmetzger, K; Rosen, S				Steinmetzger, Kurt; Rosen, Stuart			Effects of acoustic periodicity, intelligibility, and pre-stimulus alpha power on the event-related potentials in response to speech	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						EEG; Speech; Intelligibility; Periodicity; CNV; Pre-stimulus alpha power	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; OSCILLATIONS PREDICT; BAND ACTIVITY; ATTENTION; BRAIN; EEG; DYNAMICS; CORTEX; PITCH	Magneto- and electroencephalographic (M/EEG) signals in response to acoustically degraded speech have been examined by several recent studies. Unambiguously interpreting the results is complicated by the fact that speech signal manipulations affect acoustics and intelligibility alike. In the current EEG study, the acoustic properties of the stimuli were altered and the trials were sorted according to the correctness of the listeners' spoken responses to separate out these two factors. Firstly, more periodicity (i.e. voicing) rendered the event-related potentials (ERPs) more negative during the first second after sentence onset, indicating a greater cortical sensitivity to auditory input with a pitch. Secondly, we observed a larger contingent negative variation (CNV) during sentence presentation when the subjects could subsequently repeat more words correctly. Additionally, slow alpha power (7-10 Hz) before sentences with the least correctly repeated words was increased, which may indicate that subjects have not been focussed on the upcoming task.

In the first experiment, ten healthy participants were exposed to stimulation of the right median nerve while registering brain activity using 32-channel electroencephalography. Electrical stimulations were organized in four blocks of 20 stimuli with four intensities - 100%, 120%, 140%, and 160% - of the electrical pain threshold. In the second experiment, 15 healthy participants received electrical stimulation on the dominant median nerve before and during the application of a second painful stimulus. Raw data were converted into the time-frequency domain by applying a continuous wavelet transform. Separated domain information was extracted by calculating Parafac models. The results demonstrated that it is possible to capture a reproducible cortical neural response after painful electrical stimulation, more specifically at 250 milliseconds poststimulus, at the midline electrodes Cz and FCz with predominant delta-oscillations. The signature of the top-down nociceptive inhibitory mechanisms is delta-activity at 235 ms poststimulus at the prefrontal electrodes. This study presents a methodology to overcome the a priori determination of the regions of interest to analyze the brain response after painful electrical stimulation.

The data were collected from 16 normal-hearing participants in a double-oddball paradigm that contained a consonant (/ba/ to /da/) and vowel (/ba/ to /bu/) change in quiet and noise (speech-babble background at a 3 dB signal-to-noise ratio) conditions. Time frequency analysis was applied to obtain inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) measures in delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands for the P3 response. Behavioral measures included percent correct phoneme detection and reaction time as well as percent correct IEEE sentence recognition in quiet and in noise. Linear mixed-effects models were applied to determine possible brain-behavior correlates. A significant noise-induced reduction in P3 amplitude was found, accompanied by significantly longer P3 latency and decreases in ITPC across all frequency bands of interest. There was a differential effect of noise on consonant discrimination and vowel discrimination in both ERP and behavioral measures, such that noise impacted the detection of the consonant change more than the vowel change. The P3 amplitude and some of the ITPC and ERSP measures were significant predictors of speech perception at segmental- and sentence-levels across listening conditions and stimuli. These data demonstrate that the P3 response with its associated cortical oscillations represents a potential neurophysiological marker for speech perception in noise. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The preparation and execution of motor responses is thus an essential part of pain. However, it is not yet fully understood how pain and motor processes interact in the brain. Here we used electroencephalography to investigate the effects of pain on motor preparation in the human brain. Twenty healthy human participants performed a motor task in which they performed button presses to stop increasingly painful thermal stimuli when they became intolerable. In another condition, participants performed button presses without concurrent stimulation. The results show that the amplitudes of preparatory event-related desynchronizations at alpha and beta frequencies did not differ between conditions. In contrast, the amplitude of the preparatory readiness potential was reduced when a button press was performed to stop a painful stimulus compared with a button press without concomitant pain. A control experiment with nonpainful thermal stimuli showed a similar reduction of the readiness potential when a button press was performed to stop a nonpainful thermal stimulus. Together, these findings indicate that painful and nonpainful thermal stimuli can similarly influence motor preparation in the human brain. Pain-specific effects on motor preparation in the human brain remain to be demonstrated. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Pain is inherently linked to motor processes, but the interactions between pain and motor processes in the human brain are not yet fully understood. Using electroencephalography, we show that pain reduces movement-preparatory brain activity. Further results indicate that this effect is not pain specific but independent of the modality of stimulation.

In order to model a group situation, two faces displaying happy, neutral or angry expressions were presented. Importantly, faces were either facing the observer, or they were presented in profile view directed towards, or looking away from each other. In Experiment 1 (n = 64), face pairs were rated regarding perceived relevance, wish-to-interact, and displayed interactivity, as well as valence and arousal. All variables revealed main effects of facial expression (emotional > neutral), face orientation (facing observer > towards > away) and interactions showed that evaluation of emotional faces strongly varies with their orientation. Experiment 2 (n = 33) examined the temporal dynamics of perceptual-attentional processing of these face constellations with event-related potentials. Processing of emotional and neutral faces differed significantly in N170 amplitudes, early posterior negativity (EPN), and sustained positive potentials. Importantly, selective emotional face processing varied as a function of face orientation, indicating early emotion-specific (N170, EPN) and late threat-specific effects (LPP, sustained positivity). Taken together, perceived personal relevance to the observer-conveyed by facial expression and face direction-amplifies emotional face processing within triadic group situations.

However, the neural mechanisms underlying this mental exercise and its temporal course have hardly been investigated. Here, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to explore the effects of chanting the name of a Buddha (Amitabha) on the brains response to viewing negative pictures that were fear- and stress-provoking. We recorded and analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) data from 21 Buddhists with chanting experience as they viewed negative and neutral pictures. Participants were instructed to chant the names of Amitabha or Santa Claus silently to themselves or simply remain silent (no-chanting condition) during picture viewing. To measure the physiological changes corresponding to negative emotions, electrocardiogram and galvanic skin response data were also collected. Results showed that viewing negative pictures (vs. neutral pictures) increased the amplitude of the N1 component in all the chanting conditions. The amplitude of late positive potential (LPP) also increased when the negative pictures were viewed under the no-chanting and the Santa Claus condition. However, increased LPP was not observed when chanting Amitabha. The ERP source analysis confirmed this finding and showed that increased LPP mainly originated from the central-parietal regions of the brain. In addition, the participants heart rates decreased significantly when viewing negative pictures in the Santa Claus condition. The no-chanting condition had a similar decreasing trend although not significant. However, while chanting Amitabha and viewing negative pictures participants heart rate did not differ significantly from that observed during neutral picture viewing. It is possible that the chanting of Amitabha might have helped the participants to develop a religious schema and neutralized the effect of the negative stimuli. These findings echo similar research findings on Christian religious practices and brain responses to negative stimuli. Hence, prayer/religious practices may have cross-cultural universality in emotion regulation. This study shows for the first time that Buddhist chanting, or in a broader sense, repetition of religious prayers will not modulate brain responses to negative stimuli during the early perceptual stage, but only during the late-stage emotional/cognitive processing.

Contemporary knowledge justifies early diagnoses of the alcohol risk degree among adolescents, or even children, including their families, involving an examination of the P300 potential as an endophenotype, prior to achievement of an age of alcohol initiation. The results of such research approaches may be of importance not only cognitively, but also of prophylactically, in the early recognition of increased susceptibility to alcohol. The simplicity and non-invasiveness, and the exceptionally low costs of the methods described, should obtain for the present as well as in the future, a wider examination, one potentially even mass scope of in character and usefulness. The knowledge of such an endophenotype and genetically-related susceptibility, in the individual, family, and social dimension and transmission, and in the rearing of children and adolescents, could protect - not just individuals - but many from entering into the route of addiction, which is most frequently the effect of acting unaware and with negative life consequences, both generational and transgenerational for generations to come.

In the present study, we apply psychophysics and gustatory event-related potentials (gERPs) to explore age-related differences in the processing of gustatory information as indicated by the cerebral sources of the gERP. A total of 96 subjects (47 female), subdivided into four groups with increasing age, participated in the study. After olfactory and gustatory screening for normal function, the subjects were invited to two sessions of gERP acquisition. They received a randomized combination of five isointense basic tastants that were presented at a medium level. At the same time, we recorded scalp electroencephalography (EEG) from 128 scalp locations. Psychophysical testing for smell and taste function exhibited a significant decrease with age. Topographical analyses of the EEG delineated four basic topographical maps that explained the processing of taste in the pre-decline age range, with sources inside the relevant gustatory areas. The age-related change of gustatory processing was associated with the absence of a specific map with sources inside the cerebellum and posterior insula, and the temporal broadening of a map with sources in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus. These results confirm the hypothesis that the reduction of taste function with aging is not only due to degradation of gustatory peripheral tissues but is also related to different neural signatures in the central nervous system.

Neural cascade of conflict processing: Not just time-on-task	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Conflict processing; Task difficulty; Cognitive control; Time-on-task; EEG	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL PROCESSES; RESPONSE CONFLICT; STROOP TASK; ERROR LIKELIHOOD; FLANKER TASK; HUMAN BRAIN; DYNAMICS; INTERFERENCE	In visual conflict tasks (e.g., Stroop or flanker), response times (RTs) are generally longer on incongruent trials relative to congruent ones. Two event-related-potential (ERP) components classically associated with the processing of stimulus conflict are the fronto-central, incongruency-related negativity (N-inc) and the posterior late-positive complex (LPC), which are derived from the ERP difference waves for incongruent minus congruent trials. It has been questioned, however, whether these effects, or other neural measures of incongruency (e.g., fMRI responses in the anterior cingulate), reflect true conflict processing, or whether such effects derive mainly from differential time-on-task. To address this question, we leveraged high-temporal-resolution ERP measures of brain activity during two behavioral tasks. The first task, a modified Erikson flanker paradigm (with congruent and incongruent trials), was used to evoke the classic RT and ERP effects associated with conflict. The second was a non-conflict control task in which, participants visually discriminated a single stimulus (with easy and hard discrimination conditions). Behaviorally, the parameters were titrated to yield similar RT effects of conflict and difficulty (27 ms). Neurally, both within-task contrasts showed an initial fronto-central negative polarity wave (N2-latency effect), but they then diverged. In the difficulty difference wave, the initial negativity led directly into the posterior LPC, whereas in the incongruency contrast the initial negativity was followed a by a second fronto-central negative peak (N-inc), which was then followed by a considerably longer-latency LPC. These results provide clear evidence that the longer processing for incongruent stimulus inputs do not just reflect time-on-task or difficulty, but include a true conflict-processing component.

This is motivation enough to classify emotions using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. This paper describes the acquisition of evoked EEG signals for classification of emotions into four quadrants. The EEG signals have been collected from 24 subjects on three electrodes (Fz, Cz and Pz) along the central line. The absolute and differential attributes of single trial ERPs have been used to classify emotions. The single trial ERP attributes collected from each electrode have been used for developing an emotion classifier for each subject. The accuracy of classification of emotions into four classes lies between 62.5-83.3% for single trials. The subject independent analysis has been done using absolute and differential attributes of single trial signals of ERP. An overall accuracy of 55% has been obtained on Fz electrode for multi subject trials. The methodology used to classify emotions by fixing the attributes for classification of emotions brings us a step closer to developing a real time emotion recognition system with benefits including applications like Brain-Computer Interface for locked-in subjects, emotion classification for highly sensitive jobs like fighter pilots etc. (C) 2017 Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

Olfactory loss is among the first non-motor symptoms of the disease; however, in light of the many causes of smell loss, it is a very unspecific biomarker and should only be used as part of a diagnostic test battery. In this study, we investigated the olfactory response in 71 subjects, consisting of Parkinson's disease patients, hyposmic and anosmic patients of other causes, and normosmic individuals searching for sensitive, distinct biomarkers for which we used scalp event-related 64-channel electroencephalography and psychophysical tests. The analysis of the global field power indicated significant measurable differences between patients with Parkinson's disease and otherwise olfactory dysfunctional and normosmic individuals. The localization of brain sources, in particular, provides evidence for differences in mainly late EEG-components suggesting a decline of central brain networks as a causal factor for olfactory loss in Parkinson's disease. The findings indicate a different pattern of olfactory processing in patients with Parkinson's disease compared to olfactory dysfunctions of other origin, which provide further insights into the mechanisms behind olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's.

To solve this issue, we used auditory-evoked EEG responses to assess novelty detection (MMN component) and involuntary attentional orientation (P3 component) induced by socially-relevant, human-produced, biological sounds and acoustically-matched control stimuli in children with ASD and controls. Results show that early sensory and novelty processing of biological stimuli are preserved in ASD, but that automatic attentional orientation for biological sounds is markedly altered. These results support the notion that at least some cognitive processes of ASD are specifically altered when it comes to processing social stimuli.

An ERP Experiment on the Learnability of Consonant Clusters	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						consonant clusters; sonority; ERPs (Event-Related Potentials); learnability; Polish language; frequency	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SYLLABLE STRUCTURE; CONSTRAINTS; GRAMMAR; HYPOTHESIS; WORDS; JAPANESE; MEMORY; ONSET; USAGE	Phonological knowledge of a language involves knowledge about which segments can be combined under what conditions. Languages vary in the quantity and quality of licensed combinations, in particular sequences of consonants, with Polish being a language with a large inventory of such combinations. The present paper reports on a two-session experiment in which Polish-speaking adult participants learned nonce words with final consonant clusters. The aim was to study the role of two factors which potentially play a role in the learning of phonotactic structures: the phonological principle of sonority (ordering sound segments within the syllable according to their inherent loudness) and the (non-) existence as a usage-based phenomenon. EEG responses in two different time windows (adversely to behavioral responses) show linguistic processing by native speakers of Polish to be sensitive to both distinctions, in spite of the fact that Polish is rich in sonority-violating clusters. In particular, a general learning effect in terms of an N400 effect was found which was demonstrated to be different for sonority-obeying clusters than for sonority-violating clusters. Furthermore, significant interactions of formedness and session, and of existence and session, demonstrate that both factors, the sonority principle and the frequency pattern, play a role in the learning process.

Consistent with this hypothesis, reaction times (RTs) and latencies of event-related potential have been shown to be moderately associated with intelligence. These associations have been explained either in terms of individual differences in some brain-wide property such as myelination, the speed of neural oscillations, or white-matter tract integrity, or in terms of individual differences in specific processes such as the signal-to-noise ratio in evidence accumulation, executive control, or the cholinergic system. Here we show in a sample of 122 participants, who completed a battery of RT tasks at 2 laboratory sessions while an EEG was recorded, that more intelligent individuals have a higher speed of higher-order information processing that explains about 80% of the variance in general intelligence. Our results do not support the notion that individuals with higher levels of general intelligence show advantages in some brain-wide property. Instead, they suggest that more intelligent individuals benefit from a more efficient transmission of information from frontal attention and working memory processes to temporal-parietal processes of memory storage.

Rhythmic Activity and Individual Variability in Recognition Memory: Theta Oscillations Correlate with Performance whereas Alpha Oscillations Correlate with ERPs	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EEG-ALPHA; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; EPISODIC MEMORY; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; MENTAL-IMAGERY; SEMANTIC MEMORY; TASK; RETRIEVAL; SYNCHRONIZATION	During study trials of a recognition memory task, alpha (approximate to 10 Hz) oscillations decrease, and concurrently, theta (4-8 Hz) oscillations increase when later memory is successful versus unsuccessful (subsequent memory effect). Likewise, at test, reduced alpha and increased theta activity are associated with successful memory (retrieval success effect). Here we take an individual-differences approach to test three hypotheses about theta and alpha oscillations in verbal, old/new recognition, measuring the difference in oscillations between hit trials and miss trials. First, we test the hypothesis that theta and alpha oscillations have a moderately mutually exclusive relationship; but no support for this hypothesis was found. Second, we test the hypothesis that theta oscillations explain not only memory effects within participants, but also individual differences. Supporting this prediction, durations of theta (but not alpha) oscillations at study and at test correlated significantly with d across participants. Third, we test the hypothesis that theta and alpha oscillations reflect familiarity and recollection processes by comparing oscillation measures to ERPs that are implicated in familiarity and recollection. The alpha-oscillation effects correlated with some ERP measures, but inversely, suggesting that the actions of alpha oscillations on memory processes are distinct from the roles of familiarity- and recollection-linked ERP signals. The theta-oscillation measures, despite differentiating hits from misses, did not correlate with any ERP measure; thus, theta oscillations may reflect elaborative processes not tapped by recollection-related ERPs. Our findings are consistent with alpha oscillations reflecting visual inattention, which can modulate memory, and with theta oscillations supporting recognition memory in ways that complement the most commonly studied ERPs.

Before and after an acute stressor or a control condition, 39 healthy men performed a go/no-go task while ERPs (N2, P3), reaction times, errors, and salivary cortisol were measured. Acute stress impaired neither accuracy nor reaction times, but differentially affected the neural correlates of response inhibition; namely, stress led to enhanced amplitudes of the N2 difference waves (N2d, no-go minus go), indicating enhanced response inhibition and conflict monitoring. Moreover, participants responding to the stressor with an acute substantial rise in cortisol (high cortisol responders) showed reduced amplitudes of the P3 of the difference waves (P3d, no-go minus go) after the stressor, indicating an impaired evaluation and finalization of the inhibitory process. Our findings indicate that stress leads to a reallocation of cognitive resources to the neural subprocesses of inhibitory control, strengthening premotor response inhibition and the detection of response conflict, while concurrently diminishing the subsequent finalization process within the stream of processing.

Mandarin-speaking participants were asked to name individually presented target pictures and ignore a superimposed two-character Chinese word distractor. The target and distractor were either categorically related (belonging to the same semantic category), associatively related (semantically related but not categorically related), phonologically related, or unrelated. The typical categorical interference (slower picture naming with a categorically related distractor relative to an unrelated control) was found. Furthermore, significant event-related brain potential effects were obtained in categorical and associative conditions in the time window between 275 and 450 ms post-target. By using response-locked analysis, significant effects of Target-distractor Relatedness were observed only in the associative condition within the 300-ms pre-response period. These results are consistent with the theories that assume lexical selection by competition in explaining the categorical interference effect.

EEG displays the electrical activity of brain and, nowadays it is the most common tool for the diagnosis of neurological maladies. This paper aims at effective de-noising of EEG signals. EEG is obtained by recording the spontaneous electrical activity of the brain over a period of time and it may contain a whole lot of information. This information can be decoded by signal processing methods, but in most cases artifacts interrupt these signals. The recommended approach is based on ICA which is proven better by performance analysis having 96% accuracy and can decompose EEG recording into a number of event related and artifacts related potentials. This study shows that the proposed method significantly enhance the classification accuracy, by effective identification and removal of artifacts.	[Lakshmi, K. G.

Grounded on the assumption that reminders of mortality may recruit threat-defence mechanisms similar to the ones activated by painful nociceptive stimuli, we hypothesize that the effects exerted by linguistic reminders of death on pain perception and brain activity would be elicited by passive observation of death-related pictures vs. more generic threat-related pictures. Results showed an increase of the laser evoked P2 amplitude and oscillatory theta activity when participants observed death-related images. However, no change in pain ratings was found. Moreover, observation of death-related content was linked to increased oscillatory alpha desynchronisation but not to variations of visual evoked potentials amplitude. Our findings indicate that pairing potentially noxious stimuli with death-related images exerts a preferential modulation of nociceptive and visual cortical representations.

Neurophysiological correlates of vertical disparity in 3D images are studied in an objective approach using EEG technique. These disparities are known to negatively affect the quality of experience and to cause visual discomfort in stereoscopic visualizations. Approach. We have presented four conditions to subjects: one in 2D and three conditions in 3D, one without vertical disparity and two with different vertical disparity levels. Event related potentials (ERPs) are measured for each condition and the differences between ERP components are studied. Analysis is also performed on the induced potentials in the time frequency domain. Main results. Results show that there is a significant increase in the amplitude of P1 components in 3D conditions in comparison to 2D. These results are consistent with previous studies which have shown that P1 amplitude increases due to the depth perception in 3D compared to 2D. However the amplitude is significantly smaller for maximum vertical disparity (3D-3) in comparison to 3D with no vertical disparity. Our results therefore suggest that the vertical disparity in 3D-3 condition decreases the perception of depth compared to other 3D conditions and the amplitude of P1 component can be used as a discriminative feature. Significance. The results show that the P1 component increases in amplitude due to the depth perception in the 3D stimuli compared to the 2D stimulus. On the other hand the vertical disparity in the stereoscopic images is studied here. We suggest that the amplitude of P1 component is modulated with this parameter and decreases due to the decrease in the perception of depth.

Deployment of Mobile EEG Technology in an Art Museum Setting: Evaluation of Signal Quality and Usability	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						MoBI; aesthetics; EEG; dry-electrodes; signal quality; museum; real-world recording	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; TREADMILL WALKING; ELECTRODES; ARTIFACTS; COGNITION; DESIGN; SYSTEM; ERP	Electroencephalography (EEG) has emerged as a powerful tool for quantitatively studying the brain that enables natural and mobile experiments. Recent advances in EEG have allowed for the use of dry electrodes that do not require a conductive medium between the recording electrode and the scalp. The overall goal of this research was to gain an understanding of the overall usability and signal quality of dry EEG headsets compared to traditional gel-based systems in an unconstrained environment. EEG was used to collect Mobile Brain-body Imaging (MoBI) data from 432 people as they experienced an art exhibit in a public museum. The subjects were instrumented with either one of four dry electrode EEG systems or a conventional gel electrode EEG system. Each of the systems was evaluated based on the signal quality and usability in a real-world setting. First, we describe the various artifacts that were characteristic of each of the systems. Second, we report on each system's usability and their limitations in a mobile setting. Third, to evaluate signal quality for task discrimination and characterization, we employed a data driven clustering approach on the data from 134 of the 432 subjects (those with reliable location tracking information and usable EEG data) to evaluate the power spectral density (PSD) content of the EEG recordings. The experiment consisted of a baseline condition in which the subjects sat quietly facing a white wall for 1 min. Subsequently, the participants were encouraged to explore the exhibit for as long as they wished (piece-viewing). No constraints were placed upon the individual in relation to action, time, or navigation of the exhibit. In this freely-behaving approach, the EEG systems varied in their capacity to record characteristic modulations in the EEG data, with the gel-based system more clearly capturing stereotypical alpha and beta-band modulations.

Preliminary investigation of Brain Network Activation (BNA) and its clinical utility in sport-related concussion	BRAIN INJURY			English	Article						Concussion management; sports-related concussion (SRC); mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI); event related potential (ERP); functional brain imaging; Brain Network Activation (BNA); electroencephalogram (EEG)	STATES HIGH-SCHOOL; INJURY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; CONNECTIVITY; ATTENTION; RECOVERY; ERPS	Background: The clinical diagnosis and management of patients with sport-related concussion is largely dependent on subjectively reported symptoms, clinical examinations, cognitive, balance, vestibular and oculomotor testing. Consequently, there is an unmet need for objective assessment tools that can identify the injury from a physiological perspective and add an important layer of information to the clinician's decision-making process.Objective: The goal of the study was to evaluate the clinical utility of the EEG-based tool named Brain Network Activation (BNA) as a longitudinal assessment method of brain function in the management of young athletes with concussion.Methods: Athletes with concussion (n = 86) and age-matched controls (n = 81) were evaluated at four time points with symptom questionnaires and BNA. BNA scores were calculated by comparing functional networks to a previously defined normative reference brain network model to the same cognitive task.Results: Subjects above 16 years of age exhibited a significant decrease in BNA scores immediately following injury, as well as notable changes in functional network activity, relative to the controls. Three representative case studies of the tested population are discussed in detail, to demonstrate the clinical utility of BNA.Conclusion: The data support the utility of BNA to augment clinical examinations, symptoms and additional tests by providing an effective method for evaluating objective electrophysiological changes associated with sport-related concussions.

Effects of Emotional Valence on Hemispheric Asymmetries in Response Inhibition	SYMMETRY-BASEL			English	Article						emotion; lateralisation; hemispheric asymmetry; executive functions; EEG	INFERIOR FRONTAL-CORTEX; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; CEREBRAL ASYMMETRY; BRAIN; LATERALIZATION; STIMULUS; TASK; EXPRESSION; COMPONENTS; CONFLICT	Hemispheric asymmetries are a major organizational principle in human emotion processing, but their interaction with prefrontal control processes is not well understood. To this end, we determined whether hemispheric differences in response inhibition depend on the emotional valence of the stimulus being inhibited. Participants completed a lateralised Go/Nogo task, in which Nogo stimuli were neutral or emotional (either positive or negative) images, while Go stimuli were scrambled versions of the same pictures. We recorded the N2 and P3 event-related potential (ERP) components, two common electrophysiological measures of response inhibition processes. Behaviourally, participants were more accurate in withholding responses to emotional than to neutral stimuli. Electrophysiologically, Nogo-P3 responses were greater for emotional than for neutral stimuli, an effect driven primarily by an enhanced response to positive images. Hemispheric asymmetries were also observed, with greater Nogo-P3 following left versus right visual field stimuli. However, the visual field effect did not interact with emotion. We therefore find no evidence that emotion-related asymmetries affect response inhibition processes.

A brief historical perspective on the advent of brain oscillations in the biological and psychological disciplines	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Review						Oscillatory dynamics; Principles of oscillatory dynamics; Delta; Theta; Alpha; Beta; Gamma; Spatiotemporal integration; Coherence; Biomarker	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY ODDBALL TASK; TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; EEG DELTA OSCILLATIONS; EARLY GAMMA RESPONSE; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; ALZHEIMER PATIENTS; ERP RESPONSES	We aim to review the historical evolution that has led to the study of the brain (body)-mind relationship based on brain oscillations, to outline and illustrate the principles of neuro-oscillatory dynamics using research findings. The paper addresses the relevant developments in behavioral sciences after Wundt established the science of psychology, and developments in the neurosciences after alpha and gamma oscillations were discovered by Berger and Adrian, respectively. Basic neuroscientific studies have led to a number of principles: (1) spontaneous EEG is composed of a set of oscillatory components, (2) the brain responds with oscillatory activity, (3) poststimulus oscillatory activity is a function of prestimulus activity, (4) the brain response results from a superposition of oscillatory components, (5) there are multiplicities with regard to oscillations and functions, and (6) oscillations are spatially integrated. Findings of clinical studies suggest that oscillatory responses can serve as biomarkers for neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the field of psychology is still making limited use of neuro-oscillatory dynamics for a bio-behavioral understanding of cognitive-affective processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zhang, QF; Cheng, QR; Li, HX; Dong, X; Tu, WJ				Zhang, Qinfen; Cheng, Qirui; Li, Hongxin; Dong, Xuan; Tu, Wenjuan			Evaluation of auditory perception development in neonates by quantitative electroencephalography and auditory eventrelated potentials	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EEG POWER; AGE; CHILDHOOD; CHILDREN; INFANTS	Objective The present study was performed to investigate neonatal auditory perception function by quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) and auditory event-related potentials (aERPs) and identify the characteristics of auditory perception development in newborns. Methods Fifty-three normal full-term neonates were divided into three groups according their age in days. An auditory oddball paradigm was used. QEEG (resting state and task state) and aERPs were performed. EEG d power in the resting and task states and at different ages was respectively analyzed. The N2 area and latency of aERPs at different ages were also compared. Results The four main findings of this study are as follows. First, the increase in the EEG d power was significantly greater in the task than resting state in Group 3 at the Fz lead (t = -3.371, P = 0.004) and in Groups 2 and 3 at the Cz lead (Group 2: t = -3.149, P = 0.005; Group 3: t = -3.609, P = 0.002). Second, the d power gradually increased from 1 to 10 days of age (Group 1), peaked at 11 to 20 days (Group 2), and gradually decreased from 21 to 28 days (Group 3). The data in the Fz lead during the task state and in the Cz lead during the resting and task states were statistically significant (F = 5.875, P = 0.005; F = 5.523, P = 0.007; and F = 5.402, P = 0.008, respectively). Third, the N2 area significantly increased with age by presentation of target stimuli (F = 5.26, P = 0.01). The N2 area increased most significantly from 21 to 28 days (Group 3). Finally, the N2 latency significantly decreased with age (Fz lead: F = 4.66, P = 0.023; Cz lead: F = 7.18, P = 0.005). The N2 latency decreased most significantly from 11 to 20 days of age (Group 2). Conclusion Rapid cognitive development occurs during the neonatal period.

Recent behavioral studies have revealed that the statistical properties found within and across modalities can serve as cues for both processes. However, segmentation and mapping have been largely studied separately, and thus it remains unclear whether both processes can be accomplished at the same time and if they share common neurophysiological features. To address this question, we recorded EEG of 20 adult participants during both an audio alone speech segmentation task and an audiovisual word-to-picture association task. The participants were tested for both the implicit detection of online mismatches (structural auditory and visual semantic violations) as well as for the explicit recognition of words and word-to-picture associations. The ERP results from the learning phase revealed a delayed learning-related fronto-central negativity (FN400) in the audiovisual condition compared to the audio alone condition. Interestingly, while online structural auditory violations elicited clear MMN/N200 components in the audio alone condition, visual-semantic violations induced meaning-related N400 modulations in the audiovisual condition. The present results support the idea that speech segmentation and meaning mapping can take place in parallel and act in synergy to enhance novel word learning.

Methods: In this case-control study, 30 first-episode schizophrenia patients, 26 siblings, and 30 healthy controls were enrolled. They completed facial emotion recognition tasks from the Ekman Standard Faces Database as an induction for evoked potentials. Evoked potential data were obtained using a 64-channel electroencephalography system. Average evoked potential waveforms were computed from epochs for each stimulus type. The amplitudes and latency of the event-related potentials for P100 (positive potential 100 ms after stimulus onset), N170 (negative potential 170 ms after stimulus onset), and N250 (fronto-central peak) were investigated at O1, O2, P7, and P8 electrode locations. Results: There were significant differences between the groups for P100 amplitude (F = 11.526, P < 0.001), electrode position (F = 450.592, P < 0.001), emotion (disgust vs. happiness vs. fear) (F = 1722.467, P < 0.001), and emotion intensity (low vs. moderate vs. high) (F = 1737.169, P < 0.001). Post hoc analysis showed significantly larger amplitudes in the schizophrenia group at the O1, O2, P7, and P8 electrode positions. There were no significant differences between the siblings of schizophrenia patients and the healthy controls. Conclusions: Patients with schizophrenia showed abnormalities in P100 amplitude, but similar results were not observed in their siblings. These results provide evidence of dysfunctional event-related potential patterns underlying facial emotion processing in patients with schizophrenia. P100 may be a characteristic index of schizophrenia.

Acute low-level alcohol consumption reduces phase locking of event-related oscillations in rodents	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG phase synchrony; Event-related oscillations; Ethanol; Voluntary consumption; Rat	BRAIN; RATS	Event-related oscillations (EROS) are rhythmic changes that are evoked by a sensory and/or cognitive stimulus that can influence the dynamics of the EEG. EROs are defined by the decomposition of the EEG signal into magnitude (energy) and phase information and can be elicited in both humans and animals. EROs have been linked to several relevant genes associated with ethanol dependence phenotypes in humans and are altered in selectively bred alcohol-preferring rats. However, pharmacological studies are only beginning to emerge investigating the impact low intoxicating doses of ethanol can have on event-related neural oscillations. The main goal of this study was to investigate the effects of low levels of voluntary consumption of ethanol, in rats, on phase locking of EROs in order to give further insight into the acute intoxicating effects of ethanol on the brain. To this end, we allow rats to self-administer unsweetened 20% ethanol over 15 intermittent sessions. This method results in a stable low-dose consumption of ethanol. Using an auditory event-related potential "oddball" paradigm, we investigated the effects of alcohol on the phase variability of EROs from electrodes implanted into the frontal cortex, dorsal hippocampus, and amygdala. We found that intermittent ethanol self-administration was sufficient to produce a significant reduction in overall intraregional synchrony across all targeted regions. These data suggest that phase locking of EROs within brain regions known to be impacted by alcohol may represent a sensitive biomarker of low levels of alcohol intoxication.

Fluctuations in instantaneous frequency predict alpha amplitude during visual perception	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							GAMMA OSCILLATION FREQUENCY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; EEG SYNCHRONIZATION; CORTICAL NETWORKS; INHIBITION; EXCITATION; CORTEX; BRAIN	Rhythmic neural activity in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) is thought to have an important role in the selective processing of visual information. Typically, modulations in alpha amplitude and instantaneous frequency are thought to reflect independent mechanisms impacting dissociable aspects of visual information processing. However, in complex systems with interacting oscillators such as the brain, amplitude and frequency are mathematically dependent. Here, we record electroencephalography in human subjects and show that both alpha amplitude and instantaneous frequency predict behavioral performance in the same visual discrimination task. Consistent with a model of coupled oscillators, we show that fluctuations in instantaneous frequency predict alpha amplitude on a single trial basis, empirically demonstrating that these metrics are not independent. This interdependence suggests that changes in amplitude and instantaneous frequency reflect a common change in the excitatory and inhibitory neural activity that regulates alpha oscillations and visual information processing.

To characterize the magnitude of this ICA uncertainty and to understand the extent to which it may influence findings within ERP and EEG investigations, ICA decompositions of EEG data from 32 college-aged young adults were repeated 30 times for three popular ICA algorithms. Following each decomposition, eyeblink components were identified and removed. The remaining components were back-projected, and the resulting clean EEG data were further used to analyze ERPs. Findings revealed that ICA uncertainty results in variation in P3 amplitude as well as variation across all EEG sampling points, but differs across ICA algorithms as a function of the spatial location of the EEG channel. This investigation highlights the potential of ICA uncertainty to introduce additional sources of variance when the data are back-projected without artifact components. Careful selection of ICA algorithms and parameters can reduce the extent to which ICA uncertainty may introduce an additional source of variance within ERP/EEG studies.

J	Lu, N; Li, TF; Ren, XD; Miao, HY				Lu, Na; Li, Tengfei; Ren, Xiaodong; Miao, Hongyu			A Deep Learning Scheme for Motor Imagery Classification based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); deep learning; motor imagery; restricted Boltzman machine (RBM)	EEG; ERP	Motor imagery classification is an important topic in brain-computer interface (BCI) research that enables the recognition of a subject's intension to, e.g., implement prosthesis control. The brain dynamics of motor imagery are usually measured by electroencephalography (EEG) as nonstationary time series of low signal-to-noise ratio. Although a variety of methods have been previously developed to learn EEG signal features, the deep learning idea has rarely been explored to generate new representation of EEG features and achieve further performance improvement for motor imagery classification. In this study, a novel deep learning scheme based on restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is proposed. Specifically, frequency domain representations of EEG signals obtained via fast Fourier transform(FFT) and wavelet package decomposition (WPD) are obtained to train three RBMs. These RBMs are then stacked up with an extra output layer to form a four-layer neural network, which is named the frequential deep belief network (FDBN). The output layer employs the softmax regression to accomplish the classification task. Also, the conjugate gradient method and backpropagation are used to fine tune the FDBN. Extensive and systematic experiments have been performed on public benchmark datasets, and the results show that the performance improvement of FDBN over other selected state-of-the-art methods is statistically significant. Also, several findings that may be of significant interest to the BCI community are presented in this article.

The aim of our investigation was an estimation how well a passive Brain-Computer Interface (pBCI) can work in an autonomous driving scenario. The evaluation considered speed and accuracy of self-applicability by an untrained person, quality of recorded EEG data, shifts of electrode positions on the head after driving-related movements, usability, and complexity of the system as such and wearing comfort over time. An experiment was conducted inside and outside of a stationary vehicle with running engine, air-conditioning, and muted radio. Signal quality was sufficient for standard EEG analysis in the time and frequency domain as well as for the use in pBCIs. While the influence of vehicle-induced interferences to data quality was insignificant, driving-related movements led to strong shifts in electrode positions. In general, the EEG system used allowed for a fast self-applicability of cap and electrodes. The assessed usability of the system was still acceptable while the wearing comfort decreased strongly over time due to friction and pressure to the head. From these results we conclude that the evaluated system should provide the essential requirements for an application in an autonomous driving context. Nevertheless, further refinement is suggested to reduce shifts of the system due to body movements and increase the headset's usability and wearing comfort.

Evidence suggests a single session of aerobic exercise improves cognitive functions among healthy adults. Whether this holds true for stroke survivors is unclear. The objective of this study was to examine whether one session of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise improves the cognitive control and attention of stroke survivors. Methods: Nine people with chronic stroke (>= 6 months poststroke) performed a modified Eriksen Flanker task with concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) before and immediately, 20 minutes, and 40 minutes after 20 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise and after 20 minutes of rest. The sessions were in randomized order. Accuracy and response time were recorded for congruent and incongruent stimuli. Differences in accuracy, response time, and event-related potentials (P300, reflective of decision making) were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance. Results: Improvements in EEG measures were noted after exercise. P300 amplitude at Fz was greater 40 minutes after exercise compared with after rest (P = .007). P300 latency was also shorter at 20 minutes after exercise compared with after rest for both congruent (465.8 milliseconds versus 500.0 milliseconds; P = .02) and incongruent (468.0 milliseconds versus 532.0 milliseconds; P = .003) conditions at the central electrode on the lesional side. Differences in behavioral performance after exercise were not significant. Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest that aerobic exercise improves cortical processes underlying cognitive control and attention 20-40 minutes postexercise. Future research should confirm results in a larger sample and examine whether attention-demanding rehabilitation in this window has improved outcomes.

Electrophysiological correlates of semantic memory retrieval in Gulf War Syndrome 2 patients	JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Word-finding; Gulf War illness; Semantic memory; EEG; ERP; Cholinergic	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; PYRIDOSTIGMINE BROMIDE; OBJECT-RECALL; TEST SORT; VETERANS; THALAMUS; DYSFUNCTION; PERMETHRIN; DEMENTIA; DEFICITS	Gulf War veterans meeting criteria for Haley Syndrome 2 of Gulf War illness endorse a particular constellation of symptoms that include difficulty with processing information, word-finding, and confusion. To explore the neural basis of their word-finding difficulty, we assessed event-related potentials (ERPs) associated with semantic memory retrieval in 22 veterans classified as Syndrome 2 and 28 veterans who served as controls. We recorded EEGs while subjects judged whether pairs of words that represented object features combined to elicit a retrieval of an object memory or no retrieval. Syndrome 2 subjects' responses were significantly slower, and those participants were less accurate than controls on the retrieval trials, but they performed similarly on the nonretrieval trials. Analysis of the ERPs revealed a difference between retrievals and nonretrievals that has previously been detected around 750 ms at the left temporal region was present in both the Syndrome 2 patients and controls. However, the Syndrome 2 patients also showed an ERP difference between retrievals and nonretrievals at the midline parietal region that had a scalp voltage polarity opposite from that recorded at the left temporal area. We hypothesize that the similarities between task performance and ERP patterns in Syndrome 2 veterans and in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment reflect disordered thalamic cholinergic neural activity, possibly in the dorsomedial nucleus.

Specifically, we investigated whether DC bilinguals exhibit the phonemic processing strategy, evident in monolingual Dutch speakers, during planning of their Cantonese speech production. Participants named the color of colored line-drawings in Cantonese faster when color and object matched in the first segment than when they were mismatched (e.g.,(sic),/laam4//lok3to4/, "blue camel;"(sic), /hung4//lok3to4/, "red camel"). This is in contrast to previous studies in Sinitic languages that did not reveal such phoneme-only facilitation. Phonemic overlap also modulated the event-related potentials (ERPs) in the 125-175, 200-300, and 300-400 ms time windows, suggesting earlier ERP modulations than in previous studies with monolingual Sinitic speakers or unbalanced Sinitic-Germanic bilinguals. Conjointly, our results suggest that, while the syllablemay be considered the primary unit of phonological encoding in Sinitic languages, the phoneme can serve as the primary unit of phonological encoding, both behaviorally and neurally, for DC bilinguals. The presence/absence of a segment onset effect in Sinitic languages may be related to the proficiency in the Germanic language of bilinguals.

Event-related Potentials (ERPs) effects (Feedback Related Negativity (FRN) and P300) were monitored in concomitance with Behavioral Activation System (BAS) modulation. High-IAT young participants showed specific responses to IA-related cues (videos representing online gambling and videogames) in terms of cognitive performance (decreased Response Times, RTs; and Error Rates, ERs) and ERPs modulation (decreased FRN and increased P300). Consistent reward and attentional biases was adduced to explain the cognitive gain effect and the anomalous response in terms of both feedback behavior (FRN) and attentional (P300) mechanisms in high-IAT. In addition, BAS and BAS-Reward subscales measures were correlated with both IAT and ERPs variations. Therefore, high sensitivity to IAT may be considered as a marker of dysfunctional reward processing (reduction of monitoring) and cognitive control (higher attentional values) for specific IA-related cues. More generally, a direct relationship among reward-related behavior, Internet addiction and BAS attitude was suggested.

Yet, how reliably, how fast these changes are detected and how long they are processed in the human brain remain unknown. High-density electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded in 18 participants presented with a neutral-expression face at a rate of 5.88 Hz (F) for 80 s. Every five faces, the face changed expression to fear, disgust or happiness (different stimulation sequences). The resulting 1.18 Hz (F/5) EEG response and its harmonics objectively indexed detection of a brief change of facial expression. This response was recorded in every participant in a few minutes but was largely reduced for inverted faces, indicating that it reflects high-level processes. Although this response focused on occipito-temporal sites, different expression changes evoked reliably distinct topographical maps, pointing to partly distinct neural generators. These effects were also observed at a faster 12 Hz frequency rate and a lower ratio of expression change (1/9). Time-domain analysis showed that a brief change of expression inserted in a dynamic stimulation sequence elicits specific occipito-temporal responses between 100 and 310 ms, indicating a rapid change detection process followed by a long integration period of facial expression information in the human brain.

Electro-physiological changes in the brain induced by caffeine or glucose nasal spray	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Stroop; Attention; ERP P300; Source localization; sLORETA	SOLITARY CHEMOSENSORY CELLS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SWEET TASTE RECEPTORS; MEMORY; PERFORMANCE; CARBOHYDRATE; ATTENTION; BITTER; P300; ACTIVATION	Objective A direct link between the mouth cavity and the brain for glucose (GLUC) and caffeine (CAF) has been established. The aim of this study is to determine whether a direct link for both substrates also exist between the nasal cavity and the brain. Ten healthy male subjects (age 22 +/- 1 years) performed three experimental trials, separated by at least 2 days. Each trial included a 20-s nasal spray (NAS) period in which solutions placebo (PLAC), GLUC, or CAF were provided in a double-blind, randomized order. During each trial, four cognitive Stroop tasks were performed: two familiarization trials and one pre- and one post-NAS trial. Reaction times and accuracy for different stimuli (neutral, NEUTR; congruent, CON; incongruent INCON) were determined. Electroencephalography was continuously measured throughout the trials. During the Stroop tasks pre- and post-NAS, the P300 was assessed and during NAS, source localization was performed using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA). NAS activated the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). CAF-NAS also increased theta and beta activity in frontal cortices. Furthermore, GLUC-NAS increased the beta activity within the insula. GLUC-NAS also increased the P300 amplitude with INCON (P = 0.046) and reduced P300 amplitude at F3-F4 and P300 latency at CP1-CP2-Cz with NEUTR (P = 0.001 and P = 0.016, respectively). The existence of nasal bitter and sweet taste receptors possibly induce these brain responses. Greater cognitive efficiency was observed with GLUC-NAS. CAF-NAS activated cingulate, insular, and sensorymotor cortices, whereas GLUC-NAS activated sensory, cingulate, and insular cortices. However, no effect on the Stroop task was found.

Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulating (tACS) Enhances Mental Rotation Performance during and after Stimulation	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS); transcranial electrical stimulation (TES); aftereffect; EEG; alpha oscillations; event-related-desynchronization (ERD); mental rotation	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN-STIMULATION; SEX-DIFFERENCES; ALPHA POWER; EEG ALPHA; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; SPATIAL ABILITY; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; SYNCHRONIZATION	Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been repeatedly demonstrated to modulate endogenous brain oscillations in a frequency specific manner. Thus, it is a promising tool to uncover causal relationships between brain oscillations and behavior or perception. While tACS has been shown to elicit a physiological aftereffect for up to 70 min, it remains unclear whether the effect can still be elicited if subjects perform a complex task interacting with the stimulated frequency band. In addition, it has not yet been investigated whether the aftereffect is behaviorally relevant. In the current experiment, participants performed a Shepard-like mental rotation task for 80 min. After 10 min of baseline measurement, participants received either 20 min of tACS at their individual alpha frequency (IAF) or sham stimulation (30 s tACS in the beginning of the stimulation period). Afterwards another 50 min of post-stimulation EEG were recorded. Task performance and EEG were acquired during the whole experiment. While there were no effects of tACS on reaction times or event-related-potentials (ERPs), results revealed an increase in mental rotation performance in the stimulation group as compared to sham both during and after stimulation. This was accompanied by increased ongoing alpha power and coherence as well as event-related-desynchronization (ERD) in the alpha band in the stimulation group. The current study demonstrates a behavioral and physiological aftereffect of tACS in parallel. This indicates that it is possible to elicit aftereffects of tACS during tasks interacting with the alpha band. Therefore, the tACS aftereffect is suitable to achieve an experimental manipulation.

While it is known that subliminally and consciously induced conflicts interact and conjointly modulate action control in healthy subjects, this has never been investigated for ADHD. Method. We investigated the (potential) interaction of subliminally and consciously triggered response conflicts in children with ADHD and matched healthy controls using neuropsychological methods (event-related potentials; ERPs) to identify the involved cognitive sub-processes. Results. Unlike healthy controls, ADHD patients showed no interaction of subliminally and consciously triggered response conflicts. Instead, they only showed additive effects as their behavioural performance (accuracy) was equally impaired by each conflict and they showed no signs of task-goal shielding even in cases of low conflict load. Of note, this difference between ADHD and controls was not rooted in early bottom-up attentional stimulus processing as reflected by the P1 and N1 ERPs. Instead, ADHD showed either no or reversed modulations of conflict-related processes and response selection as reflected by the N2 and P3 ERPs. Conclusion. There are fundamental differences in the architecture of cognitive control which might be of use for future diagnostic procedures. Unlike healthy controls, ADHD patients do not seem to be endowed with a threshold which allows them to maintain high behavioural performance in the face of low conflict load. ADHD patients seem to lack sufficient top-down attentional resources to maintain correct response selection in the face of conflicts by shielding the response selection process from response tendencies evoked by any kind of distractor.

Processes indicative of a self-positivity bias are reflected in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals at similar to 400 ms when the task does not require a discrimination of self from other. However, when distinguishing between self-referential and other-referential emotions is required, previous studies have shown inconsistent temporal dynamics of EEG signals in slightly different tasks. Based on the observation of early self-other discrimination, we hypothesized that self would be rapidly activated in the early stage to modulate emotional processing in the late stage during an implicit self-referential emotion. To test this hypothesis, we employed an implicit task in which participants were asked to judge the order of Chinese characters of trait adjectives preceded by a self ("I") or other pronoun ("He" or "She"). This study aimed to explore the difference of social-related emotional evaluation from self-reference; the other pronoun was not defined to a specific person, rather it referred to the general concept. Sixteen healthy Chinese subjects participated in the experiment. Event-related potentials (ERPs) showed that there were self-other discrimination effects in the N1 (80-110 ms) and P1 (170-200 ms) components in the anterior brain. The emotional valence was discriminated in the later component of N2 (220-250 ms). The interaction between self-reference and emotional valence occurred during the late positive potential (LPP; 400-500 ms). Moreover, there was a positive correlation between response time (RT) and N1 in the self-reference condition based on the positive-negative contrast, suggesting a modulatory effect of the self-positivity bias. The results indicate that self-reference emerges earlier than emotion and then combines with emotional processing in an implicit task. The findings extend the view that the self plays a highly integrated and modulated role in self-referential emotion processing.

Although neuroimaging studies have identified important roles of stimulus-driven processing in the attentional detection, the effects of top-down control were scarcely investigated. In this study, scalp EEG was recorded from thirty-two participants during a modified Go/NoGo task, in which a spatial-cueing approach was implemented to manipulate top-down selective attention. We observed classical event-related potential components, including N2 and P3, in the attended condition of response inhibition. While in the ignored condition of response inhibition, a smaller P3 was observed and N2 was absent. The correlation between P3 and CNV during the foreperiod suggested an inhibitory role of P3 in both conditions. Furthermore, source analysis suggested that P3 generation was mainly localized to the midcingulate cortex, and the attended condition showed increased activation relative to the ignored condition in several regions, including inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, insula and uncus, suggesting that these regions were involved in top-down attentional control rather than inhibitory processing. Taken together, by segregating electrophysiological correlates of top-down selective attention from those of response inhibition, our findings provide new insights in understanding the neural mechanisms of response inhibition.

Previous research has established that such paradigms, such as the mismatch response or mismatch negativity, are useful for examining auditory processes in young children and infants across various sleep and attention states. The extent to which oddball ERP responses may reflect subtle discrimination effects, such as speech discrimination, is largely unknown, especially in infants that have not yet acquired speech and language. Results: Mismatch responses for three contrasts (non-speech, vowel, and consonant) were computed as a spectral-temporal probability function in 24 infants, and analyzed at the group level by a modified multidimensional scaling. Immediately following an onset gamma response (30-50 Hz), the emergence of a beta oscillation (12-30 Hz) was temporally coupled with a lower frequency theta oscillation (2-8 Hz). The spectral-temporal probability of this coupling effect relative to a subsequent theta modulation corresponds with discrimination difficulty for non-speech, vowel, and consonant contrast features. Discussion: The theta modulation effect suggests that unexpected sounds are encoded as a probabilistic measure of surprise. These results support the notion that auditory discrimination is driven by the development of brain networks for predictive processing, and can be measured in infants during sleep. The results presented here have implications for the interpretation of discrimination as a probabilistic process, and may provide a basis for the development of single-subject and single-trial classification in a clinically useful context. Conclusion: An infant's brain is processing information about the environment and performing computations, even during sleep. These computations reflect subtle differences in acoustic feature processing that are necessary for language-learning. Results from this study suggest that brain responses to deviant sounds in an oddball paradigm follow a cascade of oscillatory modulations. This cascade begins with a gamma response that later emerges as a beta synchronization, which is temporally coupled with a theta modulation, and followed by a second, subsequent theta modulation. The difference in frequency and timing of the theta modulations appears to reflect a measure of surprise. These insights into the neurophysiological mechanisms of auditory discrimination provide a basis for exploring the clinically utility of the MMRTF and other auditory oddball responses.

It makes it possible to study the neurophysiology of brain activity by recording real-time changes in electrical potential produced by cortical activation. The importance of EEG in diagnosing canine epilepsy demonstrates its usefulness when the owner's description of crises is not clear or when the episodes cannot be differentiated from behavioral or cardiac disorders. However, EEG recordings also often record electrical activity from sources other than the brain, which may interfere with the clinical event-related signal. This activity is known as artifactual electrical activity, and the signal changes recorded in these cases corrupt the trace when they are superimposed on brain activity or even, in some cases, mimic pathologic abnormalities. The first step in analyzing and interpreting EEG traces is to recognize artifacts and other specific transient events. This retrospective study set out to ascertain whether artifacts comparable to those described in humans are observed in protocols used to perform short-term interictal EEG for canine epilepsy and how these can be classified.

Here, we sought to establish the impact of natural aging on this process by recording EEG from young (18-35 years) and older adults (65-88 years) during the performance of a Go/No-Go paradigm in which participants were required to overtly signal their errors. Despite performing the task with equivalent accuracy, older adults reported substantially fewer errors, and the timing of their reports were both slower and more variable. These behavioral differences were linked to three key neurophysiological changes reflecting distinct parameters of the error detection decision process: a reduction in medial frontal delta/theta (2-7 Hz) activity, indicating diminished top-down input to the decision process; a slower rate of evidence accumulation as indexed by the rate of rise of a centro-parietal signal, known as the error positivity; and a higher motor execution threshold as indexed by lateralized beta-band (16-30 Hz) activity. Our data provide novel insight into how the natural aging process affects the neural underpinnings of error detection.

Yet, little is known about how those processes are modulated by hangover effects. Given that acute intoxication and hangover seem to be characterized by partly divergent effects and mechanisms, further research on this topic is needed. In the current study, we hence investigated this with a special focus on potentially differential effects of alcohol intoxication and subsequent hangover on sub-processes involved in the decision to select a response. We do so combining drift diffusion modeling of behavioral data with neurophysiological (EEG) data. Opposed to common sense, the results do not show an impairment of all assessed measures. Instead, they show specific effects of high dose alcohol intoxication and hangover on selective drift diffusion model and EEG parameters (as compared to a sober state). While the acute intoxication induced by binge-drinking decreased the drift rate, it was increased by the subsequent hangover, indicating more efficient information accumulation during hangover. Further, the non-decisional processes of information encoding decreased with intoxication, but not during hangover. These effects were reflected in modulations of the N2, P1 and N1 event-related potentials, which reflect conflict monitoring, perceptual gating and attentional selection processes, respectively. As regards the functional neuroanatomical architecture, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as well as occipital networks seem to be modulated. Even though alcohol is known to have broad neurobiological effects, its effects on cognitive processes are rather specific.

EEG differences between eyes-closed and eyes-open resting remain in healthy ageing	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Normal ageing; Resting EEG; Eyes open vs. eyes closed; Arousal/activation; Clinical screening tool; EEG reactivity	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY GO/NOGO TASK; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; ORIENTING REFLEX; STATE AROUSAL; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; VISUAL PERFORMANCE; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; QUANTITATIVE EEG	In young adults and children, the eyes-closed (EC) resting state is one of low EEG arousal, with the change to eyes-open (EO) primarily involving an increase in arousal. We used this arousal perspective to interpret EC/ EO differences in healthy young and older adults. EEG was recorded from 20 young (Mage = 20.4 years) and 20 gender-matched older (M-age = 68.2 years) right-handed adults during two 3 min resting conditions; EC then EO. Older participants displayed less delta and theta, some reduction in alpha, and increased beta. Global activity in all bands reduced with opening the eyes, but did not differ with age, indicating that the energetics of EEG reactivity is maintained in healthy ageing. However, older adults had more focal changes than young adults, particularly in beta, suggesting the mobilisation of additional localised resources. This maintained reactivity, and heightened focal activity, may underlie preserved performance levels in healthy ageing.

The growing amount of neurophysiological and neuroimaging research helps in broadening existing knowledge of the neural mechanisms underlying core burnout components (emotional exhaustion and depersonalization/cynicism) that are inextricably associated with emotional processing. In the presented EEG study, a group of 93 participants (55 women; mean age = 35.8) were selected for the burnout group or the demographically matched control group on the basis of the results of the Maslach Burnout Inventory - General Survey (MBI-GS) and the Areas of Worklife Survey (AWS). Subjects then participated in an EEG experiment using two experimental procedures: a facial recognition task and viewing of passive pictures. The study focuses on analyzing event-related potentials (ERPs): N170, VPP, EPN, and LPP, as indicators of emotional information processing. Our results show that burnout subjects, as compared to the control group, demonstrate significantly weaker response to affect-evoking stimuli, indexed by a decline in VPP amplitude to emotional faces and decreased EPN amplitude in processing emotional scenes. The analysis of N170 and LPP showed no significant between-group difference. The correlation analyses revealed that VPP and EPN, whichd are ERP components related to emotional processing, are associated with two core burnout symptoms: emotional exhaustion and cynicism. To our knowledge, we are one of the first research groups to use ERPs to demonstrate such a relationship between neurophysiological activity and burnout syndrome in the context of emotional processing. Thus, in conclusion we emphasized that the decreased amplitude of VPP and EPN components in the burnout group may be a neurophysiological manifestation of emotional blunting and may be considered as neurophysiological markers of emotional exhaustion and cynicism. Additionally, we did not observe a decrease in LPP, which may be considered as a marker that significantly differentiates burnout from depression.

Ten participants performed a 60-min continuous monitoring task to induce mental fatigue, before and after which an attention task (modified by two experimental paradigms: CPT-AX and Go/NoGo) was conducted for 9 min, respectively, as a pretest and posttest. Performance data, subjective levels of mental fatigue, and EEG were recorded. Lower performance efficiency and increased subjective levels of fatigue suggested that the 60-min monitoring task successfully induced mental fatigue. The amplitudes of CPT-A-P3 and NOGO-P3 decreased significantly before and after the monitoring task; however, GO-P3 amplitude was not modulated. CPT-A-P3 latency showed no significant change, while latencies of NOGO-P3 and GO-P3 increased significantly. These results indicated that mental fatigue impaired resource allocation, and the stimulus evaluation time was extended. A significant increase in NoGo-N2 latency was found with time on task; however, no significant change in NoGo-N2 amplitude, indicative of decay of the inhibition process, was observed. Greater ERN amplitude was evoked by erroneous response to NoGo trials, indicating that error monitoring was impaired by mental fatigue. These results suggested that mental fatigue results in reduced attention functioning, and the metrics above are possible indices for measuring mental fatigue.

Previously, individual differences in the latency of the N170 have been related to face and object cognition abilities. By orthogonally manipulating content domain (faces us objects) and task demands (easy/speed us difficult/accuracy) in both psychometric and EEG tasks, we investigated the uniqueness of the processes underlying face cognition as compared with object cognition and the extent to which the N1/N170 component can explain individual differences in face and object cognition abilities. Data were recorded from N = 198 healthy young adults. Structural equation modeling (SEM) confirmed that the accuracies of face perception (FP) and memory are specific abilities above general object cognition; in contrast, the speed of face processing was not differentiable from the speed of object cognition. Although there was considerable domain-general variance in the N170 shared with the N1, there was significant face-specific variance in the N170. The brain-behavior relationship showed that faster face-specific processes for structural encoding of faces are associated with higher accuracy in both perceiving and memorizing faces. Moreover, in difficult task conditions, qualitatively different processes are additionally needed for recognizing face and object stimuli as compared with easy tasks. The difficulty-dependent variance components in the N170 amplitude were related with both face and object memory (OM) performance. We discuss implications for understanding individual differences in face cognition. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Post-stimulus fMRI and EEG responses: Evidence for a neuronal origin hypothesised to be inhibitory	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Event-related synchronisation; Rebound; Undershoot; Oxygen metabolism; Alpha	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; OXYGEN EXTRACTION FRACTION; CALIBRATED FUNCTIONAL MRI; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; BOLD SIGNAL; HUMAN BRAIN; METABOLISM CHANGES; NEURAL ACTIVITY; BALLOON MODEL; COMBINING EEG	Post-stimulus undershoots, negative responses following cessation of stimulation, are widely observed in functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) data. However, the debate surrounding whether the origin of this response phase is neuronal or vascular, and whether it provides functionally relevant information, that is additional to what is contained in the primary response, means that undershoots are widely overlooked. We simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG), BOLD and cerebral blood-flow (CBF) [obtained from arterial spin labelled (ASL) fMRI] fMRI responses to hemifield checkerboard stimulation to test the potential neural origin of the fMRI post-stimulus undershoot. The post-stimulus BOLD and CBF signal amplitudes in both contralateral and ipsilateral visual cortex depended on the post-stimulus power of the occipital 8-13 Hz (alpha) EEG neuronal activity, such that trials with highest EEG power showed largest fMRI undershoots in contralateral visual cortex. This correlation in post-stimulus EEG-fMRI responses was not predicted by the primary response amplitude. In the contralateral visual cortex we observed a decrease in both cerebral rate of oxygen metabolism (CMRO2) and CBF during the post-stimulus phase. In addition, the coupling ratio (n) between CMRO2 and CBF was significantly lower during the positive contralateral primary response phase compared with the post-stimulus phase and we propose that this reflects an altered balance of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity. Together our data provide strong evidence that the post-stimulus phase of the BOLD response has a neural origin which reflects, at least partially, an uncoupling of the neuronal responses driving the primary and post-stimulus responses, explaining the uncoupling of the signals measured in the two response phases. We suggest our results are consistent with inhibitory processes driving the post-stimulus EEG and fMRI responses. We therefore propose that new methods are required to model the post-stimulus and primary responses independently, enabling separate investigation of response phases in cognitive function and neurological disease.

J	Yao, DZ				Yao, Dezhong			Is the Surface Potential Integral of a Dipole in a Volume Conductor Always Zero? A Cloud Over the Average Reference of EEG and ERP	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Average reference; Zero potential; Spherical head; Volume conductor model; Gold standard	SCALAR MULTIPOLE EXPANSIONS; INFINITY REFERENCE; REFERENCE MONTAGE; NETWORK; EEG/MEG	Currently, average reference is one of the most widely adopted references in EEG and ERP studies. The theoretical assumption is the surface potential integral of a volume conductor being zero, thus the average of scalp potential recordings might be an approximation of the theoretically desired zero reference. However, such a zero integral assumption has been proved only for a spherical surface. In this short communication, three counter-examples are given to show that the potential integral over the surface of a dipole in a volume conductor may not be zero. It depends on the shape of the conductor and the orientation of the dipole. This fact on one side means that average reference is not a theoretical 'gold standard' reference, and on the other side reminds us that the practical accuracy of average reference is not only determined by the well-known electrode array density and its coverage but also intrinsically by the head shape. It means that reference selection still is a fundamental problem to be fixed in various EEG and ERP studies.

Conventionally, this is achieved by trigger-based averaging, which suppresses uncorrelated background noise and unmasks the event related pattern. In some of the previouspapers, extraction of weak event related pattern is also achieved by decomposing the signal into a set of predefined basis functions, such as wavelets. We present here, a novel approach by combining template matching with the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). The EEMD technique is applied to decompose the noisy data corresponding to single-trial event related potentials into the so-called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). These functions are of the same length and in the same time domain as the original signal. Therefore, the EEMD technique preserves varying frequency content along the time axis. The effective extraction of the event-related pattern proposed in this paper relies on the elimination of IMFs, which capture the features corresponding to artifacts and brain signals, based on cross-correlation with a suitable template extracted from the evoked potential obtained by the conventional unrestricted averaging across a large number of trials. We illustrate the method and compare it with conventionally used single channel wavelet-based approach for denoising visual evoked potentials during the measurement of visual evoked electroencephalogram response.

From the improvement of academic achievement in children to the prevention of Alzheimer's disease in the elderly, exercise appears beneficial across the developmental spectrum. Recent work from animal studies also indicates that a pregnant mother can transfer the benefits of exercise during gestation to her offspring's brain. Exercising pregnant rats give birth to pups that have better memory and spatial learning as well as increased synaptic density. To investigate whether this transfer from the pregnant mother to her child also occurs in humans, we conducted a randomized controlled trial (n=18) and measured the impact of exercise during pregnancy on the neuroelectric response of the neonatal brain with electroencephalography (EEG). Here we show that, compared to the newborns of mothers who were inactive during their pregnancy, the children of exercising pregnant women are born with more mature brains. This was measured with the infant slow positive mismatch response (SPMMR), an electroencephalographic potential known to decrease in amplitude with age. The SPMMR reflects processes associated with brain maturation via its response to sound discrimination and auditory memory. In this study, the children of the mothers who exercised throughout their pregnancy have a smaller SPMMR than the children of mothers who remained sedentary (p=.019). Our results demonstrate the impact regular exercise during pregnancy can have on the development of the human fetal brain.

Auditory prediction errors as individual biomarkers of schizophrenia	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Machine learning; Schizophrenia; Mismatch negativity; EEG	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; DEFICITS; CLASSIFICATION; RESPONSES; ODDBALL; MEMORY; TIME; MMN	Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder, typically diagnosed through symptomatic evidence collected through patient interview. We aim to develop an objective biologically-based computational tool which aids diagnosis and relies on accessible imaging technologies such as electroencephalography (EEG). To achieve this, we used machine learning techniques and a combination of paradigms designed to elicit prediction errors or Mismatch Negativity (MMN) responses. MMN, an EEG component elicited by unpredictable changes in sequences of auditory stimuli, has previously been shown to be reduced in people with schizophrenia and this is arguably one of the most reproducible neurophysiological markers of schizophrenia. EEG data were acquired from 21 patients with schizophrenia and 22 healthy controls whilst they listened to three auditory oddball paradigms comprising sequences of tones which deviated in 10% of trials from regularly occurring standard tones. Deviant tones shared the same properties as standard tones, except for one physical aspect: 1) duration - the deviant stimulus was twice the duration of the standard; 2) monaural gap - deviants had a silent interval omitted from the standard, or 3) inter-aural timing difference, which caused the deviant location to be perceived as 90 degrees away from the standards. We used multivariate pattern analysis, a machine learning technique implemented in the Pattern Recognition for Neuroimaging Toolbox (PRoNTo) to classify images generated through statistical parametric mapping (SPM) of spatiotemporal EEG data, i. e. event-related potentials measured on the two-dimensional surface of the scalp over time. Using support vector machine (SVM) and Gaussian processes classifiers (GPC), we were able classify individual patients and controls with balanced accuracies of up to 80.48% (p-values = 0.0326, FDR corrected) and an ROC analysis yielding an AUC of 0.87.

We pursued a possible role of this receptor in the perception of other social signals such as a person's voice. Participants completed three sessions in which they heard surprised and neutral vocal and nonvocal sounds and detected rare sound repetitions. In a given session, participants received no touch or soft brushstrokes to the arm (CT innervated) or palm (CT free). Event-related potentials elicited to sounds revealed that stroking to the arm facilitated the integration of vocal and emotional information. The late positive potential was greater for surprised vocal relative to neutral vocal and nonvocal sounds, and this effect was greater for arm touch relative to both palm touch and no touch. Together, these results indicate that stroking to the arm facilitates the allocation of processing resources to emotional voices, thus supporting the possibility that CT stimulation benefits social perception cross-modally.

Holistic processing includes the ability to discriminate individual facial features (i.e., featural processing) and their spatial relationships (i.e., spacing processing). Here, we aimed to characterize the spatio-temporal dynamics of featural-and spacing-processing of faces and objects. Nineteen healthy volunteers completed a newly created perceptual discrimination task for faces and objects (i.e., the "University of East London Face Task") while their brain activity was recorded with a high-density (128 electrodes) electroencephalogram. Our results showed that early event related potentials at around 100 ms post-stimulus onset (i.e., P100) are sensitive to both facial features and spacing between the features. Spacing and features discriminability for objects occurred at circa 200 ms post-stimulus onset (P200). These findings indicate the existence of neurophysiological correlates of spacing vs. features processing in both face and objects, and demonstrate faster brain processing for faces.

Your brain on bikes: P3, MMN/N2b, and baseline noise while pedaling a stationary bike	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Attention; Exercise; Young adults; EEG; ERPs	EEG; HABITUATION; TASK; ELECTRODES; EXERCISE; REMOVAL	Increasingly, there is a trend to measure brain activity in more ecologically realistic scenarios. Normally, the confines of the laboratory and sedentary tasks mitigate sources of electrical noise on EEG measurement. Moving EEG outside of the lab requires understanding of the impact of complex movements and activities on traditional EEG and ERP measures. Here, we recorded EEG with active electrodes while participants were either riding or sitting on a stationary bike in an electrical and sound-attenuated chamber in the lab. Participants performed an auditory oddball task, pressing a button when they detected rare target tones in a series of standard frequent tones. We quantified both the levels of spectral, single-trial baseline, and ERP baseline noise, as well as classic MMN/N2b and P3 ERP components measured during both biking and sitting still. We observed slight increases in posterior high frequency noise in the spectra, and increased noise in the baseline period during biking. However, morphologically and topographically similar MMN/N2b and P3 components were measured reliably while both biking and sitting. A quantification of the power to reliably measure ERPs as a function of the number of trials revealed slight increases in the number of trials needed during biking to achieve the same level of power. Taken in sum, our results confirm that classic ERPs can be measured reliably during biking activities in the lab. Future directions will employ these techniques outside the lab in ecologically valid situations.	[Scanlon, Joanna E.

A P300 component in the EEG is induced when the subjects see their point of interest in a target image under the rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) experimental paradigm. We detected the single-trial P300 component to determine whether a subject was interested in an image. In practice, the latency and amplitude of the P300 component may vary in relation to different experimental parameters, such as target probability and stimulus semantics. Thus, we proposed a novel method, Target Recognition using Image Complexity Priori (TRICP) algorithm, in which the image information is introduced in the calculation of the interest score in the RSVP paradigm. The method combines information from the image and EEG to enhance the accuracy of single-trial P300 detection on the basis of traditional single-trial P300 detection algorithm. We defined an image complexity parameter based on the features of the different layers of a convolution neural network (CNN). We used the TRICP algorithm to compute for the complexity of an image to quantify the effect of different complexity images on the P300 components and training specialty classifier according to the image complexity. We compared TRICP with the HDCA algorithm. Results show that TRICP is significantly higher than the HDCA algorithm (Wilcoxon Sign Rank Test, p<0.05). Thus, the proposed method can be used in other and visual task-related single-trial event-related potential detection.

To set the background for the research presented in this issue, we review the published work on EEG-based markers of NCC. The article is organized according to the principle of the time-course aspect of brain potentials with regard to the stimuli for which subject's awareness is experimentally measured and/or manipulated. We treat brain potentials as the principal dependent measure as well as independent variable. More specifically, we also draw attention to the fact that in the overwhelming share of studies relative negativization of the ERPs tends to mark NCC.

Here, a novel social pharmacological approach was applied to investigate whether oxytocin administration (24 IU) enhances performance monitoring for errors that have negative consequences for another individual, so-called social mistakes. Healthy male volunteers (N = 24) participated in a placebo-controlled crossover design. EEG measures were obtained while pairs of participants performed a speeded choice reaction-time task in an individual and social context. Following oxytocin administration, error-related negativity amplitudes were increased for social compared with individual mistakes. This increase was not found in the placebo condition. No effects of oxytocin were present in the individual context. The current study shows that oxytocin enhances performance monitoring specifically for social mistakes. This outcome is in line with a presumed role for oxytocin in salience attribution to social cues and underlines its context-dependency. Combining these processes may thus open up new research avenues and advance our understanding of individual differences in performance monitoring and oxytocin responses from a social neurocognitive, pharmacological and clinical perspective.

In the current study, mind wandering was induced through completion of the same task for 5 days, consisting of a 20-min monotonous freeway-driving scenario, a cognitive depletion task, and a repetition of the 20-min driving scenario driven in the reverse direction. Participants were periodically probed with auditory tones to self-report whether they were mind wandering or focused on the driving task. Self-reported mind wandering frequency was high, and did not statistically change over days of participation. For measures of driving performance, participant labeled periods of mind wandering were associated with reduced speed and reduced lane variability, in comparison to periods of on task performance. For measures of electrophysiology, periods of mind wandering were associated with increased power in the alpha band of the electroencephalogram (EEG), as well as a reduction in the magnitude of the P3a component of the event related potential (ERP) in response to the auditory probe. Results support that mind wandering has an impact on driving performance and the associated change in driver's attentional state is detectable in underlying brain physiology. Further, results suggest that detecting the internal cognitive state of humans is possible in a continuous task such as automobile driving. Identifying periods of likely mind wandering could serve as a useful research tool for assessment of driver attention, and could potentially lead to future in-vehicle safety countermeasures.

We now test the hypothesis that CS Event Related Spectral Perturbations (ERSPs) are related to ratings of CS Expectancy (likelihood of pairing with the US), Valence (unpleasantness) and Salience (ability to capture attention). ERSP windows in EEG were defined by both time after the CS and frequency, and showed increased oscillatory power (Event Related Synchronization, ERS) in the Delta/Theta Windows (0-8 Hz) and the Gamma Window (30-55 Hz). Decreased oscillatory power (Event Related Desynchronization - ERD) was found in Alpha (8-14 Hz) and Beta Windows (14-30 Hz). The Delta/Theta ERS showed a differential effect of CS+ versus CS- at Prefrontal, Frontal and Midline Channels, while Alpha and Beta ERD were greater at Parietal and Occipital Channels early in the stimulus train. The Gamma ERS Window increased from habituation to acquisition over a broad area from frontal and occipital electrodes. The CS Valence and Salience were greater for CS+ than CS- and were correlated with each other and with the ERD at overlapping channels, particularly in the Alpha Window. Expectancy and CS Skin Conductance Response were greater for CS+ than CS- and were correlated with ERSP at fewer channels than Valence or Salience. These results suggest that Alpha ERSP activity during fear conditioning reflects Valence and Salience of the CSs more than conditioning per se. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

J	Zhao, B; Dang, JW; Zhang, GY				Zhao, Bin; Dang, Jianwu; Zhang, Gaoyan			EEG SOURCE RECONSTRUCTION EVIDENCE FOR THE NOUN-VERB NEURAL DISSOCIATION ALONG SEMANTIC DIMENSIONS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						noun-verb dissociation; ambiguous words; semantics; EEG; source reconstruction	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; GRAMMATICAL CLASS; BRAIN; WORD; CHINESE; COMPREHENSION; CATEGORIES; ERP; KNOWLEDGE; RESPONSES	One of the long-standing issues in neurolinguistic research is about the neural basis of word representation, concerning whether grammatical classification or semantic difference causes the neural dissobiation of brain activity patterns when processing different word categories, especially nouns and verbs. To disentangle this puzzle, four orthogonalized word categories in Chinese: unambiguous nouns (UN), unambiguous verbs (UV), ambiguous words with noun-biased semantics (AN), and ambiguous words with verb-biased semantics (AV) were adopted in an auditory task for recording electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from 128 electrodes on the scalps of twenty-two subjects. With the advanced current density reconstruction (CDR) algorithm and the constraint of standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography, the spatiotemporal brain dynamics of word processing were explored with the results that in multiple time periods including P1 (6090 ms), N1 (100-140 ms), P200 (150-250 ms) and N400 (350-450 ms), noun-verb dissociation over the parietal occipital and frontal-central cortices appeared not only between the UN-UV grammatical classes but also between the grammatically identical but semantically different AN AV pairs. The apparent semantic dissociation within one grammatical class strongly suggests that the semantic difference rather than grammatical classification could be interpreted as the origin of the noun-verb neural dissociation. Our results also revealed that semantic dissociation occurs from an early stage and repeats in multiple phases, thus supporting a functionally hierarchical word processing mechanism. (C) 2017 IBRO.

An action-effect is not only a sensory event; it is often also an event of emotional value which can be pleasant or aversive. This latter attribute of action-effect prediction is similar to anticipation of reward versus punishment. To date the neural systems controlling sensory and reward anticipation have not been systematically compared. To this end, we designed an experiment to manipulate the sensory content and the emotional valence of the stimuli in an orthogonal fashion. We recorded and compared event-related potentials (ERPs) to the presentation of stimuli instantiating expected or unexpected features. Our results suggest (1) that both features are processed altogether and (2) that the prediction error resulting from the manipulation is reflected in an enhanced N400 component.

To study the nature of this effect, previous electroencephalography (EEG) research recorded the N400, an ERP component that is sensitive to violations of semantic context. The N400 is characterised by a relative negativity to words that are unrelated vs. related to the semantic context. The semantic satiation hypothesis predicts that the N400 should decrease with high repetition. However, previous findings have been inconsistent. Because of these inconsistent findings and the shortcomings of previous research, we used a modified design that minimises confounding effects from non-semantic processes. We recorded 64-channel EEG and analysed the N400 in a semantic priming task in which the primes were repeated 3 or 30 times. Critically, we separated low and high repetition trials and excluded response trials. Further, we varied the physical features (letter case and format) of consecutive primes to minimise confounding effects from perceptual habituation. For centrofrontal electrodes, the N400 was reduced after 30 repetitions (vs. 3 repetitions). Explorative source reconstructions suggested that activity decreased after 30 repetitions in bilateral inferior temporal gyrus, the right posterior section of the superior and middle temporal gyrus, right supramarginal gyrus, bilateral lateral occipital cortex, and bilateral lateral orbitofrontal cortex. These areas overlap broadly with those typically involved in the N400, namely middle temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus. The results support the semantic rather than the perceptual nature of the satiation effect.

Several studies have provided electrophysiological evidence for involuntary misallocations of attention towards a distractor, but much less is known about the mechanisms that are needed to overcome a misallocation and re-allocate attention towards the concurrently presented target. In our study, electrophysiological markers of attentional mechanisms indicate that (i) the distractor captures attention before the target is attended, (ii) a misallocation of attention is terminated actively (instead of attention fading passively), and (iii) the misallocation of attention towards a distractor delays the attention allocation towards the target (rather than just delaying some post-attentive process involved in response selection). This provides the most complete demonstration, to date, of the chain of attentional mechanisms that are evoked when attention is misguided and recovers from capture within a search display.

Recent research proposes that electrophysiological measures of brain states can also predict individual variability in successful learning. This study was conducted to examine neural mechanisms of learning and neurophysiological indicators that predict success in a perceptual learning task. EEG was recorded over 20 blocks of trials while subjects learned to categorize a complex visual stimulus that required integration of multiple physical dimensions for successful categorization. For the analysis, final performance scores were used to median split subjects into high and low learners. By the 6th block, high learners began to diverge, eventually achieving 80% accuracy while low learners remained only nominally above chance. ERPs to the visual stimulus revealed a P3b that was significantly larger in high learners even before performance differences had emerged, but that did not vary with learning. Power spectral analyses showed that resting-state alpha was larger for high learners both before and during learning. Finally, alpha power increased for high but not for low learners as learning progressed. These results show that electrophysiological measures, especially alpha power, may not just reflect the learning process but also serve as predictors of eventual learning performance.

While negative emotion facilitates both cognitive and emotional conflict processing, it is unclear how emotional conflict processing is affected by positive emotion (e.g., humor). In 2 EEG experiments, we investigated the role of positive audiovisual target stimuli in cognitive and emotional conflict processing. Participants categorized either spoken vowels (cognitive task) or their emotional valence (emotional task) and ignored the visual stimulus dimension. Behaviorally, a positive target showed no influence on cognitive conflict processing, but impeded emotional conflict processing. In the emotional task, response time conflict costs were higher for positive than for neutral targets. In the EEG, we observed an interaction of emotion by congruence in the P200 and N200 ERP components in emotional but not in cognitive conflict processing. In the emotional conflict task, the P200 and N200 conflict effect was larger for emotional than neutral targets. Thus, our results show that emotion affects conflict processing differently as a function of conflict type and emotional valence. This suggests that there are conflict- and valence-specific mechanisms modulating executive control.

As event related potential (ERP) measure, the mismatch negativity (MMN) was recorded in a distracted oddball paradigm to short spoken sentences. Critical 'deviant' sentence stimuli where either well formed and meaningful, or syntactically, or lexico-semantically incorrect. After 4 weeks of speech-language therapy (SLT) delivered with high intensity (10.5 h per week), clinical language assessment with the Aachen Aphasia Test battery demonstrated significant linguistic improvements, which were accompanied by enhanced MMN responses. More specifically, MMN amplitudes to grammatically correct and meaningful mini-constructions and to 'jabberwocky' sentences containing a pseudoword significantly increased after therapy. However, no therapy-related changes in MMN responses to syntactically incorrect strings including agreement violations were observed. While MMN increases to well-formed meaningful strings can be explained both at the word and construction levels, the neuroplastic change seen for 'jabberwocky' sentences suggests an explanation in terms of constructions. The results confirm previous reports that intensive SLT leads to improvements of linguistic skills in chronic aphasia patients and now demonstrate that this clinical improvement is associated with enhanced automatic brain indexes of construction processing, although no comparable change is present for ungrammatical strings. Furthermore, the data confirm that the language-induced MMN is a useful tool to map functional language recovery in PSA.

Changes in task-irrelevant object location have been shown to impair the retrieval of memorial representations and the detection of object identity changes. However, the neural correlates of this cognitive process remain largely unknown. In the present study, we aim to investigate the underlying brain activation during object color change detection and the modulatory effects of changes in object location and VWM load. To this end we used simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings, which can reveal the neural activity with both high temporal and high spatial resolution. Subjects responded faster and with greater accuracy in the repeated compared to the changed object location condition, when a higher VWM load was utilized. These results support the spatial congruency advantage theory and suggest that it is more pronounced with higher VWM load. Furthermore, the spatial congruency effect was associated with larger posterior N1 activity, greater activation of the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and less suppression of the right supramarginal gyrus (SMG), when object location was repeated compared to when it was changed. The ERP-fMRI integrative analysis demonstrated that the object location discrimination-related N1 component is generated in the right SMG.

While utterances involving phonologically similar phonemes consistently give rise to speech errors, repeated phonemes have been shown to interfere as well as to facilitate production. Here we try to shed light on this paradox by investigating brain processes underlying planning utterances involving similar and repeated phonemes (tongue-twister-like) and utterances with only repeated phonemes elicited with picture naming during electroencephalographic/event-related potentials (EEG/ERP) recording. Tongue-twister-like utterances increased error rates while repeated onset phonemes decreased reaction times. Both types of utterances modulated ERPs after 370ms following picture onset by shortening a period of stable electrophysiological pattern. Another microstate was lengthened for tongue-twister-like utterances only, wiping out the timing difference of the previous microstate. These results indicate priming of repeated phonemes and cost of encoding similar phonemes, both phenomena co-occurring in tongue-twisters.

This study investigated the effects of speech articulation features on the amplitude and latency of cortical auditory evoked potential (CAEP) components. The speech articulation features included the placing contrast and voicing contrast. 12 Malay subjects with normal hearing and 12 Malay subjects with SNHL were recruited for the study. The CAEPs response recorded at higher amplitude with longer latency when stimulated by voicing contrast cues compared to that of the placing contrast. Subjects with SNHL elicited greater amplitude with prolonged latencies in the majority of the CAEP components in both speech stimuli. The existence of different frequency spectral and time-varying acoustic cues of the speech stimuli was reflected by the CAEPs response strength and timing. We anticipate that the CAEPs responses could equip audiologist and clinicians with useful knowledge, concerning the potential deprivation experience by hearing impaired individuals, in auditory passive perception. This would help to determine what type of speech stimuli that might be useful in measuring speech perception abilities, especially in Malay Malaysian ethic group, for choosing a better rehabilitation program, since no such study conducted for evaluating speech perception among Malaysian clinical population.

EEG correlates of cognitive time scales in the Necker-Zeno model for bistable perception	CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION			English	Article						Ambiguous figures; Bistable perception; Necker cube; EEG; Event-related potentials; Meditation; Cognitive time scales; Necker-Zeno model; Quantum cognition	P300; REVERSAL; STIMULI; CUBE; POTENTIALS; SIGNAL; BRAIN; VIEWS; LONG; BAND	The Necker-Zeno model of bistable perception provides a formal relation between the average duration of meta-stable percepts (dwell times T) of ambiguous figures and two other basic time scales (t(0), Delta T) underlying cognitive processing. The model predicts that dwell times T covary with to, Delta T or both. We tested this prediction by exploiting that observers, in particular experienced meditators, can volitionally control dwell times T. Meditators and non-meditators observed bistable Necker cubes either passively or tried to hold their current percept. The latencies of a centro-parietal event-related potential (CPP) were recorded as a physiological correlate of t(0). Dwell times T and the CPP latencies, correlated with t(0), differed between conditions and observer groups, while Delta T remained constant in the range predicted by the model. The covariation of CPP latencies and dwell times, as well as their quadratic functional dependence extends previous psychophysical confirmation of the Necker-Zeno model to psychophysiological measures.

Cognitive film theory attributes this to the system of continuity editing, a system of editing guidelines outlining the effect of different cuts and edits on spectators. A major principle in this framework is the 180 degrees rule, a rule recommendation that, to avoid spectators' attention to the editing, two edited shots of the same event or action should not be filmed from angles differing in a way that expectations of spatial continuity are strongly violated. In the present study, we used high-density EEG to explore the neural underpinnings of this rule. In particular, our analysis shows that cuts and edits in general elicit early ERP component indicating the registration of syntactic violations as known from language, music, and action processing. However, continuity edits and cuts-across the line differ from each other regarding later components likely to be indicating the differences in spatial remapping as well as in the degree of conscious awareness of one's own perception. Interestingly, a time-frequency analysis of the occipital alpha rhythm did not support the hypothesis that such differences in processing routes are mainly linked to visual attention. On the contrary, our study found specific modulations of the central mu rhythm ERD as an indicator of sensorimotor activity, suggesting that sensorimotor networks might play an important role. We think that these findings shed new light on current discussions about the role of attention and embodied perception in film perception and should be considered when explaining spectators' different experience of different kinds of cuts.

Prior research suggests that healthy older adults have a generally intact performance monitoring system, but show specific deficits in error awareness, i.e., the ability to detect committed errors. We examined the neural processing of errors across the adult lifespan (69 participants; age range 20-72 years) by analysing the error (-related) negativity (Ne/ERN) and the error positivity (Pe) using an adapted version of the Go/Nogo task. At a stable overall error rate, higher age was associated with a greater proportion of undetected errors. While the Ne/ERN was associated with the processing of errors in general, the Pe amplitude was modulated by detected errors only. Furthermore, the Pe amplitude for detected errors was significantly smaller in older adults, in contrast to the Ne/ERN amplitude which did not show age-related changes. Structural path models suggested that through those age-related changes in Pe amplitude, an indirect effect on the performance was observed. Our results confirm and extend previous extreme-group based findings about specific deficits in error detection associated with higher age using age as a continuous predictor. Age-related reductions in Pe amplitude, associated with more undetected errors, are independent of early error processing, as evidenced by the preserved Ne/ERN.

J	Bruers, S; VanRullen, R				Bruers, Sasskia; VanRullen, Rufin			At What Latency Does the Phase of Brain Oscillations Influence Perception?	ENEURO			English	Article						EEG; oscillation; phase modulation	ALPHA-RHYTHM; PREDICTS; HZ; MECHANISM; DYNAMICS; CORTEX	Recent evidence has shown a rhythmic modulation of perception: prestimulus ongoing electroencephalography (EEG) phase in the theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-13 Hz) bands has been directly linked with fluctuations in target detection. In fact, the ongoing EEG phase directly reflects cortical excitability: it acts as a gating mechanism for information flow at the neuronal level. Consequently, the key phase modulating perception should be the one present in the brain when the stimulus is actually being processed. Most previous studies, however, reported phase modulation peaking 100 ms or more before target onset. To explain this discrepancy, we first use simulations showing that contamination of spontaneous oscillatory signals by target-evoked ERP and signal filtering (e. g., wavelet) can result in an apparent shift of the peak phase modulation towards earlier latencies, potentially reaching the prestimulus period. We then present a paradigm based on linear systems analysis which can uncover the true latency at which ongoing EEG phase influences perception. After measuring the impulse response function, we use it to reconstruct (rather than record) the brain activity of human observers during white noise sequences. We can then present targets in those sequences, and reliably estimate EEG phase around these targets without any influence of the target-evoked response. We find that in these reconstructed signals, the important phase for perception is that of fronto-occipital similar to 6 Hz background oscillations at about 75 ms after target onset. These results confirm the causal influence of phase on perception at the time the stimulus is effectively processed in the brain.

Increased WM load will increase the amount and difficulty of memory information. Several studies have used electroencephalography (EEG) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore load-dependent cognition processing according to the time courses of electrophysiological activity or the spatial pattern of blood oxygen metabolic activity. However, the relationships between these two activities and the underlying neural mechanism are still unclear. In this study, using simultaneously collected EEG and fMRI data under an n-back verbal WM task, we modeled the spectral perturbation of EEG oscillation and fMRI activation through joint independent component analysis (JICA). Multi-channel oscillation features were also introduced into the JICA model for further analysis. The results showed that time-locked activity of theta and beta were modulated by memory load in the early stimuli evaluation stage, corresponding to the enhanced activation in the frontal and parietal lobe, which were involved in stimulus discrimination, information encoding and delay-period activity. In the late response selection stage, alpha and gamma activity changes dependent on the load correspond to enhanced activation in the areas of frontal, temporal and parietal lobes, which played important roles in attention, information extraction and memory retention. These findings suggest that the increases in memory load not only affect the intensity and time course of the EEG activities, but also lead to the enhanced activation of brain regions which plays different roles during different time periods of cognitive process of WM.

Classification and estimation of small repetitive signals masked by relatively large noise usually requires recording and processing several different realizations of the signal of interest. This is one of the main signal processing problems to solve when estimating or classifying P300 evoked potentials in brain-computer interfaces. To cope with this issue we propose a novel autoencoder variation, called Coherent Averaging Estimation Autoencoder with a new multiobjective cost function.

Generally, this component has an amplitude significantly smaller in patients at high risk of developing the disease than in low risk ones, being a major endophenotype of the disease. In this work, we propose an alternative system to automatically classify P300 signals of individuals with high risk and low risk, composed by two modules: a discrete wavelet transform that extracts features and an artificial neural network module which identifies the patterns. After training, 97.36 % of correct classification was obtained in the database from Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism.

Few electrophysiological studies investigated the time course and the neural correlates of EBL and the integration of face and body emotion-related information. The aim of the present study was to investigate both the time course and the neural correlates underlying the integration of affective information conveyed by faces and bodies. We analysed EEG activities evoked during an expression matching task, requiring the judgment of emotional congruence between sequentially presented pairs of stimuli belonging to the same category (face-face or body-body), and between stimuli belonging to different categories (face-body or body-face). We focused on N400 time window and results showed that incongruent stimuli elicited a modulation of the N400 in all comparisons except for body-face condition. This modulation was mainly detected in the Middle Temporal Gyrus and within regions related to the mirror mechanism. More specifically, while the perception of incongruent facial expressions activates somatosensory-related representations, incongruent emotional body postures also require the activation of motor and premotor representations, suggesting a strict link between emotion and action.

Conversely, healthy older adults demonstrate a rightward shift of this behavioural bias, hinting that an age related reduction of lateralised neural activity may occur within visuospatial attention networks. We compared young (aged 18-25) and older (aged 60-80) adults on a computerised line bisection (landmark) task whilst recording event-related potentials (ERPs). Full-scalp cluster mass permutation tests identified a larger right parieto-occipital response for long lines compared to short in young adults (confirming Benwell et al., 2014a) which was not present in the older group. To specifically investigate age-related differences in hemispheric lateralisation, cluster mass permutation tests were then performed on a lateralised EEG dataset (RH-LH electrodes). A period of right lateralisation was identified in response to long lines in young adults, which was not present for short lines. No lateralised clusters were present for either long or short lines in older adults. Additionally, a reduced P300 component amplitude was observed for older adults relative to young. We therefore report here, for the first time, an age-related and stimulus-driven reduction of right hemispheric control of spatial attention in older adults. Future studies will need to determine whether this is representative of the normal aging process or an early indicator of neurodegeneration.	[Learmonth, Gemma; Benwell, Christopher S.

The present study examined the specificity of motor imagery on the learning of a fine hand motor skill by employing a modified discrete sequence production task: the Go/NoGo DSP task. After an informative cue, a response sequence had either to be executed, imagined, or withheld. To establish learning effects, the experiment was divided into a practice phase and a test phase. In the latter phase, we compared mean response times and accuracy during the execution of unfamiliar sequences, familiar imagined sequences, and familiar executed sequences. The electroencephalogram was measured in the practice phase to compare activity between motor imagery, motor execution, and a control condition in which responses should be withheld. Event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related lateralizations (ERLs) showed strong similarities above cortical motor areas on trials requiring motor imagery and motor execution, while a major difference was found with trials on which the response sequence should be withheld. Behavioral results from the test phase showed that response times and accuracy improved after physical and mental practice relative to unfamiliar sequences (so-called sequence-specific learning effects), although the effect of motor learning by motor imagery was smaller than the effect of physical practice. These findings confirm that motor imagery also resembles motor execution in the case of a fine hand motor skill.

J	Mahajan, Y; Peter, V; Sharma, M				Mahajan, Yatin; Peter, Varghese; Sharma, Mridula			Effect of EEG Referencing Methods on Auditory Mismatch Negativity	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mismatch negativity; event related potential; reference; REST	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; INFINITY REFERENCE; AVERAGE REFERENCE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; SYSTEM ACTIVITY; SPEECH STIMULI; T-COMPLEX; CHILDREN; MATURATION	Auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) have consistently been used in the investigation of auditory and cognitive processing in the research and clinical laboratories. There is currently no consensus on the choice of appropriate reference for auditory ERPs. The most commonly used references in auditory ERR research are the mathematically linked-mastoids (LM) and average referencing (AVG). Since LM and AVG referencing procedures do not solve the issue of electrically-neutral reference, Reference Electrode Standardization Technique (REST) was developed to create a neutral reference for EEG recordings. The aim of the current research is to compare the influence of the reference on amplitude and latency of auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) as a function of magnitude of frequency deviance across three commonly used electrode montages (16, 32, and 64-channel) using REST, LM, and AVG reference procedures. The current study was designed to determine if the three reference methods capture the variation in amplitude and latency of MMN with the deviance magnitude. We recorded MMN from 12 normal hearing young adults in an auditory oddball paradigm with 1,000 Hz pure tone as standard and 1,030, 1,100, and 1,200 Hz as small, medium and large frequency deviants, respectively. The EEG data recorded to these sounds was re-referenced using REST, LM, and AVG methods across 16-, 32-, and 64-channel EEG electrode montages. Results revealed that while the latency of MMN decreased with increment in frequency of deviant sounds, no effect of frequency deviance was present for amplitude of MMN. There was no effect of referencing procedure on the experimental effect tested. The amplitude of MMN was largest when the ERR was computed using LM referencing and the REST referencing produced the largest amplitude of MMN for 64-channel montage. There was no effect of electrode-montage on AVG referencing induced ERPs. Contrary to our predictions, the results suggest that the auditory MMN elicited as a function of increments in frequency deviance does not depend on the choice of referencing procedure. The results also suggest that auditory ERPs generated using REST referencing is contingent on the electrode arrays more than the AVG referencing.

We compare highly conventionalized systematic metonymy (producer-for-product: "All freshmen read O'Connell") to lesser-conventionalized circumstantial metonymy ("[a waitress says to another:] 'Table 2 asked for more coffee."'). Whereas these two metonymy types differ in terms of contextual demands, they each reveal a similar dependency between the named and intended conceptual entities (e.g., Jackendoff, 1997; Nunberg, 1979, 1995). We reason that if each metonymy yields a distinct processing time course and substantially non-overlapping preferential localization pattern, it would not only support a two-mechanism view (one lexical, one pragmatic) but would suggest that conventionalization acts as a linguistic categorizer. By contrast, a similar behavior in time course and localization would support a one-mechanism view and the inference that conventionalization acts instead as a modulator of contextual felicitousness, and that differences in interpretation introduced by conventionalization are of degree, not of kind. Results from three paradigms: self-paced reading (SPR), event-related potentials (ERP), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), reveal the following: no main effect by condition (metonymy vs. matched literal control) for either metonymy type immediately after the metonymy trigger, and a main effect for only the Circumstantial metonymy one word post-trigger (SPR); a N400 effect across metonymy types and a late positivity for Circumstantial metonymy (ERP); and a highly overlapping activation connecting the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (fMRI). Altogether, the pattern observed does not reach the threshold required to justify a two-mechanism system. Instead, the pattern is more naturally (and conservatively) understood as resulting from the implementation of a generalized referential dependency mechanism, modulated by degree of context dependence/conventionalization, thus supporting architectures of language whereby "lexical" and "pragmatic" meaning relations are encoded along a cline of contextual underspecification.

These signatures are neural correlates of deception. However, much less is known about whether these signatures can be modified by noninvasive brain stimulation techniques representing methods of causal intervention of brain processes and the corresponding behavior. Our purpose was to explore whether such methods have an effect on these signatures. MethodsIt is well known that electroencephalographic event-related potential component, P300, is sensitive to perception of critical items in a concealed information test, one of the central methods in deception studies. We examined whether the relative level of expression of P300 as a neural marker of deception can be manipulated by means of noninvasive neuromodulation. We used EEG/ERP recording combined with (i) neuronavigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and (ii)concealed information detection test. An opportunistically recruited volunteer group of normal adults formed our experimental group.

Despite some evidence that abnormal patterns of reward responsiveness might constitute one such potential mechanism, empirical evidence is lacking. The goal of this study was to examine neural responses to gains and losses in children of suicide attempters with no personal history of suicide attempt (SA) themselves. To objectively assess these neural responses, we used feedback negativity (FN), a psychophysiological marker of responsiveness to reward and loss. Participants were 66 parents and their 7-11-year-old children (22 with parental history of SA and 44 demographically and clinically matched children of parents with no SA history). Diagnostic interviews were used to gather information about psychiatric diagnoses, symptoms, and histories of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Children also completed a guessing task, during which continuous electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. The FN was scored as the mean amplitude, 275-375 ms, following gain or loss feedback at frontocentral sites (Fz and FCz). Children of suicide attempters exhibited significantly more negative Delta FN (i.e., FN to losses minus FN to gains) than children of parents with no SA history. We found that this difference in Delta FN was due specifically to children of parents with a history of SA exhibiting a stronger response to loss, and no group differences were observed for responses to gains. The results suggest that an increased neural response to loss might represent one of the potential pathways of the familial transmission of suicide risk.

Oxiracetam and electrical stimulation of cerebellar fastigial nucleus may have beneficial impacts. This study was to investigate the effects of preconditioning with Oxiracetam or fastigial nucleus stimulation (FNS) on cognitive decline following the ascension to high altitude. MethodsThe study was conducted on 60 male military voluntary members who were divided into control group, Oxiracetam group, and fastigial nucleus stimulation group. Transcranial doppler sonography, auditory evoked potential, electroencephalogram (EEG), and cognitive assessments were performed. ResultsPeople could still suffer cognitive dysfunction at 4,000m high altitude despite that they have lived at 1,800m altitude for several years. The 4,000m altitude environment also prolonged P300 and N200 latencies. Both Oxiracetam and FNS improved cognitive function, reduced the prolonged latencies of Event Related Potentials (P300 and N200), decreased the average velocity of brain arteries, and enhanced EEG power spectral entropy at 4,000m altitude. ConclusionsNeurophysiological evidences suggest the underlying mechanism of cognitive impairments. Both Oxiracetam and FNS can reduce cognitive decline post arrival at high altitude. They could be a potential pretreatment method for cognitive dysfunction resulted from high altitude.

Leading evidence for this thesis derives from functional neuroimaging, a methodology ill-suited for detailed assessment of sensory transmission dynamics occurring at the millisecond scale. Electrophysiological assessments of this thesis, however, are sparse and unconvincing. We conducted detailed examination of visual and somatosensory evoked activity using high-density electrical mapping in individuals with autism (N = 20) and precisely matched neurotypical controls (N = 20), recording large numbers of trials that allowed for exhaustive time-frequency analyses at the single-trial level. Measures of intertrial coherence and event-related spectral perturbation revealed no convincing evidence for an unreliability account of sensory responsivity in autism. Indeed, results point to robust, highly reproducible response functions marked for their exceedingly close correspondence to those in neurotypical controls	[Butler, John S.; Molholm, Sophie; Andrade, Gizely N.; Foxe, John J.] Montefiore Med Ctr, Albert Einstein Coll Med, Sheryl & Daniel R Tishman Cognit Neurophysiol Lab, Dept Pediat, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Butler, John S.] Dublin Inst Technol, Sch Math Sci, Kevin St, Dublin 8, Ireland; [Butler, John S.; Foxe, John J.] Univ Dublin, Trinity Coll, Inst Neurosci, Dublin, Ireland; [Molholm, Sophie; Foxe, John J.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dominick P Purpura Dept Neurosci, Rose F Kennedy Intellectual & Dev Disabil Res Ctr, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Foxe, John J.] Univ Rochester, Sch Med & Dent, Dept Neurosci, Ernest J Del Monte Inst Neurosci, Rochester, NY 14642 USA		Butler, JS; Foxe, JJ (corresponding author), Montefiore Med Ctr, Albert Einstein Coll Med, Sheryl & Daniel R Tishman Cognit Neurophysiol Lab, Dept Pediat, Bronx, NY 10461 USA.; Butler, JS (corresponding author), Dublin Inst Technol, Sch Math Sci, Kevin St, Dublin 8, Ireland.; Butler, JS; Foxe, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Dublin, Trinity Coll, Inst Neurosci, Dublin, Ireland.; Foxe, JJ (corresponding author), Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dominick P Purpura Dept Neurosci, Rose F Kennedy Intellectual & Dev Disabil Res Ctr, Bronx, NY 10461 USA.; Foxe, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Rochester, Sch Med & Dent, Dept Neurosci, Ernest J Del Monte Inst Neurosci, Rochester, NY 14642 USA.	john.s.butler@dit.ie; john_foxe@urmc.rochester.edu	Butler, John/L-7789-2019	Butler, John/0000-0001-5567-8634	U.S. National Institute of Mental Health [NIMH RO1 MH085322]; Nathan Gantcher Foundation; Women's Division of The Albert Einstein College of Medicine; center grant from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development [NICHD P30 HD071593]; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT [P30HD071593] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH [R01MH085322] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER	U.S. National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); Nathan Gantcher Foundation; Women's Division of The Albert Einstein College of Medicine; center grant from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))	This work was supported by a grant from the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH RO1 MH085322 to J.J.F. and S.M.).

Optimizing the stimulus presentation paradigm design for the P300-based brain-computer interface using performance prediction	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interface; P300 speller; stimulus presentation paradigm; information theory; combinatorial problem; performance prediction; dynamic stopping	BCI; INTERVAL; MODEL	Objective. The role of a brain-computer interface (BCI) is to discern a user's intended message or action by extracting and decoding relevant information from brain signals. Stimulus-driven BCIs, such as the P300 speller, rely on detecting event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to a user attending to relevant or target stimulus events. However, this process is error-prone because the ERPs are embedded in noisy electroencephalography (EEG) data, representing a fundamental problem in communication of the uncertainty in the information that is received during noisy transmission. A BCI can be modeled as a noisy communication system and an information-theoretic approach can be exploited to design a stimulus presentation paradigm to maximize the information content that is presented to the user. However, previous methods that focused on designing error-correcting codes failed to provide significant performance improvements due to underestimating the effects of psycho-physiological factors on the P300 ERP elicitation process and a limited ability to predict online performance with their proposed methods. Maximizing the information rate favors the selection of stimulus presentation patterns with increased target presentation frequency, which exacerbates refractory effects and negatively impacts performance within the context of an oddball paradigm. An information-theoretic approach that seeks to understand the fundamental trade-off between information rate and reliability is desirable. Approach. We developed a performance-based paradigm (PBP) by tuning specific parameters of the stimulus presentation paradigm to maximize performance while minimizing refractory effects. We used a probabilistic-based performance prediction method as an evaluation criterion to select a final configuration of the PBP. Main results. With our PBP, we demonstrate statistically significant improvements in online performance, both in accuracy and spelling rate, compared to the conventional row-column paradigm. Significance. By accounting for refractory effects, an information-theoretic approach can be exploited to significantly improve BCI performance across a wide range of performance levels.	[Mainsah, B.

In the present study, we compared children with music training versus those without music training across a range of auditory and cognitive measures, including the ability to detect implicitly statistical regularities in input (statistical learning). Methods: Statistical learning of regularities embedded in auditory and visual stimuli was measured in musically trained and age-matched untrained children between the ages of 9-11 years. In addition to collecting behavioural measures, we recorded electrophysiological measures to obtain an online measure of segmentation during the statistical learning tasks. Results: Musically trained children showed better performance on melody discrimination, rhythm discrimination, frequency discrimination, and auditory statistical learning. Furthermore, grand-averaged ERPs showed that triplet onset (initial stimulus) elicited larger responses in the musically trained children during both auditory and visual statistical learning tasks. In addition, children's music skills were associated with performance on auditory and visual behavioural statistical learning tasks. Conclusion: Our data suggests that individual differences in musical skills are associated with children's ability to detect regularities. Significance: The ERP data suggest that musical training is associated with better encoding of both auditory and visual stimuli. Although causality must be explored in further research, these results may have implications for developing music-based remediation strategies for children with learning impairments.

Hypothetically, fast and global inhibition is exerted in the reactive control mode, whereas proactive control enables the preparation of inhibitory pathways in advance while relying on the slower selective inhibitory system. We compared the temporal progression of inhibition in the reactive and proactive control modes using simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) recordings. A selective stop signal task was used where go stimuli required bimanual responses, but only one hand's response had to be suppressed in stop trials. Reactive and proactive conditions were incorporated by non-informative and informative cues, respectively. In 47% of successful stop trials, subthreshold EMG activity was detected that was interrupted as early as 150 ms after stop stimulus presentation, indicating that inhibition occurs much earlier than previously thought. Inhibition latencies were similar across the reactive and proactive control modes. The EMG of the responding hand in successful selective stop trials indicated a global suppression of ongoing motor actions in the reactive condition, and less inhibitory interference on the ongoing actions in the proactive condition. Group-level second order blind separation (SOBI) was applied to the EEG to dissociate temporally overlapping event-related potentials. The components capturing the N1 and N2 were larger in the reactive than the proactive condition. P3 activity was distributed across four components, three of which were augmented in the proactive condition. Thus, although EEG indices were modulated by the control mode, the inhibition latency remained unaffected.

Detecting deficits are vital in making a decision about the treatment plan as it can persist one year or more following a brain injury. The reliability of traditional cognitive assessment tools is debatable, and thus attention has turned to assessments based on electroencephalogram (EEG) to evaluate subtle post-concussive alterations. In this study, we calculated neurocognitive deficits combining EEG analysis with three standard post-concussive assessment tools. Data were collected for all testing modalities from 21 adolescent athletes (seven concussive and fourteen healthy) in three different trials. For EEG assessment, along with linear frequency-based features, we introduced a set of time-frequency (Hjorth Parameters) and nonlinear features (approximate entropy and Hurst exponent) for the first time to explore post-concussive deficits. Besides traditional frequency-band analysis, we also presented a new individual frequency-based approach for EEG assessment. While EEG analysis exhibited significant discrepancies between the groups, none of the cognitive assessment resulted in significant deficits. Therefore, the evidence from the study highlights that our proposed EEG analysis and markers are more efficient at deciphering post-concussion residual neurocognitive deficits and thus has a potential clinical utility of proper concussion assessment and management.

For example, patients with schizophrenia exhibit consistent abnormalities in face-evoked early components of ERPs and mismatch negativities (MMNs). In most studies, the choice of reference has been the average reference (AVE), but whether this is the most suitable choice is still unknown. The aim of this study was to systematically compare the AVE and reference electrode standardization technique (REST) methods for assessing expressional face-evoked early visual ERPs and visual MMNs (vMMNs) in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. The results showed that both the AVE and REST methods could: (1) obtain primary visual-evoked ERPs in the two groups, (2) reveal the neutral and emotional expression discrimination deficit of the P1 component in the patients, which was normal in the healthy controls, (3) reflect reductions of happy vMMNs in the patients compared to the healthy controls, and (4) show right-dominant sad vMMNs only in the patients. On the other hand, compared to the energy distributions of the AVE-obtained potentials, those of REST-obtained early visual ERPs and vMMNs were more concentrated around the temporo-occipital areas. Furthermore, only the REST-obtained vMMNs revealed a significant difference between happy and sad mismatch stimuli in patients with schizophrenia. These results demonstrate that REST technology might provide new insights into neurophysiological factors associated with neuropsychiatric disorders.

Load-Dependent Increases in Delay-Period Alpha-Band Power Track the Gating of Task-Irrelevant Inputs to Working Memory	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						working memory; neural oscillations; alpha-band activity; EEG; distractor processing	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; ATTENTION; MAINTENANCE; INFORMATION; MODULATION; RETENTION; PARIETAL	Studies exploring the role of neural oscillations in cognition have revealed sustained increases in alpha-band power (ABP) during the delay period of verbal and visual working memory (VWM) tasks. There have been various proposals regarding the functional significance of such increases, including the inhibition of task-irrelevant cortical areas as well as the active retention of information in VWM. The present study examines the role of delay-period ABP in mediating the effects of interference arising from on-going visual processing during a concurrent VWM task. Specifically, we reasoned that, if set-size dependent increases in ABP represent the gating out of on-going task-irrelevant visual inputs, they should be predictive with respect to some modulation in visual evoked potentials resulting from a task-irrelevant delay period probe stimulus. In order to investigate this possibility, we recorded the electroencephalogram while subjects performed a change detection task requiring the retention of two or four novel shapes. On a portion of trials, a novel, task-irrelevant bilateral checkerboard probe was presented mid-way through the delay. Analyses focused on examining correlations between set-size dependent increases in ABP and changes in the magnitude of the P1, N1 and P3a components of the probe-evoked response and how such increases might be related to behavior. Results revealed that increased delay-period ABP was associated with changes in the amplitude of the N1 and P3a event-related potential (ERP) components, and with load-dependent changes in capacity when the probe was presented during the delay. We conclude that load-dependent increases in ABP likely play a role in supporting short-term retention by gating task-irrelevant sensory inputs and suppressing potential sources of disruptive interference.

A pervasive problem when measuring event-related potentials is the need to remove the direct-current (DC) artifact produced by the cochlear implant. Here, we describe how DC artifact removal can corrupt the response waveform and how the appropriate choice of stimulus duration may minimize this corruption. Design: Event-related potentials were recorded to a synthesized vowel /a/ with a 170- or 400-ms duration. Results: The P2 response, which occurs between 150 and 250 ms, was corrupted by the DC artifact removal algorithm for a 170-ms stimulus duration but was relatively uncorrupted for a 400-ms stimulus duration. Conclusions: To avoid response waveform corruption from DC artifact removal, one should choose a stimulus duration such that the offset of the stimulus does not temporally coincide with the specific peak of interest. While our data have been analyzed with only one specific algorithm, we argue that the length of the stimulus may be a critical factor for any DC artifact removal algorithm.

J	Colon, E; Liberati, G; Mouraux, A				Colon, Elisabeth; Liberati, Giulia; Mouraux, Andre			EEG frequency tagging using ultra-slow periodic heat stimulation of the skin reveals cortical activity specifically related to C fiber thermonociceptors	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						C fiber; Heat; Thermoreceptors; Electroencephalogram; Frequency-domain analysis; Laser stimulation	UNMYELINATED NOCICEPTIVE AFFERENTS; STATE EVOKED-POTENTIALS; CO2-LASER STIMULI; DISTINCT CLASSES; PAIN; RESPONSES; MONKEY; MECHANISMS; COMPONENTS	The recording of event-related brain potentials triggered by a transient heat stimulus is used extensively to study nociception and diagnose lesions or dysfunctions of the nociceptive system in humans. However, these responses are related exclusively to the activation of a specific subclass of nociceptive afferents: quickly-adapting thermonociceptors. In fact, except if the activation of A delta fibers is avoided or if A fibers are blocked, these responses specifically reflect activity triggered by the activation of Type 2 quickly-adapting A fiber mechano-heat nociceptors (AMH-2). Here, we propose a novel method to isolate, in the human electroencephalogram (EEG), cortical activity related to the sustained periodic activation of heat-sensitive thermonociceptors, using very slow (0.2 Hz) and long-lasting (75 s) sinusoidal heat stimulation of the skin between baseline and 50 degrees C. In a first experiment, we show that when such long-lasting thermal stimuli are applied to the hand dorsum of healthy volunteers, the slow rises and decreases of skin temperature elicit a consistent periodic EEG response at 0.2 Hz and its harmonics, as well as a periodic modulation of the magnitude of theta, alpha and beta band EEG oscillations. In a second experiment, we demonstrate using an A fiber block that these EEG responses are predominantly conveyed by unmyelinated C fiber nociceptors. The proposed approach constitutes a novel mean to study C fiber function in humans, and to explore the cortical processing of tonic heat pain in physiological and pathological conditions.

Diagnostic utility of brain activity flow patterns analysis in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); brain networks; Brain Network Activation (BNA); diagnostics; event-related potentials (ERPs); Go/NoGo; response inhibition; spatio-temporal parcellation analysis	DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; GO/NOGO TASK; STOP-SIGNAL; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS; CHILDREN; ADHD; OSCILLATIONS; METAANALYSIS	Background. A previous small study suggested that Brain Network Activation (BNA), a novel ERP-based brain network analysis, may have diagnostic utility in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this study we examined the diagnostic capability of a new advanced version of the BNA methodology on a larger population of adults with and without ADHD. Method. Subjects were unmedicated right-handed 18- to 55-year-old adults of both sexes with and without a DSM-IV diagnosis of ADHD. We collected EEG while the subjects were performing a response inhibition task (Go/NoGo) and then applied a spatio-temporal Brain Network Activation (BNA) analysis of the EEG data. This analysis produced a display of qualitative measures of brain states (BNA scores) providing information on cortical connectivity. This complex set of scores was then fed into a machine learning algorithm. Results. The BNA analysis of the EEG data recorded during the Go/NoGo task demonstrated a high discriminative capacity between ADHD patients and controls (AUC = 0.92, specificity = 0.95, sensitivity = 0.86 for the Go condition; AUC = 0.84, specificity = 0.91, sensitivity = 0.76 for the NoGo condition). Conclusions. BNA methodology can help differentiate between ADHD and healthy controls based on functional brain connectivity. The data support the utility of the tool to augment clinical examinations by objective evaluation of electro-physiological changes associated with ADHD. Results also support a network-based approach to the study of ADHD.

J	Chen, DW; Han, N; Chen, JJ; Guo, H				Chen, Dong-Wei; Han, Na; Chen, Jun-Jie; Guo, Hao			Novel Algorithm for Measuring the Complexity of Electroencephalographic Signals in Emotion Recognition	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Electroencephalographic Signal; Nonlinear Dynamics; Lerupel-Ziv Complexity; Emotion Recognition	LEMPEL-ZIV COMPLEXITY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; CIRCUMPLEX MODEL; EEG; DYNAMICS; AROUSAL; RECORDINGS; ENTROPY; VALENCE	Emotion recognition in electroencephalographic signals has attracted increasing attention in medical literatures. The Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) measurement is an effective method for processing nonlinear dynamical analysis of electroencephalograms (EEGs), and has been used for emotion recognition in affective brain -computer interface (aBCI) systems. In this paper, an improved algorithm based on conventional LZC was proposed for resolving emotion recognition in EEGs. In the new method, the EEG signal was first preprocessed by employing wavelet packet transform to remove EEG series with low frequencies. Then, a nonlinear filter was used to remove ectopic values from the EEG. Furthermore, an effective adaptive LZC algorithm was proposed for measuring the complexity of EEG signals, and this method was applied to recognize emotions. The fluctuations of LZC sequences in designated electrode sites were constructed using three different LZC algorithms. Then, statistical analysis was carried out for group comparisons of the statistically significant fluctuation of LZC sequences. Finally, it was used as the classified features in a support vector machine classification algorithm. The experiment demonstrated that the proposed method effectively discovered more patterns occurring in EEG signals. Also, it precisely detected oscillations of EEG signals, which may help reveal intrinsic nonlinearity in EEG -based emotion recognition. The adaptive LZC algorithm reached a high average accuracy of 82.43%.

Some artefacts due to simultaneous acquisition pose a threat to the quality of the data. One such problematic artefact is the ballistocardiogram (BCG) artefact. Methods: We developed a hybrid algorithm that combines features of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) with principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the BCG artefact. The algorithm does not require extra electrocardiogram (ECG) or electrooculogram (EOG) recordings to extract the BCG artefact. Results: The method was tested with both simulated and real EEG data of 11 participants. From the simulated data, the similarity index between the extracted BCG and the simulated BCG showed the effectiveness of the proposed method in BCG removal. On the other hand, real data were recorded with two conditions, i.e. resting state (eyes closed dataset) and task influenced (event-related potentials (ERPs) dataset). Using qualitative (visual inspection) and quantitative (similarity index, improved normalized power spectrum (INPS) ratio, power spectrum, sample entropy (SE)) evaluation parameters, the assessment results showed that the proposed method can efficiently reduce the BCG artefact while preserving the neuronal signals. Comparison with existing methods: Compared with conventional methods, namely, average artefact subtraction (MS), optimal basis set (OBS) and combined independent component analysis and principal component analysis (ICA-PCA), the statistical analyses of the results showed that the proposed method has better performance, and the differences were significant for all quantitative parameters except for the power and sample entropy. Conclusions: The proposed method does not require any reference signal, prior information or assumption to extract the BCG artefact. It will be very useful in circumstances where the reference signal is not available. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As of yet, it is, however, still relatively unclear which neural mechanism can mediate training-related performance gains. In the present electrophysiological study, we examined the effects of multi-domain cognitive training on performance in an untrained cue-based task switch paradigm featuring Stroop color words: participants either had to indicate the word meaning of Stroop stimuli (word task) or perform the more difficult task of color naming (color task). One-hundred and three older adults (> 65 years old) were randomly assigned to a training group receiving a 4-month multi-domain cognitive training, a passive no-contact control group or an active (social) control group receiving a 4-month relaxation training. For all groups, we recorded performance and EEG measures before and after the intervention. For the cognitive training group, but not for the two control groups, we observed an increase in response accuracy at posttest, irrespective of task and trial type. No training-related effects on reaction times were found. Cognitive training was also associated with an overall increase in N2 amplitude and a decrease of P2 latency on single trials. Training-related performance gains were thus likely mediated by an enhancement of response selection and improved access to relevant stimulus-response mappings. Additionally, cognitive training was associated with an amplitude decrease in the time window of the target-locked P3 at fronto-central electrodes. An increase in the switch positivity during advance task preparation emerged after both cognitive and relaxation training. Training-related behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) effects were not modulated by task difficulty. The data suggest that cognitive training increased slow negative potentials during target processing which enhanced the N2 and reduced a subsequent P3-like component on both switch and non-switch trials and irrespective of task difficulty. Our findings further corroborate the effectiveness of multi-domain cognitive training in older adults and indicate that ERPs can be instrumental in uncovering the neural processes underlying training-related performance gains.

Distinct roles of theta and alpha oscillations in the involuntary capture of goal-directed attention	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Goal-directed attention; Attentional capture; Neural oscillations; Alpha; Theta	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VISUAL-SEARCH; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; UNATTENDED STIMULI; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; NEURAL MECHANISMS; CONTROL SETTINGS; EEG ALPHA	Mechanisms of attention assign priority to sensory inputs on the basis of current task goals. Previous studies have shown that lateralized neural oscillations within the alpha (8-14 Hz) range are associated with the voluntary allocation of attention to the contralateral visual field. It is currently unknown, however, whether similar oscillatory signatures instantiate the involuntary capture of spatial attention by goal-relevant stimulus properties. Here we investigated the roles of theta (4-8 Hz), alpha, and beta (14-30 Hz) oscillations in human goal-directed visual attention. Across two experiments, we had participants respond to a brief target of a particular color among heterogeneously colored distractors. Prior to target onset, we cued one location with a lateralized, non-predictive cue that was either target- or non-target-colored. During the behavioral task, we recorded brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG), with the aim of analyzing cue-elicited oscillatory activity. We found that theta oscillations lateralized in response to all cues, and this lateralization was stronger if the cue matched the target color. Alpha oscillations lateralized relatively later, and only in response to target colored cues, consistent with the capture of spatial attention. Our findings suggest that stimulus induced changes in theta and alpha amplitude reflect task-based modulation of signals by feature-based and spatial attention, respectively.

Active auditory experience in infancy promotes brain plasticity in Theta and Gamma oscillations	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Auditory; EEG; Development; Brain oscillations; Infant; Plasticity	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; FAMILY-HISTORY; CORTEX; EEG; AGE; SPEECH	Language acquisition in infants is driven by on-going neural plasticity that is acutely sensitive to environmental acoustic cues. Recent studies showed that attention-based experience with non-linguistic, temporally-modulated auditory stimuli sharpens cortical responses. A previous ERP study from this laboratory showed that interactive auditory experience via behavior-based feedback (AEx), over a 6-week period from 4- to 7-months-of-age, confers a processing advantage, compared to passive auditory exposure (PEx) or maturation alone (Naive Control, NC). Here, we provide a follow-up investigation of the underlying neural oscillatory patterns in these three groups. In AEx infants, Standard stimuli with invariant frequency (STD) elicited greater Theta-band (4-6 Hz) activity in Right Auditory Cortex (RAC), as compared to NC infants, and Deviant stimuli with rapid frequency change (DEV) elicited larger responses in Left Auditory Cortex (LAC). PEx and NC counterparts showed less-mature bilateral patterns. AEx infants also displayed stronger Gamma (33-37 Hz) activity in the LAC during DEV discrimination, compared to NCs, while NC and PEx groups demonstrated bilateral activity in this band, if at all. This suggests that interactive acoustic experience with non-linguistic stimuli can promote a distinct, robust and precise cortical pattern during rapid auditory processing, perhaps reflecting mechanisms that support fine-tuning of early acoustic mapping.

J	D'Hondt, F; Maurage, P				D'Hondt, Fabien; Maurage, Pierre			Electrophysiological studies in Internet addiction: A review within the dual-process framework	ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS			English	Review						Internet addiction; Problematic Internet use; Electrophysiology; Event-related potentials; Dual-process models	GAMMA ACTIVITY; DISORDER; INDIVIDUALS; DEPRESSION; NEGATIVITY; CHILDREN; MODEL; POWER; P300; TASK	The increase of pathological Internet use recently led to the identification of an "Internet addiction" disorder. While its diagnosis criteria remain unclear, the behavioral consequences of Internet addiction have been widely explored. Its cerebral correlates have also been investigated using electroencephalography, but obtained results have not yet been integrated in a sound theoretical framework. This paper aims at reviewing these studies and at analyzing their results through a dual-process perspective. A systematic literature search was conducted using Pubmed to identify studies in English exploring neural oscillations and/or event-related potentials in individuals displaying problematic Internet use. The 14 articles finally selected show that Internet addiction shares essential features with other addictive states, mainly a joint hypo-activation of the reflective system (decreased executive control abilities) and hyper-activation of the automatic-affective one (excessive affective processing of addiction related cues). Despite the currently limited data, dual-process models thus appear useful to conceptualize the imbalance between cerebral systems in Internet addiction. We finally propose that future electrophysiological studies should better characterize this disequilibrium between controlled-deliberate and automatic-affective networks, notably by using event-related potentials paradigms focusing on each system separately and on their interactions, but also by better specifying the potential differences between sub-categories of Internet addiction.

The Influence of Negative Emotion on Cognitive and Emotional Control Remains Intact in Aging	FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						aging; executive control; conflict processing; cognitive conflict; emotional conflict; ERPs	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; OWN-AGE BIAS; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; FACE RECOGNITION; OLDER-ADULTS; AUDIOVISUAL INTEGRATION; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; RESPONSE CONFLICT	Healthy aging is characterized by a gradual decline in cognitive control and inhibition of interferences, while emotional control is either preserved or facilitated. Emotional control regulates the processing of emotional conflicts such as in irony in speech, and cognitive control resolves conflict between non-affective tendencies. While negative emotion can trigger control processes and speed up resolution of both cognitive and emotional conflicts, we know little about how aging affects the interaction of emotion and control. In two EEG experiments, we compared the influence of negative emotion on cognitive and emotional conflict processing in groups of younger adults (mean age = 25.2 years) and older adults (69.4 years). Participants viewed short video clips and either categorized spoken vowels (cognitive conflict) or their emotional valence (emotional conflict), while the visual facial information was congruent or incongruent. Results show that negative emotion modulates both cognitive and emotional conflict processing in younger and older adults as indicated in reduced response times and/or enhanced event-related potentials (ERPs). In emotional conflict processing, we observed a valence-specific N100 ERP component in both age groups. In cognitive conflict processing, we observed an interaction of emotion by congruence in the N100 responses in both age groups, and a main effect of congruence in the P200 and N200. Thus, the influence of emotion on conflict processing remains intact in aging, despite a marked decline in cognitive control. Older adults may prioritize emotional wellbeing and preserve the role of emotion in cognitive and emotional control.

Relationship of P3b single-trial latencies and response times in one, two, and three-stimulus oddball tasks	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						P300; EEG; Hidden semi-Markov models; Multi-voxel pattern analysis; N1	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TO-TARGET INTERVAL; P300 LATENCY; STIMULUS; ERP; COMPONENT; VARIABILITY; INDEX; OSCILLATIONS; ASSOCIATION	The P300 is one of the most widely studied components of the human event-related potential. According to a longstanding view, the P300, and particularly its posterior subcomponent (i.e., the P3b), is driven by stimulus categorization. Whether the P3b relates to tactical processes involved in immediate responding or strategic processes that affect future behavior remains controversial, however. It is difficult to determine whether variability in P3b latencies relates to variability in response times because of limitations in the methods currently available to quantify the latency of the P3b during single trials. In this paper, we report results from the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), the Hitchcock Radar Task, and a 3-Stimulus Oddball Task. These represent variants of the one-, two-, and three-stimulus oddball paradigms commonly used to study the P3b. The PVT requires simple detection, whereas the Hitchcock Radar Task and the 3-Stimulus Task require detection and categorization. We apply a novel technique that combines hidden semi-Markov models and multi-voxel pattern analysis (HSMM-MVPA) to data from the three experiments. HSMM-MVPA revealed a processing stage in each task corresponding to the P3b. Trial-by trial variability in the latency of the processing stage correlated with response times in the Hitchcock Radar Task and the 3-Stimulus Task, but not the PVT. These results indicate that the P3b reflects a stimulus categorization process, and that its latency is strongly associated with response times when the stimulus must be categorized before responding. In addition to those theoretical insights, the ability to detect the onset of the P3b and other components on a single-trial basis using HSMM-MVPA opens the door for new uses of mental chronometry in cognitive neuroscience.

It has been suggested that this route might be responsible for the involuntary capture of attention by potentially dangerous stimuli. In separate studies, anatomical evidence has suggested that the retino-tectal pathway relies essentially on projections from the nasal hemiretina (temporal visual field). In this study, we chose to take advantage of this anatomical difference to further investigate whether emotional facial expressions are indeed processed through a subcortical pathway. Using EEG, participants performed a monocular spatial attention paradigm in which lateralized, task-irrelevant distractors were presented, followed by a target. The distracters were fearful faces that appeared either in nasal or temporal visual hemifield (by virtue of their monocular presentations), while the neutral face was presented simultaneously on the opposite side. Participants were asked to identify a target letter that appeared subsequently in the nasal or temporal visual hemifield. Event-related potentials (ERPs) results revealed that fearful faces appearing in the temporal visual hemifield produced a strong inhibitory response, while a negative deflection reflecting attentional capture followed presentations of fear in the nasal hemifield. These effects can be explained by a greater sensitivity of the subcortical pathway for emotional stimuli. Fearful faces conveyed through this route are processed more effectively, consequently necessitating more vigorous suppression in order for targets to be dealt with adequately.

J	Mathias, B; Gehring, WJ; Palmer, C				Mathias, Brian; Gehring, William J.; Palmer, Caroline			Auditory N1 reveals planning and monitoring processes during music performance	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						FRN; N1; Sequence planning; Feedback monitoring; Sensorimotor memory; Music cognition	FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; BRAIN POTENTIALS; SEQUENCE PRODUCTION; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; SPEECH PRODUCTION; ERROR-DETECTION; NEURAL SYSTEM; GAMBLING TASK; SERIAL ORDER	The current study investigated the relationship between planning processes and feedback monitoring during music performance, a complex task in which performers prepare upcoming events while monitoring their sensory outcomes. Theories of action planning in auditory-motor production tasks propose that the planning of future events co-occurs with the perception of auditory feedback. This study investigated the neural correlates of planning and feedback monitoring by manipulating the contents of auditory feedback during music performance. Pianists memorized and performed melodies at a cued tempo in a synchronization-continuation task while the EEG was recorded. During performance, auditory feedback associated with single melody tones was occasionally substituted with tones corresponding to future (next), present (current), or past (previous) melody tones. Only future-oriented altered feedback disrupted behavior: Future-oriented feedback caused pianists to slow down on the subsequent tone more than past-oriented feedback, and amplitudes of the auditory N1 potential elicited by the tone immediately following the altered feedback were larger for future-oriented than for past-oriented or noncontextual (unrelated) altered feedback; larger N1 amplitudes were associated with greater slowing following altered feedback in the future condition only. Feedback-related negativities were elicited in all altered feedback conditions. In sum, behavioral and neural evidence suggests that future-oriented feedback disrupts performance more than past-oriented feedback, consistent with planning theories that posit similarity-based interference between feedback and planning contents. Neural sensory processing of auditory feedback, reflected in the N1 ERP, may serve as a marker for temporal disruption caused by altered auditory feedback in auditory-motor production tasks.

The Effect of Electroencephalogram (EEG) Reference Choice on Information-Theoretic Measures of the Complexity and Integration of EEG Signals	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography; EEG complexity; EEG integration; EEG spectral power density; EEG reference; resting state EEG	PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; ERP GENERATOR PATTERNS; SCALP CURRENT-DENSITY; LAPLACIAN WAVE-FORMS; AVERAGE REFERENCE; REFERENCE ELECTRODE; NEURAL COMPLEXITY; VOLUME-CONDUCTION; SURFACE LAPLACIANS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS	Converging evidence suggests that human cognition and behavior emerge from functional brain networks interacting on local and global scales. We investigated two information-theoretic measures of functional brain segregation and integration interaction complexity C-I(X), and integration I(X) as applied to electroencephalographic (EEG) signals and how these measures are affected by choice of EEG reference. C-I(X) is a statistical measure of the system entropy accounted for by interactions among its elements, whereas I(X) indexes the overall deviation from statistical independence of the individual elements of a system. We recorded 72 channels of scalp EEG from human participants who sat in a wakeful resting state (interleaved counterbalanced eyes-open and eyes-closed blocks). C-I(X) and I(X) of the EEG signals were computed using four different EEG references: linked-mastoids (LM) reference, average (AVG) reference, a Laplacian (LAP) "reference-free" transformation, and an infinity (INF) reference estimated via the Reference Electrode Standardization Technique (REST). Fourier-based power spectral density (PSD), a standard measure of resting state activity, was computed for comparison and as a check of data integrity and quality. We also performed dipole source modeling in order to assess the accuracy of neural source C-I(X) and I(X) estimates obtained from scalp-level EEG signals. C-I(X) was largest for the LAP transformation, smallest for the LM reference, and at intermediate values for the AVG and INF references. I(X) was smallest for the LAP transformation, largest for the LM reference, and at intermediate values for the AVG and INF references. Furthermore, across all references, C-I(X) and I(X) reliably distinguished between resting-state conditions (larger values for eyes-open vs. eyes-closed). These findings occurred in the context of the overall expected pattern of resting state PSD. Dipole modeling showed that simulated scalp EEG-level C-I(X) and I(X) reflected changes in underlying neural source dependencies, but only for higher levels of integration and with highest accuracy for the LAP transformation. Our observations suggest that the Laplacian-transformation should be preferred for the computation of scalp-level C-I(X) and I(X) due to its positive impact on EEG signal quality and statistics, reduction of volume-conduction, and the higher accuracy this provides when estimating scalp-level EEG complexity and integration.

We test the hypothesis that brain activity associated with small vs. large share offered by the Proposer can be detected by event related potentials (ERPs). We observed that differences between wretched and prodigal offers in ERPs latencies, amplitudes and locations appeared along the antero-posterior midline at the time of Proposer's invite to make the offer, that is before the actual offer was made. Differences in ERPs associated with the offered amount of the share were localized at parietal areas when the offer was accepted. We discuss the outcome of these results for reward learning processes.	[Lintas, Alessandra; Jaquerod, Manon; Villa, Alessandro E.

The infinity zero reference obtained by the reference electrode standardization technique (REST) has been recommended and used for its higher accuracy. This paper examined three traditional references, the average reference (AR), the linked mastoids reference (LM), and REST, in the study of the EEG center of mass (CM) using simulated and real ERPs. In the simulation, the relative error of REST was the smallest among the references. As for the ERP data with the visual oddball paradigm, the dynamic CM trajectory and its traveling velocity obtained by REST characterized three typical stages in spatial domain and temporal speed metrics, which provided useful information in addition to the distinct ERP waveform in the temporal domain. The results showed that the CM traveling from the frontal to parietal areas corresponding to the earlier positive components (i.e., P200 and P250), stays temporarily at the parietal area corresponding to P300 and then returns to the frontal area during the recovery stage. Compared with REST, AR, and LM not only changed the amplitude of P300 significantly but distorted the CM trajectory and its instantaneous velocity. As REST continues to provide objective results, we recommend that REST be used in future EEG/ERP CM studies.

Specifically, we examined 30 CHG- and StG-native adults, by contrasting a pseudoword containing an allophonic phoneme variant found in both dialects (i.e. standard) with 2 deviant stimuli encompassing allophonic phoneme variants, of which one was more familiar for CHG natives and the other was more familiar for StG natives. The same stimuli were used in a behavioural same-different discrimination task. Behavioural pseudoword differentiation was better for more familiar allophonic phoneme variants. MMN measures revealed significant fronto-central and temporal deviance-by-language-group interactions, primarily driven by larger MMN responses for less familiar deviants in StG natives. We conclude that a higher degree of familiarity with allophonic variants seems to impact neural processing efficiency, to the extent that less familiar variants demand more wide-spread activation processes.

Explicit human feedback during robot RL is advantageous, since an explicit reward function can be easily adapted. However, it is very demanding and tiresome for a human to continuously and explicitly generate feedback. Therefore, the development of implicit approaches is of high relevance. In this paper, we used an error-related potential (ErrP), an event-related activity in the human electroencephalogram (EEG), as an intrinsically generated implicit feedback (rewards) for RL. Initially we validated our approach with seven subjects in a simulated robot learning scenario. ErrPs were detected online in single trial with a balanced accuracy (bACC) of 91%, which was sufficient to learn to recognize gestures and the correct mapping between human gestures and robot actions in parallel. Finally, we validated our approach in a real robot scenario, in which seven subjects freely chose gestures and the real robot correctly learned the mapping between gestures and actions (ErrP detection (90% bACC)). In this paper, we demonstrated that intrinsically generated EEG-based human feedback in RL can successfully be used to implicitly improve gesture-based robot control during human-robot interaction. We call our approach intrinsic interactive RL.

Differentiating on behavioural examination the vegetative state (VS) from the minimally conscious state (MCS) can lead to a high misdiagnosis rate. Advanced neuroimaging and neurophysiological techniques can supplement clinical evaluation by providing physiological evidence of brain activity. However, an open issue remains whether these empirical results are directly or indirectly associated with covert consciousness and limitations emerge for their diagnostic application at the single-patient level. On the therapeutic side, the efficacy of both non-invasive and invasive brain stimulation/modulation trials is matter of debate. The present review provides an updated analysis of the diagnostic and prognostic impact that the different neurophysiological techniques of stimulation [including short-latency evoked potentials, long-latency event related potentials (ERPs), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), TMS-EEG co-registration] offer in prolonged DoC. The results of the therapeutic stimulation techniques are also evaluated. It is concluded that TMS-EEG emerges as the most promising tool for differentiating VS from MCS whereas ERPs allow neurophysiologists to probe covert cognitive capacities of each patient. Significant behavioural improvements in prolonged DoC with brain stimulation techniques are still anecdotical and further treatment options are awaited.

To this end, we recorded event-related potentials during a typewriting task that combined a semantic priming paradigm with a manipulation of response side (response initiated with right vs. left hand), and focused on the lateralised potentials indexing motor-response activation and inhibition. The critical issue was to assess whether, in the semantically related condition, the increased evidence for the target representation at the conceptual-lexical levels percolates into motor-response preparation, thus triggering an enhanced activation of the corresponding response hand, or whether lexical-semantic and motor-preparation processes unfold independently. Despite effective priming on response times, no selective influence of semantic relatedness was observed on motor-preparation potentials. These results are more compatible with a discrete account.

In fact, most standardized interoceptive tasks require directing attention to internal signals. However, most studies in the field have failed to compare attentional modulations between internally- and externally-driven processes, thus probing blind to the specificity of the former. Here we address this issue through a multidimensional approach combining behavioral measures, analyses of event-related potentials and functional connectivity via high-density electroencephalography, and intracranial recordings. In Study 1, 50 healthy volunteers performed a heartbeat detection task as we recorded modulations of the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) in three conditions: exteroception, basal interoception (also termed interoceptive accuracy), and post-feedback interoception (sometimes called interoceptive learning). In Study 2, to evaluate whether key interoceptive areas (posterior insula, inferior frontal gyrus, amygdala, and somatosensory cortex) were differentially modulated by externally- and internally-driven processes, we analyzed human intracranial recordings with depth electrodes in these regions. This unique technique provides a very fine grained spatio-temporal resolution compared to other techniques, such as EEG or fMRI. We found that both interoceptive conditions in Study 1 yielded greater HEP amplitudes than the exteroceptive one. In addition, connectivity analysis showed that post-feedback interoception, relative to basal interoception, involved enhanced long-distance connections linking frontal and posterior regions. Moreover, results from Study 2 showed a differentiation between oscillations during basal interoception (broadband: 35-110 Hz) and exteroception (1-35 Hz) in the insula, the amygdala, the somatosensory cortex, and the inferior frontal gyrus. In sum, this work provides convergent evidence for the specificity and dynamics of attentional mechanisms involved in interoception.

Temporal orienting (TO) characterizes directing attention to a specific moment in time. Previously, studies indicated that these two processes could have opposite effects on early evoked brain activity. The exact time-course and processing stages of both processes are still unknown. In this human electroencephalography study, we investigated the effects of IA and TO on visuo-tactile stimulus processing within one paradigm. IA was manipulated by presenting auditory cues to indicate whether participants should detect visual or tactile targets in visuo-tactile stimuli. TO was manipulated by presenting stimuli block -wise at fixed or variable inter-stimulus intervals. We observed that TO affects evoked activity to visuo-tactile stimuli prior to IA. Moreover, we found that TO reduces the amplitude of early evoked brain activity, whereas IA enhances it. Using beamformer source localization, we observed that IA increases neural responses in sensory areas of the attended modality whereas TO reduces brain activity in widespread cortical areas. Based on these findings we derive an updated working model for the effects of temporal and intersensory attention on early evoked brain activity.

However, the neurobiological mechanisms behind these modulations are inconclusive. One important system to consider in this regard is the locus coeruleus (LC) norepinephrine (NE) system. In the current study the role of the LC-NE system by means of pupil diameter recordings that are integrated with neurophysiological (EEG) and source localization data were examined. A combined mental-rotation Go/Nogo task was used. The results show that increases in working memory load complicate response inhibition processes. On a neurophysiological level these effects were reflected by specific modulations in event-related potentials (ERPs) reflecting motor inhibition processes (i.e., Nogo-P3). Attentional selection processes (reflected by the P1 and N1) as well as pre-motor inhibition or conflict monitoring processes (reflected by the Nogo-N2) were not affected. Activity of the LC-NE systems, as indexed by the pupil diameter data, predicted neurophysiological processes selectively in the Nogo-P3 time range. Source localization analyses suggest that this modulation occurs in the right middle and inferior frontal gyrus. The study provides evidence that the LC-NE system is an important neurobiological system modulating the effects of working memory load on response inhibition processes. More specifically, it modulates a subset of dissociable cognitive processes that are related to prefrontal cortical regions. Hum Brain Mapp 38:68-81, 2017. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Most likely, this is due to an adaptive mechanism of detecting motivationally relevant signals such as high status, superiority, and dominance. We reasoned that the relevance of leading athletes should lead to a sustained attentional prioritization. To test this idea, we recorded electroencephalography while 45 participants saw brief stills of athletes and estimated whether they were leading or trailing. Based on these recordings, we assessed event-related potentials and focused on the late positive complex (LPC), a well-established signature of controlled attention to motivationally relevant visual stimuli. Confirming our expectation, we found that LPC amplitude was significantly enhanced for leading as compared to trailing athletes. Moreover, this modulation was significantly related to behavioral performance on the score-estimation task. The present data suggest that subtle cues related to athletic supremacy are reliably differentiated in the human brain, involving a strong attentional orienting toward leading athletes. This mechanism might be part of an adaptive cognitive strategy that guides human social behavior.

With the majority rule based on an electroencephalogram (EEG), a technique to determine the attention of multiple users is proposed. In general, a single-shot EEG ensures short-time response, but it is inevitably deteriorated by artifacts. To enhance the accuracy of the majority rule, the collaborative signals of P300 evoked potentials are focused. The collaborative P300 signal is prepared by averaging individual single-shot P300 signals among subjects. In experiments, the EEG signals of twelve volunteers were collected by using auditory stimuli. The subjects paid attention to target stimuli and no attention to standard stimuli. The collaborative P300 signal was used to evaluate the performance of the majority rule. The proposed algorithm enables us to estimate the degree of attention of the group. The classification is based on supervised machine learning, and the accuracy approximately 80%. The applications of this novel technique in multimedia content evaluations as well as neuromarketing and computer-supported co-operative work are discussed.

Along with the advent of EEG-based brain imaging technique, objective assessment of scent preference is of high interest in a variety of application domains. In this work we explore the EEG-based scent preference identification method. We first designed an effective and accurate data collection procedure. We proposed a machine learning algorithm, Spatial Temporal Subspace Optimization (STSO), for the discriminative subspace learning and classification modeling. A filter hank contains multiple hand-pass filters is used to obtain EEG components from specific frequency ranges. Spatial subspace is constructed by exploring discriminative spatial components to enhance the spatial resolution of the EEG. Through the experiment, we confirm that brain signal can he identified in association with responses to pleasant and unpleasant odors. and there is a temporal pattern of such response because the temporal subspace optimization does improve the prediction result. However, event-related potentials were not present in our EEG data, and we have a discussion on the possible causes and implications. Our preliminary result shows that scent can be identified with moderate accuracy.

The present work describes the first time the ERN has been evoked and successfully detected in visual search of complex stimuli. A letter flanker task and a motorcycle conspicuity task were presented to participants during electroencephalographic (EEG) recording. Direct visual inspection and subsequent statistical analysis of the resultant time-locked ERP data clearly indicated that the ERN was detectable in both groups. Further, the ERN pattern did not differ between groups. Such results show that the ERN can be successfully elicited and detected in visual search of complex static images, opening the door to applied neuroergonomic use. Harnessing the brain's error detection system presents significant opportunities and complex challenges, and implication of such are discussed in the context of human-machine systems. Practitioner Summary: For the first time, error-related negativity (ERN) has been successfully elicited and detected in a visually complex applied search task. Brain-process-based error detection in human-machine systems presents unique challenges, but promises broad neuroergonomic applications.	[Sawyer, Ben D.; Hancock, P.

We investigated whether emotionally unpleasant complex images that were presented either unfiltered or with LSF content only in the background while subjects performed a foreground task will withdraw more attentional resources from the task compared to unemotional, neutral images (distraction paradigm). We measured steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) driven by flickering stimuli of a foreground task. Unfiltered unpleasant images resulted in a significant reduction of SSVEP amplitude compared to neutral images. No statistically significant differences were found with LSF background images. In a behavioral control experiment, we found no significant differences for complexity ratings between unfiltered and LSF pictures. Content identification was possible for unfiltered and LSF picture (correct responses>74%). An additional EEG study examined typical emotion-related components for complex images presented either as unfiltered, LSF, or high spatial frequency (HSF, as an additional control) filtered, unpleasant, and neutral images. We found a significant main effect of emotional valence in the early posterior negativity. Late positive potential differences were only found for unfiltered and HSF images. Results suggest that, while LSF content is sufficient to allow for content and emotional cue extraction when images were presented alone, LSF content is not salient enough to serve as emotional distractor that withdraws attentional resources from a foreground task in early visual cortex.

Fixation duration, pupil size and event related potentials (ERPs) locked to the onset of fixation or saccade (saccade-related potentials, SRPs) have been reported to differ dependent on whether a target or a non-target is currently fixated. Here we focus on the question of whether these variables also differ between targets that are subsequently reported (hits) and targets that are not (misses). Observers were asked to scan 15 locations that were consecutively highlighted for 1 s in pseudo-random order. Highlighted locations displayed either a target or a non-target stimulus with two, three or four targets per trial. After scanning, participants indicated which locations had displayed a target. To induce memory encoding failures, participants concurrently performed an aurally presented math task (high load condition). In a low load condition, participants ignored the math task. As expected, more targets were missed in the high compared with the low load condition. For both conditions, eye tracking features distinguished better between hits and misses than between targets and non-targets (with larger pupil size and shorter fixations for missed compared with correctly encoded targets). In contrast, SRP features distinguished better between targets and non-targets than between hits and misses (with average SRPs showing larger P300 waveforms for targets than for non-targets). Single trial classification results were consistent with these averages. This work suggests complementary contributions of eye and EEG measures in potential applications to support search and detect tasks. SRPs may be useful to monitor what objects are relevant to an observer, and eye variables may indicate whether the observer should be reminded of them later.

However, it is often difficult to distinguish subtle but critical changes in the EEG waveform by human eye inspection (visual inspection), thus open a new research field for biomedical engineers to develop and implement several intelligent techniques for the identification of such subtle changes. The EEG signals categorized as non-linear and non-stationary in nature, which achieve to further complexities according to their manual interpretation and detection of normal and abnormal activities. Several classifiers have been proposed to improve accurate and computationally efficient techniques for EEG signal. Swarm optimization algorithms and machine learning classification techniques are usually used to obtain such analysis. This paper introduces a review for some of the preprocessing, feature extraction and classification methodologies used in EEG signals.

We used electroencephalography to investigate adults' P1, N170, P2 and LPP responses to infant and adult faces with happy and sad facial expressions. Viewing infant vs adult faces was associated with significantly larger P1, N170, P2 and LPP responses, with hemisphere and/or participant gender moderating this effect in select cases. Sad faces were associated with significantly larger N170 responses than happy faces. Sad infant faces were associated with significantly larger N170 responses in the right hemisphere than all other combinations of face age and face valence characteristics. We discuss the relative and joint neural prioritization of infant face characteristics and negative facial affect, and their biological value as distinct caregiving and social cues.

Event-related potential data from a guess the number brain-computer interface experiment on school children	SCIENTIFIC DATA			English	Article; Data Paper								Guess the number is a simple P300-based brain-computer interface experiment. Its aim is to ask the measured participant to pick a number between 1 and 9. Then, he or she is exposed to corresponding visual stimuli and experimenters try to guess the number thought while they are observing event-related potential waveforms on-line. 250 school-age children participated in the experiments that were carried out in elementary and secondary schools in the Czech Republic. Electroencephalographic data from three EEG channels (Fz, Cz, Pz) and stimuli markers were stored. Additional metadata about the participants were collected (gender, age, laterality, the number thought by the participant, the guess of the experimenters, and various interesting additional information). Consequently, we offer the largest publicly available odd-ball paradigm collection of datasets to neuroscientific and brain-computer interface community.

Visuospatial information processing load and the ratio between parietal cue and target P3 amplitudes in the Attentional Network Test	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Visuospatial information processing; Event related potentials; P3; Cueing of target; Parietal cortex; Attentional Network Test	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN; CHILDREN	In ERP studies of cognitive processes during attentional tasks, the cue signals containing information about the target can increase the amplitude of the parietal cue P3 in relation to the 'neutral' temporal cue, and reduce the subsequent target P3 when this information is valid, i.e. corresponds to the target's attributes. The present study compared the cue-to-target P3 ratios in neutral and visuospatial cueing, in order to estimate the contribution of valid visuospatial information from the cue to target stages of the task performance, in terms of cognitive load. The P3 characteristics were also correlated with the results of individuals'. performance of the visuospatial tasks, in order to estimate the relationship of the observed ERP with spatial reasoning. In 20 typically developing boys, aged 10-13 years (11.3 +/- 0.86), the intelligence quotient (I.Q.) was estimated by the Block Design and Vocabulary subtests from the WISC-III. The subjects performed the Attentional Network Test (ANT) accompanied by EEG recording. The cued two-choice task had three equiprobable cue conditions: No cue, with no information about the target; Neutral (temporal) cue, with an asterisk in the center of the visual field, predicting the target onset; and Spatial cues, with an asterisk in the upper or lower hemifield, predicting the onset and corresponding location of the target. The ERPs were estimated for the mid-frontal (Fz) and mid-parietal (Pz) scalp derivations. In the Pz, the Neutral cue P3 had a lower amplitude than the Spatial cue P3; whereas for the target ERPs, the P3 of the Neutral cue condition was larger than that of the Spatial cue condition. However, the sums of the magnitudes of the cue and target P3 were equal in the spatial and neutral cueing, probably indicating that in both cases the equivalent information processing load is included in either the cue or the target reaction, respectively. Meantime, in the Fz, the analog ERP components for both the cue and target stimuli did not depend on the cue condition. The results show that, in the parietal site, the spatial cue P3 reflects the processing of visuospatial information regarding the target position. This contributes to the subsequent "decision-making", thus reducing the information processing load on the target response, which is probably reflected in the lower P3. This finding is consistent with the positive correlation of parietal cue P3 with the individual's ability to perform spatial tasks as scored by the Block Design subtest. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In other words, patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) tend to exhibit enhanced early facial processing when compared to healthy controls. Few studies have examined the temporal electrophysiological event-related potential (ERP)-indexed profiles when an individual with SAD compares faces to objects in SAD. Systematic comparisons of ERPs to facial/object stimuli before and after therapy are also lacking. We used a passive visual detection paradigm with upright and inverted faces/objects, which are known to elicit early P1 and N170 components, to study abnormal early face processing and subsequent improvements in this measure in patients with SAD. Methods: Seventeen patients with SAD and 17 matched control participants performed a passive visual detection paradigm task while undergoing EEG. The healthy controls were compared to patients with SAD pre-therapy to test the hypothesis that patients with SAD have early hypervigilance to facial cues. We compared patients with SAD before and after therapy to test the hypothesis that the early hypervigilance to facial cues in patients with SAD can be alleviated. Results: Compared to healthy control (HC) participants, patients with SAD had more robust P1-N170 slope but no amplitude effects in response to both upright and inverted faces and objects. Interestingly, we found that patients with SAD had reduced P1 responses to all objects and faces after therapy, but had selectively reduced N170 responses to faces, and especially inverted faces. Interestingly, the slope from P1 to N170 in patients with SAD was flatter post-therapy than pre-therapy. Furthermore, the amplitude of N170 evoked by the facial stimuli was correlated with scores on the interaction anxiousness scale (IAS) after therapy. Conclusions: Our results did not provide electrophysiological support for the early hypervigilance hypothesis in SAD to faces, but confirm that cognitive-behavioural therapy can reduce the early visual processing of faces. These findings have potentially important therapeutic implications in the assessment and treatment of social anxiety.

People with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) are often over-or under-reactive to stimulation, leading to a wide range of behavioral symptoms. This altered sensitivity may be caused by disrupted sensory processing, signal integration and/or gating, and is often being neglected. Here, we review translational experimental approaches that are used to investigate sensory processing in humans with ASD and FXS, and in relevant rodent models. This includes electroencephalographic measurement of event related potentials, neural oscillations and mismatch negativity, as well as habituation and pre-pulse inhibition of startle. We outline robust evidence of disrupted sensory processing in individuals with ASD and FXS, and in respective animal models, focusing on the auditory sensory domain. Animal models provide an excellent opportunity to examine common mechanisms of sensory pathophysiology in order to develop therapeutics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Performance on emotional tasks engaging cognitive control depends on emotional intelligence abilities: an ERP study	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; GO/NO-GO TASK; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; CONFLICT; IMPAIRMENT; N2; ADOLESCENTS; IMPULSIVITY; DEPRESSION; CHILDREN	Cognitive control is a key process in decision making and adequately adapting our behavior to the environment. Previous studies have provided evidence of a lower capacity for cognitive control in emotion-laden contexts in comparison with neutral contexts. The aim of the present research was to study changes in cognitive control performance as a function of emotional intelligence (EI) level in contexts involving emotional information. The study sample was composed of 2 groups of 22 participants each: the high and low EI group. Participants carried out an emotional go/no-go task while brain activity was recorded by EEG. N2 and P3 ERPs were used as indices of cognitive control processing. Participants with higher EI showed a larger N2, reflecting a greater capacity for cognitive control related to changes in conflict monitoring, and to a better detection and evaluation of the emotional stimuli. Moreover, in general, response inhibition accuracy was reduced when emotional information was involved in this process. Our findings reveal that neural mechanisms underlying tasks that engage cognitive control depend on emotional content and EI level. This study indicates the important role played by EI in the relationship between emotion and cognition. EI training may be a very useful tool for improving performance in emotion-laden contexts.

Phase-Locking Value (PLV), Phase-Lag Index (PLI) and Directed Transfer Function (DTF) were calculated for the original EEG data and following current source density (CSD) transformation, re-referencing using the average reference electrode (AVERAGE) and reference electrode standardization techniques (REST). The statistical analysis of adjacency matrices was carried out using indices based on graph theory. Both CSD and REST reduced the influence of volume conducted currents. The largest group differences in connectivity were observed for the alpha band. Schizophrenic patients showed reduced connectivity strength, as well as a lower clustering coefficient and shorter characteristic path length for both measures of phase synchronization following CSD transformation or REST re-referencing. Reduced synchronization was accompanied by increased directional flow from the occipital region for the alpha band. Following the REST re-referencing, the sources of alpha activity were located at parietal rather than occipital derivations. The results of PLV and DTF demonstrated group differences in fronto-posterior asymmetry following CSD transformation, while for PLI the differences were significant only using REST. The only analysis that identified group differences in inter-hemispheric asymmetry was DTF calculated for REST. Our results suggest that a comparison of different connectivity measures using graph-based indices for each frequency band, separately, may be a useful tool in the study of disconnectivity disorders such as schizophrenia.

Some have shown a syntax-related P600 component, but it has not been ruled out that the AGL P600 effect is a response to surface features (e. g., subsequence familiarity) rather than the underlying syntax structure. Therefore, in this study, we controlled for the surface characteristics of the test sequences (associative chunk strength) and recorded the EEG before (baseline preference classification) and after (preference and grammaticality classification) exposure to a grammar. After exposure, a typical, centroparietal P600 effect was elicited by grammatical violations and not by unfamiliar subsequences, suggesting that the AGL P600 effect signals a response to structural irregularities. Moreover, preference and grammaticality classification showed a qualitatively similar ERP profile, strengthening the idea that the implicit structural mere-exposure paradigm in combination with preference classification is a suitable alternative to the traditional grammaticality classification test.

The mechanisms responsible for task switching and language switching were investigated using electrophysiological (EEG) measures. In nonverbal task switching, monolinguals and bilinguals demonstrated equivalent behavioral mixing (pure vs. repeat) and switching (repeat vs. switch) costs, but bilinguals were more accurate in the mixed blocks. Bilinguals used a more distributed neural network than monolinguals that captured the nonverbal mixing effect and showed earlier discrimination for the switching effect in the ERPs. In language switching, more distributed networks for bilinguals than monolinguals were found for the switching effect. The scalp distributions revealed more overlap between task switching and language switching for bilinguals than monolinguals. For switch costs, both groups showed P3/LPC modulations in both tasks, but bilinguals showed extended activation to central regions for both switching tasks. For mixing costs, both groups revealed modulations of the N2 but only bilinguals showed extended activation to the occipital region. Overall bilinguals revealed more overlapping processing between task- and language-switching than monolinguals, consistent with the interpretation of integration of verbal and nonverbal control networks during early visual processing for bilinguals and later executive processing for monolinguals.

Thirty low-and thirty high-performers were selected from a larger cohort of students based on performance on a visual WM task. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data during performance on this task was analyzed with event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) and event-related coherence (ErCoh) in individually determined theta, alpha, and gamma frequency bands. The results demonstrated that high-performers in comparison to low-performers showed significantly different brain oscillatory responses in all three cognitive processes identified in the WM task - encoding, maintenance and retrieval. High-performers displayed: (1) Increased alpha ERD during encoding and increased gamma ERD during encoding and maintenance, which did not depend on set size, as well as (2) increased theta band ErCoh in fronto-parietal networks during maintenance and retrieval. To some extent, neural efficiency was observed in the gamma frequency band (ERD) and in theta coherence (ErCoh). The results tentatively lend support to the continuous single resource model assuming that working memory capacity is a flexible resource that can be spread among all elements in the sensory input as opposed to the model of discrete slots.

To make a molehill out of a mountain: An ERP-study on cognitive reappraisal of negative pictures in children with and without ADHD	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						ADHD; Cognitive reappraisal; Emotion regulation; Children; Late positive potential (LPP)	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EMOTION REGULATION; ELECTROCORTICAL REACTIVITY; DISORDER ADHD; ADOLESCENTS; FACES; STRATEGIES; MODULATE	Objective: We investigated cognitive reappraisal in children with ADHD by means of the late positive potential (LPP) and self-report ratings. We expected diminished LPP modulation following reappraisal and lower self-report scores in children with ADHD. Methods: Eighteen children with ADHD and 24 typically developing (TD) children (8-12 years) performed a cognitive reappraisal task, while EEG was recorded, and filled out a questionnaire on cognitive reappraisal. Results: Despite the lack of main reappraisal effects on LPP, the LPP was less positively modulated during reappraisal in ADHD compared to TD children. Conclusions: Children with ADHD reported less use of reappraisal and could be distinguished from TD children based on LPP modulation. However the lack of main effects of reappraisal on LPP in both groups hinders clear interpretation of this finding and questions the suitability of LPP modulation within the current paradigm as a neural index of reappraisal in children 8-12 years old, and warrants further research on the inter-individual variability and sensitivity of LPP modulation as a neural index of emotion regulation in children. Significance: This is the first study investigating the LPP during cognitive reappraisal in children with ADHD. (C) 2017 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Our objective was to assess the temporal distribution of arousal-related measures around PLMS. Polysomnographic recordings of six patients with restless legs syndrome were analyzed. We analyzed 15 PLMS, plus three 5-s epochs before and after each movement, for every patient. Mean values per epoch of blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and electroencephalographic (EEG) power were calculated. For each patient, six 5-s epochs of undisturbed sleep were analyzed as controls. Alpha + beta EEG power, systolic BP, and HR were significantly increased following PLMS. The EEG power and HR increases were noticed in the first epoch after PLMS, whereas that of systolic BP was observed in the second and third epochs following a PLMS. No significant changes occurred in the epochs of undisturbed sleep. The results suggest that PLMS are followed by arousal-related nervous system events. Given the high frequency of PLMS throughout the night, they could be a potential risk factor for nocturnal arrhythmias and hypertension, in addition to causing sleep deprivation.

We studied the use of heuristic and rational strategies and their electrophysiological correlates. Since previous work linked the P3 ERP component to attention and decision making, we were interested whether the amplitude of this component is associated with decision strategy use. To this end, we recorded EEG when participants performed a two-alternative choice task, where they could acquire decision cues in a sequential manner and use them to make choices. We classified participants' choices as consistent with a rational Weighted Additive rule (WADD) or a simple heuristic Take The Best (TTB). Participants differed in their preference for WADD and TTB. Using a permutation-based single trial approach, we analyzed EEG responses to consecutive decision cues and their relation to the individual strategy preference. The preference for WADD over TTB was associated with overall higher signal amplitudes to decision cues in the P3 time window. Moreover, the preference for WADD was associated with similar P3 amplitudes to consecutive cues, whereas the preference for TTB was associated with substantial decreases in P3 amplitudes to consecutive cues. We also found that the preference for TTB was associated with enhanced N1 component to cues that discriminated decision alternatives, suggesting very early attention allocation to such cues by TTB users. Our results suggest that preference for either WADD or TTB has an early neural signature reflecting differences in attentional weighting of decision cues. In light of recent findings and hypotheses regarding P3, we interpret these results as indicating the involvement of catecholamine arousal systems in shaping predecisional information processing and strategy selection.

This EEG-based diagnosis was eventually confirmed by the clinical evolution of the patient.Conclusion: This approach illustrates the potential importance of functional brain-imaging data to improve diagnosis of consciousness and of cognitive abilities in critical situations in which the behavioral channel is compromised such as deafferented locked-in syndrome.

Bayesian methods are an alternative to standard frequentist methods. This article provides researchers with an introduction to fundamental ideas in Bayesian modeling. We use data from an electroencephalogram (EEG) and anxiety study to illustrate Bayesian models. Specifically, the models examine the relationship between error-related negativity (ERN), a particular event-related potential, and trait anxiety. Methodological topics covered include: how to set up a regression model in a Bayesian framework, specifying priors, examining convergence of the model, visualizing and interpreting posterior distributions, interval estimates, expected and predicted values, and model comparison tools. We also discuss situations where Bayesian methods can outperform frequentist methods as well has how to specify more complicated regression models. Finally, we conclude with recommendations about reporting guidelines for those using Bayesian methods in their own research. We provide data and R code for replicating our analyses.

Many studies correlate a criterion individual difference variable (e.g., anxiety) with a psychophysiological measurement derived by subtracting scores taken from two within-subject conditions. These subtraction-based difference scores are intended to increase specificity by isolating variability of interest. Using data on the error-related negativity (ERN) and correct response negativity (CRN) in relation to generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), we highlight several conceptual and practical issues with subtraction-based difference scores and propose alternative approaches based on regression. We show that ERN and CRN are highly correlated, and that the DERN (i.e., ERN2CRN) is correlated in opposite directions both with ERN and CRN. Bivariate analyses indicate that GAD is related to DERN and ERN, but not CRN. We first show that, by using residualized scores, GAD relates both to a larger ERN and smaller CRN. Moreover, by probing the interaction of ERN and CRN, we show that the relationship between GAD and ERN varies by CRN. These latter findings are not evident when using traditional subtraction-based difference scores. We then completed follow-up analyses that suggested that an increased P300 in anxious individuals gave rise to the apparent anxiety/CRN relationship observed. These findings have important conceptual implications for facilitating the interpretability of results from individual difference studies of psychophysiology.

Interestingly, this Simon effect is reduced after non-corresponding trials. Such sequential effects can be explained in terms of a more focused processing of the relevant stimulus dimension due to increased cognitive control, which transfers from the previous non-corresponding trial (conflict adaptation effects). Alternatively, sequential modulations of the Simon effect can also be due to the degree of trial-to-trial repetitions and alternations of task features, which is confounded with the correspondence sequence (feature integration effects). In the present study, we used a spatially two-dimensional Simon task with vertical response keys to examine the contribution of adaptive cognitive control and feature integration processes to the sequential modulation of the Simon effect. The two-dimensional Simon task creates correspondences in the vertical as well as in the horizontal dimension. A trial-by-trial alternation of the spatial dimension, for example from a vertical to a horizontal stimulus presentation, generates a subset containing no complete repetitions of task features, but only complete alternations and partial repetitions, which are equally distributed over all correspondence sequences. In line with the assumed feature integration effects, we found sequential modulations of the Simon effect only when the spatial dimension repeated. At least for the horizontal dimension, this pattern was confirmed by the parietal P3b, an event-related potential that is assumed to reflect stimulus-response link processes. Contrary to conflict adaptation effects, cognitive control, measured by the fronto-central N2 component of the EEG, was not sequentially modulated. Overall, our data provide behavioral as well as electrophysiological evidence for feature integration effects contributing to sequential modulations of the Simon effect.

Motor imagery (MI), the mental practice of movements, has been suggested as a promising complement to other therapeutic approaches facilitating motor rehabilitation. Of particular potential is the combination of MI with neurofeedback (NF). However, MI NF protocols have been largely optimized only in younger healthy adults, although strokes occur more frequently in older adults. The present study examined the influence of age on the neural correlates of MI supported by electroencephalogram (EEG)-based NF and on the neural correlates of motor execution. We adopted a multimodal neuroimaging framework focusing on EEG-derived event-related desynchronization (ERD%) and oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbR) concentrations simultaneously acquired using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). ERD%, HbO concentration and HbR concentration were compared between younger (mean age: 24.4 years) and older healthy adults (mean age: 62.6 years). During MI, ERD% and HbR concentration were less lateralized in older adults than in younger adults. The lateralization-by-age interaction was not significant for movement execution. Moreover, EEG-based NF was related to an increase in task-specific activity when compared to the absence of feedback in both older and younger adults. Finally, significant modulation correlations were found between ERD% and hemodynamic measures despite the absence of significant amplitude correlations. Overall, the findings suggest a complex relationship between age and movement-related activity in electrophysiological and hemodynamic measures. Our results emphasize that the age of the actual end-user should be taken into account when designing neurorehabilitation protocols. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Patients with NF1 frequently exhibit cognitive impairments like attention problems, working memory deficits and dysfunctional inhibitory control. The latter is also relevant for the resolution of cognitive conflicts. However, it is unclear how conflict monitoring processes are modulated in NF1. To examine this question in more detail, we used a system neurophysiological approach combining high-density ERP recordings with source localisation analyses in juvenile patients with NF1 and controls during a flanker task. Behaviourally, patients with NF1 perform significantly slower than controls. Specifically on trials with incompatible flanker-target pairings, however, the patients with NF1 made significantly fewer errors than healthy controls. Yet, importantly, this overall successful conflict resolution was reached via two different routes in the two groups. The healthy controls seem to arrive at a successful conflict monitoring performance through a developing conflict recognition via the N2 accompanied by a selectively enhanced N450 activation in the case of perceived flanker-target conflicts. The presumed dopamine deficiency in the patients with NF1 seems to result in a reduced ability to process conflicts via the N2. However, NF1 patients show an increased N450 irrespective of cognitive conflict. Activation differences in the orbitofrontal cortex (BA11) and anterior cingulate cortex (BA24) underlie these modulations. Taken together, juvenile patients with NF1 and juvenile healthy controls seem to accomplish conflict monitoring via two different cognitive neurophysiological pathways. (C) 2017 The Authors.

EEG is uniquely sensitive to real-time neural computations, and thus is a promising tool to study the construction of emotion. This series of studies aimed to probe the mechanistic contribution of the late positive potential (LPP) to multimodal emotion perception. Experiment 1 revealed that LPP amplitudes for visual images, sounds, and visual images paired with sounds were larger for negatively rated stimuli than for neutrally rated stimuli. Experiment 2 manipulated this audiovisual enhancement by altering the valence pairings with congruent (e.g., positive audio+positive visual) or conflicting emotional pairs (e.g., positive audio+negative visual). Negative visual stimuli evoked larger early LPP amplitudes than positive visual stimuli, regardless of sound pairing. However, time frequency analyses revealed significant midfrontal theta-band power differences for conflicting over congruent stimuli pairs, suggesting very early (approximate to 500 ms) realization of thematic fidelity violations. Interestingly, late LPP modulations were reflective of the opposite pattern of congruency, whereby congruent over conflicting pairs had larger LPP amplitudes. Together, these findings suggest that enhanced parietal activity for affective valence is modality independent and sensitive to complex affective processes. Furthermore, these findings suggest that altered neural activities for affective visual stimuli are enhanced by concurrent affective sounds, paving the way toward an understanding of the construction of multimodal affective experience.

In the presented method, we use separately recorded horizontal EOG (HEOG) and vertical EOG (VEOG) signals as two reference inputs, which are processed using finite impulse response (FIR) filters. The linear filter coefficients are adaptively updated using a numerical variable forgetting factor (NVFF) recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm, which tracks nonstationary EOG signals. Subsequently, the processed HEOG and VEOG signals are subtracted from recorded EEG signal to obtain an artifact-free EEG signal. Simulation is conducted using synthetic EEG signal corrupted by noise, synthetic HEOG and VEOG signals. The real-time recorded EEG signal (corrupted by EOG and noise) is also refined using the separately recorded reference EOG signals and FIR filtering technique. For synthetic and real-time signals, the simulation results are presented to demonstrate that linear NVFF-RLS algorithm-based artifact and noise excision technique outperforms conventional fixed forgetting factor RLS, fixed step-size NLMS and generalized variable step-size NLMS algorithms, in terms of the reduction in mean-squared error, under low as well as high signal-to-noise ratio conditions.

Objective Assessment of Perceived Effort in Listening by Employing EEG Feature	2017 39TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	PROCEEDINGS OF ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY		English	Proceedings Paper	39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 11-15, 2017	SOUTH KOREA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, PubMed, MEDLINE, Korean Soc Med & Biol Engn				The adjustment of hearing aid devices can heavily depend on the subjective feedback of the patients. Our aim is to investigate measures that can be used objectively to state a subject's listening effort. To obtain a comprehensive and reliable measure as an indicator for a person's listening effort, we need to have a better understanding of electroencephalograpic (EEG) activities. Decoding EEG signals specifically by the analysis of the instantaneous phase information has been a new trend in the last decades. Throughout many studies conducted in the past, it has been shown that the instantaneous phase of oscillatory signals reset in relation to various cognitive processes. This is based on a hypothesis presented for the generation of event related potentials. In this study, we measure the degree of phase re-organization through fitting a von Mises distribution to EEG recordings. The concentration parameter of a von Mises distribution has been shown as an informative feature for reflecting the level of attention. This feature has been used for predicting the listening effort and the results are compared among three different hearing aid settings.	[Mortezapouraghdam, Z.; Bernarding, C.; Strauss, D.

These criteria are often used interchangeably in rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) studies but little is known about how rapidly they are processed. The aim of this work was to compare the time course of attentional selection and memory encoding for different types of target criteria. We conducted two experiments where participants reported one or two targets (T1, T2) presented in lateral RSVP streams. Targets were marked either by being a singleton color (red letter among black letters), being categorically distinct (digits among letters) or non-singleton color (target color letter among heterogeneously colored letters). Using event related potential (ERPs) associated with attention and memory encoding (the N2pc and the P3 respectively), we compared the relative latency of these two processing stages for these three kinds of targets. In addition to these ERP measures, we obtained convergent behavioral measures for attention and memory encoding by presenting two targets in immediate sequence and comparing their relative accuracy and proportion of temporal order errors. Both behavioral and EEG measures revealed that singleton color targets were attended much more quickly than either non-singleton color or categorical targets, and there was very little difference between attention latencies to non-singleton color and categorical targets. There was however a difference in the speed of memory encoding for non-singleton color and category latencies in both behavioral and EEG measures, which shows that encoding latency differences do not always mirror attention latency differences.

Mixed results, however, have been found in Chinese, and it is still unclear what roles syllables and segments play in planning Chinese spoken word production. In the current study, participants were asked to first prepare and later produce disyllabic Mandarin words upon picture prompts and a response cue while electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded. Each two consecutive pictures implicitly formed a pair of prime and target, whose names shared the same word-initial atonal syllable or the same word-initial segments, or were unrelated in the control conditions. Only syllable repetition induced significant effects on event-related brain potentials (ERPs) after target onset: a widely distributed positivity in the 200-to 400-ms interval and an anterior positivity in the 400- to 600-ms interval. We interpret these to reflect syllable-size representations at the phonological encoding and phonetic encoding stages. Our results provide the first electrophysiological evidence for the distinct role of syllables in producing Mandarin spoken words, supporting a language specificity hypothesis about the primary phonological units in spoken word production.

It has remained unknown whether these advantages prevailed with a new version of the edges paradigm designed for a mobile device. This paper investigated and evaluated in a rolling wheelchair a mobile BCI, which implemented the edges paradigm on small displays with which visual crowding tends to occur. How the mobile edge paradigm outperforms the mobile row-column paradigm has implications for understanding how principles of visual neurocognition affect BCI speller use in a mobile context. This investigation revealed that all the advantages of the edges paradigm over the row-column paradigm prevailed in this setting. However, the reduction in adjacent errors for the edges paradigm was unprecedentedly limited to horizontal adjacent errors. The interpretation offered is that dimensional constraints of visual interface design on a smartphone thus affected the neurocognitive processes of crowding.

Therefore, the ability to predict response, and especially lack of response to treatment, as early as possible after treatment onset or change, is of prime significance. Many studies have demonstrated significant results regarding the ability to use EEG and ERP markers, including attention-associated markers such as P300, for early prediction of response to treatment. But these markers are derived from long EEG/ERP samples, often from multiple channels, which render them impractical for frequent sampling. Methods and results: We developed a new electrophysiological attention-associated marker from a single channel (two electrodes), using 1-min samples with auditory oddball stimuli. This work presents an initial evaluation of the ability to use this markers dynamics between repetitive measures for early (<2 weeks) differentiation between responders and non-responders to antidepressive treatment, in 26 patients with various levels of depression and heterogeneous treatment interventions. The slope of change in the marker between early consecutive samples was negative in the non-responders, but not in the responders. This differentiation was stronger for patients suffering from severe depression (p < 0.001). Conclusion: This pilot study supports the feasibility of the EEG marker for early recognition of treatment-resistant depression. If verified in large-scale prospective studies, it can contribute to research and clinical work.

The underlying neural mechanisms and functional cortical networks have frequently been investigated using neurophysiological (EEG) or functional imaging methods. However, task switching processes are subject to strong intra-individual variability, especially when tested under varying levels of working memory demands. This intra-individual variability compromises the reliable estimation of neurophysiological processes and related functional neuroanatomical networks. In this study, we combine residue iteration decomposition (RIDE) of event-related potentials (ERPs) and source localization methods to circumvent this problem. Due to strong intra-individual variability, behavioral effects between memory-based and cue-based task switching were not reflected by classical ERPs, but were so after applying RIDE. Using RIDE, modulations paralleling the behavioral data were specifically reflected by processes related to the updating of internal representations for response selection (reflected by the C-cluster in the P3-component time range) rather than by stimulus and motor-related processes (reflected by the S-cluster and R-cluster). The C-cluster-processes were associated with activation differences in the inferior parietal cortex, including the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ, BA40) and likely reflect mechanisms related to the updating of internal representations and task sets for response selection. The results underline the necessity to use temporal decomposition methods to control the problem of intra-individual signal variability to decipher the neurophysiology and functional neuroanatomy of cognitive processes.

Therefore an effective, light weight approach is a must. There are several technologies used in deception detection. EEG based deception detection is one such approach. P300 wave is most commonly used in EEG based deception detection which depends on a stimuli. The study provides an alternative approach to deception detection instead of using P300. Twelve subjects were participated to the study and EEG signals were recorded while they were telling truths and lies. The preprocessed EEG data then fed in to feature extraction and machine learning algorithm alone with Common Spatial Patterns ( CSP) paradigm to create a model. Logistic regression classifier was used as the machine learning algorithm to classify the eeg signal. The test data were used on the trained model with cross validation.

However, emotional processing remains relatively stable even though emotional processing alters through aging. Neurophysiological studies have employed emotional stimuli to investigate age differences through Event Related Potentials (ERPs). The present approach used affective visual word stimuli derived from the Greek language. Healthy young and elderly volunteers passively viewed the stimuli which were divided into pleasant, unpleasant and neutral. The study shows differential processing of emotional stimuli in comparison to the neutral in terms of temporal resolution (latency) and activation of neuronal assembles (amplitude). The age factor interacts with emotional dimension through a complex pattern while laterality differences also occur. Our results suggest a difference in the way emotional stimuli are processed during aging through functional compensation.

(2) Methods: Twelve experienced soccer players (24.8 +/- 2 years) completed three counterbalanced 20 min sessions of (1) seated rest; (2) moderate intensity treadmill exercise; and (3) a game of futsal. Once heart rate returned to within 10% of pre-activity levels, participants completed the Stroop Color Word Conflict Task while reaction time (RT) and P300 event-related potentials were measured. (3) Results: Reaction time during Stroop performance was significantly faster following the futsal game and treadmill exercise compared to the seated rest. The P300 amplitude during Stroop performance was significantly greater following futsal relative to both treadmill and seated-rest conditions. (4) Conclusions: These findings suggest that single bouts of indoor soccer among college-aged soccer players, compared to treadmill and seated-rest conditions, may engender the greatest effect on brain networks controlling attention allocation and classification speed during the performance of an inhibitory control task. Future research is needed to determine if cognitively engaging forms of aerobic exercise may differentially impact executive control processes in less experienced and older adult participants.

The effect of anticipated achievement feedback on students' semantic processing as indicated by the N400 cloze effect	LEARNING AND INSTRUCTION			English	Article						Anticipated achievement feedback; Emotions; Semantic processing; N400; Event-related potentials	GOALS; PERFORMANCE; EMOTIONS; MOOD; POWER; MODEL	The present study examined the effects of anticipated achievement feedback on students' semantic processing on the neural level, using event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Participants (N = 79) anticipated either self-referential or normative achievement feedback regarding an announced upcoming test. Additionally, their performance expectations (low vs. no expectations) were orthogonally manipulated. Subsequently, students' on-line semantic processing was assessed by measuring the N400 doze effect, a component in the EEG signal of which the amplitude is associated with semantic processing. Within the low performance-expectation condition, no effect of anticipated feedback on semantic processing was found. Within the no-performance-expectation condition, participants anticipating self-referential feedback showed a more widely distributed N400 doze effect than participants anticipating normative feedback. The results confirmed the hypothesis that the mere expectation of a particular type of feedback can affect students' semantic processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The system uses the "odd-ball" row-col paradigm for generating the P300 evoked potentials on the scalp of the user, which are immediately processed and translated into web browser commands. There were previous approaches for controlling a BCI web browser. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them was focused on an assistive context, failing to test their applications with a suitable number of end users. In addition, all of them were synchronous applications, where it was necessary to introduce a "read-mode" command in order to avoid a continuous command selection. Thus, the aim of this study is twofold: 1) to test our web browser with a population of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients in order to assess the usefulness of our proposal to meet their daily communication needs; and 2) to overcome the aforementioned limitation by adding a threshold that discerns between control and non-control states, allowing the user to calmly read the web page without undesirable selections. The browser was tested with sixteen MS patients and five healthy volunteers. Both quantitative and qualitative metrics were obtained. MS participants reached an average accuracy of 84.14%, whereas 95.75% was achieved by control subjects. Results show that MS patients can successfully control the BCI web browser, improving their personal autonomy.

A Systematic Review of Intervention Studies Examining Nutritional and Herbal Therapies for Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Using Neuroimaging Methods: Study Characteristics and Intervention Efficacy	EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE			English	Review							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ALZHEIMERS ASSOCIATION WORKGROUPS; VASCULAR DEMENTIA; DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINES; NATIONAL INSTITUTE; SENILE-DEMENTIA; GINKGO-BILOBA; DOUBLE-BLIND; DISEASE; MEMORY	Neuroimaging facilitates the assessment of complementary medicines (CMs) by providing a noninvasive insight into their mechanisms of action in the human brain. This is important for identifying the potential treatment options for target disease cohorts with complex pathophysiologies. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate study characteristics, intervention efficacy, and the structural and functional neuroimaging methods used in research assessing nutritional and herbal medicines for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Six databases were searched for articles reporting on CMs, dementia, and neuroimaging methods. Data were extracted from 21/2,742 eligible full text articles and risk of bias was assessed. Nine studies examined people with Alzheimer's disease, 7 MCI, 4 vascular dementia, and 1 all-cause dementia. Ten studies tested herbal medicines, 8 vitamins and supplements, and 3 nootropics. Ten studies used electroencephalography (EEG), 5 structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 2 functional MRI (fMRI), 3 cerebral blood flow (CBF), 1 single photon emission tomography (SPECT), and 1 positron emission tomography (PET). Four studies had a low risk of bias, with the majority consistently demonstrating inadequate reporting on randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, and power calculations. A narrative synthesis approach was assumed due to heterogeneity in study methods, interventions, target cohorts, and quality. Eleven key recommendations are suggested to advance future work in this area.

Adaptive Stimulus Selection in hRP-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces by Maximizing Expected Discrimination Gain	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS (SMC)	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	OCT 05-08, 2017	Banff, CANADA	IEEE			CLASSIFICATION	Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can provide an alternative means of communication for individuals with severe neuromuscular limitations. The P300-based BCI speller relies on eliciting and detecting transient event-related potentials (ERPs) in electroencephalography (EEG) data, in response to a user attending to rarely occurring target stimuli amongst a series of non-target stimuli. However, in most P300 speller implementations, the stimuli to be presented are randomly selected from a limited set of options and stimulus selection and presentation are not optimized based on previous user data. In this work, we propose a data-driven method for stimulus selection based on the expected discrimination gain metric. The data-driven approach selects stimuli based on previously observed stimulus responses, with the aim of choosing a set of stimuli that will provide the most information about the user's intended target character. Our approach incorporates knowledge of physiological and system constraints imposed due to real-time BCI implementation. Simulations were performed to compare our stimulus selection approach to the row-column paradigm, the conventional stimulus selection method for P300 spellers. Results from the simulations demonstrated that our adaptive stimulus selection approach has the potential to significantly improve performance from the conventional method: up to 34% improvement in accuracy and 43% reduction in the mean number of stimulus presentations required to spell a character in a 72-character grid. In addition, our greedy approach to stimulus selection provides the flexibility to accommodate design constraints.

The effect of tDCS over the right temporo-parietal junction on pain empathy	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Empathy; TDCS; Temporo-parietal junction; ERP	DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; RIGHT TEMPOROPARIETAL JUNCTION; VISUAL PERSPECTIVE-TAKING; EMOTION; EEG; DISSOCIATION; EXPRESSIONS; MODULATION; EXPERIENCE; RESONANCE	Empathy is a complex psychological phenomenon crucial for social perception and interactions. Several lines of evidence suggest that the right temporo-parietal junction is involved in self-other control mechanisms that play an important role in empathic responses. However, limited direct evidence of the involvement of this region in empathic responses is currently available. In this study, inhibitory transcranial direct current stimulation over this region influenced empathic responses to others' pain. It was found that compared to participants that received anodal or sham transcranial direct current stimulation, participants who received cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the right temporo-parietal junction perceived the pain of others as less intense compared to sham stimulation and showed decreased late event related potentials to facial expressions of pain. Furthermore, it was found the stimulation had no significant effect on measures of sensorimotor resonance and physiological responses to pain in others. Our results demonstrate that the right temporo-parietal junction plays a role in empathic responses and that its inhibition can decrease behavioural and cerebral measures related to the cognitive-evaluative component of empathy. It is proposed that the right temporo-parietal junction is a valid stimulation target to study the influence of self-other control in empathic processes and could be useful to study the involvement of this region observed in clinical conditions characterized by altered empathic responses.

J	Huberth, M; Fujioka, T				Huberth, Madeline; Fujioka, Takako			Neural representation of a melodic motif: Effects of polyphonic contexts	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Auditory processes; EEG; ERPs; Perception	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; FEATURE CONJUNCTIONS; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; STIMULUS DEVIANCE; SENSORY MEMORY; BRAIN; MUSIC; SOUND; INFORMATION	In music, a melodic motif is often played repeatedly in different pitch ranges and at different times. Event-related potential (ERP) studies have shown that the mismatch negativity (MMN) reflects memory trace processing that encodes two separate melodic lines ("voices") with different motifs. Here we investigated whether a single motif presented in two voices is encoded as a single entity or two separate entities, and whether motifs overlapping in time impede or enhance encoding strength. Electroencephalogram (EEG) from 11 musically-trained participants was recorded while they passively listened to sequences of 5-note motifs where the 5th note either descended (standard) or ascended (deviant) relative to the previous note (20% deviant rate). Motifs were presented either in one pitch range, or alternated between two pitch ranges, creating an "upper" and a "lower" voice. Further, motifs were either temporally isolated (silence in between), or temporally concurrent with two tones overlapping. When motifs were temporally isolated, MMN amplitude in the one-pitch-range condition was similar to that in the two-pitch-range upper voice. In contrast, no MMN, but P3a, was observed in the two-pitch range lower voice. When motifs were temporally concurrent and presented in two pitch ranges, MMN exhibited a more posterior distribution in the upper voice, but again, was absent in the lower voice.

Yet data on direct comparisons across ADHD and preterm birth on cognitive-neurophysiological measures are limited. Method: We directly compared 186 preterm-born adolescents to 69 term-born adolescents with ADHD and 135 term-born controls on cognitive-performance and event related potential measures associated with attentional and inhibitory processing from a cued continuous performance test (CPT-OX), which we have previously shown to discriminate between the adolescents with ADHD and controls. We aimed to elucidate whether the ADHD-like symptoms and cognitive impairments in preterm-born individuals reflect identical cognitive-neurophysiological impairments in term-born individuals with ADHD. Results: Go-P3 amplitude was reduced, reflecting impaired executive response control, in preterm-born adolescents compared to both controls and adolescents with ADHD. Moreover, in preterm-born adolescents, as in term-born adolescents with ADHD, contingent negative variation amplitude was attenuated, reflecting impairments in response preparation compared to controls. Although the ADHD group showed significantly increased NoGo-P3 amplitude at FCz compared to preterm group, at Cz preterm-born adolescents demonstrated significantly decreased NoGo-P3 amplitude compared to the control group, similar to term-born adolescents with ADHD. Conclusion: These findings indicate impairments in response preparation, executive response control, and response inhibition in preterm-born adolescents. Although the response preparation and response inhibition impairments found in preterm-born adolescents overlap with those found in term-born adolescents with ADHD, the preterm group also shows unique impairments, suggesting more wide-ranging impairments in the preterm group compared to the ADHD group.

However, most of these studies examined EEG correlates at channel domain, which suffers the limitation that EEG signals are the mixture of multiple underlying neuronal sources due to the volume conduction effect. Moreover, few studies have been conducted in real-world tasks. To precisely probe EEG correlates with specific neural substrates to mental factors in real-world tasks, the present study examined EEG correlates to three mental factors, i.e., mental fatigue [also known as time-on-task (TOT) effect], workload and effort, in EEG component signals, which were obtained using an independent component analysis (ICA) on high-density EEG data. EEG data were recorded when subjects performed a realistically simulated air traffic control (ATC) task for 2 h. Five EEG independent component (IC) signals that were associated with specific neural substrates (i.e., the frontal, central medial, motor, parietal, occipital areas) were identified. Their spectral powers at their corresponding dominant bands, i.e., the theta power of the frontal IC and the alpha power of the other four ICs, were detected to be correlated to mental workload and effort levels, measured by behavioral metrics. Meanwhile, a linear regression analysis indicated that spectral powers at five ICs significantly increased with TOT. These findings indicated that different levels of mental factors can be sensitively reflected in EEG signals associated with various brain functions, including visual perception, cognitive processing, and motor outputs, in real-world tasks. These results can potentially aid in the development of efficient operational interfaces to ensure productivity and safety in ATC and beyond.

The current study examined neural correlates of attentional processing in response to experimentally induced uncertainty in OCD. MethodsTwenty-four OCD patients and 24 healthy controls performed a task where neutral and negative pictures were preceded by a cue, either being predictive (certain condition) or nonpredictive (uncertain condition) of subsequent picture valence. We examined prepicture anticipatory attention through (approximate to 8-12 Hz) suppression, and attentional allocation during picture presentation with the P1, N1, P2, N2, and late positive potential (LPP) of the event-related potential. Additionally, we tested how clinical measures related to these attentional markers. ResultsSubjectively, patients overestimated the frequency of negative pictures after nonpredictive cues. Patients, but not controls, showed upper (10-12 Hz) suppression after nonpredictive and predictive negative cues relative to predictive neutral cues. Only patients showed increased P2 and decreased N2 amplitudes for pictures after nonpredictive cues, and, whereas both groups showed increased LPP amplitudes for pictures after nonpredictive cues, this modulation was more pronounced in OCD during the early LPP (<1,000 ms). In patients, P2 and LPP amplitudes for negative pictures were associated positively with anxiety and negatively with depression. ConclusionsThese results suggest that OCD patients process anticipation of inevitable and potential threat similarly and highlight the substantial motivational impact of uncertain events to OCD patients. Finally, the correlation with anxiety implies that anxiety represents the source of hypervigilance during uncertainty resolution.

Demonstrating test-retest reliability of electrophysiological measures for healthy adults in a multisite study of biomarkers of antidepressant treatment response	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Evoked potentials; Surface Laplacian; LORETA; Biomarkers; Reliability	CURRENT SOURCE DENSITY; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; EEG ALPHA ASYMMETRY; RESOLUTION ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; AUDITORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; ERP GENERATOR PATTERNS; LAPLACIAN WAVE-FORMS; INTENSITY DEPENDENCE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC-ALPHA	Growing evidence suggests that loudness dependency of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP) and resting EEG alpha and theta may be biological markers for predicting response to antidepressants. In spite of this promise, little is known about the joint reliability of these markers, and thus their clinical applicability. New standardized procedures were developed to improve the compatibility of data acquired with different EEG platforms, and used to examine test-retest reliability for the three electrophysiological measures selected for a multisite project-Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care (EMBARC). Thirty-nine healthy controls across four clinical research sites were tested in two sessions separated by about 1 week. Resting EEG (eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions) was recorded and LDAEP measured using binaural tones (1000 Hz, 40 ms) at five intensities (60-100 dB SPL). Principal components analysis of current source density waveforms reduced volume conduction and provided reference-free measures of resting EEG alpha and N1 dipole activity to tones from auditory cortex. Low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) extracted resting theta current density measures corresponding to rostral anterior cingulate (rACC), which has been implicated in treatment response. There were no significant differences in posterior alpha, N1 dipole, or rACC theta across sessions. Test-retest reliability was.84 for alpha, .87 for N1 dipole, and .70 for theta rACC current density. The demonstration of good-to-excellent reliability for these measures provides a template for future EEG/ERP studies from multiple testing sites, and an important step for evaluating them as biomarkers for predicting treatment response.

On age-related differences in cognitive control during visual search	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						Aging; Cognitive control; Visual search; N2pc; Pd; CDA	DOWN SUPPRESSION DEFICIT; ATTENTIONAL CAPTURE; WORKING-MEMORY; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; STIMULUS; EEG; REPRESENTATIONS; COMPENSATION; CONTINGENT; MECHANISMS	The effect of healthy aging on cognitive control of irrelevant visual information was investigated by using event-related potentials. Participants performed a spatial cuing task where an irrelevant color cue that was either contingent (color search) or noncontingent (shape search) on the attentional set was presented before a target with different stimulus-onset asynchronies. In the contingent condition, attentional capture appeared independent of age and persisted over the stimulus-onset asynchronies but was markedly pronounced for elderly people. Accordingly, event-related potential analyses revealed that both older and younger adults initially selected the irrelevant cue when it was contingent on the attentional set and transferred spatial cue information into working memory. However, only younger adults revealed inhibitory mechanisms to compensate for attentional capture. It is proposed that this age-related lack of reactive inhibition leads to stickiness in visual processing whenever information is contingent on the attentional set, unveiling older adults' "Achilles' heel" in cognitive control.

From the perspective of error control, enterprises need to integrate relevant information to deal with those events so as to reduce their negative effects to the enterprise. The source of error information is error report. In order to find the measures of improving the willingness for report errors, mixed experiments designed for both within the subject and in between two subjects have been applied, together with related potentials (ERPs), to explore the effect of different motivation mechanism on the mechanism of self error report. The research shows that as far as the willingness of error report is concerned, the positive monetary incentive (bonus) often leads to greater FRN and P300 amplitudes, compared to the negative stimulus (penalty), whereas positive motivation is more effective than negative motivation when provoking extrinsic motivation. Meanwhile, when increasing the self-selection right of error report, i.e., when voluntary error report system is applied, the inner motivation of error report will increase accordingly and more attention will be paid to the incentive. Hence the effect of incentive will be improved.

We contrast these three modalities for a given video sequence to determine if there is a gap between what humans consciously see and what we implicitly perceive. Participants are shown a video sequence with different artifacts appearing at specific distances in their field of vision; near foveal, middle peripheral, and far peripheral. Our results show distinct differences between what we saccade to (eye tracking), how we consciously rate video quality, and our neural responses (EEG data). Our findings indicate that the measurement of perceived quality depends on the specific modality used.

In more complex cases where the human body is involved in executing multiple and different tasks simultaneously, the learning process is subject to both learning and differentiating between the sensor groups. In this article, the concept of connectivity, as applied to electroencephalograms (EEGs), followed by cooperative learning and the theory involved are explored. Next, the concept of multitask diffusion adaptation and learning will be discussed. Finally, we see how cooperative learning can model a complex biological system as well as restoration of movement related brain potentials. In addition, a cooperative tracking system is introduced for detection and tracking of the changes in brain event related potentials.

J	Almehmadi, A; El-Khatib, K				Almehmadi, Abdulaziz; El-Khatib, Khalil			On the Possibility of Insider Threat Prevention Using Intent-Based Access Control (IBAC)	IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL			English	Article						Access control; brain signals; electroencephalogram (EEG); event-related potential (ERP); insider threat; intent authentication; intention detection; motivation detection; P300	GUILTY KNOWLEDGE TEST; P300; VALIDITY	Existing access control mechanisms are based on the concept of identity enrolment and recognition and assume that recognized identity is a synonym to ethical actions, yet statistics over the years show that the most severe security breaches are the results of trusted, identified, and legitimate users who turned into malicious insiders. Insider threat damages vary from intellectual property loss and fraud to information technology sabotage. As insider threat incidents evolve, there exist demands for a nonidentity-based authentication measure that rejects access to authorized individuals who have mal-intents of access. In this paper, we study the possibility of using the user's intention as an access control measure using the involuntary electroencephalogram reactions toward visual stimuli. We propose intent-based access control (IBAC) that detects the intentions of access based on the existence of knowledge about an intention. IBAC takes advantage of the robustness of the concealed information test to assess access risk. We use the intent and intent motivation level to compute the access risk. Based on the calculated risk and risk accepted threshold, the system makes the decision whether to grant or deny access requests. We assessed the model using experiments on 30 participants that proved the robustness of the proposed solution.

However, electroencephalogram (EEG)-based predictions of antidepressant's treatment outcome may help during antidepressant's selection and ultimately improve the quality of life for MDD patients. In this study, a machine learning (ML) method involving pretreatment EEG data was proposed to perform such predictions for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRIs). For this purpose, the acquisition of experimental data involved 34 MDD patients and 30 healthy controls. Consequently, a feature matrix was constructed involving time-frequency decomposition of EEG data based on wavelet transform (WT) analysis, termed as EEG data matrix. However, the resultant EEG data matrix had high dimensionality. Therefore, dimension reduction was performed based on a rank-based feature selection method according to a criterion, i.e., receiver operating characteristic (ROC). As a result, the most significant features were identified and further be utilized during the training and testing of a classification model, i.e., the logistic regression (LR) classifier. Finally, the LR model was validated with 100 iterations of 10-fold cross-validation (10-CV). The classification results were compared with short-time Fourier transform (STFT) analysis, and empirical mode decompositions (EMD). The wavelet features extracted from frontal and temporal EEG data were found statistically significant. In comparison with other time-frequency approaches such as the STFT and EMD, the WT analysis has shown highest classification accuracy, i.e., accuracy = 87.5%, sensitivity = 95%, and specificity = 80%. In conclusion, significant wavelet coefficients extracted from frontal and temporal pre-treatment EEG data involving delta and theta frequency bands may predict antidepressant's treatment outcome for the MDD patients.

Categorization responses are elicited only if infants discriminate between different categories and generalize across exemplars within each category. In study 1, human or ape faces were presented as standard and deviant stimuli in upright and inverted trials. Upright ape faces presented among humans elicited strong categorization responses, whereas responses for upright human faces and for inverted ape faces were smaller. Deviant inverted human faces did not elicit categorization. Data were best explained by a model with main effects of species and orientation. However, variance of low-level image characteristics was higher for the ape than the human category. Variance was matched to replicate this finding in an independent sample (study 2). Both human and ape faces elicited categorization in upright and inverted conditions, but upright ape faces elicited the strongest responses. Again, data were best explained by a model of two main effects. These experiments demonstrate that 9-month-olds rapidly categorize faces, and unfamiliar faces presented among human faces elicit increased categorization responses. This likely reflects habituation for the familiar standard category, and stronger release for the unfamiliar category deviants.

In contrast, attention to internal interoceptive visceral targets has only recently begun to be studied, despite its potential importance in emotion, empathy, and self-awareness. Here, we studied the effects of shifting attention to the heart using a cue-target detection paradigm during continuous EEG recordings. Subjects were instructed to count either a series of visual stimuli (visual condition) or their own heartbeats (heart condition). Visual checkerboard stimuli were used as attentional probes throughout the task. Consistent with previous findings, attention modulated the amplitude of the heartbeat-evoked potentials. Directing attention to the heart significantly reduced the visual P1/N1 amplitude evoked by the attentional probe. ERPs locked to the attention-directing cue revealed a novel frontal positivity around 300 ms postcue. Finally, spectral power in the alpha band over parieto-occipital regions was higher while attending to the heart-when compared to the visual task-and correlated with subject's performance in the interoceptive task. These results are consistent with a shared, resource-based attentional mechanism whereby allocating attention to bodily signals can affect early responses to visual stimuli.

Its application has been extended to other non-medical areas like self-regulation, marketing, games and entertainment. Conventionally, BCI largely relies on the visual perception channel to provide users with cues or stimuli for the generation of appropriate brain signals that can be identified accurately with classification algorithms. This could lead to visual fatigue and also distract the attention of users from the environment with which they are interacting. This paper explores the haptic perception channel for enhancing BCI performance. Analogous to the paradigms used in vision-based BCI, the corresponding P300 event related potential and steady state evoked potential in the haptics domain are discussed. Besides, the potential of using haptic feedback to improve and guide motor imagery in a way similar to that of visual feedback are also discussed.

The higher sampling frequency enables inaudible sound components (above 20 kHz) that are cut off in low-resolution audio to be reproduced. Previous studies of high-resolution audio have mainly focused on the effect of such high-frequency components. It is known that alpha-band power in a human electroencephalogram (EEG) is larger when the inaudible high-frequency components are present than when they are absent. Traditionally, alpha-band EEG activity has been associated with arousal level. However, no previous studies have explored whether sound sources with high-frequency components affect the arousal level of listeners. The present study examined this possibility by having 22 participants listen to two types of a 400-s musical excerpt of French Suite No. 5 by J. S. Bach (on cembalo, 24-bit quantization, 192 kHz A/D sampling), with or without inaudible high-frequency components, while performing a visual vigilance task. High-alpha (10.5-13 Hz) and low-beta (13-20 Hz) EEG powers were larger for the excerpt with high-frequency components than for the excerpt without them. Reaction times and error rates did not change during the task and were not different between the excerpts. The amplitude of the P3 component elicited by target stimuli in the vigilance task increased in the second half of the listening period for the excerpt with high-frequency components, whereas no such P3 amplitude change was observed for the other excerpt without them. The participants did not distinguish between these excerpts in terms of sound quality. Only a subjective rating of inactive pleasantness after listening was higher for the excerpt with high-frequency components than for the other excerpt. The present study shows that high-resolution audio that retains high-frequency components has an advantage over similar and indistinguishable digital sound sources in which such components are artificially cut off, suggesting that high-resolution audio with inaudible high-frequency components induces a relaxed attentional state without conscious awareness.

This study focused on the neurocognitive functioning of 20 healthy young adults in an equiprobable go/no-go task to map the ERP correlates of behavioral responses and examine contributions of the resting state intrinsic EEG to task-related outcomes. Continuous EEG was recorded during pretask eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) conditions, and in the subsequent task. Delta, theta, alpha, and beta band amplitudes were assessed for the EC state and also for the reactive change to EO. Go/no-go ERPs were submitted to temporal principal components analysis, where the P2, N2, P3, and slow wave components of interest were extracted. The performance measure of reaction time (RT) variability was positively correlated with no-go and go errors, and also with go P2 amplitude, linking these to stimulus discrimination efforts involved in appropriate response selection. An N2c-P3b pairing was enhanced for shorter mean RTs, supporting their involvement in the decision to execute a response. A stepwise regression model identified EC midline delta as a predictor of P3b positivity, highlighting the relevance of delta in the neural mechanisms of attentional processes. These findings clarify the electrophysiology underlying decision-making processes in executive function, and provide a platform for further research assessing performance outcomes in larger samples and in developmental/clinical contexts.

In this study, brain activities in string recognition task compared with idle control state are analyzed through topographies based on multiple measurements, i.e. sample entropy, symbolic sample entropy and normalized rhythm power, extracted from simultaneously collected scalp EEG. Our analyses show that, for most subjects, both symbolic sample entropy and normalized gamma power in string recognition task are significantly higher than those in idle state, especially at locations of P4, O2, T6 and C4. It implies that these regions are highly involved in string recognition task. Since symbolic sample entropy measures complexity, from the perspective of new information generation, and normalized rhythm power reveals the power distributions in frequency domain, complementary information about the underlying dynamics can be provided through the two types of indices.

In the field of cognitive neuroscience, the past studies on mathematically gifted brains have concentrated on investigating event-related brain activation regions, cerebral laterality of cognitive functions, functional specialization that is uniquely dedicated for specific cognitive purposes, and functional interactions among discrete brain regions. From structural and functional perspectives, these studies have witnessed both general and unique neural characteristics of mathematically gifted brains. In this article, the theoretical background, empirical studies, and neurocognitive mechanisms of mathematically gifted children/adolescents are reviewed. Based on the integration of the findings, some potential directions for the future research are identified and discussed.

In this study, we aimed to provide additional scientific evidence with more insight on how the brain functions at a good/bad cognitive state than the usual statistical analysis. We introduced the brain activation measurement using baseline-normalized ERSP to determine the activation of EEG data from stimuli. These active points over a period of time could reflect brain synchronization due to stimuli. We also demonstrated the use of proposed measure on attention working memory data. The results indicate the potential of using the proposed measurement in categorizing the brain cognitive state and identifying some important factors to provide additional evidence to the field in the future.

Bilingual experience shapes language processing: Evidence from codeswitching	JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Bilingualism; Codeswitching; Language comprehension; Language production; Event-related potentials	VOICE ONSET TIME; SPANISH-ENGLISH; GENDER AGREEMENT; VERB BIAS; TELL US; CODE; SENTENCE; COMPREHENSION; CONSTRAINTS; REVEAL	We report three experiments on two groups of Spanish-English bilinguals who differed in codeswitching experience (codeswitchers and non-codeswitchers) to examine how different production choices predict comprehension difficulty. Experiment 1 examined the processing of gender congruent and gender incongruent determiner-noun switches in sentential contexts using event-related potentials. While codeswitchers demonstrated N400 sensitivity to congruency manipulations, non-codeswitchers showed a modulation of early frontal EEG activity to switching, regardless of switch type. Experiment 2 validated the translation-equivalent target words compared in Experiment I. In Experiment 3, the bilinguals who participated in Experiment 1 completed a task that elicited naturally-produced codeswitched speech. Codeswitchers switched more often than non-codeswitchers, and their switches robustly reflected the conditions that were more easily processed in Experiment 1. Together, the results indicate the comprehension system becomes optimally attuned to variation in the input, and demonstrate that switching costs depend on the type of codeswitch and bilinguals' language experience.

Greater Attention to Task-Relevant Threat Due to Orbitofrontal Lesion	JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Article						behavioral assessments; cognitive function; EEG; human studies; traumatic brain injury	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX LESIONS; ANTERIOR THALAMIC NUCLEI; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; EMOTIONAL STIMULI; VISUAL-ATTENTION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; FRONTAL LOBES; HEAD-INJURY	Injury to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is a frequent consequence of head injury and may lead to dysfunctional regulation of emotional and social behavior. Dysfunctional emotional behavior may partly be related to the role of the OFC in emotion-attention interaction, as reported previously. In order to better understand its role in emotion-attention and emotion-cognitive control interactions, we investigated attention allocation to task-relevant and task-irrelevant threat-related emotional stimuli during a task requiring cognitive control in patients with lesion to the OFC. We measured the behavioral performance and event-related potentials (ERP) of 13 patients with OFC lesion and 11 control subjects during a Go/NoGo visual discrimination task. In the task, line drawings of threatening (spider) and neutral (flower) figures served as either task-relevant Go or NoGo signals, or as task-irrelevant distractors. Overall performance did not differ between the groups. In contrast to the control group performance, the orbitofrontal group performance was improved by relevant threat signal in comparison with neutral signal. Further, task-relevant threat signals evoked larger frontocentral N2-P3 amplitude in the orbitofrontal group. Taken together, behavioral and electrophysiological results suggest that patients with OFC injury allocated more attentional and cognitive control resources in the context of task-relevant emotional stimuli. This study provides new evidence for the role of the OFC in emotion-attention and emotion-cognitive control interactions. Further, the OFC seems to contribute to the balance between voluntary and involuntary attention networks in context of emotional stimuli. Better understanding of alterations in emotion-attention interaction offers insight into affective dysfunction due to OFC lesion.

To probe cortical processing differences of emotional face and scene images, electroencephalogram (EEG) of sixteen volunteers was recorded while they watching emotional images. Early-mid occipital ERPs (Event Related Potentials) under different images were compared, and RMS (Root Mean Square) was calculated to analyze activities of the whole brain. Results showed that the N1 (170 ms) amplitudes and P2 (250 ms) amplitudes induced by face images were respectively larger and smaller than that induced by scene images, which embodied specific processing of faces and reprocessing of complex scenes. Negative scene images were processed preferentially and induced more obvious N1 than positive or neutral scene images. Comparisons of ERPs among the whole brain displayed that occipital lobe was the main active region and frontal lobe responsible for emotional regulation was activated mainly at moments of N1 and P2. The early-mid ERPs comparisons explicitly showed cortical processing differences of emotional face and scene images, which deserved further studies.

Indices of Effortful Listening Can Be Mined from Existing Electroencephalographic Data	EAR AND HEARING			English	Article						Attention; Auditory-evoked potential; Cognitive hearing; Data mining; Event-related spectral perturbation; Working memory	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; EEG DYNAMICS	Objectives: Studies suggest that theta (similar to 4 to 7 Hz), alpha (similar to 8 to 12 Hz), and stimulus-evoked dynamics of the electroencephalogram index effortful listening. Numerous auditory event-related potential datasets exist, without thorough examination of these features. The feasibility of mining those datasets for such features is assessed here. Design: In a standard auditory-oddball paradigm, 12 listeners heard deviant high-frequency tones (10%) interspersed among low-frequency tones (90%) "near" or "far" separated in frequency. Results: During active listening (deviance detection; experiment 1), sustained frontal midline theta power, and gamma-band inter-trial phase coherence, were greater for the near condition. No significant "near"/"far" differences were observable during passive exposure to the same sounds (experiment 2). Conclusions: Increased theta power likely reflects increased utilization of cognitive-control processes (e.g., working memory) that rely on frontal cortical networks. Inter-trial phase coherence differences may reflect differences in attention-modulated stimulus encoding. Reanalysis of existing datasets can usefully inform future work on listening effort.

Intersensory timing is crucial in this process because only inputs reaching the brain within a restricted temporal window are perceptually bound. Previous research in the audiovisual field has investigated various features of the temporal binding window, revealing asymmetries in its size and plasticity depending on the leading input: auditory-visual (AV) or visual-auditory (VA). Here, we tested whether separate neuronal mechanisms underlie this AV-VA dichotomy in humans. We recorded high-density EEG while participants performed an audiovisual simultaneity judgment task including various AV-VA asynchronies and unisensory control conditions (visual-only, auditory-only) and tested whether AV and VA processing generate different patterns of brain activity. After isolating the multisensory components of AV-VA event-related potentials (ERPs) from the sum of their unisensory constituents, we ran a time-resolved topographical representational similarity analysis (tRSA) comparing the AV and VA ERP maps. Spatial cross-correlation matrices were built from real data to index the similarity between the AV and VA maps at each time point (500 ms window after stimulus) and then correlated with two alternative similarity model matrices: AV(maps) = VA(maps) versus AV(maps) not equal VA(maps). The tRSA results favored the AV(maps) not equal VA(maps) model across all time points, suggesting that audiovisual temporal binding (indexed by synchrony perception) engages different neural pathways depending on the leading sense. The existence of such dual route supports recent theoretical accounts proposing that multiple binding mechanisms are implemented in the brain to accommodate different information parsing strategies in auditory and visual sensory systems.

The Severity of Deformity in Metopic Craniosynostosis Is Correlated with the Degree of Neurologic Dysfunction	PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY			English	Article							SINGLE-SUTURE CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS; NONSYNDROMIC CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS; SURGICAL-CORRECTION; LONG-TERM; SYNOSTOSIS; CHILDREN; INFANTS; SPEECH; RESPONSES; DYSLEXIA	Background: In recent years, metopic synostosis has represented up to 25 percent of all nonsyndromic craniosynostosis cases, manifesting with varying degrees of trigonocephaly. It is unknown whether the degree of severity of anterior dysmorphology is proportionate to neurologic dysfunction. This knowledge is essential to guide future surgical treatment recommendations. Given the reported correlation of abnormal auditory processing with future language dysfunction and poorer academic performance in craniosynostosis patients, the present study aims to evaluate auditory processing in preoperative patients with moderate and severe metopic synostosis, and in control infants, to discern the neurologic risk carried by different severities of trigonocephaly. Methods: Thirty-eight infants underwent evaluation of auditory processing: nine patients with severe metopic synostosis, seven with moderate metopic synostosis, and 22 controls. Brain activity was recorded by electroencephalography while the participants listened to language-based stimuli. Electroencephalographic data were analyzed to extract event-related potentials evoked by the speech sounds. Results: Severe metopic synostosis patients demonstrated significantly attenuated event-related potential responses in the left frontal scalp region overlying the left frontal lobe compared with controls (p < 0.05). The moderate metopic synostosis patients did not show significantly different language processing compared to the control infants or the severe metopic synostosis patients in the frontal scalp region. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that untreated severe metopic synostosis is associated with reduced language response in the frontal cortex. Less severe (moderate) forms are indeterminate, and mild forms do not show calculable irregularity by the event-related potential method of analysis.

This technology is promising for elderly or disabled patient assistance with daily life. The key issue of a BRI system is to identify human mental activities, by decoding brainwaves, acquired with an EEG device. Compared with other BCI applications, such as word speller, the development of these applications may be more challenging since control of robot systems via brainwaves must consider surrounding environment feedback in real-time, robot mechanical kinematics, and dynamics, as well as robot control architecture and behavior. This article reviews the major techniques needed for developing BRI systems. In this review article, we first briefly introduce the background and development of mind-controlled robot technologies. Second, we discuss the EEG- based brain signal models with respect to generating principles, evoking mechanisms, and experimental paradigms. Subsequently, we review in detail commonly used methods for decoding brain signals, namely, preprocessing, feature extraction, and feature classification, and summarize several typical application examples. Next, we describe a few BRI applications, including wheelchairs, manipulators, drones, and humanoid robots with respect to synchronous and asynchronous BCI-based techniques. Finally, we address some existing problems and challenges with future BRI techniques.

Some of the related algorithms have been reported to beat state-of-the-art approaches in many applications. The main aim of this paper is to verify one of the deep learning algorithms, specifically a stacked autoencoder, to detect the P300 component. This component, as a specific brain response, is widely used in the systems based on brain-computer interface. A simple brain-computer interface experiment more than 200 school-age participants was performed to obtain large datasets containing the P300 component. After feature extraction the collected data were split into the training and testing sets. State-of-the art BCI classifiers (such as LDA, SVM, or Bayesian LDA) were applied to the data and then compared with the results of stacked autoencoders.

In this study, an attention diversion task with two different levels was administered while participants had to complete a cue-based motor task consisting of foot dorsiflexion. An auditory oddball task with two levels of complexity was implemented to divert the user's attention. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were made from nine single channels. Event-related potentials (ERPs) confirmed that the oddball task of counting a sequence of two tones decreased the auditory P300 amplitude more than the oddball task of counting one target tone among three different tones. Pre-movement features quantified from the movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) were changed significantly between single and dual-task conditions in motor and fronto-central channels. There was a significant delay in movement detection for the case of single tone counting in two motor channels only (237.1-247.4 ms). For the task of sequence counting, motor cortex and frontal channels showed a significant delay in MRCP detection (232.1-250.5 ms). This study investigated the effect of attention diversion in dual-task conditions by analysing both ERPs and MRCPs in single channels. The higher attention diversion lead to a significant reduction in specific MRCP features of the motor task. These results suggest that attention division in dual-tasking situations plays an important role in movement execution and detection. This has important implications in designing real-time brain-computer interface systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We proposed a novel simultaneous hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) by incorporating electrical stimulation into a motor imagery (MI) based BCI system. The goal of this study was to enhance the overall performance of an MI-based BCI. In addition, the brain oscillatory pattern in the hybrid task was also investigated. Approach. 64-channel electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded during MI, selective attention (SA) and hybrid tasks in fourteen healthy subjects. In the hybrid task, subjects performed MI with electrical stimulation which was applied to bilateral median nerve on wrists simultaneously. Main results. The hybrid task clearly presented additional steady-state somatosensory evoked potential (SSSEP) induced by electrical stimulation with MI-induced event-related desynchronization (ERD). By combining ERD and SSSEP features, the performance in the hybrid task was significantly better than in both MI and SA tasks, achieving a similar to 14% improvement in total relative to the MI task alone and reaching similar to 89% in mean classification accuracy. On the contrary, there was no significant enhancement obtained in performance while separate ERD feature was utilized in the hybrid task. In terms of the hybrid task, the performance using combined feature was significantly better than using separate ERD or SSSEP feature. Significance. The results in this work validate the feasibility of our proposed approach to form a novel MI-SSSEP hybrid BCI outperforming a conventional MI-based BCI through combing MI with electrical stimulation.

Due to the difficulties obtaining functional data at this age, the characteristics of the functional architecture at the onset of sensory thalamocortical connectivity in humans remain largely unknown. In particular, it is unknown to what extent responses evoked by an external stimulus are general or already sensitive to certain stimuli. In the present study, we recorded high-density event-related potentials (ERPs) in 19 neonates, tested ten weeks before term (28-32 weeks gestational age (wGA), that is, at an average age of 30 wGA) by means of a syllable discrimination task (i.e., a phonetic change: ba vs. ga; and a voice change: male vs. female voice). We first observed that the syllables elicited 4 peaks with distinct topographies implying a progression of the sensory input along a processing hierarchy; second, repetition induced a decrease in the amplitude (repetition suppression) of these peaks, but their latencies and topographies remained stable; and third, a change of stimulus generated mismatch responses, which were more precisely time-locked to event onset in the case of a phonetic change than in the case of a voice change. A hierarchical and parallel functional architecture is therefore able to process environmental sounds in a timely precise fashion, well before term birth. This elaborate functional architecture at the onset of extrinsic neural activity suggests that specialized areas weakly dependent on the environment are present in the perisylvian region as part of the genetic endowment of the human species.

The present study investigates the evolution of visual expertise for printed stimuli with aging. Fifty-five participants of increasing age (20-30, 40-50,60-70,75-85 years old) were recruited. Behavioral and EEG data were collected during a lexical decision task, in which words and symbol strings were presented. Analyses of EEG data focused mainly on three major points: visual expertise for print, automatization of the expertise and differences in attentional demand between the processing of words and symbols. Results indicated a preservation of visual expertise with age, with larger N170 amplitude for words than for symbols. Moreover, a decrease in stimulus processing speed was observed as a function of age. No difference in attentional demand as a function of stimulus was observed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

To this effect, we used a visuo-spatial working memory task and presented block -wise distractor displays after working memory contents had been updated by means of a retroactive cue (retro-cue). Retroactive attention attenuated the interfering effect of distractors on memory precision. The reduction of working memory load by means of a selective retro-cue was reflected by a decline of a negative slow wave over parietal sites. Posterior N1 to the distractor was reduced following a selective retro-cue compared to a neutral retro-cue condition, most notably at left hemispheric sites. P3b referred to the distractor was suppressed completely only following a selective retro-cue. This suggests that focusing on only a subset of visuo-spatial information represented in working memory releases cognitive resources for preventing the in-depth processing of subsequently irrelevant visual events, thereby inhibiting their transfer into working memory.

Galvanic vestibular stimulation likely influences semicircular canals preferentially. Galvanic stimulation was compared to previously established data under acoustic stimulation. Methods: 14 healthy right-handed subjects, who were also included in the previous acoustic potential study, showed normal acoustic and galvanic vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials. They received 2,000 galvanic binaural bipolar stimuli for each side during EEG recording. Results: Vestibular cortical potentials were found in all 14 subjects and in the pooled data of all subjects ("grand average") bilaterally. Anterior insula and posterior operculum were activated exclusively under galvanic stimulation at 25, 35, 50, and 80 ms; frontal regions at 30 and 45 ms. Potentials at 70 ms in frontal regions and at 110 ms at all of the involved regions could also be recorded; these events were also found using acoustic stimulation in our previous study. Conclusion: Galvanic semicircular canal stimulation evokes specific potentials in addition to those also found with acoustic otolith stimulation in identically located regions of the vestibular cortex. Vestibular cortical regions activate differently by galvanic and acoustic input at the peripheral sensory level.

J	Sburlea, AI; Montesano, L; Minguez, J				Ioana Sburlea, Andreea; Montesano, Luis; Minguez, Javier			Advantages of EEG phase patterns for the detection of gait intention in healthy and stroke subjects	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; BCI; gait intention; MRCP; intersession transfer; intersubject transfer; instantaneous phase	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; CORTICAL POTENTIALS; MOVEMENT; OSCILLATIONS; AMPLITUDE; (DE)SYNCHRONIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; COMBINATION; FRAMEWORK; DYNAMICS	Objective. One use of EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in rehabilitation is the detection of movement intention. In this paper we investigate for the first time the instantaneous phase of movement related cortical potential (MRCP) and its application to the detection of gait intention. Approach. We demonstrate the utility of MRCP phase in two independent datasets, in which 10 healthy subjects and 9 chronic stroke patients executed a self-initiated gait task in three sessions. Phase features were compared to more conventional amplitude and power features. Main results. The neurophysiology analysis showed that phase features have higher signal-to-noise ratio than the other features. Also, BCI detectors of gait intention based on phase, amplitude, and their combination were evaluated under three conditions: session-specific calibration, intersession transfer, and intersubject transfer. Results show that the phase based detector is the most accurate for session-specific calibration (movement intention was correctly detected in 66.5% of trials in healthy subjects, and in 63.3% in stroke patients). However, in intersession and intersubject transfer, the detector that combines amplitude and phase features is the most accurate one and the only that retains its accuracy (62.5% in healthy subjects and 59% in stroke patients) w.r.t. session-specific calibration. Significance. MRCP phase features improve the detection of gait intention and could be used in practice to remove time-consuming BCI recalibration.

However, the signal-to-noise (SNR) of PEPs is low. Here, using time-frequency analysis, we characterize the phase-locked and non-phase-locked EEG responses to pinprick stimulation, before and after secondary hyperalgesia. Methods: Secondary hyperalgesia was induced using high-frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) of the left/right forearm skin in 16 volunteers. EEG responses to 64 and 96 mN pinprick stimuli were elicited from both arms, before and 20 min after HFS. Results: Pinprick stimulation applied to normal skin elicited a phase-locked low-frequency (<5 Hz) response followed by a reduction of alpha-band oscillations (7-10 Hz). The low-frequency response was significantly increased when pinprick stimuli were delivered to the area of secondary hyperalgesia. There was no change in the reduction of alpha-band oscillations. Whereas the low-frequency response was enhanced for both 64 and 96 mN intensities, PEPs analyzed in the time domain were only significantly enhanced for the 64 mN intensity. Conclusions: Time-frequency analysis may be more sensitive than conventional time-domain analysis in revealing EEG changes associated to secondary hyperalgesia. Significance: Time-frequency analysis of PEPs can be used to investigate central sensitization in humans. (C) 2017 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Pursuing this question, the aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of mindfulness training on executive control and emotion regulation in older adults, by means of studying behavioral and electrophysiological changes. Participants, 55 to 75 years of age, were randomly allocated to an 8-week mindful breath awareness training group or an active control group engaging in brain training exercises. Before and after the training period, participants completed an emotional-counting Stroop task, designed to measure attentional control and emotion regulation processes. Concurrently, their brain activity was measured by means of 64-channel electroencephalography. The results show that engaging in just over 10 min of mindfulness practice five times per week resulted in significant improvements in behavioral (response latency) and electrophysiological (N2-event-related potential) measures related to general task performance. Analyses of the underlying cortical sources (Variable Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography, VARETA) indicate that this N2-related effect is primarily associated with changes in the right angular gyrus and other areas of the dorsal attention network. However, the study did not find the expected specific improvements in executive control and emotion regulation, which may be due to the training instructions or the relative brevity of the intervention. Overall, the results indicate that engaging in mindfulness meditation training improves the maintenance of goal-directed visuospatial attention and may be a useful strategy for counteracting cognitive decline associated with aging.

Here, we studied event-related potentials recorded from electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) together with surface-EEG. Participants completed a lexical decision task (LDT), which required the differentiation of acoustically presented words from pseudo-words by button press. Target stimuli were preceded by prime-words. In recordings from VIM, a slow potential shift apparent at the lower electrode contacts persisted during target stimulus presentation (equally for words and pseudo-words). In contrast, recordings from STN electrodes showed a short local activation on prime-words but not target-stimuli. In both depth-recording regions, further components related to contralateral motor responses to target words were evident. On scalp level, mid-central activations on (pseudo)lexical stimuli were obtained, in line with the expression of N400 potentials. The prolonged activity recorded from VIM, exclusively accompanying the relevant LDT phase, is in line with the idea of thalamic selective engagement for supporting the realization of the behavioral focus demanded by the task. In contrast, the phasic prime related activity rather indicates procedural STN functions, for example, for trial sequencing or readiness inhibition of prepared target reactions.

Detection of Gait Initiation Failure in Parkinson's disease based on Wavelet Transform and Support Vector Machine	2017 39TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	PROCEEDINGS OF ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY		English	Proceedings Paper	39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 11-15, 2017	SOUTH KOREA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, PubMed, MEDLINE, Korean Soc Med & Biol Engn			COMPONENT ANALYSIS	Gait initiation Failure (GIF) is the situation in which patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) feel as if their feet get "stuck" to the floor when initiating their first steps. GIF is a subtype of Freezing of Gait (FOG) and often leads to falls and related injuries. Understanding of neurobiological mechanisms underlying GIF has been limited by difficulties in eliciting and objectively characterizing such gait phenomena in the clinical setting. Studies investigating the effects of GIF on brain activity using EEG offer the potential to study such behavior. In this preliminary study, we present a novel methodology where wavelet transform was used for feature extraction and Support Vector Machine for classifying GIF events in five patients with PD and FOG. To deal with the large amount of EEG data, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the data dimension from 15 EEG channels into 6 principal components (PCs), retaining 93% of the information. Independent Component Analysis using Entropy Bound Minimization (ICA-EBM) was applied to 6 PCs for source separation with the aim of improving detection ability of GIF events as compared to the normal initiation of gait (Good Starts). The results of this analysis demonstrated the correct identification of GIF episodes with an 83.1% sensitivity, 89.5% specificity and 86.3% accuracy. These results suggest that our proposed methodology is a promising non-invasive approach to improve GIF detection in PD and FOG.	[Ly, Quynh Tran; Handojoseno, A. M.

Aims and methods The current study compared the effects of an acute bout of physical exercise with a bout of interactive mental and physical exercise (i.e., "exergaming") on executive (Stroop) task performance and event-related potential (ERP) amplitudes in younger and older adults. Results Results revealed enhanced executive task performance in younger and older adults after exercise, with no differences in performance between exercise conditions. Stroop (RT) performance in older adults improved more than in younger adults from pre- to post-exercise. A significant increase in EEG amplitude from pre- to post-exercise was found at the Cz site from 320 to 700 ms post-stimulus for both younger and older adults, with older adults demonstrating a larger Stroop interference effect. While younger adults exhibited overall greater EEG amplitudes than older adults, they showed no differences between congruent and incongruent trials (i.e., minimal interference). Compared to peers with higher BMI (body mass index), older adults with lower BMI showed a greater reduction in Stroop interference effects from pre- to post-exercise. Discussion and conclusions The beneficial effects of an acute bout of physical exercise on cognitive and neural functioning in younger and older adults were confirmed, with no difference between standard exercise and exergaming. Findings suggest that BMI, sometimes used as a proxy for fitness level, may modulate benefits that older adults derive from an acute bout of exercise. Findings have implications for future research that seeks to investigate unique effects of exergaming when compared to standard physical exercise.

Cortical maturation has been suggested as crucial for the developing ability to shift attention. This study investigated the development of neural mechanisms by combining EEG with simultaneous eye tracking during FSP testing, in typically developing infants aged between 1 and 8 months. The most prominent neural response was a frontal positivity which occurred only in the hemisphere contralateral to the target in the youngest infants but became more ipsilateral with age. This changing lateralisation was associated with improving ability to shift attention (decreasing saccade latencies and fewer 'sticky fixations'-failures to disengage attention from the central target). These findings suggest that the lateralisation of neural responses develops during infancy, possibly due to developing intracortical connections, allowing infants to shift attention more efficiently.

Although previous studies have demonstrated visual [I, 2] and somatosensory interactions [3, 4] with auditory processing, it is not clear whether somatosensory information can contribute to the processing of audio-visual speech perception. This study explored the neural consequence of somatosensory interactions in audio-visual speech processing. We assessed whether somatosensory orofacial stimulation influenced event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to an audio-visual speech illusion (the McGurk Effect [1]). 64 scalp sites of ERPs were recorded in response to audio-visual speech stimulation and somatosensory stimulation. In the audio-visual condition, an auditory stimulus /ba/ was synchronized with the video of congruent facial motion (the production of /ba/) or incongruent facial motion (the production of the /da/: McGurk condition). These two audio-visual stimulations were randomly presented with and without somatosensory stimulation associated with facial skin deformation. We found ERPs differences associated with the McGurk effect in the presence of the somatosensory conditions. ERPs for the McGurk effect reliably diverge around 280 ms after auditory onset. The results demonstrate a change of cortical potential of audio-visual processing due to somatosensory inputs and suggest that somatosensory information encoding facial motion also influences speech processing.

They typically focus on one or two cognitive markers, such as the mismatch negativity or the P3 to global auditory regularity. However it has become clear that none of these markers in isolation is at the same time sufficiently specific and sufficiently sensitive to be taken as the unique gold standard for diagnosing consciousness. A good way forward would be to combine several cognitive markers within the same test to improve evaluation. Furthermore, given the diversity of lesions leading to disorders of consciousness, it is important not only to probe whether a patient is conscious or not, but also to establish a more general and nuanced profile of the residual cognitive capacities of each patient using a combination of markers. In the present study we built a unique EEG protocol that probed 8 dimensions of cognitive processing in a single 1.5 h session. This protocol probed variants of classical markers together with new markers of spatial attention, which has not yet been studied in these patients. The eight dimensions were: (1) own name recognition, (2) temporal attention, (3) spatial attention, (4) detection of spatial incongruence (5) motor planning, and (6,7,8) modulations of these effects by the global context, reflecting higher-level functions. This protocol was tested in 15 healthy control subjects and in 17 patients with various etiologies, among which 13 could be included in the analysis. The results in the control group allowed a validation and a specific description of the cognitive levels probed by each marker. At the single-subject level, this combined protocol allowed assessing the presence of both classical and newly introduced markers for each patient and control, and revealed that the combination of several markers increased diagnostic sensitivity. The presence of a high-level effect in any of the three tested domains distinguished between minimally conscious and vegetative patients, while the presence of low-level effects was similar in both groups. In summary, this study constitutes a validated proof of concept in favor of probing multiple cognitive dimensions to improve the evaluation of non-communicating patients. At a more conceptual level, this EEG tool can help achieve a better understanding of disorders of consciousness by exploring consciousness in its multiple cognitive facets. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Convolutional neural networks for event-related potential detection: impact of the architecture	2017 39TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	PROCEEDINGS OF ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY		English	Proceedings Paper	39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 11-15, 2017	SOUTH KOREA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, PubMed, MEDLINE, Korean Soc Med & Biol Engn			CLASSIFICATION	The detection of brain responses at the single-trial level in the electroencephalogram (EEG) such as event-related potentials (ERPs) is a difficult problem that requires different processing steps to extract relevant discriminant features. While most of the signal and classification techniques for the detection of brain responses are based on linear algebra, different pattern recognition techniques such as convolutional neural network (CNN), as a type of deep learning technique, have shown some interests as they are able to process the signal after limited pre-processing. In this study, we propose to investigate the performance of CNNs in relation of their architecture and in relation to how they are evaluated: a single system for each subject, or a system for all the subjects. More particularly, we want to address the change of performance that can be observed between specifying a neural network to a subject, or by considering a neural network for a group of subjects, taking advantage of a larger number of trials from different subjects. The results support the conclusion that a convolutional neural network trained on different subjects can lead to an AUC above 0.9 by using an appropriate architecture using spatial filtering and shift invariant layers.

However, it is not clear yet how group membership influences brain activity when a recipient evaluates the fairness of asset distribution. In this study, subjects participated as recipients in an Ultimatum Game with alleged members of both an experimentally induced ingroup and outgroup. They either received extremely unequal, moderately unequal, or equal offers from proposers while electroencephalogram was recorded. Behavioral results showed that the acceptance rates for unequal offers were higher when interacting with ingroup partners than with outgroup partners. Analyses of event related potentials revealed that proposers' group membership modulated offer evaluation at earlier processing stages. Feedback-related negativity was more negative for extremely and moderately unequal offers compared to equal offers in the ingroup interaction whereas it did not show differential responses to different offers in the outgroup interaction. Analyses of event related oscillations revealed that the theta power (4-6 Hz) was larger for moderately unequal offers than equal offers in the ingroup interaction whereas it did not show differential responses to different offers in the outgroup interaction. Thus, early mechanisms of fairness evaluation are strongly modulated by the ingroup/ outgroup membership of the interaction partner.

Ketamine comprehensively produces schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as positive, cognitive and negative symptoms in healthy volunteers. The amplitude of the mismatch negativity (MMN) is known to be significantly reduced not only in patients with schizophrenia, but also in healthy controls receiving ketamine. Accordingly, it was the aim of the present study to investigate whether changes of MMN amplitudes during ketamine administration are associated with the emergence of schizophrenia-like negative symptoms in healthy volunteers. Methods We examined the impact of ketamine during an MMN paradigm with 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) and assessed the psychopathological status using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) in healthy male volunteers using a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover design. Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography was used for source localization. Results Twenty-four men were included in our analysis. Significant reductions of MMN amplitudes and an increase in all PANSS scores were identified under the ketamine condition. Smaller MMN amplitudes were specifically associated with more pronounced negative symptoms. Source analysis of MMN generators indicated a significantly reduced current source density (CSD) under the ketamine condition in the primary auditory cortex, the posterior cingulate and the middle frontal gyrus. Limitations The sample included only men within a tight age range of 20-32 years. Conclusion The MMN might represent a biomarker for negative symptoms in schizophrenia related to an insufficient NMDAR system and could be used to identify patients with schizophrenia with negative symptoms due to NMDAR dysfunction.

We investigated attention related modalities of P300 ERP component and engagement index (EI), which is extracted from signal power ratios of alpha, beta and frequency bands. Simultaneously, we quantified the task unrelated movements, which are previously reported to be related to attention level, in an automated way employing kinect TM sensor. Reaction times were also recorded and investigated. We found that during the monotonous task, both the P300 amplitude and EI decreased as the time of the task progressed. On the other hand, the increase of the task unrelated movement quantity was observed, together with the increase in RTs. These findings lead to conclusion that the monotonous assembly work induces the decrease of attention and engagement of the workers as the task progresses, which is observable in both neural (EEG) and behavioral (RT and unrelated movements) signal modalities. Apart from observing how the attention-related modalities are changing over time, we investigated the functional relationship between the neural and behavioral modalities by using Pearson's correlation. Since the Person's correlation coefficients showed the functional relationship between the attention-related modalities, we proposed the creation of the multimodal implicit Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) system, which could acquire and process neural and behavioral data in real-time, with the aim of creating the system that could be aware of the operator's mental states during the industrial work, consequently improving the operator's well-being.

Hierarchies of Attention and Experimental Designs: Effects of Spatial and Intermodal Attention Revisited	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TOP-DOWN INFLUENCES; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; CONTROL MECHANISMS; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; VISUAL-STIMULI; ERP EVIDENCE; MODULATIONS; RECORDINGS	When attention is directed to stimuli in a given modality and location, information processing in other irrelevant modalities at this location is affected too. This spread of attention to irrelevant stimuli is often interpreted as superiority of location selection over modality selection. However, this conclusion is based on experimental paradigms in which spatial attention was transient whereas intermodal attention was sustained. Furthermore, whether modality selection affects processing in the task-relevant modality at irrelevant locations remains an open question. Here, we addressed effects of simultaneous spatial and intermodal attention in an EEG study using a balanced design where spatial attention was transient and intermodal attention sustained or vice versa. Effects of spatial attention were not affected by which modality was attended and effects of intermodal attention were not affected by whether the stimuli were at the attended location or not. This suggests not only spread of spatial attention to task-irrelevant modalities but also spread of intermodal attention to task-irrelevant locations. Whether spatial attention was transient or sustained did not alter the effect of spatial attention on visual N1 and Nd1 responses. Prestimulus preparatory occipital alpha band responses were affected by both transient and sustained spatial cueing, whereas late post-stimulus responses were more strongly affected by sustained than by transient spatial attention. Sustained but not transient intermodal attention affected late responses (>200 msec) to visual stimuli. Together, the results undermine the universal superiority of spatial attention and suggest that the mode of attention manipulation is an important factor determining attention effects.

J	List, A; Rosenberg, MD; Sherman, A; Esterman, M				List, Alexandra; Rosenberg, Monica D.; Sherman, Aleksandra; Esterman, Michael			Pattern classification of EEG signals reveals perceptual and attentional states	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; DECISION-MAKING; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; NEURAL MECHANISMS; WORKING-MEMORY; MODULATION; STIMULI; HUMANS; FMRI	Pattern classification techniques have been widely used to differentiate neural activity associated with different perceptual, attentional, or other cognitive states, often using fMRI, but more recently with EEG as well. Although these methods have identified EEG patterns (i.e., scalp topographies of EEG signals occurring at certain latencies) that decode perceptual and attentional states on a trial-by-trial basis, they have yet to be applied to the spatial scope of attention toward global or local features of the display. Here, we initially used pattern classification to replicate and extend the findings that perceptual states could be reliably decoded from EEG. We found that visual perceptual states, including stimulus location and object category, could be decoded with high accuracy peaking between 125-250 ms, and that the discriminative spatiotemporal patterns mirrored and extended our (and other well-established) ERP results. Next, we used pattern classification to investigate whether spatiotemporal EEG signals could reliably predict attentional states, and particularly, the scope of attention. The EEG data were reliably differentiated for local versus global attention on a trial- by- trial basis, emerging as a specific spatiotemporal activation pattern over posterior electrode sites during the 250-750 ms interval after stimulus onset. In sum, we demonstrate that multivariate pattern analysis of EEG, which reveals unique spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity distinguishing between behavioral states, is a sensitive tool for characterizing the neural correlates of perception and attention.

Our objective is to propose SP indicators of healthy brains (control groups) based on the default mode and their modifications by habituation and visual-motor association (VM-asso), to support diagnostic and rehabilitation processes. However, important differences seem to exist between men and women. Therefore, we aim to analyze EEG characteristics in a female sample. Subjects and Methods: In the current study, EEG was recorded at rest with closed eyes before and during repeated photostimulations (RPh) and before (pre) and during association of RPh with switch pressing (VM-asso) in 70 female adults. EEG was analyzed using UAM/INR software, which removes artifacts, identifies corresponding signals, selects 20 samples (2-s) from each condition, applies Welch's periodogrann to calculate and average the absolute power (AP; AAPs) of 3, theta, alpha, and beta, before and during learning, and emits data to a spreadsheet. Differences in each condition were evaluated using non-parametric tests. Results: The AAPs were different; in habituation, 3 and theta increased significantly in fronto-frontal (FF) and frontocentral and decreased in the other leads. During association, they increased in FE and decreased in the other three regions. alpha AAP decreased in all leads except in FE during habituation, and the decrement was lower in the association. beta AAP increased in all leads during both learning conditions. Conclusion: The SP and the topographic distribution are descriptive parameters of habituation and VM-asso; we propose them as EEG indicators.

Haptic feedback which has the potential on improving the feasibility and operability of VR-based BCI systems is rarely explored in previous studies. In this article, we present a novel framework of BCI system based on both visual and haptic feedback, in which users can learn to manipulate the haptic device's stylus for motor training. The effects of motor training with and without haptic feedback are evaluated by detecting and analysing the changes of electroencephalogram (EEG). The preliminary experimental results indicate that haptic feedback may influence the modulation of the beta rhythms over left and right sensorimotor cortex during hand movements. This study can be easily replicated to evaluate the existing systems with haptic feedback and used to develop new applications for motor training.

These conditions may be associated with early changes in brain connectivity. Vibrotactile stimulation is a sensory substitution method that allows perception and discrimination of sound, and even speech. To clarify the efficacy of this approach, a vibrotactile oddball task with 700 and 900 Hz pure-tones as stimuli [counterbalanced as target (T: 20% of the total) and non-target (NT: 80%)] with simultaneous EEG recording was performed by 14 profoundly deaf and 14 normal-hearing (NH) subjects, before and after a short training period (five 1-h sessions; in 2.53 weeks). A small device worn on the right index finger delivered sound-wave stimuli. The training included discrimination of pure tone frequency and duration, and more complex natural sounds. A significant P300 amplitude increase and behavioral improvement was observed in both deaf and normal subjects, with no between group differences. However, a P3 with larger scalp distribution over parietal cortical areas and lateralized to the right was observed in the profoundly deaf. A graph theory analysis showed that brief training significantly increased fronto-central brain connectivity in deaf subjects, but not in NH subjects. Together, ERP tools and graph methods depicted the different functional brain dynamic in deaf and NH individuals, underlying the temporary engagement of the cognitive resources demanded by the task. Our findings showed that the index-fingertip somatosensory mechanoreceptors can discriminate sounds. Further studies are necessary to clarify brain connectivity dynamics associated with the performance of vibrotactile language-related discrimination tasks and the effect of lengthier training programs.

Electrophysiological evidence suggests that when an auditory event is predicted, processing is sped up, i.e., the N1 component of the ERP occurs earlier (N1 facilitation). However, it is not clear (1) whether N1 facilitation is based specifically on predictive rather than multisensory integration and (2) which particular properties of the visual cue it is based on. The current experiment used artificial AV stimuli in which visual cues predicted but did not co-occur with auditory cues. Visual form cues (high and low salience) and the auditory-visual pairing were manipulated so that auditory predictions could be based on form and timing or on timing only. The results showed that N1 facilitation occurred only for combined form and temporal predictions. These results suggest that faster auditory processing (as indicated by N1 facilitation) is based on predictive processing generated by a visual cue that clearly predicts both what and when the auditory stimulus will occur.

Utilizing the principle of eliciting P300, we can implement BCIs to input characters, which enable people to express their intentions directly by brain. In recent years, P300-based English speller (P300ES) has been widely studied while P300-based Chinese speller (P300CS) has been far less fully investigated, owing to the complexity of sinograms. This paper aims at making a systematic summary of the current P300CS systems, and showing that P300CS would be a promising research field deserving of further researches in the furture.

Modulation of error monitoring in obsessive-compulsive disorder by individually tailored symptom provocation	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						electroencephalography; emotion regulation; error-related negativity; event-related potential; obsessive-compulsive disorder; symptom provocation	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; BRAIN ACTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; ANXIETY; RESPONSES; ERN; MODEL; HYPERACTIVATION; NEGATIVITY; INVENTORY	Background. The enhanced error monitoring in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), typically measured with the error-related negativity (ERN), has been found to be temporally stable and independent of symptom expression. Here, we examined whether the error monitoring in patients with OCD could be experimentally modulated by individually tailored symptom provocation. Method. Twenty patients with OCD and 20 healthy controls performed a flanker task in which OCD-relevant or neutral pictures were presented prior to a flanker stimulus. An individualized stimulus set consisting of the most provoking images in terms of OCD symptoms was selected for each patient with OCD. Response-locked event-related potentials were recorded and used to examine the error-related brain activity. Results. Patients with OCD showed larger ERN amplitudes than did control subjects in both the OCD-symptom provocation and neutral conditions. Additionally, while patients with OCD exhibited a significant increase in the ERN under the OCD-symptom provocation condition when compared with the neutral condition, control subjects showed no variation in the ERN between the conditions. Conclusions. Our results strengthen earlier findings of hyperactive error monitoring in OCD, as indexed by higher ERN amplitudes in patients with OCD than in controls. Importantly, we showed that the patients' overactive error-signals were experimentally enhanced by individually tailored OCD-symptom triggers, thus suggesting convincing evidence between OCD-symptoms and ERN. Such findings imply that therapeutic interventions should target affective regulation in order to alleviate the perceived threatening value of OCD triggers.

Alpha-frequency (8-12 Hz) signal power from PDR in the visual cortex or from mu rhythm in the motor cortex was used to create a power scale which was then converted into a musical scale, which could be manipulated by the individual in real time. Subjects could then generate different notes of the scale by activation (event-related synchronization) or de-activation (event-related desynchronization) of the PDR or mu rhythms in visual or motor cortex, respectively. Fifteen novice normal subjects were tested in their ability to hit target notes presented within a 5-min trial period. All 15 subjects were able to perform more accurately (average of 27.4 hits, 67.1% accuracy for visual cortex/PDR signaling; average of 20.6 hits, 57.1% accuracy for mu signaling) than a random note generation (19.03% accuracy). Moreover, PDR control was significantly more accurate than mu control. This shows that novice healthy individuals can control music with better accuracy than random, with no prior training on the device, and that PDR control is more accurate than mu control for these novices. Individuals with more years of musical training showed a moderate positive correlation with more PDR accuracy, but not mu accuracy. The Encephalophone may have potential applications both as a novel musical instrument without requiring movement, as well as a potential therapeutic biofeedback device for patients suffering from motor deficits (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brainstem stroke, traumatic amputation).

Recent studies have shown that feature combination of each specifically tailored for different physiological phenomena such as Readiness Potential (RP) and Event Related Desynchronization (ERD) might benefit BCI making it robust against artifacts. Hence, the objective is to design a CSSBP with combined feature vectors, where the signal is divided into several sub bands using a band pass filter, and this channel and frequency configurations are then modeled as preconditions before learning base learners and introducing a new heuristic of stochastic gradient boost for training the base learners under these preconditions. Results showed that Boosting approach using feature combination clearly outperformed the state-of-the-art algorithms, and improved the classification performance, resulting in increased robustness.

Foreign-accented speaker identity affects neural correlates of language comprehension	JOURNAL OF NEUROLINGUISTICS			English	Article						Comprehension; Bilingualism; ERPs; Accent	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; REFERENTIAL AMBIGUITY; PRONOUN RESOLUTION; POTENTIALS; RESPONSES; IMPLICIT; SPEECH; MEMORY; TIME; ERP	This study tested semantic and grammatical processing of native-and foreign-accented speech. Monolinguals with little experience with foreign-accented speech listened to sentences spoken by foreign-accented and native-accented speakers while their brain activity was recorded using EEG/ERPs. We gathered behavioral measures of sentence comprehension, language attitudes, and accent perception. Behavioral results showed that listeners were highly accurate in comprehending both native-and foreign-accented sentences. ERP results showed that grammatical and semantic violations elicited different neural responses in native versus foreign accented speech. Native-accented speech elicited a frontal negativity (Nref) for grammatical violations and a robust N400 for semantic violations. However, in foreign-accented speech only semantic (not grammatical) violations elicited an ERP effect, a late negativity. Closer inspection of listeners who did and who did not correctly identify the foreign accent revealed that listeners who identified the foreign accent showed ERP responses for both grammatical and semantic errors: an N400-like effect to grammatical errors and a late negativity to semantic errors. In contrast, listeners who did not correctly identify the foreign accent showed no ERP responses to grammatical errors in the foreign-accented condition, but did show a late negativity to semantic errors. These findings provide novel insights into understanding the effects of listener experience and foreign-accented speaker identity on the neural correlates of language processing.

As a first step toward developing such a method, we aimed to reconstruct the imagery of rhythm, which is one element of music. It has been reported that a periodic electroencephalogram (EEG) response is elicited while a human imagines a binary or ternary meter on a musical beat. However, it is not clear whether or not brain activity synchronizes with fully imagined beat and meter without auditory stimuli. To investigate neural entrainment to imagined rhythm during auditory imagery of beat and meter, we recorded EEG while nine participants (eight males and one female) imagined three types of rhythm without auditory stimuli but with visual timing, and then we analyzed the amplitude spectra of the EEG. We also recorded EEG while the participants only gazed at the visual timing as a control condition to confirm the visual effect. Furthermore, we derived features of the EEG using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and conducted an experiment to individually classify the three types of imagined rhythm from the EEG. The results showed that classification accuracies exceeded the chance level in all participants. These results suggest that auditory imagery of meter elicits a periodic EEG response that changes at the imagined beat and meter frequency even in the fully imagined conditions. This study represents the first step toward the realization of a method for reconstructing the imagined music from brain activity.

Both neutral images and negative images displaying war photos were shown to active duty military personnel undergoing predeployment training. Expectations regarding the affective content of upcoming images were manipulated by means of abstract visual cues that were valid only 75% of the time. Besides providing greater ecological validity, inclusion of invalid cues enabled us to examine separately, effects of the expected and actual valence of the images. Neurocognitive responses within the first second after image presentation were examined using the late positive potential (LPP), a noninvasive measure of brain electrical activity known to index affective processes. Negative images evoked an enhanced LPP relative to neutral images over central-parietal and right anterior electrode sites. Both the central-parietal and anterior LPP were found, likewise, to be modulated by expected valence. Expectation of negative versus neutral images led to an enhanced central-parietal LPP and an attenuated anterior LPP over both hemispheres independent of image valence. These findings are interpreted in terms of the allocation of attention to motivationally salient events, affective interpretation of those events, and induced affective/motivational states. By helping to characterize affective responses to acute stress and the regulation of those responses by psychological context, our study contributes to a basic understanding of how such regulation may become disordered and may aid in the development of targets for therapeutic interventions.

How is this information represented in the L2 mental lexicon? And what are the neural signatures of L2 morphosyntactic and lexical-semantic processing? We addressed these questions in one behavioral and two ERP priming experiments on inflected German adjectives testing a group of advanced late Russian learners of German in comparison to native speaker (L1) controls. While in the behavioral experiment, the L2 learners performed native-like, the ERP data revealed clear L1/L2 differences with respect to the temporal dynamics of grammatical processing. Specifically, our results show that L2 morphosyntactic processing yielded temporally and spatially extended brain responses relative to L1 processing, indicating that grammatical processing of inflected words in an L2 is more demanding and less automatic than in the L1. However, this group of advanced L2 learners showed native-like lexical-semantic processing.

From the brain connectome perspective, this study investigated dual task deficits of older adults that lead to task failure of a suprapostural motor task with increasing postural destabilization. Twelve younger (mean age: 25.3 years) and 12 older (mean age: 65.8 years) adults executed a designated force-matching task from a level-surface or a stabilometer board. Force-matching error, stance sway, and event-related potential (ERP) in the preparatory period were measured. The force-matching accuracy and the size of postural sway of the older adults tended to be more vulnerable to stance configuration than that of the young adults, although both groups consistently showed greater attentional investment on the postural task as sway regularity increased in the stabilometer condition. In terms of the synchronization likelihood (SL) of the ERP, both younger and older adults had net increases in the strengths of the functional connectivity in the whole brain and in the fronto-sensorimotor network in the stabilometer condition. Also, the SL in the fronto-sensorimotor network of the older adults was greater than that of the young adults for both stance conditions. However, unlike the young adults, the older adults did not exhibit concurrent deactivation of the functional connectivity of the left temporal-parietal-occipital network for postural-suprapostural task with increasing postural load. In addition, the older adults potentiated functional connectivity of the right prefrontal area to cope with concurrent force-matching with increasing postural load. In conclusion, despite a universal negative effect on brain volume conduction, our preliminary results showed that the older adults were still capable of increasing allocation of neural sources, particularly via compensatory recruitment of the right prefrontal loop, for concurrent force-matching under the challenging postural condition. Nevertheless, dual-task performance of the older adults tended to be more vulnerable to postural load than that of the younger adults, in relation to inferior neural economy or a slow adaptation process to stance destabilization for scant dissociation of control hubs in the temporal-parietal-occipital cortex.

These conditions are compared to a similar image in 2D both on the channel level by studying the ERP components and on the source level by the localization of the corresponding ERP component. Our findings posit that P1 component in the occipital cortex has significantly increased in amplitude for 3D condition without vertical disparity compared to the 2D condition. According to previous studies, this component increases when depth information are added to the stimulus which is in line with our findings. However the amplitude of this component has significantly decreased for 3D condition with maximum vertical disparity compared to the 3D condition without vertical disparity. We have concluded that the perception of stereoscopic depth by subjects have decreased in this case due to the distortion introduced by vertical disparity. The underlying sources corresponding to P1 component are localized. Except for the power differences, the source locations do not differ for different conditions.

While the nature of the creative process is under debate, many believe that creativity relies on real-time combinations of known neural and cognitive processes. One useful model of creativity comes from musical improvisation, such as in jazz, in which musicians spontaneously create novel sound sequences. Here we use jazz musicians to test the hypothesis that individuals with training in musical improvisation, which entails creative generation of musical ideas, might process expectancy differently. We compare jazz improvisers, non-improvising musicians, and non-musicians in the domain-general task of divergent thinking, as well as the musical task of preference ratings for chord progressions that vary in expectation while EEGs were recorded. Behavioral results showed for the first time that jazz musicians preferred unexpected chord progressions. ERP results showed that unexpected stimuli elicited larger early and mid-latency ERP responses (ERAN and P3b), followed by smaller long-latency responses (Late Positivity Potential) in jazz musicians. The amplitudes of these ERP components were significantly correlated with behavioral measures of fluency and originality on the divergent thinking task. Together, results highlight the role of expectancy in creativity.

Decreased interhemispheric time transfer of visual information in adults with Autistic spectrum disorder using the Poffenberger paradigm	RESEARCH IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS			English	Article						Autistic spectrum disorders; Corpus callosum; Interhemispheric time transfer; Event-related potentials; Poffenberger; Electroencephalography	HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; CORPUS-CALLOSUM SIZE; BRAIN CONNECTIVITY; CHILDREN; ABNORMALITIES; COMMUNICATION; TRANSMISSION; ASYMMETRY; INSIGHTS; CORTEX	Background: The Poffenberger task is a useful paradigm that measures the interhemispheric transfer time (IHTT) across the corpus callosum. Past research has demonstrated that the right to left transfer is faster in typically developing individuals compared to a left to right transfer. Numerous studies have found that the corpus callosum is structurally smaller and atypical in individuals with Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) but whether this is associated with changes in interhemispheric time transfer in adult individuals with ASD is relatively unknown. Method: The current study used a Poffenberger paradigm in combination with electro-encephalography (EEG) to measure IHTT between individuals with ASD and typically developing controls. The IHTT in each direction was estimated by comparing the latencies of P100 and N170 components in hemispheres contralateral and ipsilateral to lateralised visual stimulation. Results: Both groups demonstrated faster right to left transfer of information compared to the left to right transmission. Individuals with ASD exhibited faster IHTT latencies overall for the P100 and N170 components compared to matched typically developing controls. More importantly, these results demonstrate that the ASD group exhibited faster transfer in both directions compared to matched typically developing controls. Conclusion: These findings suggest hyper-connectivity of local networks in parietal and occipital regions of the corpus callosum in ASD and may have implications in how information is integrated between hemispheres in ASD.

In this work, we investigated the response to different emotional stimuli and the effect of age on the neuronal activation. Two negative emotion conditions, i.e., 'anger' and 'fear' faces were presented to 22 adult female participants (11 young and 11 elderly) while acquiring high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) data of 256 channels. Brain source localization was utilized to study the modulations in the early N170 event-related-potential component. The results revealed alterations in the amplitude of N170 and the localization of areas with maximum neural activation. Furthermore, age-induced differences are shown in the topographic maps and the neural activation for both emotional stimuli. Overall, aging appeared to affect the limbic area and its implication to emotional processing. These findings can serve as a step toward the understanding of the way the brain functions and evolves with age which is a significant element in the design of assistive environments. (C) 2016 IBRO.

At the early stages of the disease scientists have observed psychological changes and differences in patients' alpha, beta and theta powers. The early diagnosis of Huntington's disease is very important in order to administrate the correct medication to the patients and slow down the progress of the disease. This paper aims to suggest a protocol in which experiments could be based on, in an attempt to make an early diagnosis of the disease by taking into consideration the patients' electroencephalographic recordings during the early stages of the disease, as well as the methods of processing and classifying those EEG signals.

For this issue, the motor theory of speech perception provided another explanation, suggesting that the perception of speech sounds produced by a specific articulator movement may recruit the motor representation of that articulator in the precentral gyrus. To examine the latter theory, we used a set of Chinese synonyms with different articulatory features, involving lip gestures (LipR) or not (LipN), and recorded the electroencephalographic (EEG) signals while subjects passively listened to them. It was found that at about 200 ins post-onset, the event-related potential of LipR and LipN showed a significant polarity reversal near the precentral lip motor areas. EEG source reconstruction results also showed more obvious somatotopic activation in the lip region for the LipR than the LipN. Our results provide a positive support for the effect of articulatory simulation on speech comprehension and basically agree with the motor theory of speech perception.

Neural evidence that inhibition is linked to the affective devaluation of distractors that match the contents of working memory	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Distractor devaluation; Evaluative codes; Devaluation-by-inhibition; Attentional inhibition; Affective evaluation; Working memory; EEG/ERP; Pd component	EMOTIONAL DEVALUATION; AFFECTIVE CONSEQUENCES; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; VISUAL-SEARCH; ATTENTIONAL INHIBITION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; STIMULI; FACES; SUPPRESSION; AVOIDANCE	Stimuli appearing as visual distractors subsequently receive more negative affective evaluations than novel items or prior targets of attention. Leading accounts question whether this distractor devaluation effect occurs through evaluative codes that become associated with distractors as a mere artefact of attention-task instructions, or through affective consequences of attentional inhibition when applied to prevent distractor interference. Here we test opposing predictions arising from the evaluative-coding and devaluation-by-inhibition hypotheses using an electrophysiological marker of attentional inhibition in a task that requires participants to avoid interference from abstract-shape distractors presented while maintaining a uniquely-colored stimulus in memory. Consistent with prior research, distractors that matched the colour of the stimulus being held in memory elicited a Pd component of the event-related potential waveform, indicating that their processing was being actively suppressed. Subsequent affective evaluations revealed that memory-matching distractors also received more negative ratings than non-matching distractors or previously-unseen shapes. Moreover, Pd magnitude was greater on trials in which the memory-matching distractors were later rated negatively than on trials preceding positive ratings. These results support the devaluation-by-inhibition hypothesis and strongly suggest that fluctuations in stimulus inhibition are closely associated with subsequent affective evaluations. In contrast, none of the evaluative-coding based predictions were confirmed.

Estimating direction in brain-behavior interactions: Proactive and reactive brain states in driving	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; Driving; Neuro-behavioral analysis; Source analysis	DEFAULT MODE; ALPHA-BAND; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; CORTEX; DELTA; FMRI; REORGANIZATION; PERFORMANCE; SYNCHRONY	Conventional neuroimaging analyses have ascribed function to particular brain regions, exploiting the power of the subtraction technique in fMRI and event-related potential analyses in EEG. Moving beyond this convention, many researchers have begun exploring network-based neurodynamics and coordination between brain regions as a function of behavioral parameters or environmental statistics; however, most approaches average evoked activity across the experimental session to study task-dependent networks. Here, we examined on-going oscillatory activity as measured with EEG and use a methodology to estimate directionality in brain-behavior interactions. After source reconstruction, activity within specific frequency bands (delta: 2-3 Hz; theta: 4-7 Hz; alpha: 8-12 Hz; beta: 13-25 Hz) in a priori regions of interest was linked to continuous behavioral measurements, and we used a predictive filtering scheme to estimate the asymmetry between brain-to-behavior and behavior-to-brain prediction using a variant of Granger causality. We applied this approach to a simulated driving task and examined directed relationships between brain activity and continuous driving performance (steering behavior or vehicle heading error). Our results indicated that two neuro-behavioral states may be explored with this methodology: a Proactive brain state that actively plans the response to the sensory information and is characterized by delta-beta activity, and a Reactive brain state that processes incoming information and reacts to environmental statistics primarily within the alpha band.

In light of previous studies, we investigate the potential relationship between Internet addiction and risk decision-making, as well as the sensitivity to reward and punishment, among college students. Thirty-two volunteers were allocated to the Internet addiction group and the non-addiction group according to the Internet addiction diagnostic criteria from Tao et al. Both groups finished a simple gambling task with electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. Behavioral results showed that the Internet addiction group performed at a higher risk level compared to the non-addiction group. Regarding the event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by outcome feedback during decision-making, the Internet addiction group exhibited a smaller feedback-related negativity (FRN) but a larger P300 than the non addiction group in the small magnitude condition, which may indicate weaker punishment sensitivity and stronger reward sensitivity, respectively.

Cool, callous and in control: superior inhibitory control in frequent players of video games with violent content	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						graphic violent video game play; empathy; response inhibition; facial expression processing; stop-signal task; ERPs	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TIME-COURSE; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; FACIAL EMOTION; AGGRESSION; ADOLESCENTS; CONFLICT; BRAIN; MEDIA	Research on the effects of media violence exposure has shown robust associations among violent media exposure, increased aggressive behavior, and decreased empathy. Preliminary research indicates that frequent players of violent video games may have differences in emotional and cognitive processes compared to infrequent or nonplayers, yet research examining the amount and content of game play and the relation of these factors with affective and cognitive outcomes is limited. The present study measured neural correlates of response inhibition in the context of implicit attention to emotion, and how these factors are related to empathic responding in frequent and infrequent players of video games with graphically violent content. Participants completed a self-report measure of empathy as well as an affective stop-signal task that measured implicit attention to emotion and response inhibition during electroencephalography. Frequent players had lower levels of empathy as well as a reduction in brain activity as indicated by P100 and N200/P300 event related potentials. Reduced P100 amplitude evoked by happy facial expressions was observed in frequent players compared to infrequent players, and this effect was moderated by empathy, such that low levels of empathy further reduced P100 amplitudes for happy facial expressions for frequent players compared to infrequent players. Compared to infrequent players, frequent players had reduced N200/P300 amplitude during response inhibition, indicating less neural resources were recruited to inhibit behavior. Results from the present study illustrate that chronic exposure to violent video games modulates empathy and related neural correlates associated with affect and cognition.

Event-related potentials are used as an electrophysiologic index of cognitive disorders. Auditory event-related potentials (P300) are often used in conditions in which cognitive ability is affected. In this study, we evaluated the association between P300, used to assess cognitive impairment, and neuropsychological side effects of IFN treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Subjects were 20 patients with chronic hepatitis C; 13 patients were treated with peg IFN-alpha 2b and ribavirin (riba group), and 7 patients were treated with peg IFN-alpha 2a (alone group). P300 was performed on all patients before treatment and after 1 week, 4 weeks, 2 months, and 3 months of treatment. In addition, 10 patients of them completed the self-rating depression scale (SDS). P300 latency was significantly prolonged at all points of measurement during IFN treatment. No correlation between the change of SDS score and the change rate of P300 latency was shown. Six patients with neuropsychological symptom had a significantly increased change rate of P300 latency compared with patients without neuropsychological symptoms (P < 0.05). Based on P300 findings, this study suggests that patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with IFN may experience significant cognitive impairment.

To test this hypothesis, SSVEP amplitudes were measured in eight subjects across two conditions of stimulation ( stimulation on and stimulation off) and three brain states (waking, light sleep, and deep sleep). Results showed a significant interaction between stimulation and brain state. In particular, EEG activity at the frequency of stimulation was higher during both light sleep and deep sleep in the stimulation on condition than in the stimulation off condition. The fact that it is possible to elicit SSVEPs during sleep may provide a new way to study how SSVEPs are generated in the brain-one that might help resolve open questions such as identifying the SSVEP activation sequence or deciding if SSVEPs derive from evoked or oscillatory neural processes.

Emotional decision is a part of hot executive function and contains emotion and logic elements. As a kind of important social adaptation ability, more and more attention has been paid in recent years. Objective: Gambling task can be well performed in the study of emotional decision. As fMRI researches focused on gambling task show not completely consistent brain activation regions, this study adopted EEG-fMRI fusion technology to reveal brain neural activity related with feedback stimuli. Methods: In this study, an EEG-informed fMRI analysis was applied to process simultaneous EEG-fMRI data. First, relative power-spectrum analysis and K-means clustering method were performed separately to extract EEG-fMRI features. Then, Generalized linear models were structured using fMRI data and using different EEG features as regressors. Results: The results showed that in the win versus loss stimuli, the activated regions almost covered the caudate, the ventral striatum (VS), the orbital frontal cortex (OFC), and the cingulate. Wide activation areas associated with reward and punishment were revealed by the EEG-fMRI integration analysis than the conventional fMRI results, such as the posterior cingulate and the OFC. The VS and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were found when EEG power features were performed as regressors of GLM compared with results entering the amplitudes of feedbacK-related negativity (FRN) as regressors. Furthermore, the brain region activation intensity was the strongest when theta-band power was used as a regressor compared with the other two fusion results. Conclusions: The EEG-based fMRI analysis can more accurately depict the whole-brain activation map and analyze emotional decision problems.

Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the acute effects of aerobic and coordinative exercise on behavioral performance and the allocation of attentional resources in an inhibitory control task. Using a cross-over design, children with ADHD-combined type and healthy comparisons completed a Flanker task before and after 20 min moderately-intense cycling exercise, coordinative exercise and an inactive control condition. During the task, stimulus-locked event-related potentials were recorded with electroencephalography. Both groups showed an increase of P300 amplitude and decrease of reaction time after exercise compared to the control condition. Investigating the effect of exercise modality, aerobic exercise led to greater increases of P300 amplitude and reductions in reaction time than coordinative exercise in children with ADHD. The findings suggest that a single exercise bout improves inhibitory control and the allocation of attentional resources. There were some indications that an aerobic exercise session seems to be more efficient than coordinative exercise in reducing the inhibitory control deficits that persist in children with ADHD.

The method of ROI selection can critically affect the conclusions of a study by causing the researcher to miss effects in the data or to detect spurious effects. In practice, to avoid inflating Type I error rate (i.e., false positives), ROIs are often based on a priori hypotheses or independent information. However, this can be insensitive to experiment-specific variations in effect location (e.g., latency shifts) reducing power to detect effects. Data-driven ROI selection, in contrast, is nonindependent and uses the data under analysis to determine ROI positions. Therefore, it has potential to select ROIs based on experiment-specific information and increase power for detecting effects. However, data-driven methods have been criticized because they can substantially inflate Type I error rate. Here, we demonstrate, using simulations of simple ERP experiments, that data-driven ROI selection can indeed be more powerful than a priori hypotheses or independent information. Furthermore, we show that data-driven ROI selection using the aggregate grand average from trials (AGAT), despite being based on the data at hand, can be safely used for ROI selection under many circumstances. However, when there is a noise difference between conditions, using the AGAT can inflate Type I error and should be avoided. We identify critical assumptions for use of the AGAT and provide a basis for researchers to use, and reviewers to assess, data-driven methods of ROI localization in ERP and other studies.

Physical attributes such as color, brightness and spatial frequency of emotional visual stimuli have crucial effect on the perception of complex scene. Brightness is intimately related with emotional valence. Here we explored the effect of brightness on delta oscillatory responses upon presentation of pleasant, unpleasant and neutral pictures. We found that bright unpleasant pictures elicited lower amplitude of delta response than original unpleasant pictures. The electro-physiological finding of the study was in accordance with behavioral data. These results denoted the importance of delta responses on the examination of the association between perceptual and conceptual processes while in the question of brightness and emotion.

However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the subjective experience of perceiving univocal auditory patterns that can be listened to, despite hearing all sounds in a scene, are poorly understood. We hereby investigated the manner in which competing sound organizations are simultaneously represented by specific brain activity patterns and the way attention and task demands prime the internal model generating the current percept. Using a selective attention task on ambiguous auditory stimulation coupled with EEG recordings, we found that the phase of low-frequency oscillatory activity dynamically tracks multiple sound organizations concurrently. However, whereas the representation of ignored sound patterns is circumscribed to auditory regions, large-scale oscillatory entrainment in auditory, sensory-motor and executive-control network areas reflects the active perceptual organization, thereby giving rise to the subjective experience of a unitary percept.

This study investigated the tactile ERP and EEG spectral power correlates of mental workload by relating limited-capacity involuntary attention allocation to changes in late positive potential (LPP) amplitude, alpha, and theta powers. We examined whether mental workload (high-level cognitive control) can be evaluated using somatosensory stimuli. Sixteen participants all performed three tasks of varying difficulty. Two dual n-back tasks (n = 1 and 2) were used to investigate the degree to which mental workload affected the LPP amplitudes and EEG spectral powers evoked by ignoring salient tactile stimuli. In control trials, tactile vibrations were applied at random without dual n-back tasks. Subjective mental workload of each task was rated using the NASA Task Load Index. LPP amplitudes at Pz were significantly smaller in the dual-2-back trials compared to control and dual-1 back trials. Significantly increased theta power at Fz and reduced alpha power at Pz were found in the dual-2 back condition compared to control and dual-l-back condition. There was no significant difference between control and dual-l-back trials. The same pattern was found for subjective ratings of cognitive workload. These results indicate that the dual-2-back task imposed a significantly greater mental workload, causing impaired cognitive-control functions. Our findings support the notion that selective attention mechanisms necessary for effectively allocating and modulating attentional resources are temporarily impaired during the mentally overloaded state.

In the present investigation, we used ERPs to measure the detection of a discrepancy between gender-based occupational stereotypes and written material presented to fifteen Italian viewers in a completely implicit task. No awareness or judgment about stereotypes was required, no decision had to be made on sentence acceptability or congruence, and no prime words related to gender were presented (which might reveal the matter of the investigation). EEG was recorded while participants engaged in a task that consisted of pressing a key in response to animal words, while ignoring the overall study's purpose. Two hundred forty sentences that did or did not violate gender stereotypes were presented randomly with 32 other sentences ending with an animal word. Terminal words violating gender stereotypes (such as "The notary is BREASTFEEDING" or "Here is the commissioner with HER HUSBAND") elicited a greater anterior N400 response and left anterior negativity (LAN) than words conforming to the gender stereotype (e.g., "The chemist put on a nice TIE'). LAN modulation suggests that gender stereotypes are processed automatically (as if they were morpho-syntactic errors) and hints at how they are deeply rooted in our linguistic brain. According to the inverse solution, the neural representation of gender-based stereotypes mostly involved the middle frontal gyrus (MFG). The temporo/parietal junction (TPJ) supporting theory of mind (TOM) processes was also engaged, along with the superior and middle temporal gyri representing person information. (C) 2017 IBRO.

The pathophysiology of FOG remains poorly understood but is associated with deficits in cognitive function and motor preparation. Method: We studied 20 people with PD (10 with FOG, 10 without FOG) and performed a timed response target detection task while electroencephalographic data were acquired. We analysed the data to detect and examine cortical markers of cognitive decision making (P3b or centroparietal positivity, CPP) and motor readiness potential. We analysed current source density (CSD) to increase spatial resolution and allow identification of distinct signals. Results: There was no difference in the P3b/CPP response between people with PD with and without FOG, suggesting equivalent cognitive processing with respect to decision-making. However, the FOG group had significant difference with an earlier onset and larger amplitude of the lateralized readiness potential. Furthermore, the amplitude of the lateralised readiness potential correlated strongly with total Frontal Assessment Battery score. Conclusions: The difference in lateralized readiness potentials may reflect excessive recruitment of lateral premotor areas to compensate for dysfunction of the supplementary motor area and resultant loss of automatic motor control. This early, excessive recruitment of frontal networks occurs in spite of equivalent motor scores and reaction times between groups. Significance: The saturation of frontal processing mechanisms could help explain deficits in attentional set-shifting, dual-tasking and response inhibition which are frequently reported in FOG.

Specifically, this study used both self-report and electroencephalograrri (EEG) measures to explore how users would psychologically and physiologically respond to avatars wearing their own faces. Twenty-five undergraduate students participated in an EEG-based experiment that employed a 2 x 4 within-subjects factorial design. In the experiment, each of the participants was randomly exposed to eight combinations of two types of image presentations (photo image vs. avatar image) and four categories of human faces (self-faces vs. famous faces vs. ideal faces vs. unfamiliar faces). The self-report result data indicated that participants felt significantly higher senses of physical similarity to and identification with the characters when they were exposed to their own faces in the form of a photo image. The findings of the EEG data also demonstrated that participants paid much more attention to their own faces than to any other faces regardless of the image presentation type. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Discrimination of emotional states from scalp- and intracranial EEG using multiscale Renyi entropy	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; RESPONSES; AMYGDALA; COMPLEXITY; ERP; IDENTIFICATION; NONLINEARITY; RECOGNITION; THETA	A data-adaptive, multiscale version of Renyi's quadratic entropy (RQE) is introduced for emotional state discrimination from EEG recordings. The algorithm is applied to scalp EEG recordings of 30 participants watching 4 emotionally-charged video clips taken from a validated public database. Krippendorffs inter-rater statistic reveals that multiscale RQE of the mid-frontal scalp electrodes best discriminates between five emotional states. Multiscale RQE is also applied to joint scalp EEG, amygdala- and occipital pole intracranial recordings of an implanted patient watching a neutral and an emotionally charged video clip. Unlike for the neutral video clip, the RQEs of the mid-frontal scalp electrodes and the amygdala-implanted electrodes are observed to coincide in the time range where the crux of the emotionally-charged video clip is revealed. In addition, also during this time range, phase synchrony between the amygdala and mid-frontal recordings is maximal, as well as our 30 participants inter-rater agreement on the same video clip. A source reconstruction exercise using intracranial recordings supports our assertion that amygdala could contribute to mid-frontal scalp EEG. On the contrary, no such contribution was observed for the occipital poles intracranial recordings. Our results suggest that emotional states discriminated from mid-frontal scalp EEG are likely to be mirrored by differences in amygdala activations in particular when recorded in response to emotionally-charged scenes.

We collected ERPs in young and old participants performing a word-encoding task. For subsequently remembered words, young adults had greater activity at the left and anterior electrode sites, whereas old adults had greater posterior activity. Performance correlated positively with central sites in young adults but with left parietal hemisphere activity in old adults. Plus, a large left frontoparietal network increased its activity during the successful encoding for the Beta (13-30 Hz) and Gamma (30-100 Hz) bands in young adults. Old adults had increased activity in the right posterior parietal region for forgotten words in the Gamma band. Using a source localization analysis, we found that age leads to a decrease in Gamma band cerebral activity during encoding of words in the left hemisphere and the bilateral para-hippocampal regions. These findings indicate that encoding impairment with age may be associated with dysfunctional Gamma oscillatory activity across a widespread network of left cortical regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The Riemannian framework is sharp from a mathematical perspective, yet in practice it is simple, both algorithmically and computationally. This allows the conception of online decoding machines suiting real-world operation in adverse conditions. We provide here a review on the use of Riemannian geometry for BCI and a primer on the classification frameworks based on it. While the theoretical research on Riemannian geometry is technical, our aim here is to show the appeal of the framework on an intuitive geometrical ground. In particular, we provide a rationale for its robustness and transfer learning capabilities and we elucidate the link between a simple Riemannian classifier and a state-of-the-art spatial filtering approach.

The present study investigated the modulation of emotional intensity on the integration of facial-vocal emotional cues by recording EEG for participants while they were performing emotion identification task on facial, vocal, and bimodal angry expressions varying in emotional intensity. Behavioral results showed the rates of anger and reaction speed increased as emotional intensity across modalities. Critically, the P2 amplitudes were larger for bimodal expressions than for the sum of facial and vocal expressions for low emotional intensity stimuli, but not for middle and high emotional intensity stimuli. These findings suggested that emotional intensity modulates the integration of facial-vocal angry expressions, following the principle of Inverse Effectiveness (IE) in multimodal sensory integration.

The dynamics of neurophysiological plasticity related to acquisition of such long-term associations has only recently become the target of investigation. In the present work, the effects of appetitive and aversive visuo-gustatory conditioning were studied with high density EEG-recordings focusing on late components in the visual evoked potentials (VEPs), specifically the N2-P3 waves. Unfamiliar images were paired with either a pleasant or an unpleasant juice and VEPs evoked by the images were compared before and 1 day after the pairings. In electrodes located over posterior visual cortex areas, the following changes were observed after conditioning: the amplitude from the N2-peak to the P3-peak increased and the N2 peak delay was reduced. The percentage increase of N2-to-P3 amplitudes was asymmetrically distributed over the posterior hemispheres despite the fact that the images were bilaterally symmetrical across the two visual hemifields. The percentage increases of N2-to-P3 amplitudes in each experimental subject correlated with the subject's evaluation of positive or negative hedonic valences of the two juices. The results from 118 scalp electrodes gave surface maps of theta power distributions showing increased power over posterior visual areas after the pairings. Source current distributions calculated from swLORETA revealed that visual evoked currents rose as a result of conditioning in five cortical regions-from primary visual areas and into the inferior temporal gyrus (ITG). These learning-induced changes were seen after both appetitive and aversive training while a sham trained control group showed no changes. It is concluded that long-term visuo-gustatory conditioning potentiated the N2-P3 complex, and it is suggested that the changes are regulated by the perceived hedonic valence of the US.

Materials & methods A total of 78 volunteers participated. The study was composed of three parts where olfactory stimuli were presented using a custom-built olfactometer. Part I was designed to optimize the stimulus as well as the recording conditions. In part II EEG-power changes after olfactory/trigeminal stimulation were compared between healthy participants and patients with olfactory impairment. In Part III the test-retest reliability of the method was evaluated in healthy subjects. Results Part I indicated that the most effective paradigm for stimulus presentation was cued stimulus, with an interstimulus interval of 18-20s at a stimulus duration of 1000ms with each stimulus quality presented 60 times in blocks of 20 stimuli each. In Part II we found that central processing of olfactory stimuli analyzed by TFA differed significantly between healthy controls and patients even when controlling for age. It was possible to reliably distinguish patients with olfactory impairment from healthy individuals at a high degree of accuracy (healthy controls vs anosmic patients: sensitivity 75%; specificity 89%). In addition we could show a good test-retest reliability of TFA of chemosensory induced EEG-power changes in Part III. Conclusions Central processing of olfactory stimuli analyzed by TFA reliably distinguishes patients with olfactory impairment from healthy individuals at a high degree of accuracy. Importantly this can be achieved with a simple olfactometer.

Testing adult human participants with high-density EEG, we show that, already before the presentation of a critical word, context-induced semantic predictions are reflected by a neurophysiological index, which we therefore call the semantic readiness potential (SRP). The SRP precedes critical words if a previous sentence context constrains the upcoming semantic content ( high-constraint contexts), but not in unpredictable (low-constraint) contexts. Specific semantic predictions were indexed by SRP sources within the motor system-in dorsolateral hand motor areas for expected hand-related words (e.g., "write"), but in ventral motor cortex for face-related words ("talk"). Compared with affirmative sentences, negated ones led to medial prefrontal and more widespread motor source activation, the latter being consistent with predictive semantic computation of alternatives to the negated expected concept. Predictive processing of semantic alternatives in negated sentences is further supported by a negative-going event-related potential at similar to 400 ms (N400), which showed the typical enhancement to semantically incongruent sentence endings only in high-constraint affirmative contexts, but not to high-constraint negated ones. These brain dynamics reveal the interplay between semantic prediction and resolution (match vs error) processing in sentence understanding.

Subjective craving and event-related brain response to olfactory and visual chocolate cues in binge-eating and healthy individuals	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; EMOTION REGULATION; ANOREXIA-NERVOSA; FOOD; VALIDATION; DISORDERS; EXPOSURE; TASTE; EEG; POTENTIALS	High-sugar/high-fat foods are related to binge-eating behaviour and especially people with low inhibitory control may encounter elevated difficulties to resist their intake. Incentive sensitization to food-related cues might lead to increased motivated attention towards these stimuli and to cue-induced craving. To investigate the combined influence of olfactory and visual stimuli on craving, inhibitory control and motivated attention, 20 healthy controls and 19 individuals with binge-eating viewed chocolate and neutral pictures, primed by chocolate or neutral odours. Subjective craving and electroencephalogram activity were recorded during the task. N2 and Late Positive Potential (LPP) amplitudes were analysed. Patients reported higher craving than controls. Subjective craving, N2 and LPP amplitudes were higher for chocolate versus neutral pictures. Patients showed a higher relative increase in N2 amplitudes to chocolate versus neutral pictures than controls. Chocolate images induced significant increases in craving, motivated attention and measures of cognitive control. Chocolate odour might potentiate the craving response to visual stimuli, especially in patients with binge-eating.

While the probabilistic properties of random graphs has been extensively studied, the development of statistical inference methods for this class of objects has received less attention. In this work we propose a non-parametric test of hypotheses to test if a sample of random graphs was generated by a given probability distribution (one-sample test) or if two samples of random graphs were originated from the same probability distribution (two-sample test). We prove a Central Limit Theorem providing the asymptotic distribution of the test statistics and we propose a method to compute the quantiles of the finite sample distributions by simulation. The test makes no assumption on the specific form of the distributions and it is consistent against any alternative hypotheses that differs from the sample distribution on at least one edge-marginal. Moreover, we show that the test is a Kolmogorov-Smirnov type test, for a given distance between graphs, and we study its performance on simulated data. We apply it to compare graphs of brain functional network interactions built from electroencephalographic (EEG) data collected during the visualization of point light displays depicting human locomotion.

Albeit they have been hailed to (re-)establish communication in persons suffering from severe motor- and/or communication disabilities, only recently BCI applications have been challenging other assistive technologies. Owing to their considerably increased performance and the advent of affordable technological solutions, BCI technology is expected to trigger a paradigm shift not only in assistive technology but also in the way we will interface with technology. However, the flipside of the quest for accuracy and speed is most evident in EEG-based visual BCI where it has led to a gamut of increasingly complex classifiers, tailored to the needs of specific stimulation paradigms and use contexts. In this contribution, we argue that spatiotemporal beamforming can serve several synchronous visual BCI paradigms. We demonstrate this for three popular visual paradigms even without attempting to optimizing their electrode sets. For each selectable target, a spatiotemporal beamformer is applied to assess whether the corresponding signal-of-interest is present in the preprocessed multichannel EEG signals. The target with the highest beamformer output is then selected by the decoder (maximum selection). In addition to this simple selection rule, we also investigated whether interactions between beamformer outputs could be employed to increase accuracy by combining the outputs for all targets into a feature vector and applying three common classification algorithms. The results show that the accuracy of spatiotemporal beamforming with maximum selection is at par with that of the classification algorithms and interactions between beamformer outputs do not further improve that accuracy.

However, not all individuals are susceptible to this shift under stress. Based on pharmacological studies indicating a critical role of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in the stress-induced bias toward dorsal striatal learning, we hypothesized that MR gene variants contribute to these individual differences. In two experiments, healthy participants were genotyped, exposed to a stressor or control manipulation and performed a learning task that can be solved using hippocampal or dorsal striatal systems, while electroencephalography (EEG; Experiment I) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; Experiment II) measurements were taken. Stress led to a shift from hippocampal to dorsal striatal learning which was more pronounced in homo-and heterozygous carriers of a six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)-comprising haplotype containing the alleles of two MR SNPs associated with increased MR expression and transactivational activity (MR-2G/C C [rs2070951], MR-I180V A [rs5522]). This stress-induced shift toward habit memory was paralleled by an increased feedback-related negativity (FRN), which may reflect striatal processing, and increased caudate activation. Carriers of the MR haplotype showed a reduced P3a, an event-related potential thought to indicate cognitive processing, and reduced hippocampal activity after stress. Moreover, stress resulted in reduced amygdala-hippocampus connectivity and the decrease in amygdala connectivity to the parahippocampal cortex was particularly pronounced in MR haplotype carriers. Our findings indicate that genetic variants associated with enhanced MR expression facilitate a stress-induced shift from hippocampal toward dorsal striatal learning, most likely via impaired hippocampal processing and reduced amygdala-hippocampus cross talk, allowing the dorsal striatum to guide behavior under stress.

Changes in Dimensionality and Fractal Scaling Suggest Soft-Assembled Dynamics in Human EEG	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						dynamical systems; soft-assembly; repetition priming; fractal scaling; dimensionality; self-organization; coordination	RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; TIME-SERIES; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; PHASE-RESET; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; HUMAN HEARTBEAT; BRAIN; BEHAVIOR; OSCILLATIONS; COMPLEXITY	Humans are high-dimensional, complex systems consisting of many components that must coordinate in order to perform even the simplest of activities. Many behavioral studies, especially in themovement sciences, have advanced the notion of soft-assembly to describe how systems with many components coordinate to perform specific functions while also exhibiting the potential to re-structure and then perform other functions as task demands change. Consistent with this notion, within cognitive neuroscience it is increasingly accepted that the brain flexibly coordinates the networks needed to cope with changing task demands. However, evaluation of various indices of soft-assembly has so far been absent from neurophysiological research. To begin addressing this gap, we investigated task-related changes in two distinct indices of soft-assembly using the established phenomenon of EEG repetition suppression. In a repetition priming task, we assessed evidence for changes in the correlation dimension and fractal scaling exponents during stimulus-locked event-related potentials, as a function of stimulus onset and familiarity, and relative to spontaneous non-task-related activity. Consistent with predictions derived from soft-assembly, results indicated decreases in dimensionality and increases in fractal scaling exponents from resting to pre-stimulus states and following stimulus onset. However, contrary to predictions, familiarity tended to increase dimensionality estimates. Overall, the findings support the view from soft-assembly that neural dynamics should become increasingly ordered as external task demands increase, and support the broader application of soft-assembly logic in understanding human behavior and electrophysiology.

AMPLIFIED INDUCED NEURAL OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY PREDICTS MUSICIANS' BENEFITS IN CATEGORICAL SPEECH PERCEPTION	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha activity; categorical speech perception; experience-dependent plasticity; induced oscillations; gamma activity	AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; BRAIN-STEM; LANGUAGE EXPERIENCE; CORTEX; GAMMA; ENHANCEMENT; PLASTICITY; EXPERTISE; DYNAMICS; CONTEXT	Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) reveal musical experience refines neural encoding and confers stronger categorical perception (CP) and neural organization for speech sounds. In addition to evoked brain activity, the human EEG can be decomposed into induced (non phase -locked) responses whose various frequency bands reflect different mechanisms of perceptual-cognitive processing. Here, we aimed to clarify which spectral properties of these neural oscillations are most prone to music-related neuroplasticity and which are linked to behavioral benefits in the categorization of speech. We recorded electrical brain activity while musicians and nonmusicians rapidly identified speech tokens from a sound continuum. Time-frequency analysis parsed evoked and induced EEG into alpha( similar to 10 Hz), beta- (similar to 20 Hz), and gamma- (>30 Hz) frequency bands. We found that musicians' enhanced behavioral CP was accompanied by improved evoked speech responses across the frequency spectrum, complementing previously observed enhancements in evoked potential studies (i.e., ERPs). Brain-behavior correlations implied differences in the underlying neural mechanisms supporting speech CP in each group: modulations in induced gamma power predicted the slope of musicians' speech identification functions whereas early evoked alpha activity predicted behavior in nonmusicians. Collectively, findings indicate that musical training tunes speech processing via two complementary mechanisms: (i) strengthening the formation of auditory object representations for speech signals (gamma-band) and (ii) improving network control and/or the matching of sounds to internalized memory templates (alpha/beta-band). Both neurobiological enhancements may be deployed behaviorally and account for musicians' benefits in the perceptual categorization of speech. (C) 2017 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: 89 patients, stratified into 4 different phenotypic presentations of ALS (67 spinal-onset, 15 bulbar-onset, 7 ALS-FTD, 7 C9ORF72 gene careers), and 19 matched controls underwent 128-channel EEG data recording. Subjects were presented with standard auditory tones interleaved with pitch-deviant tones in three recording blocks. The MMN response was quantified by peak amplitude, peak delay, average amplitude, and average delay, 100-300 ms after stimuli. 64 patients underwent cognitive screening using the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen (ECAS), and 38 participants underwent contemporaneous cognitive assessment using the Stroop Color-Word Interference test (CWIT), which measures attention shift, inhibitory control, and error monitoring. Results: The MMN response was observed in frontal and frontocentral regions of patient and control groups. Compared to controls, waveforms were attenuated in early onset, and the average delay was significantly increased in all of the ALS subgroups, with no significant difference between subgroups. Comparing with the control response, the ALS MMN response clustered into four new subgroups characterized by differences in response latency. The increased average delay correlated with changes in the Stroop CWIT; however, it did not show a direct relationship with age, gender, traditional phenotypes, revised ALS Functional Rating Scale, or ECAS scores. Conclusion and significance: The MMN response in ALS patients reflects the cognitive dysfunction in specific sub-domains, as the new patient subgroups, identified by cluster analysis, do not segregate with existing clinical or cognitive classifications. Event-related potentials can provide additional quantitative neurophysiologic measures of impairment in specific cognitive sub-domains from which it may be possible to generate novel biologically relevant subgroups of ALS.

It is an important aspect in industries such as aerospace and nuclear power, which involve tremendous man-machine interaction and where safety of any component/system or environment as a whole is extremely crucial. Many methods for vigilance detection, based on biological and behavioral characteristics, have been proposed in the literature. Nevertheless, the existing methods are associated with high time complexity, unhandy devices and incur huge equipment overhead. This paper aims to pave an alternative solution to the existing techniques using brain computing interface (BCI). EEG device being a non-invasive BCI technique is popular in many applications. In this work, we have utilized P300 component of ERPs of EEG signal for vigilance detection task as it can be detected fast and accurately. Through this work, we aim to establish the correlation between P300 ERP and vigilance. We have performed a number of experiments to substantiate the correctness of our proposal and have also proposed an approach to measure the vigilance level.

These gamma oscillations are functionally relevant for the processing of rapidly changing acoustic information in both speech and non-speech sounds. Accordingly, there is a tight link between the temporal resolution ability of the auditory system and inherent neural gamma oscillations. Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) has been demonstrated to specifically increase gamma oscillation in the human auditory cortex. However, neither the physiological mechanisms of tRNS nor the behavioral consequences of this intervention are completely understood. In the present study we stimulated the human auditory cortex bilaterally with tRNS while EEG was continuously measured. Modulations in the participants' temporal and spectral resolution ability were investigated by means of a gap detection task and a pitch discrimination task. Compared to sham, auditory tRNS increased the detection rate for near-threshold stimuli in the temporal domain only, while no such effect was present for the discrimination of spectral features. Behavioral findings were paralleled by reduced peak latencies of the P50 and N1 component of the auditory event-related potentials (ERP) indicating an impact on early sensory processing. The facilitating effect of tRNS was limited to the processing of near-threshold stimuli while stimuli clearly below and above the individual perception threshold were not affected by tRNS. This non-linear relationship between the signal-to-noise level of the presented stimuli and the effect of stimulation further qualifies stochastic resonance (SR) as the underlying mechanism of tRNS on auditory processing. Our results demonstrate a tRNS related improvement in acoustic perception of time critical auditory information and, thus, provide further indices that auditory tRNS can amplify the resonance frequency of the auditory system.

Multisensory object perception in infancy: 4-month-olds perceive a mistuned harmonic as a separate auditory and visual object	COGNITION			English	Article						Auditory scene analysis; Auditory development; Multisensory object perception; Simultaneous integration	SUBJECTIVE CONTOURS; NEWBORN-INFANTS; AMODAL REPRESENTATION; NUMERICAL ABILITIES; SPEECH ACOUSTICS; SCENE ANALYSIS; YOUNG INFANTS; CORRESPONDENCES; PITCH; SOUND	Infants learn to use auditory and visual information to organize the sensory world into identifiable objects with particular locations. Here we use a behavioural method to examine infants' use of harmonicity cues to auditory object perception in a multisensory context. Sounds emitted by different objects sum in the air and the auditory system must figure out which parts of the complex waveform belong to different sources (auditory objects). One important cue to this source separation is that complex tones with pitch typically contain a fundamental frequency and harmonics at integer multiples of the fundamental. Consequently, adults hear a mistuned harmonic in a complex sound as a distinct auditory object (Alain, Theunissen, Chevalier, Batty, & Taylor, 2003). Previous work by our group demonstrated that 4-month-old infants are also sensitive to this cue. They behaviourally discriminate a complex tone with a mistuned harmonic from the same complex with in-tune harmonics, and show an object-related event-related potential (ERP) electrophysiological (EEG) response to the stimulus with mistuned harmonics. In the present study we use an audiovisual procedure to investigate whether infants perceive a complex tone with an 8% mistuned harmonic as emanating from two objects, rather than merely detecting the mistuned cue. We paired in-tune and mistuned complex tones with visual displays that contained either one or two bouncing balls. Four-month-old infants showed surprise at the incongruous pairings, looking longer at the display of two balls when paired with the in-tune complex and at the display of one ball when paired with the mistuned harmonic complex. We conclude that infants use harmonicity as a cue for source separation when integrating auditory and visual information in object perception. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

If the number of objects to be estimated is small, typically around 1-4 items, observers are able to give very fast and precise judgments with high confidence-an effect that is called subitizing. Due to its speed and effortless nature subitizing has usually been assumed to be preattentive, putting it into the same category as other low level visual features like color or orientation. More recently, however, a number of studies have suggested that subitizing might be dependent on attentional resources. In our current study we investigated the potentially preattentive nature of visual numerical perception in the subitizing range by means of EEG. We presented peripheral, task irrelevant sequences of stimuli consisting of a certain number of circular patches while participants were engaged in a demanding, non-numerical detection task at the fixation point drawing attention away from the number stimuli. Within a sequence of stimuli of a given number of patches (called "standards") we interspersed some stimuli of different numerosity ("oddballs"). We compared the evoked responses to visually identical stimuli that had been presented in two different conditions, serving as standard in one condition and as oddball in the other. We found significant visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) responses over parieto-occipital electrodes. In addition to the event-related potential (ERP) analysis, we performed a time-frequency analysis (TFA) to investigate whether the vMMN was accompanied by additional oscillatory processes. We found a concurrent increase in evoked theta power of similar strength over both hemispheres. Our results provide clear evidence for a preattentive processing of numerical visual information in the subitizing range.

Behavioral performance and event-related potentials [N2pc and contralateral delay activity (CDA)] were measured in AD, MCI, and healthy controls during a MOP task, which consisted in enumerating a variable number of targets presented among distractors. AD patients showed an overall decline in accuracy for both small and large target quantities, whereas in MCI patients, only enumeration of large quantities was impaired. N2pc, a neural marker of attentive individuation, was spared in both AD and MCI patients. In contrast, CDA, which indexes visual short term memory abilities, was altered in both groups of patients, with a non-linear pattern of amplitude modulation along the continuum of the disease: a reduction in AD and an increase in MCI. These results indicate that AD pathology shows a progressive decline in MOP, which is associated to the decay of visual short-term memory mechanisms. Crucially, CDA may be considered as a useful neural signature both to distinguish between healthy and pathological aging and to characterize the different stages along the AD continuum, possibly becoming a reliable candidate for an early diagnostic biomarker of AD pathology.

Psychol. 94:426-432) found that participants who rated religion or spirituality (R/S) highly important had greater posterior alpha after 10 years compared to those who did not. Participants who subsequently lowered their rating also had prominent alpha, while those who increased their rating did not. Here we report EEG findings 20 years after initial assessment. Clinical evaluations and R/S ratings were obtained from 73 (52 new) participants in a longitudinal study of family risk for depression. Frequency PCA of current source density transformed EEG concisely quantified posterior alpha. Those who initially rated R/S as highly important had greater alpha compared to those who did not, even if their R/S rating later increased. Furthermore, changes in religious denomination were associated with decreased alpha. Results suggest the possibility of a critical stage in the ontogenesis of R/S that is linked to posterior resting alpha. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We tested the impact of window size and choice of reference electrode on the identification of two or more peaks with close frequencies in the spectral power distribution, so called "split alpha." Together with the connectivity analysis, examination of spatiotemporal maps showing the distribution of amplitudes of EEG patterns allowed for better explanation of the mechanisms underlying the generation of split alpha peaks. It was demonstrated that the split alpha spectrum can be generated by two or more independent and interconnected alpha wave generators located in different regions of the cerebral cortex, but not necessarily in the occipital cortex. We also demonstrated the importance of appropriate reference electrode choice during signal recording. In addition, results obtained using the original data were compared with results obtained using re-referenced data, using average reference electrode and reference electrode standardization techniques.

It is believed that MI training efficiency could be improved by using the brain-computer interface (BCI) technology providing real-time feedback on person's mental attempts. While BCI is indeed a convenient and motivating tool for practicing MI, it is not clear whether it could be used for predicting or measuring potential positive impact of the training. In this study, we are trying to establish whether the proficiency in BCI control is associated with any of the neurophysiological or psychological correlates of motor imagery, as well as to determine possible interrelations among them. For that purpose, we studied motor imagery in a group of 19 healthy BCI-trained volunteers and performed a correlation analysis across various quantitative assessment metrics. We examined subjects' sensorimotor event-related EEG events, corticospinal excitability changes estimated with single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), BCI accuracy and self-assessment reports obtained with specially designed questionnaires and interview routine. Our results showed, expectedly, that BCI performance is dependent on the subject's capability to suppress EEG sensorimotor rhythms, which in turn is correlated with the idle state amplitude of those oscillations. Neither BCI accuracy nor the EEG features associated with MI were found to correlate with the level of corticospinal excitability increase during motor imagery, and with assessed imagery vividness. Finally, a significant correlation was found between the level of corticospinal excitability increase and kinesthetic vividness of imagery (KVIQ-20 questionnaire). Our results suggest that two distinct neurophysiological mechanisms might mediate possible effects of motor imagery: the non-specific cortical sensorimotor disinhibition and the focal corticospinal excitability increase. Acquired data suggests that BCI-based approach is unreliable in assessing motor imagery due to its high dependence on subject's innate EEG features (e.g. resting mu-rhythm amplitude). Therefore, employment of additional assessment protocols, such as TMS and psychological testing, is required for more comprehensive evaluation of the subject's motor imagery training efficiency.

Methods: Twenty-four early-to-middle-stage HD patients and 14 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were examined. EEGEMG recordings were obtained from 21 scalp electrodes and eight bipolar derivations from the legs. Principal component analysis was used to obtain artifact-free recordings. The stimulation paradigm consisted of 50 rare and 150 frequent stimuli and was performed in two conditions: standing and walking along a 10 by 5 m path. P3 wave amplitude and latency and EEG and EMG spectral values were compared by group and experimental condition and correlated with clinical features of HD. Results: P3 amplitude increased during walking in both HD patients and controls. This effect was inversely correlated with motor impairment in HD patients, who showed a beta-band power increase over the parieto-occipital regions in the walking condition during the P3 task. Walking speed and counting of rare stimuli were not compromised by concurrence of motor and cognitive demands. Conclusion: Our results showed that walking increased P3 amplitude in an auditory task, in both HD patients and controls. Concurrent cognitive and motor stimulation could be used for rehabilitative purposes as a means of enhancing activation of cortical compensatory reserves, counteracting potential negative interference and promoting the integration of neuronal circuits serving different functions.

A recent cognitive model suggests that frontal-parietal and frontal-temporal interregional connectivity are related to attention/action selection and target-related memory updating during the P3, respectively, but empirical work testing this model is lacking. Other work suggests the importance of theta-and delta-band connectivity between the medial frontal cortex and distributed cortical regions during attention, stimulus detection, and response selection processes, and similar dynamics may underlie P3related network connectivity. The present study evaluated the functional connectivity elicited during a visual task, which combined oddball target and novelty stimuli, in a sample of 231 same-sex twins. It was hypothesized that both target and novel conditions would involve theta frontoparietal connectivity and medial frontal theta power, but that target stimuli would elicit the strongest frontotemporal connectivity. EEG time-frequency analysis revealed greater theta-band frontoparietal connectivity and medial frontal power during both target and novel conditions compared to standards, which may index conflict/uncertainty resolution processes. Theta-band frontotemporal connectivity was maximal during the target condition, potentially reflecting context updating or stimulus-response activation. Delta-band frontocentral-parietal connectivity was also strongest following targets, which may be sensitive to response-related demands. These results suggest the existence of functional networks related to P3 that are differentially engaged by target oddballs and novel distractors.

Increased long distance event-related gamma band connectivity in Alzheimer's disease	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Event-related; Sensory-evoked; Coherence; Gamma; Alzheimer's disease; EEG; Connectivity	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; DELTA OSCILLATORY RESPONSES; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; MEMORY TASK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; RETICULAR-FORMATION; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; AUDITORY PATHWAY; HEALTHY-SUBJECTS; BRAIN	Background: Brain oscillatory responses can be used for non-invasive analyses of cortico-cortical connectivity, local neuronal synchronization, and coherence of oscillations in many neuropsychiatric conditions including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present paper, we examine sensory-evoked and event-related gamma coherences elicited by visual stimuli in three sub-gamma bands in two sub-groups of patients with AD (i.e., acetylcholinesterase-inhibitor treated and untreated) and healthy controls. Methods: We studied a total of 39 patients with probable mild AD (according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria) who had been sub-divided into untreated (n = 21) and treated (n = 18) (patients either on cholinergic monotherapy or combined therapy with memantine) AD groups, and 21 age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy elderly controls. A simple flash visual paradigm was applied for the acquisition of sensory-evoked coherences. Event-related coherences were elicited using a classical visual oddball paradigm. Both sensory-evoked and event-related gamma coherences were calculated for long-distance intrahemispheric pairs for three frequency ranges: 2530 Hz, 30-35 Hz, and 40-48 Hz in post-stimulus 0-800 ms duration. The long-distance intrahemispheric pairs from both sides were fronto-parietal, fronto-temporal, fronto-temporoparietal, fronto-occipital, centro-occipital and parieto-occipital. Results: The sensory-evoked or event-related gamma coherences revealed that both treated and untreated AD patients had significantly increased values compared to healthy controls in all three sub-gamma bands. Moreover, the treated AD patients demonstrated significantly higher fronto-parietal gamma coherences during both sensory stimulation and oddball paradigm and lower occipito-parietal coherences during oddball paradigm in comparison to untreated AD patients. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that an increase of gamma coherences was present in response to both visual sensory and cognitive stimulation in AD patients in all gamma sub-bands. Therefore, gamma oscillatory activity seems to be fundamental in brain functions at both the sensory and cognitive levels. The increase of gamma coherence values was not due to cholinergic treatment to any significant extent, as both treated and untreated AD patients had increased gamma coherence values compared to healthy controls. The use of coherence values reflecting brain connectivity holds potential for neuroimaging of AD and understanding brain dynamics related to the effects of medication. (C) 2017 The Authors.

For instance, when two streams of stimuli are presented left and right, the second target (T2) is better identified in the left visual field (LVF) than in the right visual field (RVF). Recently, it has been shown that this bias is related to weaker stimulus-driven orienting of attention toward the RVF: The RVF disadvantage was reduced with salient task-irrelevant valid cues and increased with invalid cues. Here we studied if also endogenous orienting of attention may compensate for this unequal distribution of stimulus-driven attention. Explicit information was provided about the location of T1 and T2. Effectiveness of the cue manipulation was confirmed by EEG measures: decreasing alpha power before stream onset with informative cues, earlier latencies of potentials evoked by T1-preceding distractors at the right than at the left hemisphere when T1 was cued left, and decreasing T1- and T2-evoked N2pc amplitudes with informative cues. Importantly, informative cues reduced (though did not completely abolish) the LVF advantage, indicated by improved identification of right T2, and reflected by earlier N2pc latency evoked by right T2 and larger decrease in alpha power after cues indicating right T2. Overall, these results suggest that endogenously driven attention facilitates stimulus-driven orienting of attention toward the RVF, thereby partially overcoming the basic LVF bias in spatial attention.

Even though many neurological diseases have shown a strong nexus between motor and cognitive symptoms, it has remained unclear whether cognitive performance of RLS patients declines in the evening and which neurophysiological mechanisms are affected by the circadian variation. In the current study, we examined daytime effects (morning vs. evening) on cognitive performance in RLS patients (n = 33) compared to healthy controls (n = 29) by analyzing flanker interference effects in combination with EEG and source localization techniques. RLS patients showed larger flanker interference effects in the evening than in the morning (p = .023), while healthy controls did not display a comparable circadian variation. In line with this, the neurophysiological data showed smaller N1 amplitudes in RLS patients compared to controls in the interfering task condition in the evening (p = .042), but not in the morning. The results demonstrate diurnal cognitive changes in RLS patients with intensified impairments in the evening. It seems that not all dopamine-regulated cognitive processes are altered in RLS and thus show daytime-dependent impairments. Instead, the daytime-related cognitive impairment emerges from attentional selection processes within the extra-striate visual cortex, but not from later cognitive processes such as conflict monitoring and response selection.

The present study investigated whether these psychological processes were dissociable on neural dynamics in terms of incentive valence and approach motivation. We recorded EEG when participants were performing a monetary incentive delay task, and found a cue-P3 during the cue-evaluation stage, a contingent negative variation (CNV) during the motor-preparation stage, and a stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN) during the feedback-anticipation stage. Critically, both the cue-P3 and SPN exhibited an enhanced sensitivity to gain versus loss anticipation, which was not observed for the CNV. Moreover, both the cue-P3 and SPN, instead of the CNV, for gain anticipation selectively predicted the participants' approach motivation as measured in a following effort expenditure for rewards task, particularly when reward uncertainty was maximal. Together, these results indicate that reward anticipation consists of several sub-stages, each with distinct functional significance, thus providing implications for neuropsychiatric diseases characterized by dysfunction in anticipatory reward processing.

This phenomenon may be one of the most common forms of synaesthesia but it has rarely been studied and there are no studies of its neural basis. We screened for this in a sample of 200 + individuals, and estimated a prevalence of 4.2%. We also document its characteristics: it tends to be induced by physically moving stimuli (more so than static stimuli which imply motion or trigger illusory motion); and the psychoacoustic features are simple (e.g. "whooshing") with some systematic correspondences to vision (e.g. faster movement is higher pitch). We demonstrate using event-related potentials that it emerges from early perceptual processing of vision. The synaesthetes have a higher amplitude motion-evoked N2 (165-185 ms), with some evidence of group differences as early as 55-75 ms. We discuss similarities between hearing-motion synaesthesia and previous observations that visual motion triggers auditory activity in the congenitally deaf. It is possible that both conditions reflect the maintenance of multisensory pathways found in early development that most people lose but can be retained in certain people in response to sensory deprivation (in the deaf) or, in people with normal hearing, as a result of other differences (e.g. genes predisposing to synaesthesia).

The advanced analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals induced by brain stimulation paradigms may provide an appropriate approach to differentiate patients with DoC, besides the clinical assessment. Objective: This study was performed with an objective of identifying residual brain network perturbations following an innovative, non-invasive audiovisual stimulation protocol, which could be related to behavioral responsiveness in patients with DoC. Methods: The study comprised of ten healthy controls (HC), seven patients with Minimally Conscious State (MCS), and nine patients with Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (UWS). Both synchronous as well as asynchronous transorbital and transauricolar alternating current were employed as stimuli and their effects were measured in terms of functional and effective connectivity. Results: A more noticeable deterioration of long range connectivity patterns were found in patients with UWS than in those with MCS, with an exception of two patients with UWS, who showed connectivity values similar to those of MCS patients. Conclusion: The audiovisual stimulation paradigm used in the present study may be employed as a supportive bedside tool for improving the differential diagnosis in patients with DoC.

Its prevalence is 5% in German-speaking individuals. Although the etiology of dyslexia largely remains to be determined, comprehensive evidence supports deficient phonological processing as a major contributing factor. An important prerequisite for phonological processing is auditory discrimination and, thus, essential for acquiring reading and spelling skills. The event-related potential Mismatch Response (MMR) is an indicator for auditory discrimination capabilities with dyslexics showing an altered late component of MMR in response to auditory input. MethodsIn this study, we comprehensively analyzed associations of dyslexia-specific late MMRs with genetic variants previously reported to be associated with dyslexia-related phenotypes in multiple studies comprising 25 independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 10 genes. ResultsFirst, we demonstrated validity of these SNPs for dyslexia in our sample by showing that additional inclusion of a polygenic risk score improved prediction of impaired writing compared with a model that used MMR alone. Secondly, a multifactorial regression analysis was conducted to uncover the subset of the 25 SNPs that is associated with the dyslexia-specific late component of MMR. In total, four independent SNPs within DYX1C1 and ATP2C2 were found to be associated with MMR stronger than expected from multiple testing. To explore potential pathomechanisms, we annotated these variants with functional data including tissue-specific expression analysis and eQTLs.

As shown in recent studies, the degree of coordination between brain and autonomic arousal influences attention, which highlights a previously unrecognised point of potential failure in the attention system. To investigate how cortical and autonomic dynamics are linked to the attentive process we analysed electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram and skin conductance data of 39 healthy adults recorded during a 2-h resting-state oddball experiment. We related cross-correlations to fluctuation periods of cortical and autonomic signals and correlated obtained measures to event-related potentials N1 and P2, reflecting excitatory and inhibitory processes. Increasing alignment of cortical and autonomic signals and longer periods of vigilance fluctuations corresponded to a larger and earlier P2; no such relations were found for N1. We compared two groups, with (I) and without measurable (II) delay in cortico-autonomic correlations. Individuals in Group II had more stable vigilance fluctuations, larger and earlier P2 and fell asleep more frequently than individuals in Group I. Our results support the hypothesis of a link between cortico-autonomic coupling and dynamics and central inhibition. Quantifying this link could help refine classification in psychiatric disorders with attention and sleep-related symptoms, particularly in ADHD, depression, and insomnia.

Researchers have argued that listeners are more sensitive to approaching sounds compared with receding sounds, reflecting an evolutionary pressure. However, these studies only manipulated overall sound intensity; therefore, it is unclearwhether looming bias is truly a perceptual bias for changes in source distance, or only in sound intensity. Here we demonstrate both behavioral and neural correlates of looming bias without manipulating overall sound intensity. In natural environments, the pinnae induce spectral cues that give rise to a sense of externalization; when spectral cues are unnatural, sounds are perceived as closer to the listener. We manipulated the contrast of individually tailored spectral cues to create sounds of similar intensity but different naturalness. We confirmed that soundswere perceived as approaching when spectral contrast decreased, and perceived as receding when spectral contrast increased. We measured behavior and electroencephalography while listeners judged motion direction. Behavioral responses showed a looming bias in that responses were more consistent for sounds perceived as approaching than for sounds perceived as receding. In a control experiment, looming bias disappeared when spectral contrast changes were discontinuous, suggesting that perceived motion in distance and not distance itself was driving the bias. Neurally, looming bias was reflected in an asymmetry of late event-related potentials associated with motion evaluation. Hence, both our behavioral and neural findings support a generalization of the auditory looming bias, representing a perceptual preference for approaching auditory objects.

Methods: EEG signals from Cz and its surrounding channels were recorded during three sets of ankle dorsiflexion movements. Each set was interspersed with either a complex or a simple auditory oddball task for healthy participants and a complex auditory oddball task for stroke patients. Results: The amplitude of the movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) decreased with the complex oddball paradigm, while MRCP variability increased. Both oddball paradigms increased the detection latency significantly (p < 0.05) and the complex paradigm decreased the true positive rate (TPR) (p = 0.04). In patients, the negativity of the MRCP decreased while pre-phase variability increased, and the detection latency and accuracy deteriorated with attention diversion. Conclusion: Attention diversion has a significant influence on MRCP features and detection parameters, although these changes were counteracted by the application of the laplacian method. Significance: Brain-computer interfaces for neuromodulation that use the MRCP as the control signal are robust to changes in attention. However, attention must be monitored since it plays a key role in plasticity induction. Here we demonstrate that this can be achieved using the single channel Cz.

This event-related fMRI study investigated the neural origins of self-initiated behaviors in humans, by identifying brain regions that increased in neural activities several seconds prior to self-initiated movements. Subjects performed a hand grasping task under two conditions: a free-timing and cued timing condition. The supplementary motor area (SMA) began to activate several seconds prior to self-initiated movement (accounting for hemodynamic delay), representing a potential blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal correlate of the readiness potential (RP) on electroencephalogram (EEG), referred to here as "readiness BOLD signals." Significant readiness BOLD signals were also observed in the right frontoparietal areas, precuneus, and insula, all of which are known to contribute to internally-generated behaviors, but with no prior evidence for such early and slow accumulation of neural activities. Moreover, visual and auditory cortices also exhibited clear readiness BOLD signals with similar early onsets, even absent external stimulation. Slow accumulation of neural activities throughout distributed cortical areas, including sensory, association, and motor cortices, underlies the generation of self-initiated behaviors. These findings warrant reconsideration of the prevailing view that the SMA or some other specific locus in frontoparietal cortex serves as the ultimate neural origin of self-initiated movement.

Voltage measurements are widely used but suffer from isolating and smearing properties of tissue between source and sensor, are blind to ionic flow direction, and reflect the difference between two electrodes, complicating interpretation. Magnetic field measurements could overcome these limitations but have been essentially limited to magnetoencephalography (MEG), using centimeter-sized, helium-cooled extracranial sensors. Here, we report on in vivo magnetic recordings of neuronal activity from visual cortex of cats with magnetrodes, specially developed needle-shaped probes carrying micron-sized, non-cooled magnetic sensors based on spin electronics. Event-related magnetic fields inside the neuropil were on the order of several nanoteslas, informing MEG source models and efforts for magnetic field measurements through MRI. Though the signal-to-noise ratio is still inferior to electrophysiology, this proof of concept demonstrates the potential to exploit the fundamental advantages of magnetophysiology.

Reconstruction of the current source density (CSD) underlying such recordings, however, requires "inverting" Poisson's equation. For inter-laminar recordings, this is commonly done by the CSD method, which consists in taking the second-order spatial derivative of the recorded local field potentials (LFPs). Although the CSD method has been tremendously successful in mapping the current generators underlying inter-laminar LFPs, its application to planar recordings is more challenging. While for inter-laminar recordings the CSD method seems reasonably robust against violations of its assumptions, is it unclear as to what extent this holds for planar recordings. One of the objectives of this study is to characterize the conditions under which the CSD method can be successfully applied to Utah array data. Using forward modeling, we find that for spatially coherent CSDs, the CSD method yields inaccurate reconstructions due to volume-conducted contamination from currents in deeper cortical layers. An alternative approach is to "invert" a constructed forward model. The advantage of this approach is that any a priori knowledge about the geometrical and electrical properties of the tissue can be taken into account. Although several inverse methods have been proposed for LFP data, the applicability of existing electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) inverse methods to LFP data is largely unexplored. Another objective of our study therefore, is to assess the applicability of the most commonly used EEG/MEG inverse methods to Utah array data. Our main conclusion is that these inverse methods provide more accurate CSD reconstructions than the CSD method. We illustrate the inverse methods using event-related potentials recorded from primary visual cortex of a macaque monkey during a motion discrimination task.

In this study, we sought to assess whether reward processing as such, or alternatively the complex interplay between motivation and reward might potentially account for the abnormal reward-based learning in MDD. MethodsA total of 35 treatment resistant MDD patients and 44 age matched healthy controls (HCs) performed a standard probabilistic learning task. RL was titrated using behavioral, computational modeling and event-related brain potentials (ERPs) data. ResultsMDD patients showed comparable learning rate compared to HCs. However, they showed decreased lose-shift responses as well as blunted subjective evaluations of the reinforcers used during the task, relative to HCs. Moreover, MDD patients showed normal internal (at the level of error-related negativity, ERN) but abnormal external (at the level of feedback-related negativity, FRN) reward prediction error (RPE) signals during RL, selectively when additional efforts had to be made to establish learning. ConclusionsCollectively, these results lend support to the assumption that MDD does not impair reward processing per se during RL. Instead, it seems to alter the processing of the emotional value of (external) reinforcers during RL, when additional intrinsic motivational processes have to be engaged.

The process underlying P3 has been assumed to be the updating of expectancies. More recently, P3 has been related to decision processing and to activation of established stimulus-response associations (S/R-link hypothesis). However, so far this latter approach has not provided a conception about how to explain the occurrence of P3 with predicted stimuli, although P3 was originally discovered in a prediction task. The present article proposes such a conception. We assume that the internal responses right or wrong both become associatively linked to each predicted target and that one of these two response alternatives gets activated as a function of match or mismatch of the target to the preceding prediction. This seems similar to comparison tasks where responses depend on the matching of the target stimulus with a preceding first stimulus (S1). Based on this idea, this study compared the effects of frequencies of first events (predictions or S1) on target-evoked P3s in prediction and comparison tasks. Indeed, frequencies not only of targets but also of first events had similar effects across tasks on target-evoked P3s. These results support the notion that P3 evoked by predicted stimuli reflects activation of appropriate internal "match" or "mismatch" responses, which is compatible with S/R-link hypothesis.

In the present study, two types of calculation tasks that varied in the required effort were adopted, and we resorted to electroencephalography to probe the temporal dynamics of how exerted effort would affect one's anticipation and evaluation of performance feedback. In the high-effort condition, a more salient stimulus-preceding negativity was detected during the anticipation stage, which was accompanied with a more salient FRN/P300 complex (a more positive P300 and a less negative feedback-related negativity) in response to positive outcomes in the evaluation stage. These results suggested that when more effort was invested, an enhanced anticipatory attention would be paid toward one's task performance feedback and that positive outcomes would be subjectively valued to a greater extent.

However, only a few studies examined how emotion and attention interact in voice processing. We investigated neutral, happy (laughs) and angry (growls) vocalizations in a modified oddball task. Participants silently counted the targets in each block and rated the valence and arousal of the vocalizations. A combined event-related potential and time-frequency analysis focused on the P3 and pre-stimulus alpha power to capture attention effects in response to unexpected events. Whereas an early differentiation between emotionally salient and neutral vocalizations was reflected in the P3a response, the P3b was selectively enhanced for happy voices. The P3b modulation was predicted by pre-stimulus frontal alpha desynchronization, and by the perceived pleasantness of the targets. These findings indicate that vocal emotions may be differently processed based on task relevance and valence. Increased anticipation and attention to positive vocal cues (laughter) may reflect their high social relevance.

Unfortunately, most of the existing automatic P300 detection schemes require computations over repetitive trials in both training and recognition phases. Several attempts have recently been endeavored towards the single trial detection of the P300 signals. However, no acceptable solution to the problem is found till date. In the present work, we have attempted to address this problem in the light of latency and (amplitude) deflection of the signal. The intra- and inter-personal variations inherent in these features are managed by the uncertainty management characteristics of General Type-2 Fuzzy Sets. First, these sets are constructed by exploiting the knowledge obtained from different trials of a large number of subjects. The secondary membership functions of the Type-2 Fuzzy Sets are computed based on a novel density dependent measure of the primary membership functions in the footprint of uncertainty. Second, recognition of P300 in an unknown EEG trial is performed based on the agreement of measured feature values with the General Type-2 Fuzzy knowledge-base. Majority voting of the concerned electrodes makes the scheme more robust. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of achieving 88.60% accuracy in single trial detection of P300 instances, which is significantly higher than those obtained in state of the art algorithms.

However, little is known about the role of spatial frequency information in emotion processing during infancy. In the present study, we examined the role of low compared to high spatial frequencies in the processing of happy and fearful facial expressions by using filtered face stimuli and measuring event-related brain potentials (ERPs) in 7-month-old infants (N = 26). Our results revealed that infants' brains discriminated between emotional facial expressions containing high but not between expressions containing low spatial frequencies. Specifically, happy faces containing high spatial frequencies elicited a smaller Nc amplitude than fearful faces containing high spatial frequencies and happy and fearful faces containing low spatial frequencies. Our results demonstrate that already in infancy spatial frequency content influences the processing of facial emotions. Furthermore, we observed that fearful facial expressions elicited a comparable Nc response for high and low spatial frequencies, suggesting a robust detection of fearful faces irrespective of spatial frequency content, whereas the detection of happy facial expressions was contingent upon frequency content. In summary, these data provide new insights into the neural processing of facial emotions in early development by highlighting the differential role played by spatial frequencies in the detection of fear and happiness.

Brain electrical activity signatures during performance of the Multisource Interference Task	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Multisource Interference Task; Cognitive control; EEG; Time-frequency; Theta	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; EEG; DYNAMICS; PHASE; ALPHA	The Multisource Interference Task (MSIT) was developed to test cognitive control in normal and pathological conditions and has become a reliable tool for exploring the integrity of cingulo-frontal-parietal cognitive/attentional networks in fMRI studies. Analysis of EEG recordings made during performance of the MSIT may provide additional information about the temporal dynamics of cognitive control. However, this has not yet been investigated in depth. In this study, we analyzed the ERPs and carried out time-frequency decomposition of EEG recorded during control and interference conditions of the MSIT. The N2 ERP component and midfrontal theta power (both considered neural signatures of conflict processing) were significantly larger in interference than in control trials. Theta also showed higher phase synchronization between midfrontal and right frontolateral scalp locations in the interference condition, supporting the view that this frequency band entrains additional brain resources when a need for greater control arises. In interference trials, we also observed longer P3 latency, larger P3 amplitude, and greater reduction of posterior alpha (modulations related to allocation of attentional resources), in addition to a greater reduction of central beta power (related to motor preparation). In conclusion, the MSIT reliably modulated brain electrical activity related to cognitive control and attention.

We explicitly addressed the differentiation between high and low performing elderly to identify electrophysiological correlates of successful aging. Therefore, ERP and behavioral data was obtained from 45 young (mean = 22.73 years) and 35 older participants (mean = 68.49 years). Both groups performed a visual-spatial n-back task with two levels of difficulty. Additionally, related neuropsychological tests were administered. Older subjects performed less accurately in both conditions of the n-back task. Older age was additionally associated with a reduced fronto-central positivity (labeled as P200) in the 2-back task and an overall reduced amplitude of the parietal positivity (labeled as P300). The latter shifted to frontal leads in older subjects. Additionally, only in the group of the older participants, increased P200 and decreased parietal P300 amplitudes correlated with performance. Regarding older high and low performers, we observed a clear shift of frontal activity of both ERP components in the group of high performers. High performers additionally performed better in spatial working memory, verbal learning, and fluid intelligence tasks. We conclude, that increasing demands of working memory load are accompanied by a reallocation of resources in both young and older adults. With age, executive control and updating processes (indexed by both ERP components) are diminished or rely on more frontal processes for compensation. However, high performing older adults, who perform comparable to young adults, sustain comparable executive control processes, exceeding pure compensation.

These differences are thought to affect timing of interhemispheric interactions and, in turn, functional hemispheric asymmetries. The present study aimed at elucidating the neuronal mechanisms underlying this relationship. To this end, we used a combined DTI and EEG study design. In 103 right-handed and healthy adult participants, we determined the microstructural integrity of the posterior third of the corpus callosum and examined in how far this micro-structural integrity was related to between-hemisphere timing differences in neurophysiological correlates of attentional processes in the dichotic listening task. The results show that microstructural integrity of the posterior callosal third correlated with attentional timing differences in a verbal dichotic listening condition but not in a noise control condition. Hence, this association between callosal microstructure and between-hemisphere timing differences is specific for stimuli, which trigger hemispheric bottom-up processing in an asymmetric fashion. Specifically, higher microstructural integrity was associated with decreased left-right differences in the latency of the N1 event-related potential component and hence more symmetric processing of dichotic stimuli between the two hemispheres. Our data suggest that microstructure of the posterior callosal third affects functional hemispheric asymmetries by modulating the timing of interhemispheric interactions.

ERPs and startle data were obtained from a published dataset wherein auditory startle stimuli were used as probes of pain processing (De Pascalis & Scacchia, 2016). We wanted to identify (1) sources of cortical current density changes associated with pain/distress reductions to placebo analgesia (PA) treatment, and (2) sources of activity changes that are predictors of the behavioural inhibition system (BIS) and fight/flight/freeze system (FFFS) of the revised Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (rRST). We administered three treatments: Baseline, CCT-alone (Pain), and CCT plus sham cream (Placebo). PA, as compared to Pain treatment, was effective in pain and distress reduction, and produced a significant current density reduction within right primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and left middle frontal gyrus (MFG). In addition, current density change in the right S1 was a positive predictor of subjective pain and distress reduction, although distress reduction was also associated with decreased activity in the left MFG. We failed to identify regional sources of placebo-related current density changes as predictors of the BIS and FFFS with the exception of current density changes within left MFG that was positively correlated with BIS and a significant predictor of this trait. Findings appear consistent with rRST predictions suggesting BIS and FFFS as separate, but interacting neurobehavioural systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstinence reverses EEG-indexed attention bias between drug-related and pleasant stimuli in cocaine-addicted individuals	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY & NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SMOKING CUES; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; HEROIN DEPENDENCE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; OPIATE ADDICTION; FMRI RESPONSES; SMOKERS; EMOTION; USERS; WITHDRAWAL	Background Increased attention bias toward drug-related cues over non-drug-related intrinsically pleasant reinforcers is a hallmark of drug addiction. In this study we used the late positive potential (LPP) to investigate whether such increased attention bias toward drug-related relative to non-drug-related cues changes over a protracted period of reduced drug use in treatment-seeking individuals with a cocaine use disorder (CUD). Methods Treatment-seeking individuals with CUD and matched healthy controls passively viewed a series of pleasant, neutral and drug-related pictures while their event-related potentials were recorded at baseline ( 3 weeks after treatment initiation) and at 6-month follow-up (only CUD). Results We included 19 treatment-seeking individuals with CUD and 18 matched controls in our analyses. The results showed a reversal in attention bias (i.e., LPP amplitude) from baseline (i.e., drug > pleasant) to follow-up (i.e., pleasant > drug) driven by an increased attentional engagement with pleasant pictures; this LPP reversal was paralleled by a concomitant reduction in self-reported wanting and craving for cocaine in the CUD group. Furthermore, reduced attention bias toward drug-related cues (relative to pleasant cues) was correlated with longer duration of abstinence at baseline, and the extent of its longitudinal reversal was correlated with decreased craving at follow-up, providing support for abstinence as a putative mechanism of this bottom-up attentional change. Limitations A limited sample size and the use of the same set of pictures at baseline and follow-up were the major limitations of this study. Conclusion Results collectively indicate that, by tracking with drug abstinence, LPP in response to drug-related relative to pleasant cues may serve as an indicator of clinical progress in treatment-seeking individuals with CUD.

In this paper, we propose and test a number of convolutional neural network (CNN) structures to identify and classify single-trial P300 in electroencephalogram (EEG) readings of an auditory BCI. The recorded data correspond to nine subjects in a series of experiment sessions in which auditory stimuli following the oddball paradigm were presented via earphones from six different virtual directions at time intervals of 200, 300, 400 and 500 ms. Using three different approaches for the pooling process, we report the average accuracy for 18 CNN structures. The results obtained for most of the CNN models show clear improvement over past studies in similar contexts, as well as over other commonly-used classifiers. We found that the models that consider data from the time and space domains and those that overlap in the pooling process usually offer better results regardless of the number of layers. Additionally, patterns of improvement with single-layered CNN models can be observed.

The Effects of Probe Similarity on Retrieval and Comparison Processes in Associative Recognition	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RECALL-TO-REJECT; LONG-TERM-MEMORY; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; EPISODIC MEMORY; FAMILIARITY; RECOLLECTION; INFORMATION; ACTIVATION; DISCOVERY	In this study, we investigated the information processing stages underlying associative recognition. We recorded EEG data while participants performed a task that involved deciding whether a probe word triple matched any previously studied triple. We varied the similarity between probes and studied triples. According to a model of associative recognition developed in the Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational cognitive architecture, probe similarity affects the duration of the retrieval stage: Retrieval is fastest when the probe is similar to a studied triple. This effect may be obscured, however, by the duration of the comparison stage, which is fastest when the probe is not similar to the retrieved triple. Owing to the opposing effects of probe similarity on retrieval and comparison, overall RTs provide little information about each stage's duration. As such, we evaluated the model using a novel approach that decomposes the EEG signal into a sequence of latent states and provides information about the durations of the underlying information processing stages. The approach uses a hidden semi-Markov model to identify brief sinusoidal peaks (called bumps) that mark the onsets of distinct cognitive stages. The analysis confirmed that probe type has opposite effects on retrieval and comparison stages.

Within this framework, the present study investigates the association of frontal cortical asymmetry with attentional and emotional responses toward approach- and withdrawal-related emotional stimuli. Resting frontal asymmetry was measured from 43 students before they passively viewed negative, neutral, and positive emotional pictures. The startle reflex, skin conductance response, and subjective ratings of valence and arousal were assessed to quantify emotional responding, while attention was assessed with ERPs. We also assessed frontal asymmetry in response to the pictures. Results indicated that relatively stronger right frontal cortical activation was associated with increased N1 amplitudes and more negative subjective emotional evaluation of all stimuli. Furthermore, enhanced right frontal asymmetry (state and trait) was associated with diminished emotional modulation of the late positive potential. In contrast, no association of frontal asymmetry with defensive reflex physiology or activation of sympathetic nervous system activity was found. The current data suggest dissociable influence of resting frontal brain asymmetry on attentional and physiological processing of withdrawal- and approach-related stimuli. That is, asymmetrical frontal cortical brain activation might not modulate approach-/withdrawal-related motor responses and sympathetic arousal directly, but instead enhances allocation of attentional resources to subjectively significant stimuli. The results are discussed in terms of their potential importance for emotion perception in anxiety disorders and their contribution to the understanding of frontal asymmetry.

Here, we aimed to identify the relationship between electroencephalographic (EEG) marker of spatial attention and reading ability in Chinese children with ADHD. First, we demonstrated that rapid automatized naming (RAN) is a strong predictor of reading ability in Chinese-speaking children. Then, EEG data of 9-to 15-year-old children with ADHD (n = 38) and typically developing (TD) controls (n = 36) were collected while the children performed a classical visual search task. Children with ADHD showed slower RAN speed than TD children. For event-related potentials (ERPs), children with ADHD showed a reduced target-evoked N2pc component, which predicted their poorer RAN performance. However, in TD children the early occipital P1 amplitude was negatively correlated with their RAN performance. The correlation between decreased N2pc and poor RAN performance in children with ADHD suggests that their reading problems may in part be due to impaired attentional selection. In contrast, in TD children, development in early visual processing co-occurs with improvements in reading ability.

For children with cochlear implants (CIs), auditory deprivation may hinder normal development of the auditory cortex, and the reference effect may be different between CIs and a normal developing group. Methods: Thirteen right-side-CI children were recruited, comprising 7 males and 6 females, ages 2-5 years, with CI usage of similar to 1 year. Eleven sex-and age-matched healthy children were recruited for normal controls; 1,000Hz pure tone evoked AEPs were recorded, and the data were re-referenced to NR, left mastoid reference (LMR, which is the opposite side of the implanted cochlear), MAR, and REST. CI artifact and P1-N1 complex (latency, amplitudes) at Fz were analyzed. Results: Confirmed P1-N1 complex could be found in Fz using NR, LMR, MAR, and REST with a 128-electrode scalp. P1 amplitude was larger using LMR than MAR and NR, while no statistically significant difference was found between NR and MAR in the CI group; REST had no significant difference with the three other references. In the control group, no statistically significant difference was found with different references. Group difference of P1 amplitude could be found when using MR, MAR, and REST. For P1 latency, no significant difference among the four references was shown, whether in the CI or control group. Group difference in P1 latency could be found in MR and MAR. N1 amplitude in LMR was significantly lower than NR and MAR in the control group. LMR, MAR, and REST could distinguish the difference in the N1 amplitude between the CI and control group. Contralateral MR or MAR was found to be better in differentiating CI children versus controls. No group difference was found for the artifact component. Conclusions: Different references for AEP studies do not affect the CI artifact. In addition, contralateral MR is preferable for P1-N1 component studies involving CI children, as well as methodology-like studies.

Researchers have argued that deficient control of self-and other-related motor representations (self-other distinction) might explain imitation difficulties. In a recent EEG study, we showed that control of imitation relies on high-level as well as on low-level cognitive processes. Here, we aimed to further our insights into control of imitation deficits in ASD. We focused on congruency effects in the P3 (high-level), the N190 and the readiness potential (RP; low-level). We predicted smaller congruency effects within the P3 in the ASD group. However, we found differences in the RP and not in the P3-component. Thus, high-level self-other distinction centred on motor actions may be preserved in ASD, while impairments are reflected during motor preparation.

J	Muckschel, M; Gohil, K; Ziemssen, T; Beste, C				Mueckschel, Moritz; Gohil, Krutika; Ziemssen, Tjalf; Beste, Christian			The norepinephrine system and its relevance for multi-component behavior	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Cognitive control; Sensorimotor integration; Executive function; EEG; Vegetative factors; Pupil; Source localization	VAGUS NERVE-STIMULATION; LOCUS-COERULEUS; GOAL ACTIVATION; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; ATTENTION SYSTEM; PUPIL DIAMETER; ADAPTIVE GAIN; STOP-SIGNAL; HUMAN BRAIN; MECHANISMS	The ability to execute several actions in a specific temporal order to achieve an overarching goal, a process often termed action cascading or multi-component behavior, is essential for everyday life requirements. We are only at the beginning to understand the neurobiological mechanisms important for these cognitive processes. However, it is likely that the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system may be of importance. In the current study we examine the relevance of the LC-NE system for action cascading processes using a system neurophysiological approach combining high-density EEG recordings and source localization to analyze event related potentials (ERPs) with recordings of pupil diameter as a proximate of LC-NE system activity. N=25 healthy participants performed an action cascading stop-change paradigm. Integrating ERPs and pupil diameter using Pearson correlations, the results show that the LC-NE system is important for processes related to multi component behavior. However, the LC-NE system does not seem to be important during the time period of response selection processes during multi-component behavior (reflected in the P3) as well as during perceptual and attentional selection (P1 and N1 ERPs). Rather, it seems that the neurophysiological processes in the fore period of a possibly upcoming imperative stimulus to initiate multi-component behavior are correlated with the LC-NE system. It seems that the LC-NE system facilitates responses to task-relevant processes and supports task-related decision and response selection processes by preparing cognitive control processes in case these are required during multi-component behavior rather than modulating these processes once they are operating.

It is a championship for severely motor impaired people using assistive prototype devices to compete against each other. Our team, the Graz BCI Racing Team MIRAGE91 from Graz University of Technology, participated in the discipline "Brain-Computer Interface Race". A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a device facilitating control of applications via the user's thoughts. Prominent applications include assistive technology such as wheelchairs, neuroprostheses or communication devices. In the CYBATHLON BCI Race, pilots compete in a BCI-controlled computer game. Methods: We report on setting up our team, the BCI customization to our pilot including long term training and the final BCI system. Furthermore, we describe CYBATHLON participation and analyze our CYBATHLON result. Results: We found that our pilot was compliant over the whole time and that we could significantly reduce the average runtime between start and finish from initially 178 s to 143 s. After the release of the final championship specifications with shorter track length, the average runtime converged to 120 s. We successfully participated in the qualification race at CYBATHLON 2016, but performed notably worse than during training, with a runtime of 196 s. Discussion: We speculate that shifts in the features, due to the nonstationarities in the electroencephalogram (EEG), but also arousal are possible reasons for the unexpected result. Potential counteracting measures are discussed. Conclusions: The CYBATHLON 2016 was a great opportunity for our student team. We consolidated our theoretical knowledge and turned it into practice, allowing our pilot to play a computer game. However, further research is required to make BCI technology invariant to non-task related changes of the EEG.

In everyday situations, there are many event features competing for our attention, and our ability to successfully recover those details may depend on our ability to ignore others. Failures of selective attention may contribute to older adults' context memory impairments. In the current electroencephalogram (EEG) study, we assessed the effects of age on processes supporting successful context memory retrieval of selectively attended features as indexed by neural oscillations. During encoding, young and older adults were directed to attend to a picture of an object and its relationship to one of two concurrently presented contextual details: a color or scene. At retrieval, we tested their memory for the object, its attended and unattended context features, and their confidence for both the attended and unattended features. Both groups showed greater memory for attended than unattended contextual features. However, older adults showed evidence of hyper-binding between attended and unattended context features while the young adults did not. EEG results in the theta band suggest that young and older adults recollect similar amounts of information but brain-behavior correlations suggest that this information was supportive of contextual memory performance, particularly for young adults. By contrast, sustained beta desynchronization, indicative of sensory reactivation and episodic reconstruction, was correlated with contextual memory performance for older adults only. We conclude that older adults' inhibition deficits during encoding reduced the selectivity of their contextual memories, which led to reliance on executive functions like episodic reconstruction to support successful memory retrieval.

J	Davis, JD; Winkielman, P; Coulson, S				Davis, Joshua D.; Winkielman, Piotr; Coulson, Seana			Sensorimotor simulation and emotion processing: Impairing facial action increases semantic retrieval demands	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Emotion; ERP; Embodied cognition	FACE PERCEPTION; RECOGNITION; EXPRESSIONS; MIMICRY; EMBODIMENT; LANGUAGE; JUDGMENTS; RESPONSES; CHILDREN; SMILES	Sensorimotor models suggest that understanding the emotional content of a face recruits a simulation process in which a viewer partially reproduces the facial expression in their own sensorimotor system. An important prediction of these models is that disrupting simulation should make emotion recognition more difficult. Here we used electroencephalogram (EEG) and facial electromyogram (EMG) to investigate how interfering with sensorimotor signals from the face influences the real-time processing of emotional faces. EEG and EMG were recorded as healthy adults viewed emotional faces and rated their valence. During control blocks, participants held a conjoined pair of chopsticks loosely between their lips. During interference blocks, participants held the chopsticks horizontally between their teeth and lips to generate motor noise on the lower part of the face. This noise was confirmed by EMG at the zygomaticus. Analysis of EEG indicated that faces expressing happiness or disgust-lower face expressions-elicited larger amplitude N400 when they were presented during the interference than the control blocks, suggesting interference led to greater semantic retrieval demands. The selective impact of facial motor interference on the brain response to lower face expressions supports sensorimotor models of emotion understanding.

During an imagined tactile sensation, referred to as somatosensory attentional orientation (SAO), the subject shifts and maintains somatosensory attention on a body part, e.g., left or right hand. The SAO can be detected from EEG recordings for establishing a communication channel. To test for the hypothesis that SAO on different body parts can be discriminated from EEG, 14 subjects were assigned to a group who received an actual sensory stimulation (STE-Group), and 18 subjects were assigned to the SAO only group (SAO-Group). In single trials, the STE-Group received tactile stimulation first (both wrists simultaneously stimulated), and then maintained the attention on the selected body part (without stimulation). The same group also performed the SAO task first and then received the tactile stimulation. Conversely, the SAO-Group performed SAO without any stimulation, neither before nor after the SAO. In both the STE-Group and SAO-Group, it was possible to identify the SAO-related oscillatory activation that corresponded to a contralateral event-related desynchronization (ERD) stronger than the ipsilateral ERD. Discriminative information, represented as R-2, was found mainly on the somatosensory area of the cortex. In the STE-Group, the average classification accuracy of SAO was 83.6%, and it was comparable with tactile BCI based on selective sensation (paired-t test, P > 0.05). In the SAO-Group the average online performancewas 75.7%. For this group, after frequency band selection the offline performance reached 82.5% on average, with >= 80% for 12 subjects and >= 95% for four subjects. Complementary to tactile sensation, the SAO does not require sensory stimulation, with the advantage of being completely independent from the stimulus.

Source-space EEG neurofeedback links subjective experience with brain activity during effortless awareness meditation	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Neurofeedback; EEG; Posterior cingulate cortex; PCC; Meditation; Mindfulness	DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; POSTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; METAANALYSIS; RESOLUTION; SELF; LOCALIZATION; PREVENTION	Background: Meditation is increasingly showing beneficial effects for psychiatric disorders. However, learning to meditate is not straightforward as there are no easily discernible outward signs of performance and thus no direct feedback is possible. As meditation has been found to correlate with posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) activity, we tested whether source-space EEG neurofeedback from the PCC followed the subjective experience of effortless awareness (a major component of meditation), and whether participants could volitionally control the signal. Methods: Sixteen novice meditators and sixteen experienced meditators participated in the study. Novice meditators were briefly trained to perform a basic meditation practice to induce the subjective experience of effortless awareness in a progressively more challenging neurofeedback test-battery. Experienced meditators performed a self-selected meditation practice to induce this state in the same test-battery. Neurofeedback was provided based on gamma-band (40-57 Hz) PCC activity extracted using a beamformer algorithm. Associations between PCC activity and the subjective experience of effortless awareness were assessed by verbal probes. Results: Both groups reported that decreased PCC activity corresponded with effortless awareness (P < 0.0025 for each group), with high median confidence ratings (novices: 8 on a 0-10 Likert scale; experienced: 9). Both groups showed high moment-to-moment median correspondence ratings between PCC activity and subjective experience of effortless awareness (novices: 8, experienced: 9). Both groups were able to volitionally control the PCC signal in the direction associated with effortless awareness by practicing effortless awareness meditation (novices: median % of time = 77.97, P = 0.001; experienced: 89.83, P < 0.0005). Conclusions: These findings support the feasibility of using EEG neurofeedback to link an objective measure of brain activity with the subjective experience of effortless awareness, and suggest potential utility of this paradigm as a tool for meditation training.

Despite this remarkable difference with other cortical areas, the influence of motor output and its amplitude on TEPs is largely unknown. Here we studied TEPs resulting from M1 stimulation and assessed whether their waveform and spectral features depend on the MEP amplitude. To this aim, we performed two separate experiments. In experiment 1, single-pulse TMS was applied at the same supra-threshold intensity on primary motor, prefrontal, premotor and parietal cortices and the corresponding TEPs were compared by means of local mean field power and time-frequency spectral analysis. In experiment 2 we stimulated M1 at resting motor threshold in order to elicit MEPs characterized by a wide range of amplitudes. TEPs computed from high-MEP and low-MEP trials were then compared using the same methods applied in experiment 1. In line with previous studies, TMS of M1 produced larger TEPs compared to other cortical stimulations. Notably, we found that only TEPs produced by M1 stimulation were accompanied by a late event-related desynchronization (ERD-peaking at similar to 300 ms after TMS), whose magnitude was strongly dependent on the amplitude of MEPs. Overall, these results suggest that M1 produces peculiar responses to TMS possibly reflecting specific anatomo-functional properties, such as the re-entry of proprioceptive feedback associated with target muscle activation.

For example, during Stroop-like tasks, the interference in response time (RT) is typically larger following congruent trials than following incongruent trials. This effect is called the Gratton effect, and has been taken to reflect top-down control adjustments based on the previous trial type. Such control adjustments have been studied extensively in Stroop and Eriksen flanker tasks (mostly using manual responses), but not in the picture word interference (PWI) task, which is a workhorse of language production research. In one of the few studies of the Gratton effect in PWI, Van Maanen and Van Rijn (2010) examined the effect in picture naming RTs during dual-task performance. Based on PWI effect differences between dual task conditions, they argued that the functional locus of the PWI effect differs between post-congruent trials (i.e., locus in perceptual and conceptual encoding) and post incongruent trials (i.e., locus in word planning). However, the dual-task procedure may have contaminated the results. We therefore performed an electroencephalography (EEG) study on the Gratton effect in a regular PWI task. We observed a PWI effect in the RTs, in the N400 component of the event-related brain potentials, and in the midfrontal theta power, regardless of the previous trial type. Moreover, the RTs, N400, and theta power reflected the Gratton effect. These results provide evidence that the PWI effect arises at the word planning stage following both congruent and incongruent trials, while the amount of top-down control changes depending on the previous trial type.

All participants were presented with two neutral and six fear-related blocks of pictures: two social, two spider and two blood/injection fear blocks. In a social fear block neutral images were occasionally interspersed with photographs of angry faces and social exposure scenes. In spider and blood/injection fear blocks neutral pictures were interspersed with spider fear-relevant and blood/injection pictures, respectively. When compared to healthy controls the social fear group responded with increased activations in the anterior orbital, middle/anterior cingulate and middle/superior temporal areas for pictures depicting angry faces and with a few elevated superior frontal activations for social exposure scenes. In the blood/injection fear group, heart rate was decreased and the activity in the middle/inferior frontal and visual processing regions was increased for blood/injection pictures. The HR decrease for blood/injection pictures correlated with increased frontal responses. In the spider fear group, spider fear-relevant pictures triggered increased activations within a broad subcortical and cortical neural fear network. The HR response for spider fear-relevant stimuli was increased and correlated with an increased insula and hippocampus activity. When compared to healthy controls, all fear groups showed higher LPP amplitudes for their feared cues and an overall greater P1 hypervigilance effect. Contrasts against the fear control groups showed that the increased responses for fear-specific stimuli are mostly related to specific fears and not to general anxiety proneness. The results suggest different engagement of cognitive evaluation and down-regulation strategies and an overall increased sensitization of the fear system in the three fear groups.

We compared processing of salient stimuli (subject's own names [SONS] and angry voice [AV] stimuli) to processing of unfamiliar names (UNs) and neutral voice (NV) stimuli across different vigilance stages (i.e. wakefulness as well as sleep stages N1 and N2) by means of event-related oscillatory responses during wakefulness and a subsequent afternoon nap. Our findings suggest that emotional prosody and self-relevance drew more attentional resources during wakefulness with specifically AV stimuli being processed more strongly. During NI, SONs were more arousing than UNs irrespective of prosody. Moreover, emotional and self-relevant stimuli evoked stronger responses also during N2 sleep suggesting a 'sentinel processing mode' of the brain during this state of naturally occurring unconsciousness. Finally, this initial preferential processing of salient stimuli during N2 sleep seems to be followed by an inhibitory sleep-protecting process, which is reflected by a K-complex-like response.

The oddball paradigm has repeatedly been used to explore the underlying cognitive and neurophysiological components of change detection. It is also used to investigate the special role of emotional content in perception and attention (emotional oddball paradigm; EOP). In this article, the EOP is systematically reviewed. The EOP is, for instance, used as a tool to address questions as to what degree emotional deviant stimuli trigger orientation reactions, which role the emotional context plays in the processing of deviant information, and how the processing of emotional deviant information differs interindividually (including clinical populations). Two main variants with regard to the emotionality of standards and deviants are defined. Most of the identified EOP studies report EEG data but an overview of behavioral data is also provided in this review. We integrate evidence from 99 EOP experiments and shape the EOP's theoretical background under the consideration of other paradigms' mechanisms and theories.

There is growing evidence that it provides a useful objective measure of electrode discrimination in cochlear implant (CI) users. To date, the spatial ACC has only been measured in relatively experienced CI users with one type of device. Early assessment of electrode discrimination could allow auditory stimulation to be optimized during a potentially sensitive period of auditory rehabilitation. In this study we used a direct stimulation paradigm to measure the spatial ACC in both pre- and post-lingually deafened adults. We show that it is feasible to measure the spatial ACC in different CI devices and as early as 1 week after CI switch-on. The spatial ACC has a strong relationship with performance on a behavioural discrimination task and in some cases provides information over and above behavioural testing. We suggest that it may be useful to measure the spatial ACC to guide auditory rehabilitation and improve hearing performance in CI users. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study studied the BCI system that was based on the left-right hand motion imagination (MI) from the offline analysis and online application. First of all, we designed a MI brain-computer interface (BCI) experimental paradigm with visual cues, and collected the EEG signal of the left-right hand MI in offline experiment, of which the average classification accuracy was 69.14% after analyzed. Secondly, five able-bodied subjects executed two online sessions individually, of which the average classification accuracy was 64.5% and 66.2%, respectively. The characteristics of features are mainly in the Mu (8-13Hz) and Beta (14-30Hz) frequency band with the channels of FC3, FC4, C3, C4, CP3 and CP4. Finally, we designed a new protocol to extract the error-related potentials (ErrPs). Furthermore, we also analyzed follow-up study plans that extract the ErrPs signal online in real-time used for cancelling the error command sent by BCI.

Posterior alpha EEG Dynamics Dissociate Current from Future Goals in Working Memory-Guided Visual Search	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; priority; selective attention; states; visual search template; visual working memory	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; RETRO-CUEING PARADIGM; SPATIAL ATTENTION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; NEURAL MECHANISMS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; INHIBITION; CORTEX	Current models of visual search assume that search is guided by an active visual working memory representation of what we are currently looking for. This attentional template for currently relevant stimuli can be dissociated from accessory memory representations that are only needed prospectively, for a future task, and that should be prevented from guiding current attention. However, it remains unclear what electrophysiological mechanisms dissociate currently relevant (serving upcoming selection) from prospectively relevant memories (serving future selection). We measured EEG of 20 human subjects while they performed two consecutive visual search tasks. Before the search tasks, a cue instructed observers which item to look for first (current template) and which second (prospective template). During the delay leading up to the first search display, we found clear suppression of alpha band (8-14 Hz) activity in regions contralateral to remembered items, comprising both local power and interregional phase synchronization within a posterior parietal network. Importantly, these lateralization effects were stronger when the memory item was currently relevant (i.e., for the first search) compared with when it was prospectively relevant (i.e., for the second search), consistent with current templates being prioritized over future templates. In contrast, event-related potential analysis revealed that the contralateral delay activity was similar for all conditions, suggesting no difference in storage. Together, these findings support the idea that posterior alpha oscillations represent a state of increased processing or excitability in task-relevant cortical regions, and reflect enhanced cortical prioritization of memory representations that serve as a current selection filter.

At the cortical level, the superior frontal gyrus, including the supplementary motor area (SMA) and inferior frontal areas, is important. There is an ongoing debate about the functional roles of these structures during response inhibition as it is unclear whether these structures process different codes or contents of information during response inhibition. In the current study, we examined this question with a focus on theta frequency oscillations during response inhibition processes. We used a standard Go/Nogo task in a sample of human participants and combined different EEG signal decomposition methods with EEG beamforming approaches. The results suggest that stimulus coding during inhibitory control is attained by oscillations in the upper theta frequency band (similar to 7 Hz). In contrast, response selection codes during inhibitory control appear to be attained by the lower theta frequency band (similar to 4 Hz). Importantly, these different codes seem to be processed in distinct functional neuroanatomical structures. Although the SMA may process stimulus codes and response selection codes, the inferior frontal cortex may selectively process response selection codes during inhibitory control. Taken together, the results suggest that different entities within the functional neuroanatomical network associated with response inhibition mechanisms process different kinds of codes during inhibitory control. These codes seem to be reflected by different oscillations within the theta frequency band. (C) 2017 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Disentangling conscious from unconscious cognitive processing with event-related EEG potentials	REVUE NEUROLOGIQUE			English	Article						Consciousness; Consciousness disorders; Unconscious; Semantics; ERPs; MMN; P300; N400; P600	COMPLEX SOUND SEQUENCES; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; VEGETATIVE STATE; NEURAL RESPONSES; DISORDERS; AWARENESS; N400; ATTENTION; COMPONENT; MEMORY	By looking for properties of consciousness, cognitive neuroscience studies have dramatically enlarged the scope of unconscious cognitive processing. This emerging knowledge inspired the development of new approaches allowing clinicians to probe and disentangle conscious from unconscious cognitive processes in non-communicating brain-injured patients both in terms of behaviour and brain activity. This information is extremely valuable in order to improve diagnosis and prognosis in such patients both at acute and chronic settings. Reciprocally, the growing observations coming from such patients suffering from disorders of consciousness provide valuable constraints to theoretical models of consciousness. In this review we chose to illustrate these recent developments by focusing on brain signals recorded with EEG at bedside in response to auditory stimuli. More precisely, we present the respective EEG markers of unconscious and conscious processing of two classes of auditory stimuli (sounds and words). We show that in both cases, conscious access to the corresponding representation (e.g.: auditory regularity and verbal semantic content) share a similar neural signature (P3b and P600/LPC) that can be distinguished from unconscious processing occurring during an earlier stage (MMN and N400). We propose a two-stage serial model of processing and discuss how unconscious and conscious signatures can be measured at bedside providing relevant informations for both diagnosis and prognosis of consciousness recovery. These two examples emphasize how fruitful can be the bidirectional approach exploring cognition in healthy subjects and in brain-damaged patients. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The neural basis of responsive caregiving behaviour: Investigating temporal dynamics within the parental brain	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Parenting; Infant; Magnetoencephalography; Electroencephalography; Orbitofrontal cortex; Periaqueductal gray	INFANT FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MATERNAL BRAIN; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; SEX-DIFFERENCES; PERIAQUEDUCTAL GRAY; AMYGDALA RESPONSE; DISTRESS SIGNALS; YOUNG INFANTS; SOCIAL BRAIN	Whether it is the sound of a distressed cry or the image of a cute face, infants capture our attention. Parents and other adults alike are drawn into interactions to engage in play, nurturance and provide care. Responsive caregiving behaviour is a key feature of the parent-infant relationship, forming the foundation upon which attachment is built. Infant cues are considered to be 'innate releasers' or 'motivational entities' eliciting responses in nearby adults (Lorenz 1943; Murray, 1979) [42,43]. Through the advent of modern neuroimaging, we are beginning to understand the initiation of this motivational state at the neurobiological level. In this review, we first describe a current model of the 'parental brain', based on functional MRI studies assessing neural responses to infant cues. Next, we discuss recent findings from temporally sensitive techniques (magneto- and electroencephalography) that illuminate the temporal dynamics of this neural network. We focus on converging evidence highlighting a specific role for the orbitofrontal cortex in supporting rapid orienting responses to infant cues. In addition, we consider to what extent these neural processes are tied to parenthood, or whether they might be present universally in all adults. We highlight important avenues for future research, including utilizing multiple levels of analysis for a comprehensive understanding of adaptive caregiving behaviour. Finally, we discuss how this research can help us understand disrupted parent-infant relationships, such as in situations where parents' contingent responding to infant cues is disrupted; for example, in parental depression or anxiety where cognitive attentional processes are disrupted.

However, the strong spatial correlations from background spontaneous activity might mask the local evoked activity and lead to spurious connectivity results in connectivity analysis for event-related EEG and MEG. In this paper, we applied normalized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) preprocessing, Minimum Norm Estimation (MNE) and Granger causal connectivity analysis to identify stimulus-elicited neural sources and measure the effective connectivity among the sources for left somatosensory MEG responses of five healthy subjects. After normalized PCA preprocessing our results demonstrated increased coherences between channels with somatosensory evoked response at major physiological frequency bands, including Alpha and Beta band for somatosensory evoked response. The sources were located at contralateral primary somatosensory cortex, contralateral secondary somatosensory cortex and cingulate cortex. The information flow was processed through a complex pattern of both feedforward and feedback interactions between the sources. Compare with the results without normalized PCA preprocessing, our results are consistent with established connections between somatosensory regions and previous source modeling studies, which provides validation of the proposed approach.

Role of N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors in Action-Based Predictive Coding Deficits in Schizophrenia	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Ketamine; N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor; Predictive coding; Schizophrenia; Speech motor control	COROLLARY DISCHARGE DYSFUNCTION; AUDITORY SENSORY MEMORY; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY GENERATION; SUBUNIT GENE GRIN2B; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; SPEECH PRODUCTION; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; COGNITIVE DEFICITS; PSYCHOTIC SYMPTOMS	BACKGROUND: Recent theoretical models of schizophrenia posit that dysfunction of the neural mechanisms subserving predictive coding contributes to symptoms and cognitive deficits, and this dysfunction is further posited to result from N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction. Previously, by examining auditory cortical responses to self-generated speech sounds, we demonstrated that predictive coding during vocalization is disrupted in schizophrenia. To test the hypothesized contribution of NMDAR hypofunction to this disruption, we examined the effects of the NMDAR antagonist, ketamine, on predictive coding during vocalization in healthy volunteers and compared them with the effects of schizophrenia. METHODS: In two separate studies, the N1 component of the event-related potential elicited by speech sounds during vocalization (talk) and passive playback(listen) were compared to assess the degree of N1 suppression during vocalization, a putative measure of auditory predictive coding. In the crossover study, 31 healthy volunteers completed two randomly ordered test days, a saline day and a ketamine day. Event- related potentials during the talk/ listen task were obtained before infusion and during infusion on both days, and N1 amplitudes were compared across days. In the case- control study, N1 amplitudes from 34 schizophrenia patients and 33 healthy control volunteers were compared. RESULTS: N1 suppression to self produced vocalizations was significantly and similarly diminished by ketamine (Cohen's d= 1.14) and schizophrenia(Cohen's d=.85). CONCLUSIONS: Disruption of NMDARs causes dysfunction in predictive coding during vocalization in a manner similar to the dysfunction observed in schizophrenia patients, consistent with the theorized contribution of NMDAR hypofunction to predictive coding deficits in schizophrenia.

Combined in Vivo Amperometric Oximetry and Electrophysiology in a Single Sensor: A Tool for Epilepsy Research	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; TISSUE OXYGENATION; MICROELECTRODE ARRAYS; CEREBRAL OXYGENATION; PATIENT SELECTION; PARTIAL-PRESSURE; NITRIC-OXIDE; EEG-FMRI; BRAIN; HYPOXIA	Seizures are paroxysmal events in which increased neuronal activity is accompanied by an increase in localized energetic demand. The ability to simultaneously record electrical and chemical events using a single sensor poses a promising approach to identify seizure onset zones in the brain. In the present work, we used ceramic-based platinum microelectrode arrays (MEAs) to perform high-frequency amperometric recording of local pO(2) and local field potential (LFP)-related currents during seizures in the hippocampus of chronically implanted freely moving rats. Resting levels of O-2 in the rodent brain varied between 6.6 +/- 0.7 mu M in the dentate gyrus (DG) region of the Hippocampus hippocampus and 22.1 +/- 4.9 mu M in the cerebral cortex. We also observed an expected increase in hippocampal pO(2) (15 +/- 4% from baseline) in response to tail pinch stress paradigm. Finally, induction of status epilepticus by intrahippocampal injection of pilocarpine induced biphasic changes in PO, in the hippocampus. The initial dip at seizure onset (Delta O-2 = -4.5 +/- 0.7 mu M) was followed by a prolonged hyperoxygenation phase (Delta O-2 = +10.4 +/- 2.9 mu M). By acquiring the amperometry signal with a high sampling rate of 100 Hz we decomposed the raw signal in an oximetry recording (<1 Hz) and LFP recording (>1 Hz), demonstrating that each individual Pt site can simultaneously report changes in local pO(2) and LFP-related currents during pilocarpine-induced seizure activity. This has high potential for translation into the clinical setting supported on intracranial grid or strip electrodes.

Evidence for a Priori Existence of Attentional Bias Subgroups in Emotional Processing of Aversive Stimuli	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention; EEG; attentional bias; dot probe; behavior; avoidance; hypervigilance	PAIN-RELATED INFORMATION; CHRONIC MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN; LOW-BACK-PAIN; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; ANXIETY SENSITIVITY; SPATIAL ATTENTION; HYPERVIGILANCE; BRAIN; AVOIDANCE; THREAT	Little is known regarding inter-individual differences in attentional biases for pain-related information; more knowledge is crucial, since these biases have been associated with differences in pain processing as well as in predicting the risk of postoperative pain. The present study investigated EEG correlates of attentional bias patterns for pain-related information, with specific focus on avoidance-and vigilance-like behavior. Forty-one participants performed a dot-probe task, where neutral and pain-related words were used to create neutral, congruent, incongruent, and double (two pain-related words) trials. EEG was recorded, which was used to generate ERP's of the word-processing phase and the post-dot phase. Participants were placed in two subgroups based on the direction of their attentional bias (either positive; toward the pain-related words, or negative; away from pain-related words). Using t-profiles, four latency windows were identified on which the two subgroups differed significantly. These latency windows yield areas which correspond with the P1-N1 domain and the P3b for the word-processing phase, while the post-dot phase latency windows cover the areas of the P200 and the P3b. The two subgroups show differences on congruent, incongruent, and the double trials, but interestingly also on the neutral trials. Most notably, the area in the word-phase associated with the P3b is diminished in the subgroup showing a negative bias. The deflections associated with both early and late attentional components, including the P3B, as well as a positive deflection in the timeframe of proposed response evaluation processes differ significantly between subgroups. In this study we demonstrated that different attentional biases exist in the healthy population, by showing differences in ERP's. We also show differences in processing neutral trials, which suggests there are fundamental differences between these groups in processing words in general.

Human participants made speeded saccades to targets that were presented alongside salient distractors. By subsequently sorting trials based on whether the distractor was strongly represented or suppressed by the visual system - as evident in the accuracy (Exp. 1) or quality of the saccade (Exp. 2) - we could characterize and contrast pre-saccadic neural activity as a function of whether oculomotor control was established. Results show that saccadic behavior is strongly linked to the operation of attentional mechanisms in visual cortex. In Experiment 1, accurate saccades were preceded by attentional selection of the target - indexed by a target-elicited N2pc component - and by attentional suppression of the distractor - indexed by early and late distractor-elicited distractor positivity (Pd) components. In Experiment 2, the strength of distractor suppression predicted the degree to which the path of slower saccades would deviate away from the distractor en route to the target. However, results also demonstrated clear dissociations of covert and overt selective control, with saccadic latency in particular showing no relationship to the latency of covert selective mechanisms. Eye movements could thus be initiated prior to the onset of attentional ERP components, resulting in stimulus-driven behaviour. Taken together, the results indicate that attentional mechanisms play a role in determining saccadic behavior, but that saccade timing is not contingent on the deployment of attention. This creates a temporal dependency, whereby attention fosters oculomotor control only when attentional mechanisms are given sufficient opportunity to impact stimuli representations before an eye movement is executed.

Yet for speech perception, the degree to which listeners utilize experience derived from speech production has long been debated. In the present study, we examined how sensorimotor adaptation during production may affect perception, and how this relationship may be reflected in early vs. late electrophysiological responses. Participants first performed a baseline speech production task, followed by a vowel categorization task during which EEG responses were recorded. In a subsequent speech production task, half the participants received shifted auditory feedback, leading most to alter their articulations. This was followed by a second, post-training vowel categorization task. We compared changes in vowel production to both behavioral and electrophysiological changes in vowel perception. No differences in phonetic categorization were observed between groups receiving altered or unaltered feedback. However, exploratory analyses revealed correlations between vocal motor behavior and phonetic categorization. EEG analyses revealed correlations between vocal motor behavior and cortical responses in both early and late time windows. These results suggest that participants' recent production behavior influenced subsequent vowel perception. We suggest that the change in perception can be best characterized as a mapping of acoustics onto articulation.

Here, electroencephalogram recordings of older (aged 62-87 years) and younger (aged 20-32 years) adults were recorded during a working memory task. Each trial contained 2 faces and 2 scenes presented sequentially, followed by a 5-second delay and a probe stimulus. Participants were told what stimuli to remember/ignore and when they would appear. Predictive cues enabled older adults to remember stimuli as accurately as younger adults, although response times were significantly slower, even when corrected for general age-related slowing. Previously observed reductions in P1/N1 amplitude and latency suppression to irrelevant stimuli were not seen. Rather, older adults exhibited lowered P3 amplitudes to relevant stimuli; those with the greatest declines yielded the lowest accuracy and slowest response times. This shows that predictive information can help maintain accuracy, although not response times, which correspond to age-related declines in neural enhancement to relevant stimuli.

However, different aspects of information are simultaneously processed at any given moment. This raises the question of whether the norepinephrine system is also capable of specifically modulating selected aspects of all ongoing information processing, especially when several of those processes are carried out by the same functional neuroanatomical structure at the same time. We examine this question in humans using a flanker paradigm by integrating neurophysiological (EEG) and pupil diameter data using novel signal processing techniques including Residue Iteration Decomposition (RIDE) and source localization. We show that during conflict monitoring, motor response-related processes are more strongly modulated by the NE system than stimulus-related processes or central decision processes between stimulus and response. This was the case even though these processes occurred at the same time point and were mediated by overlapping medial frontal cortical structures. The results indicate that the NE system exerts specific modulatory effects for different informational contents that are simultaneously processed in the medial frontal cortex.

This phenomenonknown as distractor-induced blindnesshas thus far only been elicited using dynamic visual features, such as motion and orientation changes. In three ERP experiments, we used a visual object featurecolorto test for the adaptability and specificity of the effect. In Experiment I, participants responded to a color change (target) in the periphery whose onset was signaled by a central cue. Presentation of irrelevant color changes prior to the cue (distractors) led to reduced target detection, accompanied by a frontal ERP negativity that increased with increasing number of distractors, similar to the effects previously found for dynamic targets. This suggests that distractor-induced blindness is adaptable to color features. In Experiment II, the target consisted of coherent motion contrasting the color distractors. Correlates of distractor-induced blindness were found neither in the behavioral nor in the ERP data, indicating a feature specificity of the process. Experiment III confirmed the strict distinction between congruent and incongruent distractors: A single color distractor was embedded in a stream of motion distractors with the target consisting of a coherent motion. While behavioral performance was affected by the distractors, the color distractor did not elicit a frontal negativity. The experiments show that distractor-induced blindness is also triggered by visual stimuli predominantly processed in the ventral stream. The strict specificity of the central inhibition process also applies to these stimulus features.

Neural measures reveal lower social conformity among non-religious individuals	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						religion; social conformity; late positive potential; EEG/ERP	BRAIN POTENTIALS; PERCEPTION; EVOLUTION; BEAUTY	Even in predominantly religious societies, there are substantial individual differences in religious commitment. Why is this? One possibility is that differences in social conformity (i.e. the tendency to think and behave as others do) underlie inclination towards religiosity. However, the link between religiosity and conformity has not yet been directly examined. In this study, we tested the notion that non-religious individuals show dampened social conformity, using both self-reported and neural (EEG-based ERPs) measures of sensitivity to others' influence. Non-religious vs religious undergraduate subjects completed an experimental task that assessed levels of conformity in a domain unrelated to religion (i.e. in judgments of facial attractiveness). Findings showed that, although both groups yielded to conformity pressures at the self-report level, non-religious individuals did not yield to such pressures in their neural responses. These findings highlight a novel link between religiosity and social conformity, and hold implications for prominent theories about the psychological functions of religion.

In two experiments similar to the multiple object tracking (MOT) task, we asked observers to monitor continuously one or several targets as they moved unpredictably for a semi-random period. After all objects disappeared, observers were immediately prompted to report the perceived final position of one queried target. Precision of these position reports declined with attentional load, and reports tended to best resemble positions occupied by the queried target between 0 and 30 ms in the past. Measurement of event-related potentials showed a contralateral delay activity over occipital scalp, maximal in the right hemisphere. The peak power-spectral frequency of observers' eyes-closed resting occipital alpha oscillations reliably predicted performance, such that lower-frequency alpha was associated with superior spatial localisation. Slower resting alpha might be associated with a cognitive style that depends less on memory related processing and instead emphasises attention to changing stimuli.

Hyperscanning applications to neuromanagement	NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL TRENDS			English	Article						Management; Hyperscanning technique; Leadership; Communicative style	EMOTIONAL FACE RECOGNITION; EEG; BEHAVIOR; LATERALIZATION; PERCEPTION; LEADERSHIP; ELECTRODE; SYSTEMS; ERP	Neuromanagement deals with neuroscience methodological approaches to the management. A management construct is leadership, but objective psychophysiological data in support of it are still missing. The present pilot study aimed to apply the hyperscanning paradigm during a role-played employees' evaluation. Our purpose was to identify lexical and neuro/psychophysiological markers of leader-employee interactions. The sample consisted in paired manager-collaborator couples. Managers were required to use two different communication styles: authoritative vs. cooperative. A conversational analysis permitted to identify main topics to interpret data. Results showed that the interview was more arousing for the employee than the manager. Greater Delta and Theta EEG bands could denote positive valence of personal interactions and company mission topics. Autonomic measures (Skin Conductance Response, SCR and Heart Rate, HR) showed important information related to different leadership style. Results highlight the importance of applying neurosciences to organizational contexts exploring processes related to manager-employee dynamics and communicative style.

Current literature suggests that psychophysical discrimination of odour enantiomers mainly depends on the peripheral processing at the level of the olfactory sensory neurons (OSN). To study the influence of central processing in discrimination, we investigated differences in the electrophysiological responses to psychophysically indistinguishable (+)- and (-)- rose oxide enantiomers at peripheral and central-nervous levels in humans. We recorded the electro-olfactogram (EOG) from the olfactory epithelium and the EEG-derived olfactory event-related potentials (OERP). Results from a psychophysical three alternative forced choice test indicated indistinguishability of the two odour enantiomers. In a total of 19 young participants EOG could be recorded in 74 and OERP in 95% of subjects. Significantly different EOG amplitudes and latencies were recorded in response to the 2 stimuli. However, no such differences in amplitude or latency emerged for the OERP. In conclusion, although the pair of enantiomer could be discriminated at a peripheral level this did not lead to a central-nervous/cognitive differentiation of the two stimuli.

Earlier work has shown that speech planning processes are reflected in speakers' eye movements as they describe visually presented objects. However, to-be-named objects can be processed to some extent before they have been fixated upon, presumably because attention can be allocated to objects covertly, without moving the eyes. The present study investigated whether EEG could track speakers' covert attention allocation as they produced short utterances to describe pairs of objects (e.g., "dog and chair"). The processing difficulty of each object was varied by presenting it in upright orientation (easy) or in upside down orientation (difficult). Background squares flickered at different frequencies in order to elicit steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs). The N2pc component, associated with the focusing of attention on an item, was detectable not only prior to speech onset, but also during speaking. The time course of the N2pc showed that attention shifted to each object in the order of mention prior to speech onset. Furthermore, greater processing difficulty increased the time speakers spent attending to each object. This demonstrates that the N2pc can track covert attention allocation in a naming task. In addition, an effect of processing difficulty at around 200-350 ms after stimulus onset revealed early attention allocation to the second to-be-named object. The flickering backgrounds elicited SSVEPs, but SSVEP amplitude was not influenced by processing difficulty. These results help complete the picture of the coordination of visual information uptake and motor output during speaking.

It has however remained unclear whether self-referred decisions truly impair behavioral control even in seemingly unrelated cognitive domains, and which neurophysiological mechanisms are affected by these potential depletion effects. In the current study, we therefore used an inter-individual design to compare two kinds of depletion, namely a self-referred choice-based depletion and a categorization-based switching depletion, to a non-depleted control group. We used a backward inhibition (BI) paradigm to assess the effects of depletion on task switching and associated inhibition processes. It was combined with EEG and source localization techniques to assess both behavioral and neurophysiological depletion effects. The results challenge the ego depletion theory in its current form: Opposing the theory's prediction of a general limited resource, which should have yielded comparable effects in both depletion groups, or maybe even a larger depletion in the self-referred choice group, there were stronger performance impairments following a task domain-specific depletion (i.e., the switching-based depletion) than following a depletion based on self-referred choices. This suggests at least partly separate and independent resources for various cognitive control processes rather than just one joint resource for all self-regulation activities. The implications are crucial to consider for people making frequent far-reaching decisions e.g., in law or economy.

The study of empathetic-pain perception and empathy were always related with psychological disorder effecting social and humanity values. The process involved in empathetic-pain perception formations in brain were believed to be different if induced by different level of empathetic-pain perception stimuli. Therefore, this paper was aimed to study the processes involved in empathetic-pain perception formation by revealing the activation-time intervals and source location of the highest empathetic-pain perception intensity. This study conducted an experiment to induce empathetic-pain perception on 16 participants using still pictures as visual-stimuli. Electroencephalograph (EEG) recorded brain signal of the participants during the visual-stimuli presentations while the EEG signal were analysed using MATLAB (R) toolbox, EEGLAB. Time/frequency decomposition in EEGLAB produces ERSP images which determines the activation-time intervals for empathetic-pain perception and, by performing source localization within the activation-time intervals using sLORETA, the source locations for most active processes in empathetic-pain perception were determined.

Neural Correlates of Response Inhibition in Early Childhood: Evidence From a Go/No-Go Task	DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; FRONTAL-LOBE; CHILDREN; BRAIN; ERP; ABILITY; N2; PERFORMANCE; ACTIVATION	We examined the neural correlates underlying response inhibition in early childhood. Five-year-old children completed a Go/No-go task with or without time pressure (Fast vs. Slow condition) while scalp EEG was recorded. On No-go trials where inhibition was required, the left frontal N2 and posterior P3 were enhanced relative to Go trials. Time pressure was detrimental to behavioral performance and modulated the early-occurring P1 component. The topography of ERPs related to response inhibition differed from patterns typically seen in adults, and may indicate a compensatory mechanism to make up for immature inhibition networks in children.

The neural bases of the synchronization ability remain unknown, even in the simpler, paradigmatic task of finger tapping to a metronome. In this task the subject is instructed to tap in synchrony with a periodic sequence of brief tones, and the time difference between each response and the corresponding stimulus tone (asynchrony) is recorded. We make a step towards the identification of the neurophysiological markers of SMS by recording high-density EEG event-related potentials and the concurrent behavioral response-stimulus asynchronies during an isochronous paced finger-tapping task. Using principal component analysis, we found an asymmetry between the traces for advanced and delayed responses to the stimulus, in accordance with previous behavioral observations from perturbation studies. We also found that the amplitude of the second component encodes the higher-level percept of asynchrony 100 ms after the current stimulus. Furthermore, its amplitude predicts the asynchrony of the next step, past 300 ms from the previous stimulus, independently of the period length. Moreover, the neurophysiological processing of synchronization errors is performed within a fixed-duration interval after the stimulus. Our results suggest that the correction of a large asynchrony in a periodic task and the recovery of synchrony after a perturbation could be driven by similar neural processes.

More recent studies demonstrated that these impairments are enhanced for speech stimuli with negative content. Nonetheless, few studies probed the temporal dynamics of self versus nonself speech processing in schizophrenia and, particularly, the impact of semantic valence on self-other voice discrimination. In the current study, we examined these questions, and additionally probed whether impairments in these processes are associated with the experience of hallucinations. Fifteen schizophrenia patients and 16 healthy controls listened to 420 prerecorded adjectives differing in voice identity (self-generated [SGS] versus nonself speech [NSS]) and semantic valence (neutral, positive, and negative), while EEG data were recorded. The N1, P2, and late positive potential (LPP) ERP components were analyzed. ERP results revealed group differences in the interaction between voice identity and valence in the P2 and LPP components. Specifically, LPP amplitude was reduced in patients compared with healthy subjects for SGS and NSS with negative content. Further, auditory hallucinations severity was significantly predicted by LPP amplitude: the higher the SAPS voices conversing score, the larger the difference in LPP amplitude between negative and positive NSS. The absence of group differences in the N1 suggests that self-other voice processing abnormalities in schizophrenia are not primarily driven by disrupted sensory processing of voice acoustic information. The association between LPP amplitude and hallucination severity suggests that auditory hallucinations are associated with enhanced sustained attention to negative cues conveyed by a nonself voice.

However, its effect on performance monitoring and reward prediction errors remain unclear. To examine this issue, we used a standard mood induction procedure (based on guided imagery) and asked 45 participants to complete a gambling task suited to study reward prediction errors by means of the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and mid-frontal theta band power. Results showed a larger FRN for negative feedback as well as a lack of reward expectation modulation for positive feedback at the theta level with positive mood, relative to a neutral mood condition. A control analysis showed that this latter result could not be explained by the mere superposition of the event-related brain potential component on the theta oscillations. Moreover, these neurophysiological effects were evidenced in the absence of impairments at the behavioral level or increase in autonomic arousal with positive mood, suggesting that this mood state reliably altered brain mechanisms of reward prediction errors during performance monitoring. We interpret these new results as reflecting a genuine mood congruency effect, whereby reward is anticipated as the default outcome with positive mood and therefore processed as unsurprising (even when it is unlikely), while negative feedback is perceived as unexpected.

The present study tested whether the N400 elicited by isolated words and pseudowords was modulated by task instructions thus reflecting controlled processing of linguistic information. In two language discrimination tasks, Finnish adults with English as their second language detected either Finnish or English nouns in a list of Finnish and English words and pseudowords. The same set of stimuli, presented in a random order, was used for both tasks. The amplitudes of both the evoked potentials and their magnetic counterparts were task-language dependent. In both tasks, task-language pseudowords elicited more negative evoked potentials N400 and P600) than non-tasklanguage pseudowords or words. The left temporal source of the evoked magnetic field was activated more strongly by English than Finnish pseudowords in the English task. This source was also activated more strongly by English pseudowords in the English task than in the Finnish task. However, no similar enhancement of the evoked magnetic field by Finnish pseudowords was observed in the Finnish task. This finding suggests that at the level of multimodal temporal cortex around the superior temporal sulcus, the native language is processed more automatically than the second language and that the controlled processing of linguistic information reflected by the N400 potential is accomplished by a broader neural network extending beyond the association temporal areas.

The purpose of the study was to investigate electrophysiological correlates of burnout to explain the mechanisms of the core burnout symptoms: exhaustion and depersonalization/cynicism. The analyzed error-related electrophysiological markers shed light on impaired cognitive mechanisms and the specific changes in information-processing in burnout. In the EEG study design (N = 80), two components of error-related potential (ERP), error-related negativity (ERN), and error positivity (Pe), were analyzed. In the non-clinical burnout group (N = 40), a significant increase in ERN amplitude and a decrease in Pe amplitude were observed compared to controls (N = 40). Enhanced error detection, indexed by increased ERN amplitude, and diminished response monitoring, indexed by decreased Pe amplitude, reveal emerging cognitive problems in the non-clinical burnout group. Cognitive impairments in burnout subjects relate to both reactive and unconscious (ERN) and proactive and conscious (Pe) aspects of error processing. The results indicate a stronger `reactive control mode' that can deplete resources for proactive control and the ability to actively maintain goals. The analysis refers to error processing and specific task demands, thus should not be extended to cognitive processes in general. The characteristics of ERP patterns in burnout resemble psychophysiological indexes of anxiety (increased ERN) and depressive symptoms (decreased Pe), showing to some extent an overlapping effect of burnout and related symptoms and disorders. The results support the scarce existing data on the psychobiological nature of burnout, while extending and specifying its cognitive characteristics.

They have great potential but their complexity also bears unexpected pitfalls. In this paper, we explore the possibilities that arise from the high sensitivity of MVPA for stimulus-related differences, which may confound estimations of class differences during decoding of cognitive concepts. We propose a method that takes advantage of concept-unrelated grouping factors, uses blocked permutation tests, and gradually manipulates the proportion of concept-related information in data while the stimulus-related, concept-irrelevant factors are held constant. This results in a concept-response curve, which shows the relative contribution of these two components, i.e. how much of the decoding performance is specific to higher-order category processing and to lower order stimulus processing. It also allows separating stimulus-related from concept-related neuronal processing, which cannot be achieved experimentally. We applied our method to three different EEG data sets with different levels of stimulus-related confound to decode concepts of digits vs. letters, faces vs. houses, and animals vs. fruits based on event-related potentials at the single trial level. We show that exemplar-specific differences between stimuli can drive classification accuracy to above chance levels even in the absence of conceptual information. By looking into time-resolved windows of brain activity, concept-response curves can help characterize the time-course of lower-level and higher-level neural information processing and detect the corresponding temporal and spatial signatures of the corresponding cognitive processes. In particular, our results show that perceptual information is decoded earlier in time than conceptual information specific to processing digits and letters. In addition, compared to the stimulus-level predictive sites, concept-related topographies are spread more widely and, at later time points, reach the frontal cortex. Thus, our proposed method yields insights into cognitive processing as well as corresponding brain responses.

Power and Phase of Alpha Oscillations Reveal an Interaction between Spatial and Temporal Visual Attention	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EEG ALPHA; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; SENSORY SELECTION; EVOKED-RESPONSES; REACTION-TIME	Oscillatory brain rhythms can bias attention via phase and amplitude changes, which modulate sensory activity, biasing information to be processed or ignored. Alpha band (7-14 Hz) oscillations lateralize with spatial attention and rhythmically inhibit visual activity and awareness through pulses of inhibition. Here we show that human observers' awareness of spatially unattended targets is dependent on both alpha power and alpha phase at target onset. Following a predictive directional cue, alpha oscillations were entrained bilaterally using repetitive visual stimuli. Subsequently, we presented either spatially cued or uncued targets at SOAs either validly or invalidly predicted in time by the entrainers. Temporal validity maximally modulated perceptual performance outside the spatial focus of attention and was associated with both increased alpha power and increased neural entrainment of phase in the hemisphere processing spatially unattended information. The results demonstrate that alpha oscillations represent a pulsating inhibition, which impedes visual processing for unattended space.	[Kizuk, Sayeed A.

It was previously suggested that the oN1 was primarily driven by the identity of the anticipated sound. Here, we examined the role of temporal prediction in conjunction with identity prediction of the anticipated sound in the evocation of the auditory oN1. With incongruent audiovisual stimuli (a video of a handclap that is consistently combined with the sound of a car horn) we demonstrate in Experiment 1 that a natural match in identity between the visual and auditory stimulus is not required for inducing the oN1, and that the perceptual system can adapt predictions to unnatural stimulus events. In Experiment 2 we varied either the auditory onset (relative to the visual onset) or the identity of the sound across trials in order to hamper temporal and identity predictions. Relative to the natural stimulus with correct auditory timing and matching audiovisual identity, the oN1 was abolished when either the timing or the identity of the sound could not be predicted reliably from the video. Our study demonstrates the flexibility of the perceptual system in predictive processing (Experiment 1) and also shows that precise predictions of timing and content are both essential elements for inducing an oN1 (Experiment 2).

Whereas consonant discrimination is required to resolve rapid acoustic events, voice perception relies on slower cues. Humans, right from preterm ages, are particularly efficient to encode temporal cues. To compare the capacities of preterms to those observed in other mammals, we tested anesthetized adult rats by using exactly the same paradigm as that used in preterm neonates. We simultaneously recorded neural (using ECoG) and hemodynamic responses (using fNIRS) to series of human speech syllables and investigated the brain response to a change of consonant (ba vs. ga) and to a change of voice (male vs. female). Both methods revealed concordant results, although ECoG measures were more sensitive than fNIRS. Responses to syllables were bilateral, but with marked right-hemispheric lateralization. Responses to voice changes were observed with both methods, while only ECoG was sensitive to consonant changes. These results suggest that rats more effectively processed the speech envelope than fine temporal cues in contrast with human preterm neonates, in whom the opposite effects were observed. Cross-species comparisons constitute a very valuable tool to define the singularities of the human brain and species-specific bias that may help human infants to learn their native language.

Specifically, we examined whether the pattern of motor activation elicited by verbs depends on the larger sentential context. A robust N400 congruence effect confirmed the contextual manipulation of action plausibility, a form of semantic congruency. Importantly, this study showed that: (1) Action verbs elicited more mu power decrease than non-action verbs when sentences described plausible actions. Action verbs thus elicited more motor activation than non-action verbs. (2) In contrast, when sentences described implausible actions, mu activity was present but the difference between the verb types was not observed. The increased processing associated with a larger N400 thus coincided with mu activity in sentences describing implausible actions. Altogether, context-dependent motor activation appears to play a functional role in deriving context-sensitive meaning.	[Lam, Kevin J.

Electrophysiology provides a method to study auditory processing, by investigating event-related potentials such as mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a-amplitude. However, findings on MMN in autism are highly inconsistent, partly due to small sample sizes in the studies and differences in MMN paradigms. Therefore, in the current study, MMN and P3a amplitude were assessed in a relatively large sample of children with ASD, using a more extensive MMN paradigm and compared with that of typically developing children (TDC). Thirty-five children (aged 8-12 years) with ASD and 38 age and gender matched TDC were assessed with a MMN paradigm with three types of deviants, i.e., frequency, duration and a combination of these two. MMN elicited by duration and frequency-duration deviants was significantly reduced in the ASD group. P3a-amplitude elicited by duration deviants was significantly increased in the ASD group. Reduced MMN in children with ASD suggests that children with ASD may be less responsive to environmentally deviant stimuli at an early (sensory) level. P3a-amplitude was increased in ASD, implying a hyper-responsivity at the attentional level. In addition, as similar MMN deficits are found in schizophrenia, these MMN results may explain some of the frequently reported increased risk of children with ASD to develop schizophrenia later in life. Autism Res2017, 10: 1857-1865. (c) 2017 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Lay SummaryAutomatic detection of deviant sounds in the environment, such as upcoming traffic, is often affected in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Mismatch negativity (MMN) is a way to quantify automatic deviancy detection, using electroencephalography. In this study, auditory MMN was assessed in 35 children with ASD and 38 matched control children, revealing significantly reduced MMN in the ASD group. This may indicate that children with ASD are less able to automatically detect environmentally deviant stimuli.

However, little is known about adaptation across sensory modalities, especially in the context of high-level processing, such as the perception ofemotion. Previous studies have shownthat prolonged exposure to a face exhibiting oneemotion, such as happiness, leads to contrastive biases in the perception of subsequently presented faces toward the oppositeemotion, such as sadness. Such work has shown the importance of adaptation in calibrating face perception based on prior visual exposure. In the present study, we showed for the first time that emotion-laden sounds, like laughter, adapt the visual perception of emotional faces, that is, subjects more frequently perceived faces as sad after listening to a happy sound. Furthermore, via electroencephalography recordings and event-related potential analysis, we showed that there was a neural correlate underlying the perceptual bias: There was an attenuated response occurring at similar to 400ms to happy test faces and a quickened response to sad test faces, after exposure to a happy sound. Our results provide the first direct evidence for a behavioral cross-modal adaptation effect on the perception of facial emotion, and its neural correlate.

Multimodal evaluation has improved prognosis but precocious biomarkers are not appropriate in determining long-term functional outcome. AIM: To identify early prognostication markers of long-term functional outcome in post-anoxic coma. DESIGN: Retrospective assessment of outcomes. POPULATION: Individuals older than 18 years with post-anoxic coma hospitalized in intensive care units after cardiac arrest (CA) regardless of cause (cardiac or non-cardiac) and location of event (in or out-of-hospital). METHODS: Clinical, biological and neurophysiological data were collected within 48 hours from CA. Clinical data included time of no and low flow, CA rhythm, pupillary reflex, Glasgow motor score at admission and hyperthermia. Biological marker was the highest creatinine level. Neurophysiological parameters included EEG pattern and reactivity, Somatosensory Evoked Potential (SSEP), and Middle-Latency (ML) SSEP evoked at low (10 mA) and high (50 mA) intensity stimulation. Level of Cognitive Functioning Scale (LCFS), Disability Rating Scale and recovery from coma (Revised coma Recovery Scale [CRS-R]) were collected at 12 months. A LASSO multiple regression analysis was fitted to data to investigate the best predictors of LCF, DRS and CRS-R. In-sample prediction was obtained to verify the quality of fitting, and accuracy indices (i.e., total error rate) produced. RESULTS: Presence of short and medium latency SSEPs with low and high stimulation intensity were identified as prognostic predictors of outcome for all the scales. Error rate was 4.5% for CRS and LCF, and 9.1% for DRS. CONCLUSIONS: Middle latency somatosensory evoked potentials associated with short latency somatosensory evoked potentials during the first 48 hours after a cardiac arrest are strong predictors of functional outcome at 12 months from the event.

However, it is unknown whether multiple sessions of rTMS improve cognitive control, which is a function of the neural circuitry of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)-cingulate cortex in healthy individuals. In addition, it is still unclear which stages of neural processing are altered by rTMS. In this study, we investigated the effects of high-frequency rTMS on cognitive control and explored the time course changes of cognitive processing after rTMS using event-related potentials (ERPs). For seven consecutive days, 25 young healthy participants underwent one 10-Hz rTMS session per day in which stimulation was applied over the left DLPFC, and a homogeneous participant group of 25 individuals received a sham rTMS treatment. A Stroop task was performed, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. The results revealed that multiple sessions of rTMS can decrease reaction time (RTs) under both congruent and incongruent conditions and also increased the amplitudes of both N2 and N450 compared with sham rTMS. The negative correlations between the mean amplitudes of both N2 and N450 and the RTs were found, however, the latter correlation were restricted to incongruent trials and the correlation was enhanced significantly by rTMS. This observation supports the view that high-frequency rTMS over the left DLPFC can not only recruit more neural resources from the prefrontal cortex by inducing an electrophysiologically excitatory effect but also enhance efficiency of resources to deploy for conflict resolution during multiple stages of cognitive control processing in healthy young people.

Classification of Movement and Inhibition Using a Hybrid BCI	FRONTIERS IN NEUROROBOTICS			English	Article						inhibition; brain computer interface; motor imagery (MI); event-related potentials (ERPs); machine learning	RESPONSE-INHIBITION; EEG	Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are an emerging technology that are capable of turning brain electrical activity into commands for an external device. Motor imagery (MI)-when a person imagines a motion without executing it-is widely employed in BCI devices for motor control because of the endogenous origin of its neural control mechanisms, and the similarity in brain activation to actual movements. Challenges with translating a MI-BCI into a practical device used outside laboratories include the extensive training required, often due to poor user engagement and visual feedback response delays; poor user flexibility/freedom to time the execution/inhibition of their movements, and to control the movement type (right arm vs. left leg) and characteristics (reaching vs. grabbing); and high false positive rates of motion control. Solutions to improve sensorimotor activation and user performance of MI-BCIs have been explored. Virtual reality (VR) motor-execution tasks have replaced simpler visual feedback (smiling faces, arrows) and have solved this problem to an extent. Hybrid BCIs (hBCIs) implementing an additional control signal to MI have improved user control capabilities to a limited extent. These hBCIs either fail to allow the patients to gain asynchronous control of their movements, or have a high false positive rate. We propose an immersive VR environment which provides visual feedback that is both engaging and immediate, but also uniquely engages a different cognitive process in the patient that generates event-related potentials (ERPs). These ERPs provide a key executive function for the users to execute/inhibit movements. Additionally, we propose signal processing strategies and machine learning algorithms to move BCIs toward developing long-term signal stability in patients with distinctive brain signals and capabilities to control motor signals. The hBCI itself and the VR environment we propose would help to move BCI technology outside laboratory environments for motor rehabilitation in hospitals, and potentially for controlling a prosthetic.

Here we approach this challenge by proposing plausible mechanisms for the phenomenon of structured experience. In earlier work, we argued that the experience we call reality is a mental construct derived from information compression. Here we show that algorithmic information theory provides a natural framework to study and quantify consciousness from neurophysiological or neuroimaging data, given the premise that the primary role of the brain is information processing. We take as an axiom that "there is consciousness" and focus on the requirements for structured experience: we hypothesize that the existence and use of compressive models by cognitive systems, e. g. in biological recurrent neural networks, enables and provides the structure to phenomenal experience. Self-awareness is seen to arise naturally (as part of a better model) in cognitive systems interacting bidirectionally with the external world. Furthermore, we argue that by running such models to track data, brains can give rise to apparently complex (entropic but hierarchically organized) data. We compare this theory, named KT for its basis on the mathematical theory of Kolmogorov complexity, to other information-centric theories of consciousness. We then describe methods to study the complexity of the brain's output streams or of brain state as correlates of conscious state: we review methods such as (i) probing the brain through its input streams (e. g. event-related potentials in oddball paradigms or mutual algorithmic information between world and brain), (ii) analyzing spontaneous brain state, (iii) perturbing the brain by non-invasive transcranial stimulation, and (iv) quantifying behavior (e. g. eye movements or body sway).

Retrospective cueing studies indicate that selective attention can be directed to memory representations in WM improving performance. While most of the work has explored the neural substrates of orienting attention based on a spatial retro-cue, behavioral studies show that a feature other than location can also improve WM performance. In the present work we explored the oscillatory underpinnings of orienting attention to a relevant representation held in WM guided by a feature value. We recorded EEG data in a group of 36 healthy human subjects (20 females) performing a WM task in which they had to memorize the orientation of four rectangles of different colors. After a maintenance period, a cue was presented indicating the color of the relevant item. We showed that directing attention to a memory item based on its color resulted in a modulation of posterior alpha activity, which appears as more desynchronization in the contralateral than in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Alpha lateralization is considered a neurophysiological marker of external and internal spatial attention. We propose that current findings support the idea that selection of a memory item based on a non-location feature could be accomplished by a spatial attentional mechanism. Moreover, using a centrally presented color retro-cue allowed us to surpass the confounds inherent to the use of spatial retro-cues, supporting that the observed lateralized alpha results from an endogenous attentional mechanism.

Composing only by thought: Novel application of the P300 brain-computer interface	PLOS ONE			English	Article							USER-CENTERED DESIGN; MENTAL PROSTHESIS; HEALTHY	The P300 event-related potential is a well-known pattern in the electroencephalogram (EEG). This kind of brain signal is used for many different brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, e.g., spellers, environmental controllers, web browsers, or for painting. In recent times, BCI systems are mature enough to leave the laboratories to be used by the end-users, namely severely disabled people. Therefore, new challenges arise and the systems should be implemented and evaluated according to user-centered design (USD) guidelines. We developed and implemented a new system that utilizes the P300 pattern to compose music. Our Brain Composing system consists of three parts: the EEG acquisition device, the P300-based BCI, and the music composing software. Seventeen musical participants and one professional composer performed a copy-spelling, a copy-composing, and a free-composing task with the system. According to the USD guidelines, we investigated the efficiency, the effectiveness and subjective criteria in terms of satisfaction, enjoyment, frustration, and attractiveness. The musical participants group achieved high average accuracies: 88.24% (copy-spelling), 88.58% (copy-composing), and 76.51% (free-composing). The professional composer achieved also high accuracies: 100% (copy-spelling), 93.62% (copy-composing), and 98.20% (free-composing). General results regarding the subjective criteria evaluation were that the participants enjoyed the usage of the Brain Composing system and were highly satisfied with the system. Showing very positive results with healthy people in this study, this was the first step towards a music composing system for severely disabled people.

Such affordances play a part in how we prepare to handle or manipulate tools and other objects. Evidence obtained through fMRI, EEG and TMS has proven that this is the case but, as yet, the temporal evolution of affordances has not been fully investigated. The aim here was to further explore the timing of evoked motor activity using visual stimuli tailored to drive the motor system. Therefore, we presented three kinds of stimuli in stereoscopic depth; whole hand grasp objects which afforded a power-grip, pinch-grip objects which afforded a thumb and forefinger precision-grip and an empty desk, affording no action. In order to vary functional motor priming while keeping visual stimulation identical, participants adopted one of two postures, with either the dominant or non-dominant hand forward. EEG data from 29 neurologically healthy subjects were analysed for the N1 evoked potential, observed in visual discrimination tasks, and for the N2 ERP component, previously shown to correlate with affordances (Proverbio, Adorni, & D'Aniello, 2011). We observed a link between ERPs, previously considered to reflect motor priming, and the positioning of the dominant hand. A significant interaction was detected in the left-hemisphere N2 between the participants' posture and the object category they viewed. These results indicate strong affordance-related activity around 300 ms after stimulus presentation, particularly when the dominant hand can easily reach an object. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Low Latency Estimation of Motor Intentions to Assist Reaching Movements along Multiple Sessions in Chronic Stroke Patients: A Feasibility Study	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography; motor-related cortical potentials; event-related desynchronization; functional electrical stimulation; stroke; neurorehabilitation	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; MACHINE INTERFACE; IMPACT SCALE-16; REHABILITATION; RECOVERY; STIMULATION; PEOPLE; EXOSKELETON; PLASTICITY; HAND	Background: The association between motor-related cortical activity and peripheral stimulation with temporal precision has been proposed as a possible intervention to facilitate cortico-muscular pathways and thereby improve motor rehabilitation after stroke. Previous studies with patients have provided evidence of the possibility to implement brain-machine interface platforms able to decode motor intentions and use this information to trigger afferent stimulation and movement assistance. This study tests the use a low-latency movement intention detector to drive functional electrical stimulation assisting upper-limb reaching movements of patients with stroke. Methods: An eight-sessions intervention on the paretic arm was tested on four chronic stroke patients along 1 month. Patients' intentions to initiate reaching movements were decoded from electroencephalographic signals and used to trigger functional electrical stimulation that in turn assisted patients to do the task. The analysis of the patients' ability to interact with the intervention platform, the assessment of changes in patients' clinical scales and of the system usability and the kinematic analysis of the reaching movements before and after the intervention period were carried to study the potential impact of the intervention. Results: On average 66.3 +/- 15.7% of trials (resting intervals followed by self-initiated movements) were correctly classified with the decoder of motor intentions. The average detection latency (with respect to the movement onsets estimated with gyroscopes) was 112 +/- 278ms. The Fugl-Meyer index upper extremity increased 11.5 +/- 5.5 points with the intervention. The stroke impact scale also increased. In line with changes in clinical scales, kinematics of reaching movements showed a trend toward lower compensatory mechanisms. Patients' assessment of the therapy reflected their acceptance of the proposed intervention protocol. Conclusions: According to results obtained here with a small sample of patients, Brain-Machine Interfaces providing low-latency support to upper-limb reaching movements in patients with stroke are a reliable and usable solution formotor rehabilitation interventions with potential functional benefits.

However, as yet it is unclear what aspects of behavioral abnormalities are related to pathology in which striatal subcomponent, that is, the matrix and the striosomes. We therefore studied cognitive control in X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism, a model disease of striosomal degeneration, using behavioral paradigms and EEG. Methods: We studied genetically confirmed X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism patients (N = 21) in their early disease stages and healthy matched controls. Error-related behavioral adaptation was tested in a flanker task and response inhibition in a Go/Nogo paradigm during EEG. We focused on error-related negativity during error processing and the Nogo-N2 and Nogo-P3 in the response inhibition task. Source localization analyses were calculated. In addition, total wavelet power and phase-locking factor reflecting neural synchronization processes in time and frequency across trials were calculated. Results: Error processing and behavioral adaptation predominantly engaging the anterior cingulate cortex was markedly impaired in X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism. This was reflected in abnormal reaction times correlating with error-related negativity amplitudes, error related theta band activity, and the phase-locking factor. Also, abnormal error processing correlated with dystonia severity but not with parkinsonism. Response inhibition and corresponding EEG activity were normal. Conclusions: This dissociable pattern of cognitive deficits most likely reflects predominant dysfunction of the striosomal compartment and its connections to the anterior cingulate cortex in X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism. The results underscore the importance of striosomes for cognitive function in humans and suggest that striosomes are relays of error-related behavioral adaptation but not inhibitory control.

Recent studies suggest that expression-related visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) reflects automatic processing of emotional changes. In the present study we used a controlled paradigm to investigate the specificity of emotional change-detection. In order to disentangle specific responses to emotional deviants from that of neutral deviants, we presented neutral expression as standard stimulus (p = 0.80) and both angry and neutral expressions as deviants (p = 0.10, each). In addition to an oddball sequence, an equiprobable sequence was presented, to control for refractoriness and low-level differences. Our results showed that in an early time window (100-200 ms), the controlled vMMN was greater than the oddball vMMN only for the angry deviant, suggesting the importance of controlling for refractoriness and stimulus physical features in emotion related studies. Within the controlled vMMN, angry and neutral deviants both elicited early and late peaks occurring at 140 and 310 ms, respectively, but only the emotional vMMN presented sustained amplitude after each peak. By directly comparing responses to emotional and neutral deviants, our study provides evidence of specific activity reflecting the automatic detection of emotional change. This differs from broader "visual" change processing, and suggests the involvement of two partially-distinct pre-attentional systems in the detection of changes in facial expressions.

Attentional Orienting and Dorsal Visual Stream Decline: Review of Behavioral and EEG Studies	FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						aging; visuospatial orienting of attention; compensation; dorsal visual stream; magnocellular pathway	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; STIMULUS-DRIVEN ATTENTION; LINE-BISECTION JUDGMENTS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES; ADULT LIFE-SPAN; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; NEURAL ACTIVITY	Every day we are faced with an overwhelming influx of visual information. Visual attention acts as the filtering mechanism that enables us to focus our limited neural resources, by selectively processing only the most relevant and/or salient aspects of our visual environment. The ability to shift attention to the most behaviorally relevant items enables us to successfully navigate and interact with our surroundings. The dorsal visual stream is important for the rapid and efficient visuospatial orienting of attention. Unfortunately, recent evidence suggests that the dorsal visual stream may be especially vulnerable to age-related decline, with significant deterioration becoming evident quite early in the aging process. Yet, despite the significant age-related declines to the dorsal visual stream, the visuospatial orienting of attention appears relatively well preserved in older adults, at least in the early stages of aging. The maintenance of visuospatial orienting of attention in older adults appears to be facilitated by the engagement of compensatory neural mechanisms. In particular, older adults demonstrate heightened activity in the frontal regions to compensate for the reduced activity in the posterior sensory regions. These findings suggest that older adults are more reliant on control processes mediated by the anterior regions of the frontoparietal attention network to compensate for less efficient sensory processing within the posterior sensory cortices.

Impaired Processing of Task-Irrelevant Salient Information in Adults With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: Evidence From Event-Related Potentials	JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						ADHD; novelty P3; P3b; oddball task	DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; SLOW-WAVE; ADHD; NOVELTY; CHILDREN; BRAIN; P300; PERFORMANCE; FORMS; P3A	The current study examined the mechanisms of attention allocation in adult ADHD to investigate the frequently reported diminished target processing in ADHD as well as the less consistently observed increased distractibility by task-irrelevant distracting stimuli. To this end, while high-density EEG was recorded, 25 adults with ADHD and 23 healthy controls completed a 4-stimulus oddball task that comprised a frequently presented standard stimulus and 3 different categories of equally infrequent stimuli: task-relevant targets, task-irrelevant nontargets, and task-irrelevant unfamiliar novels. By applying specific contrasts, this allowed us to disentangle pure effects of 3 kinds of salience, namely targetness (targets vs. nontargets), deviance (nontargets vs. standards), and novelty (novels vs. nontargets). Distinct effects of targetness, deviance and novelty across several components were found. At the behavioral level, no group differences between adults with and without ADHD were observed. Contrary to our expectations, no difference between groups was found for the P3b amplitude to targets or the novelty P3 to nontargets and novels; however, in adults with ADHD a clear P3b to novels was apparent, which was absent in controls. This latter finding indicates deficient attention allocation in adults with ADHD, more specifically increased sustained processing of task-irrelevant novel events. General Scientific Summary This study suggests that attention problems in adult ADHD are not characterized by a general deficit of top-down attentional processing of task-relevant stimuli or increased distractibility to task-irrelevant novel stimuli, but may be related to abnormal sustained processing of salient task-irrelevant novel stimuli.

The study of response inhibition provides insights into reduced action disposition in blood phobia. Twenty individuals with and 20 without blood phobia completed an emotional go/no-go task including phobia-related pictures, as well as phobia-unrelated unpleasant, neutral, and pleasant stimuli. Behavioral results did not indicate a phobia-specific reduced action disposition in the phobic group. Time-frequency decomposition of eventrelated EEG data showed a reduction of right prefrontal activity, as indexed by an increase in alpha power (200 ms), for no-go mutilation trials in the phobic group but not in controls. Moreover, theta power (300 ms) increased specifically for phobiarelated pictures in individuals with, but not without, blood phobia, irrespective of go or no-go trial types. Passive avoidance of phobia-related stimuli subtended by the increased alpha in the right prefrontal cortex, associated with increased emotional salience indexed by theta synchronization, represents a possible neurophysiological correlate of the conflicting motivational response in blood phobia. Through the novel use of time-frequency decomposition in an emotional go/no-go task, the present study contributed to clarifying the neurophysiological correlates of the overlapping motivational tendencies in blood phobia.

Sleep-wake architecture, neuronal oscillations and network connectivity are key mechanisms supporting brain plasticity and cognition, which are disrupted in mood disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. In rats, we investigated the dynamic effects of acute and chronic subcutaneous administration of ketamine (2.5, 5 and 10 mg kg(-1)) on sleep-wake cycle, multichannels network interactions assessed by coherence and phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling, locomotor activity (LMA), cognitive information processing as reflected by the mismatch negativity-like (MMN) component of event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Acute ketamine elicited a short, lasting inhibition of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, increased coherence in higher gamma frequency oscillations independent of LMA, altered theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling, increased MMN peak-amplitude response and evoked higher gamma oscillations. In contrast, chronic ketamine reduced large-scale communication among cortical regions by decreasing oscillations and coherent activity in the gamma frequency range, shifted networks activity towards slow alpha rhythm, decreased MMN peak response and enhanced aberrant higher gamma neuronal network oscillations. Altogether, our data show that acute and chronic ketamine elicited differential changes in network connectivity, ERPs and event-related oscillations (EROs), supporting possible underlying alterations in NMDAR-GABAergic signaling. The findings underscore the relevance of intermittent dosing of ketamine to accurately maintain the functional integrity of neuronal networks for long-term plastic changes and therapeutic effect.

This causes functional ischemia and contributes to muscle wasting. Similar functional ischemia may be present in brains of patients with BMD, who often have mild cognitive impairment, and nNOS may be important for the regulation of the microvascular circulation in the brain. We hypothesized that treatment with sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor that potentiates nitric oxide responses, would augment both the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in patients with BMD. Seventeen patients (mean +/- SD age 38.5 +/- 10.8 years) with BMD were included in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Twelve patients completed the entire study. Effects of sildenafil were assessed by 3 T magnetic resonance (MR) scanning, evoked potentials, somatosensory task-induced BOLD functional MR imaging, regional and global perfusion, and angiography before and after 4 weeks of sildenafil, 20 mg (Revatio in gelatine capsules, oral, 3 times daily), or placebo treatment. Sildenafil increased the event-related sensory and visual BOLD response compared with placebo (p < 0.01). However, sildenafil did not alter CBF, measured by MR phase contrast mapping, or the arterial diameter of the middle cerebral artery, measured by MR angiography. We conclude that nNOS may play a role in event-related neurovascular responses. Further studies in patients with BMD may help clarify the roles of dystrophin and nNOS in neurovascular coupling in general, and in patients with BMD in particular.

Impairments in the P300 potential are well documented in psychosis. Intrinsic (self-)connectivity in a frontoparietal cortical hierarchy during a P300 experiment was investigated. Dynamic Causal Modeling was used to estimate how evoked activity results from the dynamics of coupled neural populations and how neural coupling changes with the experimental factors. Twenty-four patients with psychotic disorder, twenty-four unaffected relatives, and twenty-five controls underwent EEG recordings during an auditory oddball paradigm. Sixteen frontoparietal network models (including primary auditory, superior parietal, and superior frontal sources) were analyzed and an optimal model of neural coupling, explaining diagnosis and genetic risk effects, as well as their interactions with task condition were identified. The winning model included changes in connectivity at all three hierarchical levels. Patients showed decreased self-inhibition-that is, increased cortical excitability-in left superior frontal gyrus across task conditions, compared with unaffected participants. Relatives had similar increases in excitability in left superior frontal and right superior parietal sources, and a reversal of the normal synaptic gain changes in response to targets relative to standard tones. It was confirmed that both subjects with psychotic disorder and their relatives show a context-independent loss of synaptic gain control at the highest hierarchy levels. The relatives also showed abnormal gain modulation responses to task-relevant stimuli. These may be caused by NMDA-receptor and/or GABAergic pathologies that change the excitability of superficial pyramidal cells and may be a potential biological marker for psychosis.

In the present study, participants were instructed to perform an audio-visual spatial attention task. They were asked to attend to either the left or the right hemifield and to respond to deviant transient either auditory or visual stimuli. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) elicited by two task irrelevant pattern reversing checkerboards flickering at 10 and 15 Hz in the left and the right hemifields, respectively, were used to continuously monitor the locus of spatial attention. The amplitude and phase of the SSVEPs were extracted for single trials and were separately analyzed. Sustained attention to one hemifield (spatial attention) as well as to the auditory modality (intermodal attention) increased the inter-trial phase locking of the SSVEP responses, whereas briefly presented visual and auditory stimuli decreased the single-trial SSVEP amplitude between 200 and 500 ms post-stimulus. This transient change of the single-trial amplitude was restricted to the SSVEPs elicited by the reversing checkerboard in the spatially attended hemifield and thus might reflect a transient re-orienting of attention towards the brief stimuli. Thus, the present results demonstrate independent, but interacting neural mechanisms of sustained and transient attentional orienting.

Effect of methylphenidate on visual responses in the superior colliculus in the anaesthetised rat: Role of cortical activation	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Local field potential; multiunit activity; psychostimulants; cortical arousal	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FLASH-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; RETICULAR-FORMATION; IN-VITRO; AMPHETAMINE; DOPAMINE; ADHD; PERFORMANCE; SEROTONIN	The mechanism of action of psychostimulant drugs in the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is still largely unknown, although recent evidence suggests one possibility is that the drugs affect the superior colliculus (SC). We have previously demonstrated that systemically administered d-amphetamine attenuates/abolishes visual responses to wholefield light flashes in the superficial layers of the SC in anaesthetised rats, and the present study sought to extend this work to methylphenidate (MPH). Anaesthetised rats were administered MPH at a range of doses (or saline) and subjected to monocular wholefield light flashes at two intensities, juxta-threshold and super-threshold. In contrast to d-amphetamine, systemic MPH produced an enhancement of visual activity at both intensities. Methylphenidate was also found to produce activation of the cortical EEG in anaesthetised rats. Furthermore, cortical activation induced by electrical stimulation of the pons was found to enhance visual responses in superficial layers of the SC, and when MPH was paired with pontine-induced cortical activation, the response-enhancing effects of MPH were substantially attenuated. Taken together, the results suggest that the enhancement of visual responses in the superficial layers of the SC by MPH in the anaesthetised rat is an artefact of the drug's interaction with cortical arousal.

In this paper, a real-time ECG peaks detection algorithm is proposed. The paper proposes a new genetic algorithm (GA) based adaptive filter (GA-AF) and an effective real-time peak detection algorithm, which is coupled with search-back mechanism for missed peaks. The proposed methodology is tested on the standard MIT-BIII Arrhythmia database. The GA-AF based QRS detector gives good detection performance by taking an average duration of 0.3s for processing a signal block of 0.83s duration. The proposed methodology achieves sensitivity (%Se) and positive predictivity (%P+) of 98.97% and 99.70% respectively.

Visual processing in patients with age-related macular degeneration performing a face detection test	CLINICAL OPHTHALMOLOGY			English	Article						age-related eye diseases; bevacizumab; face recognition; EEG; N170	BRAIN RESPONSE; RECOGNITION; ACUITY; PERCEPTION; N250R; REORGANIZATION; DISABILITY; DEPRESSION; FAMILIAR; IDENTITY	Purpose: People with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have difficulties in familiar face recognition and facial expression discrimination. Our aim was to evaluate the visual processing of faces in AMD patients and whether this would be improved by anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy. This was a prospective interventional cohort study. Patients: Twelve patients with monocular wet AMD and 6 control subjects were recruited. Face detection processes were studied using cortical event-related potentials (ERPs). Patients received 3 bevacizumab intravitreal injections to the single affected eye. At baseline and 4-6 weeks after the last injection, clinical presentation and ERPs of the face task were evaluated. Face pictures were shown as targets (16.7%) among standard pictures of pixelated faces in an oddball-type paradigm. Results: Face pictures elicited well-defined electrical components in occipital and parieto-occipital cortical areas at baseline and after treatment. The face-specific N170 component was evident in all subjects with longer peak latency in patients than in controls (170 +/- 13 vs 155 +/- 14, P=0.032). Unexpectedly, an early component reflecting unintentional prediction of perceiving a face, that is, deviance-related negativity, was present in patients and controls. Visual acuity of the affected eye seemed improved in patients from logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution 0.71 (+/- 0.33) to 0.52 (+/- 0.39) by 119 (+/- 23) days without accompanying significant change in face-specific ERPs. Conclusions: Monocular wet AMD distinctly influenced face-specific brain electrophysiological components. However, the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment did not improve the binocular face detection ability. The EudraCT number of this study is 2012-000765-20.

Bipolar disorder is a disease characterized by fluctuating states of emotional and cognitive dysregulation. To explore the role of attentional control on face processing in bipolar patients (BP) we used gaze direction as an emotion modulation parameter in a two-back Working Memory (WM) task while high-density EEG data were acquired. Since gaze direction influences emotional attributions to faces with neutral expressions as well, we presented neutral faces with direct and averted gaze. Nineteen euthymic BP and a sample of age-and gender-matched controls were examined. In BP we observed diminished P200 and augmented P300 evoked responses, differentially modulated by non-repeated or repeated faces, as well as by gaze direction. BP showed a reduced P200 amplitude, significantly stronger for faces with direct gaze than averted gaze. Source localization of P200 indicated decreased activity in sensory-motor regions and frontal areas suggestive of abnormal affective processing of neutral faces. The present study provides neurophysiological evidence for abnormal gaze processing in BP and suggests dysfunctional processing of direct eye contact as a prominent characteristic of bipolar disorder.

Empathic behavior is selectively elicited from genuine, meaningful pain but not from fake, meaningless scenarios. However, the brain's screening mechanism of false information from meaningful events and the time course for the screening process remains unclear. Using EEG combined with principle components analysis (PCA) techniques, here we compared temporal neurodynamics between the observation of pain and no-pain pictures as well as between true (painful expressions and needle-penetrated arms) and false (needle-penetrated faces with neutral expressions) pain pictures. The results revealed that pain vs. no-pain information is differentiated in the very early ERP components, i.e., the N1/P1 for the face and arm pictures categories and the VPP/N170 for the facial expression category while the mid-latency ERP components, N2 and P3, played key roles in differentiating true from false situations. The complex of N2 and P3 components may serve as a screening mechanism through which observers allocate their attentions to more important or relevant events and screen out false environmental information. This is the first study to describe and provide a time course of the screening process during pain empathy. These findings shed new light on the understanding of empathic processing.

Although reproducibility and validity of neuroscientific and psychological research has been criticized, clear data on how different quantification methods of the ERN and their relation to available trial numbers affect within- and across-participant studies is sparse. Within a large sample of 863 healthy human participants, we demonstrate that, across participants, the number of errors correlates with the amplitude of the ERN independently of the number of errors included in ERN quantification per participant, constituting a possible confound when such variance is unaccounted for. Additionally, we find that ERN amplitudes reach high consistency within participants at lower trial numbers, yet when comparisons between groups of participants are desired, increasing error-trial numbers lead to higher statistical power. We derive concrete suggestions for specific types of analyses, which may help researchers to more effectively design studies and analyze error-related EEG data with the most appropriate measurement technique for the question at hand and trial number available.

This paper discusses the invariance and variability in interaction error-related potentials (ErrPs), where a special focus is laid upon the factors of (1) the human mental processing required to assess interface actions (2) time (3) subjects. Approach. Three different experiments were designed as to vary primarily with respect to the mental processes that are necessary to assess whether an interface error has occurred or not. The three experiments were carried out with 11 subjects in a repeated-measures experimental design. To study the effect of time, a subset of the recruited subjects additionally performed the same experiments on different days. Main results. The ErrP variability across the different experiments for the same subjects was found largely attributable to the different mental processing required to assess interface actions. Nonetheless, we found that interaction ErrPs are empirically invariant over time (for the same subject and same interface) and to a lesser extent across subjects (for the same interface). Significance. The obtained results may be used to explain across-study variability of ErrPs, as well as to define guidelines for approaches to the ErrP classifier transferability problem.

One likely mechanism by which this occurs is the application of attention to potentially relevant objects. Here we test the hypothesis that category membership influences the allocation of attention, allowing attention to be applied not only to object features, but to entire categories. Participants briefly learned to categorize a set of novel cartoon animals after which EEG was recorded while participants distinguished between a target and non-target category. A second identical EEG session was conducted after two sessions of categorization practice. The category structure and task design allowed parametric manipulation of number of target features while holding feature frequency and category membership constant. We found no evidence that category membership influenced attentional selection: a postero-lateral negative component, labeled the selection negativity/N250, increased over time and was sensitive to number of target features, not target categories. In contrast, the right hemisphere N170 was not sensitive to target features. The P300 appeared sensitive to category in the first session, but showed a graded sensitivity to number of target features in the second session, possibly suggesting a transition from rule-based to similarity based categorization.

Infant social attention: an endophenotype of ASD-related traits?	JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Autism spectrum disorders; infancy; endophenotype; social attention	AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; 6-MONTH-OLD INFANTS; YOUNG-CHILDREN; VISUAL-ATTENTION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; EYE GAZE; FACE; HABITUATION; POPULATION; MECHANISMS	BackgroundAs a neurodevelopmental disorder, symptoms of ASD likely emerge from a complex interaction between preexisting genetic vulnerabilities and the child's environment. One way to understand causal paths to ASD is to identify dimensional ASD-related traits that vary in the general population and that predispose individuals with other risk factors toward ASD. Moving beyond behavioral traits to explore underlying neurocognitive processes may further constrain the underlying genetics. Endophenotypes are quantitative, heritable, trait-related differences that are generally assessed with laboratory-based methods, can be identified in the general population, and may be more closely tied to particular causal chains that have a more restricted set of genetic roots. The most fruitful endophenotypes may be those observed in infancy, prior to the emergence of behavioral symptoms that they are hypothesized to cause. Social motivation is an ASD-related trait that is highly heritable. In this study, we investigate whether infant endophenotypes of social attention relate to familial risk for lower social motivation in the general population. MethodsWe examined whether infant social attention (measured using habituation, EEG power, and event-related potential tasks previously used in infants/toddlers with ASD) varies quantitatively with parental social motivation in 117 six-month-old and 106 twelve-month-old typically developing infants assessed cross-sectionally. To assess heritable aspects of social motivation, primary caregiver biological parents completed two self-report measures of social avoidance and discomfort that have shown high heritability in previous work. ResultsParents with higher social discomfort and avoidance had infants who showed shorter looks to faces but not objects; reduced theta power during naturalistic social attention; and smaller P400 responses to faces versus objects. ConclusionsEarly reductions in social attention are continuously related to lower parental social motivation. Alterations in social attention may be infant endophenotypes of social motivation traits related to ASD.	[Jones, Emily J.

There is an ongoing debate whether such adjustments result from adaptive processes that serve to optimize performance or whether they reflect interference from error monitoring or attentional orientation. The present study aimed at identifying adaptive adjustments in a two-stage visual search task, in which participants had to select and subsequently identify a target stimulus presented to the left or right visual hemifield. Target selection and identification can be measured by two distinct event-related potentials, the N2pc and the SPCN. Using a decoder analysis based on multivariate pattern analysis, we were able to isolate the processing stages related to error sources and post-error adjustments. Whereas errors were linked to deviations in the N2pc and the SPCN, only for the N2pc we identified a post-error adjustment, which exhibits key features of source-specific adaptivity. While errors were associated with an increased N2pc, post-error adjustments consisted in an N2pc decrease. We interpret this as an adaptive adjustment of target selection to prevent errors due to disproportionate processing of the task-irrelevant target location. Our study thus provides evidence for adaptive post error adjustments in visual search.

Methods: Fifteen DOC patients and 24 healthy controls took part in the study. The 40 Hz click trains were used to evoke ASSRs. Mean evoked amplitude (EA) and phase-locking index (PLI) within 38-42 Hz window were calculated for 100 ms bins, starting from -200 to 700 ms relative to stimulus onset. Results: The PLI values from the patient group in the period of 200-500 ms after the stimulus onset positively correlated with the CRS-R total score and with the scores of the Auditory and Visual subscales. Conclusions: The phase-locking index of 40 Hz auditory steady-state responses can be an indicator of the level of dysfunction of the central nervous system in DOC. Significance: Our results emphasize the role of central auditory system integrity in determining the level of functioning of DOC patients and suggest the possibility to use the ASSR protocol as an objective diagnostic method in DOC patients.

Evidence from mind wandering research suggests that spontaneous shifts from externally directed cognition (EDC) to internally directed cognition (IDC) involves oculomotor changes indicative of visual disengagement. In the present study, we investigated potential differences in eye behavior between goal-directed forms of IDC and EDC. To this end, we manipulated the focus of attention (internal versus external) in two demanding cognitive tasks (anagram and sentence generation). IDC was associated with fewer and longer fixations and higher variability in pupil diameter and eye vergence compared to EDC, suggesting reduced visual scanning and higher spontaneous eye activity. IDC was further related to longer blinks, lower microsaccade frequency, and a lower angle of eye vergence. These latter changes appear conducive to attenuate visual input and thereby shield ongoing internal processes from external distraction. Together, these findings suggest that IDC is accompanied by characteristic eye behavior that reflects a decoupling of attention from external events and serves gating out visual input.

Attentional Resources Are Needed for Auditory Stream Segregation in Aging	FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						selective attention; auditory scene analysis; event-related potentials (ERPs); mismatch negativity (MMN); automatic processing	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; SCENE ANALYSIS; OLDER-ADULTS; STIMULI; SOUNDS; TASK; AGE; ORGANIZATION; MODULATION; SEQUENCES	The ability to select sound streams from background noise becomes challenging with age, even with normal peripheral auditory functioning. Reduced stream segregation ability has been reported in older compared to younger adults. However, the reason why there is a difference is still unknown. The current study investigated the hypothesis that automatic sound processing is impaired with aging, which then contributes to difficulty actively selecting subsets of sounds in noisy environments. We presented a simple intensity oddball sequence in various conditions with irrelevant background sounds while recording EEG. The ability to detect the oddball tones was dependent on the ability to automatically or actively segregate the sounds to frequency streams. Listeners were able to actively segregate sounds to perform the loudness detection task, but there was no indication of automatic segregation of background sounds while watching a movie. Thus, our results indicate impaired automatic processes in aging that may explain more effortful listening, and that tax attentional systems when selecting sound streams in noisy environments.

Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) represents a common, idiopathic generalized epileptic syndrome, characterized by spike-and-wave discharge (SWD) electroencephalographic (EEG) waveforms. We compare herein the network properties of periods of SWD and baseline activity using graph theory. EEG data were obtained from 11 patients with JME. Functional cortical networks during SWD and baseline periods were estimated by calculating the coherence between all possible electrode pairs in the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands. Graph theoretical measures, including nodal degree, characteristic path length, clustering coefficient, and small-world index were then used to evaluate the characteristics of epileptic networks in JME. We also assessed short- and long-range connections between SWD and baseline networks. Compared to baseline, increased coherence was observed during SWD in all frequency bands. The nodal degree of the SWD network, particularly in the frontal region, was significantly higher compared to the baseline network. The clustering coefficient and small-world index were significantly lower in the theta and beta bands of the SWD versus baseline network, but the characteristic path length did not differ among networks. Long-range connections were increased during SWD, particularly between frontal and posterior brain regions. Our study suggests that SWD in JME is associated with increased local (particularly in frontal region) connectivity. Furthermore, the SWD network was associated with increased long-range connections, and reduced small-worldness, which may impair information processing during SWD.

Participants made eye movements to a unique line-segment target embedded in a search display also containing a unique distractor. Target and distractor salience was manipulated by varying degree of orientation offset from a homogenous background. VWM capacity was measured using a change-detection task. Results showed greater likelihood of incorrect saccades when the distractor was relatively more salient than when the target was salient. Misdirected saccades to salient distractors were strongly represented in the error-monitoring system by rapid and robust errorrelated negativity (ERN), which predicted a significant adjustment of oculomotor behavior. Misdirected saccades to less-salient distractors, while arguably representing larger errors, were not as well detected or utilized by the error/ performance-monitoring system. This system was instead better engaged in tasks requiring greater cognitive control and by individuals with higher VWM capacity. Our findings show that relative salience of task-relevant and task-irrelevant stimuli can define situations where an increase in cognitive control is necessary, with individual differences in VWM capacity explaining significant variance in the degree of monitoring and control of goal-directed eye movement behavior. The present study supports a conflict-monitoring interpretation of the ERN, whereby the level of competition between different responses, and the stimuli that define these responses, was more important in the generation of an enhanced ERN than the error commission itself.

The overall architecture is made up by two subsystems: the Brain-to-Computer System (BCS) and the mechanical actuator (a proof of concept of the proposed BCI is shown using a prototype car). The BCS is devoted to signal acquisition (6 EEG channels from wireless headset), visual stimuli delivery for P300 evocation and signal processing. Due to the P300 inter-subject variability, a first stage of Machine Learning (ML) is required. The ML stage is based on a custom algorithm (t-RIDE) which allows a fast calibration phase (only similar to 190 s for the first learning). The BCI presents a functional approach for time-domain features extraction, which reduces the amount of data to be analyzed. The real-time function is based on a trained linear hyper-dimensional classifier, which combines high P300 detection accuracy with low computation times. The experimental results, achieved on a dataset of 5 subjects (age: 26 +/- 3), show that: (i) the ML algorithm allows the P300 spatio-temporal characterization in 1.95 s using 38 target brain visual stimuli (for each direction of the car path); (ii) the classification reached an accuracy of 80.5 +/- 4.1% on single-trial P300 detection in only 22 ms (worst case), allowing real-time driving. For its versatility, the BCI system here described can be also used on different mechatronic actuators.

It was shown that focusing on only one item within working memory transfers this representation into a protected state, reducing its susceptibility to interference by incoming signals. The present study investigated the nature of this retroactive cue (retro-cue) benefit by means of oscillatory activity in the EEG. In a working memory task with a retro-cue indicating one, two or three memory representations as relevant and a block-wise distractor display presented after the retro-cue, participants had to remember the orientation of a colored bar. On behavioral level, we found that the interfering effect of the distractor display on memory performance could be prevented when a retro-cue reduced the number of attended representations in working memory. However, only the one-item retro-cue led to an overall increase in task performance compared to a condition without a retro-cue. The neural basis of this special representational status was investigated by means of oscillatory parameters in the EEG and a clustering approach on level of the independent components (ICs) in the signal. The retroactive reduction of attended working memory representations was reflected in a suppression of alpha power over right parietal and parieto-occipital sites. In addition, we found that an IC cluster representing oscillatory activity in the mu/beta range (10-12 Hz and 20-24 Hz) with a source in sensorimotor cortex revealed a power suppression already prior to the memory probe following the one-item retro-cue. This suggests that the retro-cue benefit results in large parts from the possibility to focus attention on one particular item in working memory and initiate motor planning processes already ahead of the probe stimulus indicating the respective response.

It has been suggested that the norepinephrine (NE) system is important to consider for such likelihood effects. As an indirect measure of the NE system activity we used the pupil diameter and integrated this data with neurophysiological (EEG) data and beamforming analyses. The study shows that inhibitory control processes reflected by theta oscillations are strongly modulated by the likelihood to employ these processes and that these mechanisms were related to neural processes in the SMA and SFG. Probably, the modulations observed for theta band activity may reflect modulations in the encoding of a surprise, or conflict signal. Interestingly, correlation analyses of neuronal activity at the sensor and the source level with pupil diameter data revealed strong correlations that were only seen in the condition where inhibitory control processes were rarely demanded. On the basis of findings and theoretical models suggesting that the pupil diameter can be interpreted as a proximate of NE system activity the results may be interpreted that the NE system modulates inhibitory control processes via theta band activity in the SFB when the likelihood to inhibit a prepotent response tendency is low. From this it may be speculated that the NE system dynamically gains and loses relevance to modulate inhibitory control depending on boundary conditions that determine the mode of responding.

Whether the spacing effect is achieved by reducing neural repetition priming or depends on learning experience is still unclear. In this event-related potential study, participants were asked to memorize 140 novel faces, half under the massed learning condition and the other half under the spaced learning condition. The afterwards recognition tests indicated that participants recognized more items under the spaced learning condition than under the massed learning condition. The electroencephalography data suggested that spaced learning was associated with a reduced familiarity effect in frontal N400. Remembered faces showed smaller repetition priming than forgotten faces under both learning conditions and spaced learning significantly reduced repetition suppression. Although no direct association was found between repetition priming and episodic memory, the difference in quantity between spaced learning and massed learning in the repetition priming can predict the different quantities in the recognition memory. These results suggest that the neural mechanism of the spacing effect is influenced by experience; however, the impact is mainly repetition priming and the spacing effect is still very robust.

In contrast, simple span tasks conceptually mainly require WM storage. Thus, conceptually, an N-back task and a complex span task share more commonalities as compared to a simple span task. In the current study, we compared an N-back task, a complex operation span task (Ospan), and a simple digit span task (Dspan) by means of typical WM load-related measures of the Electroencephalogram (EEG) like the parietal alpha and beta frequency band power, the frontal theta frequency band power, and the P300 amplitude, to examine whether these tasks would show commonalities or differences in WM processing-load. We expected that increasing WM-load would generally lead to a decreased alpha and beta frequency band power, an increased theta frequency band power, and a decreased P300 amplitude. Yet, based on the conceptual considerations, we hypothesized that the outcomes of these measures would be more comparable between the N-back and the Ospan as compared to the Dspan. Our hypotheses were partly confirmed. The N-back and the Ospan showed timely more prolonged alpha frequency band power effects as compared to the Dspan. This might indicate higher demands on WM processing in the former two tasks. The theta frequency band power and the P300 amplitude were most pronounced in the N-back task as compared to both span tasks. This might indicate specific demands on cognitive control in the N-back task. Additionally, we observed that behavioral performance measures correlated with changes in EEG alpha power of the N-back and the Ospan, yet not of the Dspan. Taken together, the hypothesized conceptual commonalities between the N-back task and the Ospan (and, for the Dspan, differences) were only partly confirmed by the electrophysiological WM load-related measures, indicating a potential need for reconsidering the theoretical accounts on WM tasks and the value of a closer link to electrophysiological research herein.

In this paper, a new adaptive filter (AF), employing cuckoo search optimization algorithm (COA), is proposed for generating feature for QRS complex detection. An efficient peak detection algorithm, coupled with search-back mechanism for detecting missed peaks, is also proposed. The combination of COA with AF and an effective peak detection algorithm with search-backs for missed peaks are the novelties presented in this paper. The performance results of proposed methodology are evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art methods. It is proved from the results that the proposed COA-AF based QRS detector gives efficient performance with sensitivity (%Se), positive predictivity (%P+), and detection error rate (%DER) of 99.75%, 99.79%, and 0.44% respectively.

Social value orientation modulates the FRN and P300 in the chicken game	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Social value orientation; Pro-social; Pro-self; FRN; P300	FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; ECONOMIC DECISION-MAKING; REWARD PREDICTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; NEURAL BASIS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; OUTCOME EVALUATION; ULTIMATUM GAME	Social dilemmas pervade daily life, business, and politics. The manners in which these dilemmas are resolved depend in part on the personal characteristics of those involved. One such characteristic is Social Value Orientation (SVO), a trait-like predisposition to maximize cooperative (Pro-Social) or non-cooperative (Pro-Self) outcomes in social relationships. The present study investigated the role of SVO in modulating neural responses to outcomes in a type of social dilemma known as the Chicken Game. The Chicken Game models real-world situations involving two parties independently making a decision between cooperation and aggression. The EEG of Pro-Socials and Pro-Selfs was recorded while playing Chicken with a computer Opponent. Two ERP components were extracted: Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN) and the P300. Despite no behavioral differences in decision (i.e., cooperation, aggression), FRN results indicate that Pro-Socials experienced unreciprocated cooperation as the least desired outcome. Further, P300 results show a main effect for the Opponent's choice, such that the Opponent's cooperation was more salient than aggression. Additionally, an interaction between the Participant's and Opponent's choice showed that the effect for the Opponent's choice only occurred when the Participant chose cooperation. None of the results for P300 were moderated by SVO. For both ERP components, Pro-Selfs showed no differential responding to Chicken outcomes. In addition, FRN magnitude on trial n predicted choice on trial n + 1 for Pro-Socials, but not for Pro-Selfs. P300 magnitude on trial n showed no relationship to choice on trial n+ 1. Results indicate that individual differences in SVO modulate FRN responses to Chicken outcomes, and that these neural reactions may have utility in predicting subsequent behaviors. For P300, there is no evidence of SVO modulation. Our general pattern of FRN responsiveness in Pro-Socials, but not in Pro-Selfs, is related to similar findings in fMRI and EEG research.

Objective Identification of Simulated Cochlear Implant Settings in Normal-Hearing Listeners Via Auditory Cortical Evoked Potentials	EAR AND HEARING			English	Article						Auditory evoked potentials; Cochlear implants; EEG classification; Information transfer; Speech confusion matrix; Vocoded speech	CATEGORICAL SPEECH-PERCEPTION; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION RATE; TEMPORAL CUES; BRAIN-STEM; CODING STRATEGIES; SENSITIVE PERIOD; RECOGNITION; USERS; ARTIFACT; RESPONSES	Objectives: Providing cochlear implant (CI) patients the optimal signal processing settings during mapping sessions is critical for facilitating their speech perception. Here, we aimed to evaluate whether auditory cortical event-related potentials (ERPs) could be used to objectively determine optimal CI parameters. Design: While recording neuroelectric potentials, we presented a set of acoustically vocoded consonants (aKa, aSHa, and aNa) to normal-hearing listeners (n = 12) that simulated speech tokens processed through four different combinations of CI stimulation rate and number of spectral maxima. Parameter settings were selected to feature relatively fast/slow stimulation rates and high/low number of maxima; 1800 pps/20 maxima, 1800/8, 500/20 and 500/8. Results: Speech identification and reaction times did not differ with changes in either the number of maxima or stimulation rate indicating ceiling behavioral performance. Similarly, we found that conventional univariate analysis (analysis of variance) of N1 and P2 amplitude/latency failed to reveal strong modulations across CI-processed speech conditions. In contrast, multivariate discriminant analysis based on a combination of neural measures was used to create "neural confusion matrices" and identified a unique parameter set (1800/8) that maximally differentiated speech tokens at the neural level. This finding was corroborated by information transfer analysis which confirmed these settings optimally transmitted information in listeners' neural and perceptual responses. Conclusions: Translated to actual implant patients, our findings suggest that scalp-recorded ERPs might be useful in determining optimal signal processing settings from among a closed set of parameter options and aid in the objective fitting of CI devices.

In this paper we investigated whether musical audiovisual stimulation might trigger the activation of motor information in the brain of professional pianists, due to the presence of permanent gestures/sound associations. At this aim EEG was recorded in 24 pianists and naive participants engaged in the detection of rare targets while watching hundreds of video clips showing a pair of hands in the act of playing, along with a compatible or incompatible piano soundtrack. Hands size and apparent distance allowed self-ownership and agency illusions, and therefore motor simulation. Event-related potentials (ERPs) and relative source reconstruction showed the presence of an Error-related negativity (ERN) to incongruent trials at anterior frontal scalp sites, only in pianists, with no difference in naiive participants. ERN was mostly explained by an anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) source. Other sources included "hands" IT regions, the superior temporal gyrus (STG) involved in conjoined auditory and visuomotor processing, SMA and cerebellum (representing and controlling motor subroutines), and regions involved in body parts representation (somatosensory cortex, uncus, cuneus and precuneus). The findings demonstrate that instrument-specific audiovisual stimulation is able to trigger error shooting and correction neural responses via motor resonance and mirroring, being a possible aid in learning and rehabilitation.

The present study examines the neural correlates of the two factors, using EEG while observers viewed several versions of stereoscopic stimuli, which depicted Panum's limiting case. In these patterns the vertical disparity gradient was varied from 0.1 to 0.6, while the degree of cue conflict was manipulated from low to high. The ERP data showed that the amplitude of the N170 component (exogenous) was modulated by the vertical disparity gradient and cue conflict In contrast, the N270 component (endogenous) was modulated by cue conflict only. Such findings demonstrate that both factors affect the perception of depth in Panum's limiting case, but at different stages: the vertical disparity gradient at an early stage of processing (N170) and cue conflict at two stages (N170 and N270). Hence, vertical disparity gradient is related to low-level visual stimulus parameters and can modulate exogenous component, while cue conflict is related to both exogenous and endogenous components.

The diversity of brain mechanisms involved and the joyful character of playing an instrument make musical instrument training a potential vehicle for neurorehabilitation of motor skills in patients with cerebral palsy (CP). This clinical condition is characterized by motor impairments that can affect, among others, manual function, and limit severely the execution of basic daily activities. In this study, adolescents and adult patients with CP, as well as a group of typically developing children learned to play piano for 4 consecutive weeks, having completed a total of 8 hours of training. For ten of the participants, learning was supported by a special technical system aimed at helping people with sensorimotor deficits to better discriminate fingers and orient themselves along the piano keyboard. Potential effects of piano training were assessed with tests of finger tapping at the piano and tests of perception of vibratory stimulation of fingers, and by measuring neuronal correlates of motor learning in the absence of and after piano training. Results were highly variable especially among participants with CP. Nevertheless, a significant effect of training on the ability to perceive the localization of vibrations over fingers was found. No effects of training on the performance of simple finger tapping sequences at the piano or on motor-associated brain responses were registered. Longer periods of training are likely required to produce detectable changes.

We used three types of ambiguous stimuli and combined EEG and fMRI to examine the neural representation of perceptual decisions under ambiguity. We identified a late positive potential, the LPP, which differentiated levels of ambiguity, and which was specifically associated with behavioral judgments about choices that were ambiguous, rather than passive perception of ambiguous stimuli. Mediation analyses together with two further control experiments confirmed that the LPP was generated only when decisions are made (not during mere perception of ambiguous stimuli), and only when those decisions involved choices on a dimension that is ambiguous. A further control experiment showed that a stronger LPP arose in the presence of ambiguous stimuli compared to when only unambiguous stimuli were present. Source modeling suggested that the LPP originated from multiple loci in cingulate cortex, a finding we further confirmed using fMRI and fMRI-guided ERP source prediction. Taken together, our findings argue for a role of an LPP originating from cingulate cortex in encoding decisions based on task-relevant perceptual ambiguity, a process that may in turn influence confidence judgment, response conflict, and error correction.

Action priming with biomechanically possible and impossible grasps: ERP evidence from 6-month-old infants	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Action priming; infant; EEG	POINTING PERCEPTION; VISUAL-ATTENTION; NEURAL BASIS; GAZE; SHIFTS; POTENTIALS; DIRECTION; ADULTS; EYES	Coding the direction of others' gestures is a fundamental human ability, since it allows the observer to attend and react to sources of potential interest in the environment. Shifts of attention triggered by action observation have been reported to occur early in infancy. Yet, the neurophysiological underpinnings of such action priming and the properties of gestures that might be crucial for it remain unknown. Here, we addressed these issues by recording electroencephalographic activity (EEG) from 6-month-old infants cued with spatially non-predictive hand grasping toward or away from the position of a target object, i.e., valid and invalid trials, respectively. Half of the infants were cued with a gesture executable by a human hand (possible gesture) and the other half with a gesture impossible to be executed by a human hand. Results show that the amplitude enhancement of the posterior N290 component in response to targets in valid trials, as compared to invalid trials, was present only for infants seeing possible gestures, while it was absent for infants seeing impossible gestures. These findings suggest that infants detect the biomechanical properties of human movements when processing hand gestures, relying on this information to orient their visual attention toward the target object.

The P300 signal, an Evoked Related Potential (ERP) devoted to the cognitive brain activity, is induced for purpose by visual stimulation. The EEG data are collected by 6 smart wireless electrodes from the parietal-cortex area and online classified by a linear threshold classifier, basing on a suitable stage of Machine Learning (ML). The ML is implemented on a mu PC dedicated to the system and where the data acquisition and processing is performed. The main improvement in remote driving car by EEG, regards the approach used for the intentions recognition. In this work, the classification is based on the P300 and not just on the average of more not well identify potentials. This approach reduces the number of electrodes on the EEG helmet. The ML stage is based on a custom algorithm (t-RIDE) which tunes the following classification stage on the user's "cognitive chronometry". The ML algorithm starts with a fast calibration phase (just similar to 190s for the first learning). Furthermore, the BCI presents a functional approach for time-domain features extraction, which reduces the amount of data to be analyzed, and then the system response times. In this paper, a proof of concept of the proposed BCI is shown using a prototype car, tested on 5 subjects (aged 26 +/- 3). The experimental results show that the novel ML approach allows a complete P300 spatio-temporal characterization in 1.95s using 38 target brain visual stimuli (for each direction of the car path). In free-drive mode, the BCI classification reaches 80.5 +/- 4.1% on single-trial detection accuracy while the worst-case computational time is 19.65ms +/- 10.1. The BCI system here described can be also used on different mechatronic actuators, such as robots.	[De Venuto, D.; Annese, V.

Alpha frequencies are modulated by working memory load and are used to process information during task switching, however we do not know how this oscillatory network communication is modulated. In order to understand the mechanisms that drive cognitive flexibility, ERPs, oscillatory power and how the communication within these networks is organized are of importance. The EEG data show that during phases reflecting preparatory processes to pre-activate task sets, alpha oscillatory power but not the small world properties of the alpha network architecture was modulated. During the switching only the N2 ERP component showed clear modulations. After the response, alpha oscillatory power reinstates and therefore seems to be important to deactivate or maintain the previous task set. For these reactive control processes the network architecture in terms of small-world properties is modulated. Effects of memory load on small-world aspects were seen in repetition trials, where small-world properties were higher when memory processes were relevant. These results suggest that the alpha oscillatory network becomes more small-world-like when reactive control processes during task switching are less complex.

Continuous regular monitoring, as well as repeated assessment for cerebral complications has become an essential element of the ECMO patient management. Besides well-known complications, like bleeding, ischemic stroke, seizures, and brain hypoperfusion, other less defined yet relevant injury and clinical manifestations are increasingly reported and impacting on ECMO patient prognosis at short term. Furthermore, it is becoming more evident that neurologic complication may not occur only in the early phase. Indeed, other potential adverse events related to the long-term neurocognitive function have been also recently documented either in children or adult ECMO patients. Despite increasing awareness of these aspects, generally accepted protocols and clinical management strategies in this respect are still lacking. Current means to monitor brain perfusion or detecting ongoing cerebral tissue injury are rather limited, and most techniques provide indirect or post-insult recognition of irreversible tissue injury. Continuous monitoring of brain perfusion, serial assessment of brain-derived serum biomarkers, timely neuro-imaging, and post-discharge counselling for neurocognitive dysfunction, particularly in pediatric patients, are novel pathways focusing on neurologic assessment with important implications in daily practice to assess brain function and integrity not only during the ECMO-related hospitalization, but also at long-term to re-evaluate the neuropsychological integrity, although well designed studies will be necessary to elucidate the cost-effectiveness of these management strategies.

While the impact of this treatment on seizures has been established, its impact on human cognition remains equivocal. The goal of this study is to elucidate the immediate effects of vagus nerve stimulation on attention, cognition, and emotional reactivity in patients with epilepsy. Twenty patients (12 male and 8 female; 45 +/- 13years old) treated with VNS due to refractory epilepsy participated in the study. Subjects performed a computer-based test of executive functions embedded with emotional distractors while their brain activity was recorded with electroencephalography. Subjects' cognitive performance, early visual event-related potential N1, and frontal alpha asymmetry were studied when cyclic vagus nerve stimulation was on and when it was off. We found that vagus nerve stimulation improved working memory performance as seen in reduced errors on a subtask that relied on working memory, odds ratio (OR)=0.63 (95% confidence interval, CI [0.47, 0.85]) and increased N1 amplitude, F(1, 15)=10.17, p=.006. In addition, vagus nerve stimulation resulted in longer reaction time, F(1, 16)=8.23, p=.019, and greater frontal alpha asymmetry, F(1, 16)=11.79, p=.003, in response to threat-related distractors. This is the first study to show immediate improvement in working memory performance in humans with clinically relevant vagus nerve stimulation. Furthermore, vagus nerve stimulation had immediate effects on emotional reactivity evidenced in behavior and brain physiology.

However, the neural correlates of memory-related processes remain unclear. In the current EEG study, SMs and control participants performed a digit memory task during which their brain activity was recorded. Chinese SMs used a digit-image mnemonic for encoding digits, in which they associated 2 digit groups with images immediately after the presentation of each even-position digit in sequences. Behaviorally, SMs' memory of digit sequences was better than the controls'. During encoding in the study phase, SMs showed an increased right central P2 (150-250 ms post onset) and a larger right posterior high-alpha (10-14 Hz, 500-1720 ms) oscillation on digits at even-positions compared with digits at odd-positions. Both P2 and high-alpha oscillations in the study phase co-varied with performance in the recall phase, but only in SMs, indicating that neural dynamics during encoding could predict successful retrieval of digit memory in SMs. Our findings suggest that representation of a digit sequence in SMs using mnemonics may recruit both the early-stage attention allocation process and the sustained information preservation process. This study provides evidence for the role of dynamic and efficient neural encoding processes in mnemonists.

The task-switching paradigm is frequently used to investigate this task-set reconfiguration. In the present study, we adopted a novel approach to identify a neural signature of reconfiguration in event-related potentials. Our method was to isolate neural correlates of reconfiguration failure and to use these correlates to reveal the time course of reconfiguration in task switches and task repetitions. We employed a task-switching paradigm in which two types of errors could be distinguished: task errors (the incorrect task was applied) and response errors (an incorrect response for the correct task was provided). Because differential activity between both error types distinguishes successful and failed reconfiguration, this activity could be used as a neural signature of the reconfiguration process. We found that, whereas reconfiguration takes place on task repetitions and task switches, it occurred earlier in the former than in the latter. Single-trial analysis revealed that the same activity predicted the amplitude of error-related brain activity, providing further support that this preparatory activity reflects reconfiguration. Our results implicate that reconfiguration is not switch-specific but that task switches and task repetitions differ with respect to the time course of reconfiguration. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that considering neural correlates of failure is a promising approach to link cognitive mechanisms to specific neural processes.

Neurophysiological Processing of Emotion in Children of Mothers with a History of Depression: the Moderating Role of Preschool Persistent Irritability	JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Offspring; Depression; Irritability; Emotion processing; Event-related potentials	MOOD DYSREGULATION DISORDER; FAMILIAL RISK; LONGITUDINAL ASSOCIATIONS; MATERNAL DEPRESSION; BIPOLAR DISORDER; REACTIVITY; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; ADOLESCENCE; FACES; PREVALENCE	Research on emotion-processing biases in offspring of depressed parents has produced a variety of findings. Child persistent irritability may be a useful clinical feature that demarcates subgroups of offspring with distinct patterns of emotion processing. The present study examined whether early persistent irritability moderated the relationship between maternal lifetime history of a depressive disorder and appetitive- and aversive-emotion processing in 338 never-depressed pre-adolescent children (43.8% female). When children were 3, mothers were interviewed about children's persistent irritability. Six years later, EEG was recorded while children completed a task in which the late positive potential (LPP), a neural index of emotional reactivity, was measured in response to appetitive, aversive, and neutral images. At both assessments, mothers were interviewed about their own psychopathology. Among offspring of depressed mothers, children characterized by high levels of early persistent irritability showed an enhanced LPP to appetitive and aversive compared to neutral images (i.e., Delta LPP), whereas children with low levels of early irritability showed attenuated Delta LPPs. In offspring of mothers with no history of depression, there was no association between irritability and emotion processing. Findings suggest that persistent irritability influences the pattern of emotion-processing aberrations in offspring of depressed mothers.

J	Pomper, U; Chait, M				Pomper, Ulrich; Chait, Maria			The impact of visual gaze direction on auditory object tracking	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; FRONTAL THETA; BAND ACTIVITY; EYE POSITION; MODULATION; VISION; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS; SELECTION	Subjective experience suggests that we are able to direct our auditory attention independent of our visual gaze, e.g when shadowing a nearby conversation at a cocktail party. But what are the consequences at the behavioural and neural level? While numerous studies have investigated both auditory attention and visual gaze independently, little is known about their interaction during selective listening. In the present EEG study, we manipulated visual gaze independently of auditory attention while participants detected targets presented from one of three loudspeakers. We observed increased response times when gaze was directed away from the locus of auditory attention. Further, we found an increase in occipital alpha-band power contralateral to the direction of gaze, indicative of a suppression of distracting input. Finally, this condition also led to stronger central theta-band power, which correlated with the observed effect in response times, indicative of differences in top-down processing. Our data suggest that a misalignment between gaze and auditory attention both reduce behavioural performance and modulate underlying neural processes. The involvement of central theta-band and occipital alpha-band effects are in line with compensatory neural mechanisms such as increased cognitive control and the suppression of task irrelevant inputs.

Design: Systematic review of empirical research in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane from January 2002 to March 2016. Main Measures: Data extracted included sample size, type of electrophysiological technique and task design, rate of cognitive responders, false negatives and positives, and excluded subjects from the study analysis. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) was used for quality appraisal of the retrieved literature. Results: Twenty-four studies examining electrophysiological signs of command-following in patients with DoC were identified. Sensitivity rates in healthy controls demonstrated variable accuracy across the studies, ranging from 71% to 100%. In patients with DoC, specificity and sensitivity rates varied in the included studies, ranging from 0% to 100%. Pronounced heterogeneity was found between studies regarding methodological approaches, task design, and procedures of analysis, rendering comparison between studies challenging. Conclusion: We are still far from establishing precise recommendations for standardized electrophysiological diagnostic procedures in DoC, but electrophysiological methods may add supplemental diagnostic information of covert cognition in some patients with DoC.

The Effects of Methylphenidate on the Neural Signatures of Sustained Attention	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						EEG oscillations; Inattention; Perceptual decision making; Psychostimulants; Ritalin; Time-on-task decrement	DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; ADHD; ATOMOXETINE; MODULATION; CITALOPRAM; ADULTS; SIGNAL; BRAIN; CONNECTIVITY; ACCUMULATION	BACKGROUND: Although it is well established that methylphenidate (MPH) enhances sustained attention, the neural mechanisms underpinning this improvement remain unclear. We examined how MPH influenced known electro-physiological precursors of lapsing attention over different time scales. METHODS: We measured the impact of MPH, compared with placebo, on behavioral and electrocortical markers while healthy adults (n = 40) performed a continuous monitoring paradigm designed to elicit attentional lapses. RESULTS: MPH led to increased rates of target detection, and electrophysiological analyses were conducted to identify the mechanisms underlying these improvements. Lapses of attention were reliably preceded by progressive increases in alpha activity that emerged over periods of several seconds. MPH led to an overall suppression of alpha activity across the entire task but also diminished the frequency of these maladaptive pretarget increases through a reduction of alpha variability. A drug-related linear increase in the amplitude of the frontal P3 event-related component was also observed in the pretarget timeframe (3 or 4 seconds). Furthermore, during immediate target processing, there was a significant increase in the parietal P3 amplitude with MPH, indicative of enhanced perceptual evidence accumulation underpinning target detection. MPH-related enhancements occurred without significant changes to early visual processing (visual P1 and 25-Hz steady-state visual evoked potential). CONCLUSIONS: MPH serves to reduce maladaptive electrophysiological precursors of lapsing attention by acting selectively on top-down endogenous mechanisms that support sustained attention and target detection with no significant effect on bottom-up sensory excitability. These findings offer candidate markers to monitor the therapeutic efficacy of psychostimulants or to predict therapeutic responses.

Distinguishing response to names in Rett and MECP2 Duplication syndrome: An ERP study of auditory social information processing	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Rett; Electroencephalography; MECP2; Auditory processing	SUBJECTS OWN NAME; EYE-TRACKING; MENTAL-RETARDATION; BRAIN RESPONSES; AUTISM; ATTENTION; CHILDREN; PHENOTYPE; FAMILIAR; XQ28	Despite significant advances at the level of basic research, the characterization of higher-level processes in Rett and MECP2 Duplication syndrome remains understudied. In this pilot study, we assessed social emotional information processing by testing whether children (ages 4-12 years) with Rett (n = 9) and MECP2 Duplication syndrome (n = 7) distinguished their own spoken name from other names. We hypothesized that own and familiar names would elicit more positive parietal P300 responses than unknown names, and that the groups would have different neural responses to these stimuli. The MECP2 Duplication group partially mirrored the parietal responses to own name observed in typically developing participants, and better name discrimination correlated with more adaptive behaviors. Conversely, participants with RTT did not resemble the typical group, and showed greater responses to close other names at frontal/central regions. These results may reflect the different consequences of too much (MECP2 Duplication) vs. too little (RTT) MeCP2 protein. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we show in 2 independent experiments that integrative encoding-the ability to form individual and across memory representations during online encoding-is supported by 2 distinct neurophysiological responses. Brain potential is increased gradually during encoding and fit to a trial level memory measure for individual episodes, whereas neural oscillations in the theta range (4-6 Hz) emerge later during learning and predict participants' generalization performance in a subsequent test. These results suggest that integrative encoding requires the recruitment of 2 separate neural mechanisms that, despite their co-occurrence in time, differ in their underlying neural dynamics, reflect different brain learning rates and are supportive of the formation of opposed memory representations, individual versus across-event episodes.

The use of experimental models of epileptogenesis and of drug-resistance is instrumental to select the most promising approaches to explore such biomarkers in the pre-clinical setting for further clinical validation. The approaches most frequently used to find clinically useful biomarkers of epileptogenesis include molecular brain imaging, EEG signal analysis and the measure of soluble molecules in biofluids which may reflect brain intrinsic events involved in epilepsy development. Among those, we focused our attention on proton magnetic resonance imaging (H-1-MRS)-based analysis of astrocytic activation, and related blood biomarkers, since this cell population appears to be pivotally involved in various epileptogenesis processes triggered by differing insults. Moreover, we also investigated behavioral biomarkers by focusing on cognitive dysfunctions since this deficit represents a typical co-morbidity in epilepsy which may manifest even before the onset of spontaneous seizures. In this review article, we will report our recently published evidence supporting the utility of measuring astrocyte activation, the soluble molecules they release, and the associated cognitive deficits during epileptogenesis for early stratification of animals developing epilepsy. We will discuss the potential clinical translation of our findings for enriching the patient population in preventive clinical trials designed to study anti-epileptogenic treatments.

J	Stevens, RH; Galloway, TL				Stevens, Ronald H.; Galloway, Trysha L.			Are Neurodynamic Organizations A Fundamental Property of Teamwork?	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						teamwork; EEG; social coordination; team neurodynamics; information theory; entropy; uncertainty	OSCILLATIONS; COMMUNICATION; CONNECTION	When performing a task it is important for teams to optimize their strategies and actions to maximize value and avoid the cost of surprise. The decisions teams make sometimes have unintended consequences and they must then reorganize their thinking, roles and/or configuration into corrective structures more appropriate for the situation. In this study we ask: What are the neurodynamic properties of these reorganizations and how do they relate to the moment-by-moment, and longer, performance-outcomes of teams?. We describe an information-organization approach for detecting and quantitating the fluctuating neurodynamic organizations in teams. Neurodynamic organization is the propensity of team members to enter into prolonged (minutes) metastable neurodynamic relationships as they encounter and resolve disturbances to their normal rhythms. Team neurodynamic organizations were detected and modeled by transforming the physical units of each team member's EEG power levels into Shannon entropy-derived information units about the team's organization and synchronization. Entropy is a measure of the variability or uncertainty of information in a data stream. This physical unit to information unit transformation bridges micro level social coordination events with macro level expert observations of team behavior allowing multimodal comparisons across the neural, cognitive and behavioral time scales of teamwork. The measures included the entropy of each team member's data stream, the overall team entropy and the mutual information between dyad pairs of the team. Mutual information can be thought of as periods related to team member synchrony. Comparisons between individual entropy and mutual information levels for the dyad combinations of three-person teams provided quantitative estimates of the proportion of a person's neurodynamic organizations that represented periods of synchrony with other team members, which in aggregate provided measures of the overall degree of neurodynamic interactions of the team. We propose that increased neurodynamic organization occurs when a team's operating rhythm can no longer support the complexity of the task and the team needs to expend energy to re-organize into structures that better minimize the "surprise" in the environment. Consistent with this hypothesis, the frequency and magnitude of neurodynamic organizations were less in experienced military and healthcare teams than they were in more junior teams. Similar dynamical properties of neurodynamic organization were observed in models of the EEG data streams of military, healthcare and high school science teams suggesting that neurodynamic organization may be a common property of teamwork. The innovation of this study is the potential it raises for developing globally applicable quantitative models of team dynamics that will allow comparisons to be made across teams, tasks and training protocols.

Does increased pornography exposure alter general emotion processing? Research in the area of pornography use is heavily reliant on conscious self-report measures. However, increasing knowledge indicates that attitudes and emotions are extensively processed on a non-conscious level prior to conscious appraisal. Hence, this exploratory study aimed to investigate whether frequency of pornography use has an impact on non-conscious and/or conscious emotion processes. Participants (N = 52) who reported viewing various amounts of pornography were presented with emotion inducing images. Brain Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) were recorded and Startle Reflex Modulation (SRM) was applied to determine non-conscious emotion processes. Explicit valence and arousal ratings for each image presented were also taken to determine conscious emotion effects. Conscious explicit ratings revealed significant differences with respect to "Erotic" and "Pleasant" valence (pleasantness) ratings depending on pornography use. SRM showed effects approaching significance and ERPs showed changes in frontal and parietal regions of the brain in relation to "Unpleasant" and "Violent" emotion picture categories, which did not correlate with differences seen in the explicit ratings. Findings suggest that increased pornography use appears to have an influence on the brain's non-conscious responses to emotion-inducing stimuli which was not shown by explicit self-report.

Clinical interviews are currently used to identify individuals who have an ultra-high risk (UHR) of developing a psychotic illness with a view to provision of interventions that prevent, delay or reduce severity of future mental health issues. The utility of bio-markers as an adjunct in the identification of UHR individuals is not yet established. Several event-related potential measures, especially mismatch-negativity (MMN), have been identified as potential biomarkers for schizophrenia. In this 12-month longitudinal study, demographic, clinical and neuropsychological data were acquired from 102 anti-psychotic naive UHR and 61 healthy controls, of whom 80 UHR and 58 controls provided valid EEG data during a passive auditory task at baseline. Despite widespread differences between UHR and controls on demographic, clinical and neuropsychological measures, MMN and P3a did not differ between these groups. Of 67 UHR at the 12-month follow-up, 7 (10%) had transitioned to a psychotic illness. The statistical power to detect differences between those who did or did not transition was limited by the lower than expected transition rate. ERPs did not predict transition, with trends in the opposite direction to that predicted. In exploratory analysis, the strongest predictors of transition were measures of verbal memory and subjective emotional disturbance.	[Atkinson, Rebbekah J.; Fulham, W.

All else constant, stimuli previously associated with a high value gain stronger attentional prioritization than stimuli previously associated with a low value. The N2pc, an ERP component indicative of attentional target selection, has been shown to reflect aspects of this prioritization, by changes of mean amplitudes closely corresponding to selective enhancement of high value target processing and suppression of high value distractor processing. What has remained unclear so far is whether the N2pc also reflects the flexible and repeated behavioral adjustments needed in a volatile task environment, in which the values of stimuli are reversed often and unannounced. Using a value-based reversal learning task, we found evidence that the N2pc amplitude flexibly and reversibly tracks value-based choices during the learning of reward associated stimulus colors. Specifically, successful learning of current value-contingencies was associated with reduced N2pc amplitudes, and this effect was more apparent for distractor processing, compared with target processing. In addition, following a value reversal the feedback related negativity (FRN), an ERP component that reflects feedback processing, was amplified and co-occurred with increased N2pc amplitudes in trials following low-value feedback. Importantly, participants that showed the greatest adjustment in N2pc amplitudes based on feedback were also the most efficient learners. These results allow further insight into how changes in attentional prioritization in an uncertain and volatile environment support flexible adjustments of behavior.

J	Jiang, YP; Wu, X; Gao, XR				Jiang, Yunpeng; Wu, Xia; Gao, Xiaorong			A category-specific top-down attentional set can affect the neural responses outside the current focus of attention	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Category-specific attention; Top-down attentional set; SSVEP; ERP	CONTROL SETTINGS; CAPTURE; CONTINGENT; COMPONENT; TOOLBOX; SEARCH; COLOR	A top-down set can guide attention to enhance the processing of task-relevant objects. Many studies have found that the top-down set can be tuned to a category level. However, it is unclear whether the category-specific top-down set involving a central search task can exist outside the current area of attentional focus. To directly probe the neural responses inside and outside the current focus of attention, we recorded continuous EEG to measure the contralateral ERP components for central targets and the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) oscillations associated with a flickering checkerboard placed on the visual periphery. The relationship of color categories between targets and non-targets was manipulated to investigate the effect of category-specific top-down set. Results showed that when the color categories of targets and non-targets in the central search arrays were the same, larger SSVEP oscillations were evoked by target color peripheral checkerboards relative to the non-target color ones outside the current attentional focus. However, when the color categories of targets and non-targets were different, the peripheral checkerboards in two different colors of the same category evoked similar SSVEP oscillations, indicating the effects of category-specific top-down set. These results firstly demonstrate that the category-specific top-down set can affect the neural responses of peripheral distractors. The results could support the idea of a global selection account and challenge the attentional window account in selective attention. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Don't make me angry, you wouldn't like me when I'm angry: Volitional choices to act or inhibit are modulated by subliminal perception of emotional faces	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Cognitive control; Decision-making; Emotion ERP; Priming	FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; ERP COMPONENTS; FEAR; AMYGDALA; STOP; CONSCIOUSNESS; GO/NOGO; BRAIN	Volitional action and self-control-feelings of acting according to one's own intentions and in being control of one's own actions-are fundamental aspects of human conscious experience. However, it is unknown whether high-level cognitive control mechanisms are affected by socially salient but nonconscious emotional cues. In this study, we manipulated free choice decisions to act or withhold an action by subliminally presenting emotional faces: In a novel version of the Go/NoGo paradigm, participants made speeded button-press responses to Go targets, withheld responses to NoGo targets, and made spontaneous, free choices to execute or withhold the response for Choice targets. Before each target, we presented emotional faces, backwards masked to render them nonconscious. In Intentional trials, subliminal angry faces made participants more likely to voluntarily withhold the action, whereas fearful and happy faces had no effects. In a second experiment, the faces were made supraliminal, which eliminated the effects of angry faces on volitional choices. A third experiment measured neural correlates of the effects of subliminal angry faces on intentional choice using EEG. After replicating the behavioural results found in Experiment 1, we identified a frontal-midline theta component-associated with cognitive control processes-which is present for volitional decisions, and is modulated by subliminal angry faces. This suggests a mechanism whereby subliminally presented "threat" stimuli affect conscious control processes. In summary, nonconscious perception of angry faces increases choices to inhibit, and subliminal influences on volitional action are deep seated and ecologically embedded.

Asynchronous brain-computer interface for cognitive assessment in people with cerebral palsy	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						P300; EEG; cognitive assessment; cerebral palsy	MENTAL PROSTHESIS; BCI SYSTEM; CHILDREN; COMMUNICATION; SSVEP; P300	Objective. Typically, clinical measures of cognition require motor or speech responses. Thus, a significant percentage of people with disabilities are not able to complete standardized assessments. This situation could be resolved by employing a more accessible test administration method, such as a brain-computer interface (BCI). A BCI can circumvent motor and speech requirements by translating brain activity to identify a subject's response. By eliminating the need for motor or speech input, one could use a BCI to assess an individual who previously did not have access to clinical tests. Approach. We developed an asynchronous, event-related potential BCI-facilitated administration procedure for the peabody picture vocabulary test (PPVT-IV). We then tested our system in typically developing individuals (N = 11), as well as people with cerebral palsy (N = 19) to compare results to the standardized PPVT-IV format and administration. Main results. Standard scores on the BCI-facilitated PPVT-IV, and the standard PPVT-IV were highly correlated (r = 0.95, p < 0.001), with a mean difference of 2.0 +/- 6.4 points, which is within the standard error of the PPVT-IV. Significance. Thus, our BCI-facilitated PPVT-IV provided comparable results to the standard PPVT-IV, suggesting that populations for whom standardized cognitive tests are not accessible could benefit from our BCI-facilitated approach.

J	Brandt, VC; Stock, AK; Munchau, A; Beste, C				Brandt, Valerie C.; Stock, Ann-Kathrin; Muenchau, Alexander; Beste, Christian			Evidence for enhanced multi-component behaviour in Tourette syndrome - an EEG study	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PARKINSONS-DISEASE; GOAL ACTIVATION; BASAL GANGLIA; RESPONSE SELECTION; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; MECHANISMS; DOPAMINE; STRIATUM; NETWORKS	Evidence suggests that Tourette syndrome is characterized by an increase in dopamine transmission and structural as well as functional changes in fronto-striatal circuits that might lead to enhanced multi-component behaviour integration. Behavioural and neurophysiological data regarding multi-component behaviour was collected from 15 patients with Tourette syndrome (mean age = 30.40 +/- 11.10) and 15 healthy controls (27.07 +/- 5.44), using the stop-change task. In this task, participants are asked to sometimes withhold responses to a Go stimulus (stop cue) and change hands to respond to an alternative Go stimulus (change cue). Different onset asynchronies between stop and change cues were implemented (0 and 300 ms) in order to vary task difficulty. Tourette patients responded more accurately than healthy controls when there was no delay between stop and change stimulus, while there was no difference in the 300 ms delay condition. This performance advantage was reflected in a smaller P3 event related potential. Enhanced multi-component behaviour in Tourette syndrome is likely based on an enhanced ability to integrate information from multiple sources and translate it into an appropriate response sequence.

Sensory attenuation of self-initiated sounds maps onto habitual associations between motor action and sound	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						EEG; Auditory N1; Forward model; Corollary discharge; Sensory attenuation	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; COROLLARY DISCHARGE DYSFUNCTION; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; RESPONSES; SPEECH; SUPPRESSION; MODULATION; TONES; ERPS	Sensory attenuation refers to reduced brain responses to self-initiated sensations relative to those produced by the external world, a distinction that is vital for dynamic motor control and our sense of agency. Typically, willed vocalizations elicit larger N1 reduction of the auditory evoked potential compared to indirectly evoked sounds, such as tones generated by button-presses, which is attributed to the prediction-and cancellation of incoming signals enabled by speech motor commands. However, physical confounds exist, including different stimuli and the increased motor artefact associated with mouth vs. finger movements. The present study investigated N1 attenuation to physically identical sounds evoked by hand, eye, and mouth-initiated movements. Twenty-eight healthy participants had their electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded as they blew into a microphone, pressed a button, or moved their eye to generate a pure tone. We found that N1 and P2 response was most reduced in the blow initiation condition, and that both blow and button-press but not saccade initiated tones elicited significantly reduced N1 and P2 amplitude compared to external initiation. This indicates that the eliciting motor action markedly influences ERP response to auditory stimuli. Given that saccades are never associated with sounds, finger movements sometimes are, and mouth movements often are, the pattern of results suggests that N1 attenuation to self-initiated sounds may depend on existing associations between the initiating action and resultant sensation.

Recently, it has been proposed that three brain regions, i.e., the inferior frontal gyrus (iFg), the anterior insula (aIns), and the anterior intraparietal sulcus (alPs), play an important role in several processing phases of perceptual decision tasks, especially in the preparation, perception and action phases, respectively. However, little is known about hemispheric differences in the activation of these three areas during the transition from perception to action. Many studies have examined how people prepare to stop upcoming responses through both proactive and reactive inhibitory control. Although inhibitory control has been associated with activity in the right prefrontal cortex (PFC), we have previously reported that, during a discriminative response task performed with the right hand, we observed: 1) a bilateral activity in the iFg during the preparation phase, and 2) a left dominant activity in the aIns and alPs during the transition from perception to action, i.e., the so-called stimulus-response mapping. To clarify the hemispheric dominance of these processes, we combined the high temporal resolution of event-related potentials (ERPs) with the high spatial resolution of event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participants performed a discriminative response task (DRT) and a simple response task (SRT) using their non-dominant left hand. We confirmed that proactive inhibitory control originates in the iFg: its activity started one second before the stimulus onset and was released concomitantly to the stimulus appearance. Most importantly, we confirmed the presence of a bilateral iFg activity that seems to reflect a bilateral proactive control rather than a right hemisphere dominance or a stronger control of the hemisphere contralateral to the responding hand. Further, we observed a stronger activation of the left aIns and a right-lateralized activation of the alPs reflecting left hemisphere dominance for stimulus-response mapping finalized to response execution and a contralateral-hand parietal premotor activity, respectively.

Mismatch negativity to pitch pattern deviants in schizophrenia	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory pattern; deviance detection; EEG; long-term schizophrenia	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ACOUSTIC REGULARITIES; BRAIN RESPONSES; MMN; DEFICITS; DYSFUNCTION; FEATURES; IMPAIRMENTS; INFORMATION	Simple mismatch negativity (MMN) to infrequent pitch deviants is impaired in individuals with long-term schizophrenia (Sz). The complex MMN elicited by pattern deviance often manifes is cut from here]->ts later after deviant onset than simple MMN and can ascertain deficits in abstracting relationships between stimuli. Sz exhibit reduced complex MMN, but so far this has only been measured when deviance detection relies on a grouping rule. We measured MMN to deviants in pitch-based rules to see whether MMN is also abnormal in Sz under these conditions. Three experiments were conducted. Twenty-seven Sz and 28 healthy matched controls (HC) participated in Experiments 1 and 2, and 24 Sz and 26 HC participated in Experiment 3. Experiment 1 was a standard pitch MMN task, and Sz showed the expected MMN reduction (115ms) in the simple pitch deviant compared to HC. Experiment 2 comprised standard groups of six tones that ascended in pitch, and deviant groups where the last tone descended in pitch. Complex MMN was late (510ms) and significantly blunted in Sz. Experiment 3 comprised standard groups of 12 tones (six tones ascending in pitch followed by six tones descending in pitch, like a scale), and deviant groups containing two repetitions of six ascending tones (the scale restarted midstream). Complex MMN was also late (460ms) and significantly blunted in Sz. These results identify a late pitch pattern deviance-related MMN that is deficient in schizophrenia. This suggests specific deficits in later more complex deviance detection in schizophrenia for abstract patterns.

The patients in the study, on average, demonstrated lower accuracy than the matched control participants. Patients had a slightly greater incidence of oculomotor limitations, but this did not translate to a measurable difference in task-specific gaze control or performance on any of the tasks. Lower cognitive screen scores were the only clinical characteristic to consistently reduce evoked responses and P300 accuracies across individuals. The late portion of the evoked potential, 500-800 ms after the stimulus, was most strongly associated with cognitive score. The early evoked potential around 170 ms, generated by the face speller, was not as strongly associated with cognition. The results indicate that patients with neurodegenerative disease may fare better using an oddball-based BCI task employing face stimuli due in part to the early evoked response that is less hindered by cognitive impairment.

It provides direct spelling device by non-muscular method for people with severe motor impairments and with limited gaze movement. Brain needs to conduct both stimuli-driven and stimuli-related attention in fast presented BCI paradigms for such BCI speller applications. Few researchers studied the mechanism of brain response to such fast presented BCI applications. In this study, we compared the distribution of brain activation in visual, auditory, and audio-visual combined stimuli paradigms using sLORETA (standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography). Between groups comparisons showed the importance of visual and auditory stimuli in audio-visual combined paradigm. They both contribute to the activation of brain regions, with visual stimuli being the predominate stimuli. Visual stimuli related brain region was mainly located at parietal and occipital lobe, whereas response in frontal-temporal lobes might be caused by auditory stimuli. These regions played an important role in audio-visual bimodal paradigms. These new findings are important for future study of ERP speller as well as the mechanism of fast presented stimuli.

In the absence of verbal report, these nociceptive responses are used as measures of pain sensation in newborn humans, as they are in animals [3, 4]. However, many infants are raised in a physiologically stressful environment, and little is known about the effect of background levels of stress upon their pain responses. In adults, acute physiological stress causes hyperalgesia [5-7], and increased background stress increases pain [8-10], but these data cannot necessarily be extrapolated to infants. Here we have simultaneously measured nociceptive behavior, brain activity, and levels of physiological stress in a sample of 56 newborn human infants aged 36-42 weeks. Salivary cortisol (hypothalamic pituitary axis), heart rate variability (sympathetic adrenal medullary system), EEG event-related potentials (nociceptive cortical activity), and facial expression (behavior) were acquired in individual infants following a clinically required heel lance. We show that infants with higher levels of stress exhibit larger amplitude cortical nociceptive responses, but this is not reflected in their behavior. Furthermore, while nociceptive behavior and cortical activity are normally correlated, this relationship is disrupted in infants with high levels of physiological stress. Brain activity evoked by noxious stimulation is therefore enhanced by stress, but this cannot be deduced from observation of pain behavior. This may be important in the prevention of adverse effects of early repetitive pain on brain development.

Psychophysiological endophenotypes to characterize mechanisms of known schizophrenia genetic loci	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Endophenotypes; gene-based tests; polygenic risk scores; schizophrenia; single variant association	GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; ANTISACCADE PERFORMANCE; BIOLOGICAL RELATIVES; HERITABILITY; VARIANTS; ABNORMALITIES; METAANALYSIS; CONSORTIUM; DISORDERS; BIPOLAR	Background. Endophenotypes are laboratory-based measures hypothesized to lie in the causal chain between genes and clinical disorder, and to serve as a more powerful way to identify genes associated with the disorder. One promise of endophenotypes is that they may assist in elucidating the neurobehavioral mechanisms by which an associated genetic polymorphism affects disorder risk in complex traits. We evaluated this promise by testing the extent to which variants discovered to be associated with schizophrenia through large-scale meta-analysis show associations with psychophysiological endophenotypes. Method. We genome-wide genotyped and imputed 4905 individuals. Of these, 1837 were whole-genome-sequenced at 11x depth. In a community-based sample, we conducted targeted tests of variants within schizophrenia-associated loci, as well as genome-wide polygenic tests of association, with 17 psychophysiological endophenotypes including acoustic startle response and affective startle modulation, antisaccade, multiple frequencies of resting electroencephalogram (EEG), electrodermal activity and P300 event-related potential. Results. Using single variant tests and gene-based tests we found suggestive evidence for an association between contactin 4 (CNTN4) and antisaccade and P300. We were unable to find any other variant or gene within the 108 schizophrenia loci significantly associated with any of our 17 endophenotypes. Polygenic risk scores indexing genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia were not related to any of the psychophysiological endophenotypes after correction for multiple testing. Conclusions. The results indicate significant difficulty in using psychophysiological endophenotypes to characterize the genetically influenced neurobehavioral mechanisms by which risk loci identified in genome-wide association studies affect disorder risk.

Neural reward signals in impulsive individuals exaggerate the difference between immediate and future rewards	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Delayed gratification; ERP; Reward positivity; Impulsivity; Self-control	SELF-CONTROL; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DELAY; FEEDBACK; SENSITIVITY; BEHAVIOR; BRAIN; GRATIFICATION; POSITIVITY; RESPONSES	Waiting for rewards is difficult, and highly impulsive individuals with low self-control have an especially hard time with it. Here, we investigated whether neural responses to rewards in a delayed gratification task predict impulsivity and self-control. The EEG was recorded from participants engaged in a guessing game in which on each trial they could win either a large or small reward, paid either now or after 6 months. Ratings confirmed that participants preferred immediate, large rewards over small, delayed rewards. Electrophysiological reward signals reflecting the difference between immediate and future rewards predicted self-report measures of impulsivity and self-control. Further, these signals were highly reliable across two sessions over a 1-week interval, showing high temporal stability like stable personality traits. These results suggest that greater valuation of immediate rewards causes impulsive individuals to redirect control away from delayed rewards, indicating why it is so hard for them to wait.

Although a few studies have reported evaluating the effectiveness of manual acupuncture or electro-acupuncture by monitoring the P300, research in this field is not yet very active. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of periodic low-frequency electrical stimulation applied to BL62 and KI6 on brain activity by analyzing the P300. Method: The study was conducted as a randomized double-blind test of 55 subjects in their 50s, including 26 males and 29 females. Each subject received 12 sessions of stimulation over a one-month period. In each session, low-frequency electrical stimulation at an average of 24 mu A and 2 Hz was applied to the acupuncture points BL62 and KI6, and event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured before the first session and after the last session of the electrical stimulation. Results: The results of a chi-square test indicated that the double-blind test was conducted correctly. Compared to the Sham group, all the subjects in the Real stimulation group showed a tendency toward a decreasing P300 latency and increasing P300 amplitude after all 12 sessions of stimulation. In the women, the amplitude significantly increased at Fz, Fcz, Cz, Cpz, and Pz. Conclusions: With this experiment, the low-frequency electrical stimulation of two acupuncture points (BL62 and K16) was confirmed to have a positive influence on the prevention of natural cerebral aging.

This is particularly true for continuous and complex stimuli such as speech, in which information is organized into hierarchically embedded structures. Recently, novel metrics for assessing the neural representation of continuous speech have been developed using noninvasive brain recordings that have thus far only been tested during wakefulness. Here we investigated, for the first time, the sleeping brain's capacity to process continuous speech at different hierarchical levels using a newly developed Concurrent Hierarchical Tracking (CHT) approach that allows monitoring the neural representation and processing-depth of continuous speech online. Speech sequences were compiled with syllables, words, phrases, and sentences occurring at fixed time intervals such that different linguistic levels correspond to distinct frequencies. This enabled us to distinguish their neural signatures in brain activity. We compared the neural tracking of intelligible versus unintelligible (scrambled and foreign) speech across states of wakefulness and sleep using high-density EEG in humans. Wefound that neural tracking of stimulus acoustics was comparable across wakefulness and sleep and similar across all conditions regardless of speech intelligibility. In contrast, neural tracking of higher-order linguistic constructs (words, phrases, and sentences) was only observed for intelligible speech during wakefulness and could not be detected at all during nonrapid eye movement or rapid eye movement sleep. These results suggest that, whereas low-level auditory processing is relatively preserved during sleep, higher-level hierarchical linguistic parsing is severely disrupted, thereby revealing the capacity and limits of language processing during sleep.

The N400 in processing repeated name and pronoun anaphors in sentences and discourse	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Anaphor; Reference; Repeated name penalty; Sentence; Discourse; N400; LAN	LEXICAL REPETITION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; COREFERENCE; LANGUAGE; COMPREHENSION; EXPRESSIONS; RESOLUTION; INTEGRATION; POTENTIALS; PREDICTION	We report two EEG/ERP experiments that examined processing of repeated name (e.g., Bill; Experiment 1) and pronoun (e.g., he; Experiment 2) subject anaphors to single antecedents (e.g., Bill) and to antecedents embedded in a conjunction (e.g., Bill and Mary) within sentences and discourses. Experiment 1 replicated previous reports of repeated references to single antecedents eliciting greater N400 negativity than repeated references to conjoined antecedents within sentences, and extended these results to cross sentence (discourse) references. Experiment 2 found that pronouns also elicited greater N400 negativity following single than conjoined antecedents. In both experiments, references to conjoined antecedents elicited greater frontal negativity than references to single antecedents in both sentences and discourse. Our results indicate that, in processing subject anaphors, the N400 is an index of reference predictability rather than a marker of the fit between antecedent salience and reference form, and that frontal negativity marks referential ambiguity elicited by conjoined phrases.

Cognitive deficits are among the most disabling consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI), leading to long-term outcomes and interfering with the individual's recovery. One of the most effective ways to reduce the impact of cognitive disturbance in everyday life is cognitive rehabilitation, which is based on the principles of brain neuroplasticity and restoration. Although there are many studies in the literature focusing on the effectiveness of cognitive interventions in reducing cognitive deficits following TBI, only a few of them focus on neural modifications induced by cognitive treatment. The use of neuroimaging or neurophysiological measures to evaluate brain changes induced by cognitive rehabilitation may have relevant clinical implications, since they could add individualized elements to cognitive assessment. Nevertheless, there are no review studies in the literature investigating neuroplastic changes induced by cognitive training in TBI individuals. Objective. Due to lack of data, the goal of this article is to review what is currently known on the cerebral modifications following rehabilitation programs in chronic TBI. Methods. Studies investigating both the functional and structural neural modifications induced by cognitive training in TBI subjects were identified from the results of database searches. Forty-five published articles were initially selected. Of these, 34 were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. Results. Eleven studies were found that focused solely on the functional and neurophysiological changes induced by cognitive rehabilitation. Conclusions. Outcomes showed that cerebral activation may be significantly modified by cognitive rehabilitation, in spite of the severity of the injury.

Proactive Control: Neural Oscillatory Correlates of Conflict Anticipation and Response Slowing	ENEURO			English	Article						Bayesian model; Electroencephalogram (EEG); neural oscillation; proactive control; stop-signal task	STOP-SIGNAL TASK; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SUPPLEMENTARY EYE FIELD; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; HUMAN BRAIN; INHIBITORY CONTROL; PREDICTION ERROR; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS	Proactive control allows us to anticipate environmental changes and adjust behavioral strategy. In the laboratory, investigators have used a number of different behavioral paradigms, including the stop-signal task (SST), to examine the neural processes of proactive control. Previous functional MRI studies of the SST have demonstrated regional responses to conflict anticipation-the likelihood of a stop signal or P(stop) as estimated by a Bayesian model-and reaction time (RT) slowing and how these responses are interrelated. Here, in an electrophysiological study, we investigated the time-frequency domain substrates of proactive control. The results showed that conflict anticipation as indexed by P(stop) was positively correlated with the power in low-theta band (3-5 Hz) in the fixation (trial onset)-locked interval, and go-RT was negatively correlated with the power in delta-theta band (2-8 Hz) in the go-locked interval. Stimulus prediction error was positively correlated with the power in the low-beta band (12-22 Hz) in the stop-locked interval. Further, the power of the P(stop) and go-RT clusters was negatively correlated, providing a mechanism relating conflict anticipation to RT slowing in the SST. Source reconstruction with beamformer localized these time-frequency activities close to brain regions as revealed by functional MRI in earlier work. These are the novel results to show oscillatory electrophysiological substrates in support of trial-by-trial behavioral adjustment for proactive control.

The current study used concurrent EEG-fMRI recordings to identify large-scale network interactions involved in the amplification of visual cortical activity when viewing aversively conditioned cues. To generate a continuous neural signal from pericalcarine visual cortex, we presented rhythmic (10/sec) phase-reversing gratings, the orientation of which predicted the presence (CS+) or absence (CS-) of a cutaneous electric shock (i.e., the unconditioned stimulus). The resulting single trial steady-state visual evoked potential (ssVEP) amplitude was regressed against the whole-brain BOLD signal, resulting in a measure of ssVEP-BOLD coupling. Across all trial types, ssVEP-BOLD coupling was observed in both primary and extended visual cortical regions, the rolandic operculum, as well as the thalamus and bilateral hippocampus. For CS+ relative to CS- trials during the conditioning phase, BOLD-alone analyses showed CS+ enhancement at the occipital pole, superior temporal sulci, and the anterior insula bilaterally, whereas ssVEP-BOLD coupling was greater in the pericalcarine cortex, inferior parietal cortex, and middle frontal gyrus. Dynamic causal modeling analyses supported connectivity models in which heightened activity in pericalcarine cortex for threat (CS+) arises from cortico-cortical top-down modulation, specifically from the middle frontal gyrus. No evidence was observed for selective pericalcarine modulation by deep cortical structures such as the amygdala or anterior insula, suggesting that the heightened engagement of pericalcarine cortex for threat stimuli is mediated by cortical structures that constitute key nodes of canonical attention networks.

Combating the scientific decline effect with confidence (intervals)	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Analysis/statistical methods; EEG; ERPs; MEG; EMG; Methods	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; MASS UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS; BRAIN; DIFFERENCE; POWER	A symptom of the need for greater reproducibility in scientific practice is the decline effect-the fact that the size of many experimental effects decline with subsequent study or fail to replicate entirely. A simple way to combat this problem is for scientists to more routinely use confidence intervals (CIs) in their work. CIs provide frequentist bounds on the true size of an effect and can reveal when a statistically significant effect is possibly too small to be reliable or when a large effect might have been missed due to insufficient statistical power. CIs are often lacking in psychophysiological reports, likely due to the large number of dependent variables, which complicates deriving and visualizing CIs. In this article, I explain the value of CIs and show how to compute them for analyses involving multiple variables in various ways that adjust the intervals for the greater uncertainty induced by multiple statistical comparisons. The methods are illustrated using a basic visual oddball ERP dataset and freely available MATLAB software.

One such treatment approach, attention bias modification training (ABMT), targets the anxiety-related threat bias, a disruption in attention to and neural processing of threat-related information. It remains unclear, however, whether reducing treatment barriers via mobile delivery of ABMT is effective and whether ABMT efficacy varies depending on individual differences in neural processing of threat. The present study tested whether mobile, gamified ABMT reduced prenatal threat bias, anxiety and stress, and whether ABMT efficacy varied with individual differences in neural responses to threat. Participants were 29 women in their 19th-29th week of pregnancy, randomized to four weeks of an ABMT or placebo training (PT) version of the mobile app using a double-blind design. Self-report of anxiety, depression, and stress were obtained; salivary cortisol was collected at home and in lab in response to stressors to index biological stress reactivity. Threat bias was measured using a computerized attention assay during which EEG was recorded to generate event-related potentials (ERPs) to threat cues. Results showed lower levels of lab cortisol following ABMT versus PT. Although the main effect of ABMT on subjective anxiety was not significant, the magnitude of cortisol reduction was correlated with lower levels of subjective anxiety and threat bias. Those receiving ABMT also reported less anxiety when showing smaller ERPs to threat (P1, P2) prior to training, but, conversely reported more anxiety when showing larger ERPs to threat. Use of gamified, mobile ABMT reduced biobehavioral indices of prenatal stress and anxiety, but effects on anxiety varied with individual differences in cortisol response and neurocognitive indices of early attention to threat.

The current study examined differences in electroencephalographic theta and alpha power related to cognitive control processes involving response execution and response inhibition in 22 individuals with aMCI and 22 age-, sex-, and education-matched cognitively normal controls. Two Go/NoGo tasks involving semantic categorization were used. In the basic categorization task, Go/NoGo responses were made based on exemplars of a single car (Go) and a single dog (NoGo). In the superordinate categorization task, responses were made based on multiple exemplars of objects (Go) and animals (NoGo). Behavioral data showed that the aMCI group had more false alarms during the NoGo trials compared to controls. The EEG data revealed between group differences related to response type in theta (4-7 Hz) and low-frequency alpha (8-10 Hz) power. In particular, the aMCI group differed from controls in theta power during the NoGo trials at frontal and parietal electrodes, and in low-frequency alpha power during Go trials at parietal electrodes. These results suggest that alterations in theta power converge with behavioral deterioration in response inhibition, whereas alterations in low-frequency alpha power appear to precede behavioral changes in response execution. Both behavioral and electrophysiological correlates combined provide a more comprehensive characterization of cognitive control deficits in aMCI.

Homeostatic plasticity in human extrastriate cortex following a simulated peripheral scotoma	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; ERP; P1; Visual plasticity; Homeostatic plasticity; Disinhibition	PERCEPTUAL FILLING-IN; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; RECEPTIVE-FIELD EXPANSION; MACULAR DEGENERATION; RETINAL LESIONS; ADULT CAT; CORTICAL REORGANIZATION; ARTIFICIAL SCOTOMAS; STRIATE CORTEX; TOPOGRAPHIC REORGANIZATION	Neuroimaging and patient work over the past decade have indicated that, following retinal deafferentation, the human visual cortex undergoes a large-scale and enduring reorganization of its topography such that the classical retinotopic organization of deafferented visual cortex remaps to represent non-classical regions of visual space. Such long-term visual reorganization is proposed to occur through changes in the functional balance of deafferented visual circuits that engage more lasting changes through activity-dependent neuroplasticity. Here, we investigated the short-term changes in functional balance (short-term plasticity; homeostatic plasticity) that occur within deafferented human visual cortices. We recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) while observers were conditioned for 6 s with a simulated retinal scotoma (artificial scotoma) positioned 8.0A degrees in the periphery. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) evoked by the onset of sinusoidal visual probes that varied in their tilt were used to examine changes in cortical excitability within and around cortical representations of the simulated scotoma. Psychophysical orientation functions obtained from discrimination of visual probe tilt were used to examine alterations in the stimulus selectivity within the scotoma representations. Consistent with a mechanism of homeostatic disinhibition, an early extrastriate component of the VEP (the early phase P1) exhibited increased amplitude following the condition with a simulated scotoma relative to a stimulus-matched control condition. This increased visual cortical response was associated with a reduction in the slope of the psychophysical orientation function, suggesting a broader tuning of neural populations within scotoma representations. Together, these findings support a mechanism of disinhibition in promoting visual plasticity and topographical reorganization.

Because of their increased risk of exposure to dangerous levels of prolonged noise and transient explosive blast events, communication problems in these soldiers could be due to either hearing loss (traditional or "hidden") in the auditory sensory periphery or from blast-induced injury to cortical networks associated with attention. We found that out of the 14 blast-exposed Service Members recruited for this study, 12 had hearing thresholds in the normal to near-normal range. A majority of these participants reported having problems specifically related to failures with selective attention. Envelope following responses (EFRs) measuring neural coding fidelity of the auditory brainstem to suprathreshold sounds were similar between blast-exposed and non-blast controls. Blast-exposed subjects performed substantially worse than non-blast controls in an auditory selective attention task in which listeners classified the melodic contour (rising, falling, or "zig-zagging") of one of three simultaneous, competing tone sequences. Salient pitch and spatial differences made for easy segregation of the three concurrent melodies. Poor performance in the blast-exposed subjects was associated with weaker evoked response potentials (ERPs) in frontal EEG channels, as well as a failure of attention to enhance the neural responses evoked by a sequence when it was the target compared to when it was a distractor. These results suggest that communication problems in these listeners cannot be explained by compromised sensory representations in the auditory periphery, but rather point to lingering blast-induced damage to cortical networks implicated in the control of attention. Because all study participants also suffered from post-traumatic disorder (PTSD), follow-up studies are required to tease apart the contributions of PTSD and blast-induced injury on cognitive performance.

Quite often, this requires the integration of information derived from different sensory modalities. Children are less likely to integrate information from different modalities and, at the same time, also do not command fully developed executive functions, as compared to adults. Yet still, the role of developmental age-related effects on multisensory integration processes has not been examined within the context of multicomponent behavior until now (i.e., the concatenation of different executive subprocesses). This is problematic because differences in multisensory integration might actually explain a significant amount of the developmental effects that have traditionally been attributed to changes in executive functioning. In a system, neurophysiological approach combining electroencephaloram (EEG) recordings and source localization analyses, we therefore examined this question. The results show that differences in how children and adults accomplish multicomponent behavior do not solely depend on developmental differences in executive functioning. Instead, the observed developmental differences in response selection processes (reflected by the P3 ERP) were largely dependent on the complexity of integrating temporally separated stimuli from different modalities. This effect was related to activation differences in medial frontal and inferior parietal cortices. Primary perceptual gating or attentional selection processes (P1 and N1 ERPs) were not affected. The results show that differences in multisensory integration explain parts of transformations in cognitive processes between childhood and adulthood that have traditionally been attributed to changes in executive functioning, especially when these require the integration of multiple modalities during response selection.

This study examined the processing of emotional faces in typically developing adults with high and low levels of autistic traits (measured using the Autism Spectrum Quotient-AQ). Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during viewing of backward-masked neutral, fearful and happy faces presented under two conditions: subliminal (16 ms, below the level of visual conscious awareness) and supraliminal (166 ms, above the time required for visual conscious awareness). Individuals with low and high AQ differed in the processing of subliminal faces, with the low AQ group showing an enhanced N2 amplitude for subliminal happy faces. Some group differences were found in the condition effects, with the Low AQ showing shorter frontal P3b and N4 latencies for subliminal vs. supraliminal condition. Although results did not show any group differences on the face-specific N170 component, there were shorter N170 latencies for supraliminal vs. subliminal conditions across groups. The results observed on the N2, showing group differences in subliminal emotion processing, suggest that decreased sensitivity to the reward value of social stimuli is a common feature both of people with ASD as well as people with high autistic traits from the normal population.

The purposes of this pilot study were to assess and to compare immediate behavioral auditory working memory and electrophysiologic effects of three different, randomized, conditions of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (LDLPFC) transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied to four neurotypical adults and four adults with chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI). Materials/methods: Pre- and post-anodal, cathodal, and sham tDCS auditory memory performance, auditory event-related potentials (P300 amplitude and latency) and power of alpha and theta EEG bands were measured across individuals in each group. Results: Post-anodal tDCS only, the neurotypical and TBI groups both demonstrated significantly improved immediate auditory memory function. Also post-anodal tDCS, the TBI group demonstrated significantly increased P300 amplitude versus post-sham tDCS. The neurotypical group demonstrated no pre- post-tDCS electrophysiologic changes across conditions. Conclusions: These findings are consistent with findings of other studies of immediate tDCS effects on other types of memory in neurotypical individuals and in individuals with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and stroke and suggest that individuals with memory impairments second to chronic TBI may benefit from LDLPFC anodal tDCS. Pairing tDCS with traditional behavioral memory interventions may facilitate TBI rehabilitation outcomes and warrants continued investigation.

However, recent findings provide compelling evidence of cortical involvement during balance reactions evoked by whole-body postural perturbations. In humans, an external perturbation elicits an evoked potential, termed the perturbation-evoked potential (PEP). PEPs are widely distributed over fronto-centro-parietal areas with maximal amplitude at the FCz/Cz electrode. From our literature review it is evident that the PEPs are comprised of a small positive potential (P1) that peaks around 30-90 ms after perturbation onset, a large negative potential (N1) that peaks around 90-160 ms, followed by positive (P2) and negative (N2) potentials between 200 and 400 ms. Converging results across multiple studies suggest that these different PEP components are influenced by perturbation characteristics, postural set, environmental, and psychological factors. This review summarizes and integrates seminal research on the PEP, with a special emphasis on the PEP N1. Implications for future studies in PEP research are discussed to encourage further empirical investigation of PEP characteristics in healthy and patient populations.

The aim of this work was to investigate if there exists neural evidence for such a process i.e. automatic, unattended detection of overall statistical differences between scenes. In order to do this, Visual Mismatch Negativity (vMMN), an early evoked neural response component, was measured. We presented a sequence of sets of oriented patterns of a given (random) mean orientation and varied the variance of the orientations of the patterns, so that some sets contained similar orientations (ordered) or the orientations were random (disordered). These two types of sets of patterns were presented in an oddball sequence such that one type occurred often and the other was a rare, unexpected stimulus. We found a significant vMMN in response to a randomly oriented stimulus amongst more ordered stimuli, which suggested that humans perceive 'ordered' vs 'disordered' scenes categorically. We conclude that by manipulating the variance of the orientations contained within each stimulus we are able to show that this property is automatically encoded in visual neural response.

However, the potential impact of this mechanism in cognitive performance is not fully explored. Since the main consequence of E/I dysfunction is an impairment in oscillatory activity and its underlying cognitive computations, we assessed the electroencephalographic activity of ASD and typically developing (TD) subjects during a working-memory task. We found that ASD subjects committed more errors than TD subjects. Moreover, TD subjects demonstrated a parametric modulation in the power of alpha and theta band while ASD subjects did not demonstrate significant modulations. The preceding leads to significant differences between the groups in both the alpha power placed on the occipital cortex and the theta power placed on the left premotor and the right prefrontal cortex. The impaired theta modulation correlated with autistic symptoms. The results indicated that ASD may present an alteration in the recruitment of the oscillatory activity during working-memory, and this alteration could be related to the physiopathology of the disorder.

Dysregulation of gene expression in a patient with depressive disorder after transient ischemic attack confirmed by a neurophysiological neuromarker	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Depressive disorder; Aphasia; Marker genes; HSP; Interleukins	ANTIOXIDANT DIET SUPPLEMENTATION; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; POSTSTROKE DEPRESSION; STROKE; ASSOCIATION; ANXIETY; STRESS; SYMPTOMS; DISEASE; UPDATE	The aim of this study was to evaluate dysregulation of gene expression associated with the cellular stress response in a patient with a post-"warning stroke" depressive disorder confirmed by the presence of a neurophysiological neuromarker through the use of quantitative EEG and event-related potentials. The patient was tested for seven genes associated with the stress reaction: HSPA1A, HSPB1, IL6, IL10, CRP, and HSF-1 along with NF-kappa B, compared to gene expression in health controls. A 54-year-old patient with a past history of schizophrenia (at the age of 20), and of transient ischemic attack (at the age of 53) and depressive disorder confirmed by functional, cognitive, emotional, and affectional diagnostics underwent additional testing for expression of the genes associated with stress response. The expression of genes coding for heat shock protein (HSPA1A, HSPB1), interleukins (IL6, IL10), and C-reactive protein was tested along with factors that regulate their expression. The results of the tests conducted on this patient were compared with 42 healthy control subjects. Diagnostic testing revealed upregulation in expression of these genes, presenting as increased expression of the target genes and of the regulatory genes. A post-"warning stroke" depressive disorder appears to be associated with overexpression of the genes coding for HSP and interleukins. Further research on larger groups of people may provide grounds for treatment modification.

Phonological and semantic processing during comprehension in Wernicke's aphasia: An N400 and Phonological Mapping Negativity Study	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Language comprehension; Stroke; Aphasia; Wernicke's aphasia; Speech perception; Semantics; Semantic access; N400; PMN; Phonological processing	SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; AUDITORY COMPREHENSION; COMPETING SPEECH; WORD; DEFICITS; PHONEME; INTEGRATION; COMPONENT; DEMENTIA; ACCOUNT	Comprehension impairments in Wernicke's aphasia are thought to result from a combination of impaired phonological and semantic processes. However, the relationship between these cognitive processes and language comprehension has only been inferred through offline neuropsychological tasks. This study used ERPs to investigate phonological and semantic processing during online single word comprehension. EEG was recorded in a group of Wernicke's aphasia n = 8 and control participants n = 10 while performing a word-picture verification task. The N400 and Phonological Mapping Negativity/Phonological Mismatch Negativity (PMN) event-related potential components were investigated as an index of semantic and phonological processing, respectively. Individuals with Wernicke's aphasia displayed reduced and inconsistent N400 and PMN effects in comparison to control participants. Reduced N400 effects in the WA group were simulated in the control group by artificially degrading speech perception. Correlation analyses in the Wernicke's aphasia group found that PMN but not N400 amplitude was associated with behavioural word-picture verification performance. The results confirm impairments at both phonological and semantic stages of comprehension in Wernicke's aphasia. However, reduced N400 responses in Wernicke's aphasia are at least partially attributable to earlier phonological processing impairments. The results provide further support for the traditional model of Wernicke's aphasia which claims a causative link between phonological processing and language comprehension impairments.

J	Fornaciai, M; Park, J				Fornaciai, Michele; Park, Joonkoo			Distinct Neural Signatures for Very Small and Very Large Numerosities	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						event-related potentials; approximate number system; numerosity processing; subitizing; texture-density	TEXTURE DENSITY ADAPTATION; APPROXIMATE NUMBER SYSTEM; VISUAL NUMBER; OBJECT RECOGNITION; REPRESENTATION; BRAIN; DISCRIMINATION; PSYCHOPHYSICS; PERCEPTION; MECHANISMS	Behavioral studies of numerical cognition have shown that perceptual threshold for numerosity discrimination depends on the range of numerical values to be estimated. Discrimination threshold is constant when comparing very small numerosities via the mechanism called subitizing, while it increases as a function of numerosity for numbers beyond that range governed by subitizing. However, when numerosity gets so large that the individual elements start to form a cluttered ensemble, discrimination threshold increases as a function of the square root of numerosity. These behavioral patterns suggest that our sense of number is not based on a unitary mechanism and is rather based on multiple numerosity processing mechanisms depending on the absolute numerosity to be estimated. In this study, we demonstrate neurophysiological evidence for such multiple mechanisms. Participants electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded while they viewed arrays containing either very small (14) or very large (100400) number of dots with systematic variations in non-numerical cues. A linear model that tested the effects of numerical and non-numerical cues on the visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) revealed strong neural sensitivity to numerosity around 160180 ms over right occipito-parietal sites irrespective of the numerical range presented. In contrast, earlier neural responses (similar to 100 ms) showed markedly distinct patterns across the different numerical ranges tested. These results indicate that differences in behavioral response patterns in numerosity estimation across various numerical ranges may arise from the differences in the first stages of visual analysis. Collectively, the findings provide a firmer ground for the idea that there exists a brain system specifically dedicated for numerosity processing, yet they also suggest that multiple early visual cortical mechanisms converge to that numerosity processing stage later in the visual stream.

J	Bidelman, GM; Yellamsetty, A				Bidelman, Gavin M.; Yellamsetty, Anusha			Noise and pitch interact during the cortical segregation of concurrent speech	HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG/ERPs; Double-vowel segregation; F0-benefit; Speech-in-noise perception; Neural classification	AUDITORY BRAIN-STEM; BACKGROUND-NOISE; HEARING-LOSS; VOWEL IDENTIFICATION; NEURAL ORGANIZATION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PERCEPTION; AGE; REPRESENTATION; EXPERIENCE	Behavioral studies reveal listeners exploit intrinsic differences in voice fundamental frequency (F0) to segregate concurrent speech sounds-the so-called "F0-benefit." More favorable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the environment, an extrinsic acoustic factor, similarly benefits the parsing of simultaneous speech. Here, we examined the neurobiological substrates of these two cues in the perceptual segregation of concurrent speech mixtures. We recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) while listeners performed a speeded double-vowel identification task. Listeners heard two concurrent vowels whose F0 differed by zero or four semitones presented in either clean (no noise) or noise-degraded (+5 dB SNR) conditions. Behaviorally, listeners were more accurate in correctly identifying both vowels for larger F0 separations but F0-benefit was more pronounced at more favorable SNRs (i.e., pitch x SNR interaction). Analysis of the ERPs revealed that only the P2 wave (similar to 200 ms) showed a similar F0 x SNR interaction as behavior and was correlated with listeners' perceptual F0-benefit. Neural classifiers applied to the ERPs further suggested that speech sounds are segregated neurally within 200 ms based on SNR whereas segregation based on pitch occurs later in time (400-700 ms). The earlier timing of extrinsic SNR compared to intrinsic F0-based segregation implies that the cortical extraction of speech from noise is more efficient than differentiating speech based on pitch cues alone, which may recruit additional cortical processes. Findings indicate that noise and pitch differences interact relatively early in cerebral cortex and that the brain arrives at the identities of concurrent speech mixtures as early as similar to 200 ms.

The Role of Musical Experience in Hemispheric Lateralization of Global and Local Auditory Processing	PERCEPTION			English	Article						attention; audition; global; hemispheric lateralization; local; musical experience; P300	DIFFERENT COMPONENTS; FACE RECOGNITION; ERP EVIDENCE; PRECEDENCE; BRAIN; TASK; MECHANISMS; FREQUENCY; ATTENTION; STIMULI	The global precedence effect is a phenomenon in which global aspects of visual and auditory stimuli are processed before local aspects. Individuals with musical experience perform better on all aspects of auditory tasks compared with individuals with less musical experience. The hemispheric lateralization of this auditory processing is less well-defined. The present study aimed to replicate the global precedence effect with auditory stimuli and to explore the lateralization of global and local auditory processing in individuals with differing levels of musical experience. A total of 38 college students completed an auditory-directed attention task while electroencephalography was recorded. Individuals with low musical experience responded significantly faster and more accurately in global trials than in local trials regardless of condition, and significantly faster and more accurately when pitches traveled in the same direction (compatible condition) than when pitches traveled in two different directions (incompatible condition) consistent with a global precedence effect. In contrast, individuals with high musical experience showed less of a global precedence effect with regards to accuracy, but not in terms of reaction time, suggesting an increased ability to overcome global bias. Further, a difference in P300 latency between hemispheres was observed. These findings provide a preliminary neurological framework for auditory processing of individuals with differing degrees of musical experience.

Involvement of the anterior cingulate cortex in time-based prospective memory task monitoring: An EEG analysis of brain sources using Independent Component and Measure Projection Analysis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							WORKING-MEMORY; MULTIPROCESS FRAMEWORK; DYNAMICS; INTERFERENCE; INTENTION; MODEL; REHABILITATION; PERFORMANCE; DEMANDS; COST	Objective Time-based prospective memory (PM), remembering to do something at a particular moment in the future, is considered to depend upon self-initiated strategic monitoring, involving a retrieval mode (sustained maintenance of the intention) plus target checking (intermittent time checks). The present experiment was designed to explore what brain regions and brain activity are associated with these components of strategic monitoring in time-based PM tasks. Method 24 participants were asked to reset a clock every four minutes, while performing a foreground ongoing word categorisation task. EEG activity was recorded and data were decomposed into source-resolved activity using Independent Component Analysis. Common brain regions across participants, associated with retrieval mode and target checking, were found using Measure Projection Analysis. Results Participants decreased their performance on the ongoing task when concurrently performed with the time-based PM task, reflecting an active retrieval mode that relied on withdrawal of limited resources from the ongoing task. Brain activity, with its source in or near the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), showed changes associated with an active retrieval mode including greater negative ERP deflections, decreased theta synchronization, and increased alpha suppression for events locked to the ongoing task while maintaining a time-based intention. Activity in the ACC was also associated with time-checks and found consistently across participants; however, we did not find an association with time perception processing per se. Conclusion The involvement of the ACC in both aspects of time-based PM monitoring may be related to different functions that have been attributed to it: strategic control of attention during the retrieval mode (distributing attentional resources between the ongoing task and the time-based task) and anticipatory/decision making processing associated with clock-checks.

J	Wu, ZH; Wu, Z				Wu, Zhenghua; Wu, Zheng			Functional symmetry of the primary visual pathway evidenced by steady-state visual evoked potentials	BRAIN RESEARCH BULLETIN			English	Article						Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP); Primary visual pathway; Primary visual cortex; Functional symmetry; Hemicerebrum	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE	The primary visual pathway exhibits a symmetrical anatomical structure, initially arising from the left and right retinas, passing through the lateral geniculate nucleus, and finally projecting to the left and right primary visual cortices. However, to our knowledge, studies based on scalp EEG have not provided adequate evidence of the functional symmetry of the primary visual pathway, as the usual visual ERP is often related to other higher-level brain areas. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) can be considered as the direct response of the primary visual pathway to a repetitive stimulus, with a very limited correlation with responses of higher-level brain areas. Therefore, SSVEPs can be used to evaluate the functional symmetry of the primary visual pathway. In this study, we draw a comparison among the powers and distributions of SSVEPs of different frequencies when the left or right eye alone is stimulated, and when both the eyes are stimulated together. Our results indicate that the primary visual pathway is almost symmetrical in generating SSVEPs from either eye and that there is some functional interaction between the left and right primary visual pathways.

Goals and strategies influence lexical prediction during sentence comprehension	JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Prediction; Anticipation; Automaticity; N400; Post-N400 positivity; Self-paced reading	LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; EYE-MOVEMENTS; PROCESSING PREDICTION; SPREADING ACTIVATION; ATTENTIONAL CONTROL; ERP COMPONENTS; CONTEXT; PREDICTABILITY; N400; MEMORY	Predictive processing is a critical component of language comprehension, but exactly how and why comprehenders generate lexical predictions remains to be determined. Here, we present two experiments suggesting that lexical prediction is influenced by top-down comprehension strategies, and that lexical predictions are not always generated automatically as a function of the preceding context. In Experiment 1 (N = 24), participants read predictable and unpredictable sentence-final words while EEG was recorded from the scalp. When comparing two different sets of task instructions, the neural effects of doze probability were enhanced when predictive processing was emphasized. In Experiment 2 (N = 252), participants read predictable and unpredictable sentence continuations in a self-paced reading task, and the overall validity of predictive Cues was manipulated across groups using a separate set of filler sentences. There was a linear relationship between the benefits of a constraining sentence context and the global validity of predictive cues. Critically, no reading time benefits were observed as prediction validity approached zero. These results provide important constraints for theories of anticipatory language processing, while calling into question prior assumptions about the automaticity of lexical prediction.

High Order Stable Infinite Impulse Response Filter Design Using Cuckoo Search Algorithm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUTOMATION AND COMPUTING			English	Article						Cuckoo search algorithm; infinite impulse response (IIR); means square error (MSE); evolutionary algorithm; stability	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; ARTIFICIAL BEE COLONY; IIR FILTER; FIR FILTER; EEG/ERP; NOISE	In this paper, an efficient technique for optimal design of digital infinite impulse response (IIR) filter with minimum passband error (e(p)), minimum stopband error (e(s)), high stopband attenuation (A(s)), and also free from limit cycle effect is proposed using cuckoo search (CS) algorithm. In the proposed method, error function, which is multi-model and non-differentiable in the heuristic surface, is constructed as the mean squared difference between the designed and desired response in frequency domain, and is optimized using CS algorithm. Computational efficiency of the proposed technique for exploration in search space is examined, and during exploration, stability of filter is maintained by considering lattice representation of the denominator polynomials, which requires less computational complexity as well as it improves the exploration ability in search space for designing higher filter taps. A comparative study of the proposed method with other algorithms is made, and the obtained results show that 90% reduction in errors is achieved using the proposed method. However, computational complexity in term of CPU time is increased as compared to other existing algorithms.

Selective violation of expectations can add to aesthetic response but radical or frequent violations are likely to be disliked or not comprehended. In this study we investigated whether a lifetime of exposure to music among untrained older adults would enhance their reaction to unexpected endings of unfamiliar melodies. Older and younger adults listened to melodies that had expected or unexpected ending notes, according to Western music theory. Ratings of goodness-of-fit were similar in the groups, as was ERP response to the note onset (N1). However, in later time windows (P200 and Late Positive Component), the amplitude of a response to unexpected and expected endings was both larger in older adults, corresponding to greater sensitivity, and more widespread in locus, consistent with a dedifferentiation pattern. Lateralization patterns also differed. We conclude that older adults refine their understanding of this important aspect of music throughout life, with the ability supported by changing patterns of neural activity. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Endophenotype research is being oversold for its potential to help discover psychopathology relevant genes using the types of small samples feasible for electrophysiological research. This is largely because the genetic architecture of endophenotypes appears to be very much like that of behavioral traits and disorders: they are complex, influenced by many variants (e.g., tens of thousands) within many genes, each contributing a very small effect. Out of over 40 electrophysiological endophenotypes covered by our review, only resting heart, a measure that has received scant advocacy as an endophenotype, emerges as an electrophysiological variable with verified associations with molecular genetic variants. To move the field forward, investigations designed to discover novel variants associated with endophenotypes will need extremely large samples best obtained by forming consortia and sharing data obtained from genome wide arrays. In addition, endophenotype research can benefit from successful molecular genetic studies of psychopathology by examining the degree to which these verified psychopathology-relevant variants are also associated with an endophenotype, and by using knowledge about the functional significance of these variants to generate new endophenotypes. Even without molecular genetic associations, endophenotypes still have value in studying the development of disorders in unaffected individuals at high genetic risk, constructing animal models, and gaining insight into neural mechanisms that are relevant to clinical disorder.

J	Stock, AK; Wolff, N; Beste, C				Stock, Ann-Kathrin; Wolff, Nicole; Beste, Christian			Opposite effects of binge drinking on consciously vs. subliminally induced cognitive conflicts	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Alcohol intoxication; Binge drinking; Flanker; Fronto-parietal networks; Priming; Subliminal response conflict	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TOP-DOWN PROCESSES; SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; INHIBITORY CONTROL; STROOP TASK; BOTTOM-UP; ALCOHOL; ATTENTION; MECHANISMS; ADDICTION	Binge-drinking is very prevalent and potentially harmful, yet very little is known about the specificity of its effects on behavior and the underlying neurophysiologic mechanisms. While it is generally accepted that alcohol impairs top-down cognitive control and conflict monitoring, it has remained unclear whether this also applies to subliminally triggered conflicts, as alcohol may not impair automated processes to the same extent. To investigate this, we used a within-subjects design in a sample of n = 22 healthy young male subjects who performed a complex response conflict paradigm while an EEG was recorded. Behavioral data showed that a binge-like intoxication of 1.1% increased the response conflict induced by consciously perceived flankers, but paradoxically decreased the response conflict induced by subliminal primes. The latter was found to be reflected in decreased amplitude differences in the visual N1, which reflects attentional aspects of stimulus processing, and the N2 as well as a following central negativity, which are thought to reflect conflict monitoring and cognitive effort. On the neuroanatomical level, we found the decrease in subliminally induced response conflicts to be based on changes in fronto-parietal networks (including BA 7/the precuneus, BA 40/the postcentral gyrus, BA 23 & 24/the cingulate cortex and BA 13/the insular cortex) that subserve attention allocation, the processing of complex stimuli and cognitive conflict. It can be concluded that alcohol intoxication paradoxically reduces subliminally triggered response conflicts, which may be caused by decreased allocation of attention towards less salient/noticeable stimuli.

J	Stock, AK; Gohil, K; Beste, C				Stock, Ann-Kathrin; Gohil, Krutika; Beste, Christian			Blocking effects in non-conditioned goal-directed behaviour	BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION			English	Article						Goal-directed behaviour; Blocking effect; Cognitive control; EEG; Learning; Source localization	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; ATTENTION; PERCEPTION; BRAIN; MODES; P3B	A great deal of our goal-directed behaviour depends on stimulus-response (S-R) associations, which can be established through conditioning or explicit instructions. For conditioned and reward maximizing behaviour, it has been shown that redundant information will no longer be taken into account once those associations have been formed ("blocking effect"). Following from this, new aspects will not be included in a pre-established association unless they improve behaviour. Opposing this, influential action control theories state that all kinds of information may be taken into account during action selection, thus denying the possibility of blocking redundant "surplus" information from non-conditioned goal-directed behaviour. We probed these contradicting predictions by asking two groups of healthy young adults to perform a redundant and a non-redundant version of a stop-change task in a counterbalanced order. Using behavioural and electrophysiological data, we demonstrate that contradicting current theories, blocking seems to be a general mechanism which also applies to non-conditioned goal-directed behaviour. Specifically, we show that the complexity of response selection processes associated with medial frontal cortical activity is altered by blocking. This was reflected by faster responses and smaller central P3 amplitudes originating in the ACC (BA24/BA32). Preceding attentional processes were not affected. Contradicting current views, our ability to ignore information that hampers an expedient unfolding of goal-directed behaviour is quite limited. Prior experiences have a much larger influence on which input we consider for response formation. This offers a functional explanation for why it can be hard to alter (inefficient) behaviour once it has been established.

Neuroimaging of Human Balance Control: A Systematic Review	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						static and dynamic balance control; temporal and spatial dynamics of brain activation; mechanical perturbation; sensory degradation; susceptibility to cognitive dual tasks; movement artifacts	DUAL-TASK INTERFERENCE; PREPARATORY CORTICAL ACTIVITY; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; STRIDE-TIME VARIABILITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; TREADMILL WALKING; POSTURAL CONTROL; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; (DE)SYNCHRONIZATION ERD/ERS; REFLEX RESPONSES	This review examined 83 articles using neuroimaging modalities to investigate the neural correlates underlying static and dynamic human balance control, with aims to support future mobile neuroimaging research in the balance control domain. Furthermore, this review analyzed the mobility of the neuroimaging hardware and research paradigms as well as the analytical methodology to identify and remove movement artifact in the acquired brain signal. We found that the majority of static balance control tasks utilized mechanical perturbations to invoke feet-in-place responses (27 out of 38 studies), while cognitive dual-task conditions were commonly used to challenge balance in dynamic balance control tasks (20 out of 32 studies). While frequency analysis and event related potential characteristics supported enhanced brain activation during static balance control, that in dynamic balance control studies was supported by spatial and frequency analysis. Twenty-three of the 50 studies utilizing EEG utilized independent component analysis to remove movement artifacts from the acquired brain signals. Lastly, only eight studies used truly mobile neuroimaging hardware systems. This review provides evidence to support an increase in brain activation in balance control tasks, regardless of mechanical, cognitive, or sensory challenges. Furthermore, the current body of literature demonstrates the use of advanced signal processing methodologies to analyze brain activity during movement. However, the static nature of neuroimaging hardware and conventional balance control paradigms prevent full mobility and limit our knowledge of neural mechanisms underlying balance control.

Involuntary orienting of attention to a sound desynchronizes the occipital alpha rhythm and improves visual perception	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Alpha oscillation; Desynchronization; Involuntary attention; Voluntary attention; Crossmodal cueing; Visual discrimination	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; AUDIOVISUAL LINKS; CORTEX; EEG; DISCRIMINATION	Directing attention voluntarily to the location of a visual target results in an amplitude reduction (desynchronization) of the occipital alpha rhythm (8-14 Hz), which is predictive of improved perceptual processing of the target. Here we investigated whether modulations of the occipital alpha rhythm triggered by the involuntary orienting of attention to a salient but spatially non-predictive sound would similarly influence perception of a subsequent visual target. Target discrimination was more accurate when a sound preceded the target at the same location (validly cued trials) than when the sound was on the side opposite to the target (invalidly cued trials). This behavioral effect was accompanied by a sound-induced desynchronization of the alpha rhythm over the lateral occipital scalp. The magnitude of alpha desynchronization over the hemisphere contralateral to the sound predicted correct discriminations of validly cued targets but not of invalidly cued targets. These results support the conclusion that cue-induced alpha desynchronization over the occipital cortex is a manifestation of a general priming mechanism that improves visual processing and that this mechanism can be activated either by the voluntary or involuntary orienting of attention. Further, the observed pattern of alpha modulations preceding correct and incorrect discriminations of valid and invalid targets suggests that involuntary orienting to the non-predictive sound has a rapid and purely facilitatory influence on processing targets on the cued side, with no inhibitory influence on targets on the opposite side.

Why are there both semantic hubs and category-specificity, and how come that they emerge in different cortical regions? Can the activation time-course of these areas be predicted and explained by brain-like network models? In this present work, we extend a neurocomputational model of human cortical function to simulate the time-course of cortical processes of understanding meaningful concrete words. The model implements frontal and temporal cortical areas for language, perception, and action along with their connectivity. It uses Hebbian learning to semantically ground words in aspects of their referential object- and action-related meaning. Compared with earlier proposals, the present model incorporates additional neuroanatomical links supported by connectivity studies and downscaled synaptic weights in order to control for functional between-area differences purely due to the number of in- or output links of an area. We show that learning of semantic relationships between words and the objects and actions these symbols are used to speak about, leads to the formation of distributed circuits, which all include neuronal material in connector hub areas bridging between sensory and motor cortical systems. Therefore, these connector hub areas acquire a role as semantic hubs. By differentially reaching into motor or visual areas, the cortical distributions of the emergent 'semantic circuits' reflect aspects of the represented symbols' meaning, thus explaining category specificity. The improved connectivity structure of our model entails a degree of category-specificity even in the 'semantic hubs' of the model. The relative time-course of activation of these areas is typically fast and near simultaneous, with semantic hubs central to the network structure activating before modality-preferential areas carrying semantic information.

Comparing the effects of sustained and transient spatial attention on the orienting towards and the processing of electrical nociceptive stimuli	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Sustained spatial attention; Transient spatial attention; Nociceptive electrical stimuli; ERPs; ERLs; LPS	ERP COMPONENTS; PAIN; INHIBITION; REFLECT; MODULATIONS; ADDRESS; SHIFTS; MODEL; P300; BIAS	We examined whether sustained vs. transient spatial attention differentially affect the processing of electrical nociceptive stimuli. Cued nociceptive stimuli of a relevant intensity (low or high) on the left or right forearm required a foot pedal press. The cued side varied trial wise in the transient attention condition, while it remained constant during a series of trials in the sustained attention condition. The orienting phase preceding the nociceptive stimuli was examined by focusing on lateralized EEG activity. ERPs were computed to examine the influence of spatial attention on the processing of the nociceptive stimuli. Results for the orienting phase showed increased ipsilateral alpha and beta power above somatosensory areas in both the transient and the sustained attention conditions, which may reflect inhibition of ipsilateral and/or disinhibition of contralateral somatosensory areas. Cued nociceptive stimuli evoked a larger N130 than uncued stimuli, both in the transient and the sustained attention conditions. Support for increased efficiency of spatial attention in the sustained attention condition was obtained for the N180 and the P540 component. We concluded that spatial attention is more efficient in the case of sustained than in the case of transient spatial attention. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Van der Lubbe, Rob H.

To this aim, 30 young (mean age: 23.2 years) and 20 elderly women (mean age: 82.8 years) were split in two equal groups, one assigned to the Seated Position (SP), and the other to the horizontal Bed Rest position (hBR). In the Learning Phase, participants were shown 60 words randomly distributed, and in the subsequent Recognition Phase they had to recognize them mixed with a sample of 60 new words. Behavioral analyses showed age-group effects, with young women exhibiting faster response times and higher accuracy rates than elderly women, but no interaction of body position with age group was found. Analysis of the RP component (250-270 ms) revealed greater negativity in the left Occipital gyrus/Cuneus of both sitting age-groups, but significantly left-lateralized RP in left Lingual gyrus only in young bedridden women. Elderly hBR women showed a lack of left RP lateralization, the main generator being located in the right Cuneus. Young participants had the typical old/new effect (450-800 ms) in different portions of left Frontal gyri/Uncus, whereas elderly women showed no differences in stimulus processing and its location. EEG alpha activity analyzed during a 3 min resting state, soon after the recognition task, revealed greater alpha amplitude (i.e., cortical inhibition) in posterior sites of hBR elderly women, a result in line with their inhibited posterior RP. In elderly women the left asymmetry of RP was positively correlated with both greater accuracy and faster responses, thus pointing to a dysfunctional role, rather than a compensatory shift, of the observed right RP asymmetry in this group. This finding may have important clinical implications, with particular regard to the long-term side-effects of forced Bed Rest on elderly patients.

Choice predicts the feedback negativity	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						analysis; statistical methods; choice; decision making; EEG; learning; reinforcement	HUMAN SENSITIVITY; DECISION-MAKING; LEARNING-TASK; MATCHING LAW; REINFORCEMENT; REWARD; ERROR; POSITIVITY; PUNISHMENT; REPRESENTATION	Choosing the appropriate response given the circumstance is integral to all aspects of human behavior. One way of elucidating the mechanisms of choice is to relate behavior to neural correlates. Electrophysiological evidence implicates the ERP feedback-negativity (FN) and the P300 as promising neural correlates of reward processing, an integral component of learning. However, prior research has not adequately addressed how the development of a preference to select one option over another (choice preference) relates to the FN and the P300. We assessed whether variation in choice preference predicted the FN and P300 amplitude within subjects. We used a discrete-trials two-alternative choice procedure, where the reinforcer rate for each option was dependently scheduled by a concurrent variable interval. The reinforcer ratio for selecting each option was varied between sessions. Choice was quantified using both the generalized matching law sensitivity and the log odds of staying on the same versus switching to the other alternative (stay preference). The relationship between stay preference, FN, and P300 amplitudes was assessed using the innovative application of hierarchical Bayesian linear regression. The results demonstrate that stay preference was controlled by the reinforcer ratios and credibly predicted the FN amplitude but not P300 amplitude. The findings are consistent with the view that reinforcers may guide behavior by what they signal about future reinforcement, with the FN related to such a process.

Vulnerability to Depression in Youth: Advances From Affective Neuroscience	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY-COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE AND NEUROIMAGING			English	Review						Affective neuroscience; Depression; Developmental psychopathology; EEG/ERP; fMRI; Risk		Vulnerability models of depression posit that individual differences in trait-like vulnerabilities emerge early in life and increase risk for the later development of depression. In this review, we summarize advances from affective neuroscience using neural measures to assess vulnerabilities in youth at high risk for depression due to parental history of depression or temperament style, as well as prospective designs evaluating the predictive validity of these vulnerabilities for symptoms and diagnoses of depression across development. Evidence from multiple levels of analysis indicates that healthy youth at high risk for depression exhibit abnormalities in components of the Research Domain Criteria positive valence systems, including blunted activation in the striatum during reward anticipation and feedback, and that some of these measures can be used to predict later symptoms. In addition, alterations in components of the Research Domain Criteria negative valence systems, including neural processing of sadness, loss, and threat, have been observed in risk for depression, though effects appear to be more task and method dependent. Within the social processes domain, preliminary evidence indicates that neural processing of social feedback, including heightened reactivity to exclusion and blunted response to social reward, may be related to depression vulnerability.

SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Autism spectrum disorder; high functioning autism; touch processing; self-other distinction; P3; sensory evoked potential	RUBBER-HAND ILLUSION; JOINT-TASK-PERFORMANCE; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; INTEGRATION; CHILDREN; BRAIN; ERP; PERCEPTION; MECHANISMS	Next to social problems, individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often report severe sensory difficulties. Altered processing of touch is however a stronger mediator of social symptoms' severity than altered processing of for instance vision or audition. Why is this the case? We reasoned that sensory difficulties may be linked to social problems in ASD through insufficient self-other distinction centred on touch. We investigated by means of EEG whether the brain of adults with ASD adequately signals when a tactile consequence of an observed action does not match own touch, as compared to the brain of matched controls. We employed the action-based somatosensory congruency paradigm. Participants observed a human or wooden hand touching a surface, combined with a tap-like tactile sensation that either matched or mismatched the tactile consequence of the observed movement. The ASD group showed a diminished congruency effect for human hands only in the P3-complex, suggesting difficulties with signalling observed action-based touch of others that does not match own touch experiences. Crucially, this effect reliably correlated with self-reported social and sensory everyday difficulties in ASD. The findings might denote a novel theoretical link between sensory and social impairments in the autism spectrum.

However, these two pathways also communicate to share much visual information. These dorso-ventral interactions have been studied using form-from-motion (FfM) stimuli, revealing that FfM perception first activates dorsal regions (e.g., MT+/V5), followed by successive activations of ventral regions (e.g., LOC). However, relatively little is known about the implications of focal brain damage of visual areas on these dorso-ventral interactions. In the present case report, we investigated the dynamics of dorsal and ventral activations related to FfM perception (using topographical ERP analysis and electrical source imaging) in a patient suffering from a deficit in FfM perception due to right extrastriate brain damage in the ventral stream. Despite the patient's FfM impairment, both successful (observed for the highest level of FfM signal) and absent/failed FfM perception evoked the same temporal sequence of three processing states observed previously in healthy subjects. During the first period, brain source localization revealed cortical activations along the dorsal stream, currently associated with preserved elementary motion processing. During the latter two periods, the patterns of activity differed from normal subjects: activations were observed in the ventral stream (as reported for normal subjects), but also in the dorsal pathway, with the strongest and most sustained activity localized in the parieto-occipital regions. On the other hand, absent/failed FfM perception was characterized by weaker brain activity, restricted to the more lateral regions. This study shows that in the present case report, successful FfM perception, while following the same temporal sequence of processing steps as in normal subjects, evoked different patterns of brain activity. By revealing a brain circuit involving the most rostral part of the dorsal pathway, this study provides further support for neuro-imaging studies and brain lesion investigations that have suggested the existence of different brain circuits associated with different profiles of interaction between the dorsal and the ventral streams.

In this study, we use the mismatch negativity (MMN) brain response to observe neurophysiological responses to discontinuous particle verbs. The MMN can be used to distinguish between whole-form storage and combinatorial processes, as it is enhanced to stored words compared to unknown pseudowords, whereas combinatorially legal strings elicit a reduced MMN relative to ungrammatical ones. Earlier work had found larger MMNs to congruent than to incongruent verb-particle combinations when particle and verb appeared as adjacent elements, thus suggesting whole-form storage at least in this case. However, it is still possible that particle verbs discontinuously spread out across a sentence would elicit the combinatorial, grammar-violation response pattern instead. Here, we tested the brain signatures of discontinuous verb-particle combinations, orthogonally varying congruence and semantic transparency. The results show for the first time brain indices of whole-form storage for discontinuous constituents, thus arguing in favour of access to whole-form-stored lexical elements in the processing of particle verbs, irrespective of their semantic opacity. Results are discussed in the context of linguistic debates about the status of particle verbs as words, lexical elements or syntactically generated combinations. The explanation of the pattern of results within a neurobiological language model is highlighted.

Electrophysiology research has documented negative shifts of brain activity when expectancies are violated within a local stimulus context (e.g., reading an implausible word in a sentence) or more globally between consecutive stimuli (e.g., a narrative of images with an incongruent end). In this EEG study, we examine the interaction between expectancies operating at the level of stimulus plausibility and at more global level of contextual congruency to provide evidence for, or against, a disassociation of the underlying processing mechanisms. We asked participants to verify the congruency of pairs of cross-modal stimuli (a sentence and a scene), which varied in plausibility. ANOVAs on ERP amplitudes in selected windows of interest show that congruency violation has longer-lasting (from 100 to 500 ms) and more widespread effects than plausibility violation (from 200 to 400 ms). We also observed critical interactions between these factors, whereby incongruent and implausible pairs elicited stronger negative shifts than their congruent counterpart, both early on (100-200 ms) and between 400-500 ms. Our results suggest that the integration mechanisms are sensitive to both global and local effects of expectancy in a modality independent manner. Overall, we provide novel insights into the interdependence of expectancy during meaning integration of cross-modal stimuli in a verification task.

Compared to predictive cues, cues predicting at chance the location of targets reduce the filtering out of uncued locations and the costs in reorienting attention to targets presented at these locations. Slagter et al. (2016) have recently suggested that the larger target related P1 component that is found in the hemisphere ipsilateral to validly cued targets reflects stimulus-driven inhibition in the processing of the unstimulated side of space contralateral to the same hemisphere. Here we verified whether the strength of this inhibition and the amplitude of the corresponding P1 wave are modulated by the probabilistic link between cues and targets. Healthy participants performed a task of endogenous orienting once with predictive and once with non-predictive directional cues. In the non-predictive condition we observed a drop in the amplitude of the P1 ipsilateral to the target and in the costs of reorienting. No change in the inter-hemispheric latencies of the P1 was found between the two predictive conditions. The N1 facilitatory component was unaffected by predictive cuing. These results show that the predictive context modulates the strength of the inhibitory P1 response and that this modulation is not matched with changes in the interhemispheric interaction between the P1 generators of the two hemispheres.

Yet, there are reasons to believe that switches in language might benefit language comprehension in some groups of people, such as less proficient language learners. This study therefore investigated the interplay between language switching and semantic processing in groups with varying language proficiency. EEG was recorded while L2 learners of English with intermediate and high proficiency levels read semantically congruent or incongruent sentences in L2. Translations of congruent and incongruent target words were additionally presented in L1 to create intrasentential language switches. A control group of English native speakers was tested in order to compare responses to non-switched stimuli with those of L2 learners. An omnibus ANOVA including all groups revealed larger N400 responses for non-switched incongruent stimuli compared to congruent stimuli. Additionally, despite switches to L1 at target word position, semantic N400 responses were still elicited in both L2 learner groups. Further switching effects were reflected by an N400-like effect and a late positivity complex, pointing to possible parsing efforts after language switches. Our results therefore show that although language switches are associated with increased mental effort, switches may not necessarily be costly on the semantic level. This finding contributes to the ongoing discussion on language inhibition processes, and shows that, in these intermediate and high proficient L2 learners, semantic processes look similar to those of native speakers of English.

Slow and Fast Responses: Two Mechanisms of Trial Outcome Processing Revealed by EEG Oscillations	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cognitive control; attention; response time; error detection; theta oscillations; alpha oscillations; beta oscillations	MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; ERP GENERATOR PATTERNS; LAPLACIAN WAVE-FORMS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; BEHAVIORAL ADAPTATION; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSES; BAND OSCILLATIONS; DECISION-MAKING	Cognitive control includes maintenance of task-specific processes related to attention, and non-specific regulation of motor threshold. Depending upon the nature of the behavioral tasks, these mechanisms may predispose to different kinds of errors, with either increased or decreased response time (RT) of erroneous responses relative to correct responses. Specifically, slow responses are related to attentional lapses and decision uncertainty, these conditions tending to delay RTs of both erroneous and correct responses. Here we studied if RT may be a valid approximation distinguishing trials with high and low levels of sustained attention and decision uncertainty. We analyzed response-related and feedback-related modulations in theta, alpha and beta band activity in the auditory version of the two-choice condensation task, which is highly demanding for sustained attention while involves no inhibition of prepotent responses. Depending upon response speed and accuracy, trials were divided into slow correct, slow erroneous, fast correct and fast erroneous. We found that error-related frontal midline theta (FMT) was present only on fast erroneous trials. The feedback-related FMT was equally strong on slow erroneous and fast erroneous trials. Late post-response posterior alpha suppression was stronger on erroneous slow trials. Feedback-related frontal beta was present only on slow correct trials. The data obtained cumulatively suggests that RT allows distinguishing the two types of trials, with fast trials related to higher levels of attention and low uncertainty, and slow trials related to lower levels of attention and higher uncertainty.

J	Urakawa, T; Bunya, M; Araki, O				Urakawa, Tomokazu; Bunya, Mao; Araki, Osamu			Involvement of the visual change detection process in facilitating perceptual alternation in the bistable image	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						Bistable; Perceptual alternation; Visual mismatch negativity; vMMN; EEG	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; BINOCULAR-RIVALRY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; POTENTIAL ERP; NECKER-CUBE; TOP-DOWN; DYNAMICS; PHASE; NOISE	A bistable image induces one of two perceptual alternatives. When the bistable visual image is continuously viewed, the percept of the image alternates from one possible percept to the other. Perceptual alternation was previously reported to be induced by an exogenous perturbation in the bistable image, and this perturbation was theoretically interpreted to cause neural noise, prompting a transition between two stable perceptual states. However, little is known experimentally about the visual processing of exogenously driven perceptual alternation. Based on the findings of a previous behavioral study (Urakawa et al. in Perception 45:474-482, 2016), the present study hypothesized that the automatic visual change detection process, which is relevant to the detection of a visual change in a sequence of visual events, has an enhancing effect on the induction of perceptual alternation, similar to neural noise. In order to clarify this issue, we developed a novel experimental paradigm in which visual mismatch negativity (vMMN), an electroencephalographic brain response that reflects visual change detection, was evoked while participants continuously viewed the bistable image. In terms of inter-individual differences in neural and behavioral data, we found that enhancements in the peak amplitude of vMMN1, early vMMN at a latency of approximately 150 ms, correlated with increases in the proportion of perceptual alternation across participants. Our results indicate the involvement of automatic visual change detection in the induction of perceptual alternation, similar to neural noise, thereby providing a deeper insight into the neural mechanisms underlying exogenously driven perceptual alternation in the bistable image.

Are Visual Field Defects Reversible? - Visual Rehabilitation with Brains	KLINISCHE MONATSBLATTER FUR AUGENHEILKUNDE			German	Article						glaucoma; neuroophthalmology; electrophysiology; trauma	ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; VISION-RESTORATION-THERAPY; ISCHEMIC OPTIC NEUROPATHY; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; RESIDUAL VISION; REORGANIZATION; ACTIVATION; DYNAMICS; RECOVERY; LIFE	Visual field defects are considered irreversible because the retina and optic nerve do not regenerate. Nevertheless, there is some potential for recovery of the visual fields. This can be accomplished by the brain, which analyses and interprets visual information and is able to amplify residual signals through neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity refers to the ability of the brain to change its own functional architecture by modulating synaptic efficacy. This is actually the neurobiological basis of normal learning. Plasticity is maintained throughout life and can be induced by repetitively stimulating (training) brain circuits. The question now arises as to how plasticity can be utilised to activate residual vision for the treatment of visual field loss. Just as in neurorehabilitation, visual field defects can be modulated by post-lesion plasticity to improve vision in glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy or optic neuropathy. Because almost all patients have some residual vision, the goal is to strengthen residual capacities by enhancing synaptic efficacy. New treatment paradigms have been tested in clinical studies, including vision restoration training and non-invasive alternating current stimulation. While vision training is a behavioural task to selectively stimulate "relative defects" with daily vision exercises for the duration of 6 months, treatment with alternating current stimulation (30 min. daily for 10 days) activates and synchronises the entire retina and brain. Though full restoration of vision is not possible, such treatments improve vision, both subjectively and objectively. This includes visual field enlargements, improved acuity and reaction time, improved orientation and vision related quality of life. About 70% of the patients respond to the therapies and there are no serious adverse events. Physiological studies of the effect of alternating current stimulation using EEG and fMRI reveal massive local and global changes in the brain. These include local activation of the visual cortex and global reorganisation of neuronal brain networks. Because modulation of neuroplasticity can strengthen residual vision, the brain deserves a better reputation in ophthalmology for its role in visual rehabilitation. For patients, there is now more light at the end of the tunnel, because vision loss in some areas of the visual field defect is indeed reversible.	[Sabel, B.

In the absence of a real MRI scan, pseudo MRI (i.e., associated headmodel and sourcemodel) is often approximated from an available standard MRI template or pool of MRI scans considering the subject's digitized head surface. In the present study, we approximated two types of pseudo MRI (i.e., associated headmodel and sourcemodel) using an available pool of MRI scans with the focus on MEG source imaging. The first was the first rank pseudo MRI; that is, the MRI scan in the dataset having the lowest objective registration error (ORE) after being registered (rigid body transformation with isotropic scaling) to the subject's digitized head surface. The second was the averaged rank pseudo MRI that is generated by averaging of headmodels and sourcemodels from multiple MRI scans respectively, after being registered to the subject's digitized head surface. Subject level analysis showed that the mean upper bound of source location error for the approximated sourcemodel in reference to the real one was 10 3 mm for the averaged rank pseudo MRI, which was significantly lower than the first rank pseudo MRI approach. Functional group source response in the brain to visual stimulation in the form of event-related power (ERP) at the time latency of peak amplitude showed noticeably identical source distribution for first rank pseudo MRI, averaged rank pseudo MRI, and real MRI. The source localization error for functional peak response was significantly lower for averaged rank pseudo MRI compared to first rank pseudo MRI. We conclude that it is feasible to use approximated pseudo MRI, particularly the averaged rank pseudo MRI, as a substitute for real MRI without losing the generality of the functional group source response.

Recently, it has been suggested that heat may augment the negative effect of mental fatigue on cognitive performance, raising the question whether it may also amplify the effect of mental fatigue on TT performance. Methods: In 30 degrees C and 30% relative humidity, 10 endurance-trained male athletes (mean +/- SD; age = 22 +/- 3 yr, W-max = 332 +/- 41 W) completed two experimental conditions: intervention (I; 45-min Stroop task) and control (C; 45-min documentary). Pre-and postintervention/control, cognitive performance was followed up with a 5-min Flanker task. Thereafter, subjects cycled for 45 min at a fixed pace equal to 60% W-max, immediately followed by a self-paced TT in which they had to produce a fixed amount of work (equal to cycling 15 min at 80% W-max) as fast as possible. Results: Self-reported mental fatigue was significantly higher after I compared with C (P < 0.05). Moreover EEG measures also indicated the occurrence of mental fatigue during the Stroop (P < 0.05). TT did not differ between conditions (I = 906 +/- 30 s, C = 916 +/- 29 s). Throughout exercise, physiological (HR, blood lactate, core, and skin temperature) and perceptual measures (perception of effort and thermal sensation) were not affected by mental fatigue. Conclusion: No negative effects of mild mental fatigue were observed on performance and the physiological and perceptual responses to endurance exercise in the heat. Most plausibly, mild mental fatigue does not reduce endurance performance when the brain is already stressed by a hot environment.
