In the first part we overview studies that relied on visual inspection of EEG traces and spectral characteristics of EEG. Second, we survey analysis methods motivated by dynamical systems theory (DST) as well as more recent network connectivity approaches. In the third part we review studies of sleep. Next, we compare the utility of early and late ERP components in dementia research. In the section on mismatch negativity (MMN) studies we summarize their results and limitations and outline the emerging field of computational neurology. In the following we overview the use of EEG in the differential diagnosis of the most common neurocognitive disorders. Finally, we provide a summary of the state of the field and conclude that several promising EEG/ERP indices of synaptic neurotransmission are worth considering as potential biomarkers.

In BCI applications inter stimuli interval is shorter than the ERP duration. This causes temporal dependencies over observation potentials thus disallows taking the data into consideration independently. However, conventionally the data is assumed to be independent for decreasing complexity. In this paper we propose a graphical model which covers the temporal dependency into consideration by labeling each time sample. We also propose a formulation to exploit the time series structure of the EEG.

For this purpose, the author decided to adopt such methods as electroencephalography (EEG) experiment, literature review and hypothesis testing. Based on the neuroscience for decision-making, the mechanism of management risk-based decision-making was investigated under different economic risks. Then, the "economic management risk-based decision-making" hypothesis was presented in light of the mathematical model for risk-based decision-making and the neuroscience for decision-making. After that, the author prepared the detailed design of an experiment and conducted pre-experiments. The high-time resolution event-related potential (ERP) technique was adopted to capture the signal processing procedure and neural action pattern in the brain in different risk scenarios. Through the analysis of the experimental data, it is discovered that the brain's decision-making under economic management risk demonstrates the decision-maker's adaptive choice. The research findings provide valuable reference for the decision-making of enterprise managers.

We had two groups of participants: females (n = 15, mean age = 40.6 years old) and males (n = 15, mean age = 39.0 years old). ERPs from all participants were recorded while the participants performed an oddball task. Results showed that males on average had a significantly larger P200 peak amplitude and a significantly shorter P200 latency period. These results indicate that the P200 ERP is affected by sex. Therefore, suggesting that sex differences exist on an electrophysiological level, which may aid in better understanding of sex-biased biological influences, behaviors, neuropsychiatric disorders, and general brain function.

Although previous studies demonstrated the efficacy of regression-based trigger timing correction for ERP analysis of EEG data obtained from Emotiv EPOC+, it was unclear whether this correction also works with a limited number of triggers. Moreover, we wanted to address this question using a recent version of the EEG acquisition software of Emotiv EPOC+, because previous studies predicted an improved temporal accuracy for a recent version. Results showed an N170-like waveform when original trigger timings were used as event onsets, but not when corrected trigger timings were used. This suggests that a recent version of the EEC acquisition software of EMOTIV EPOC+ has an improved temporal accuracy, and that trigger timing correction under a limited number of triggers should not he applied or at least be applied carefully.

The influence of sample set construction on the estimation performance and the benefit of combining EEG and fMRI features remain unclear. In this study, we extracted spectral power and event-related-potentials from the Pz electrode and 9 electrodes in related lobes as the EEG feature and extracted the beta values of the activation brain regions as the fMRI feature at the two sample set construction levels of trial and run. Then we combined EEG and fMRI features. The results showed that the classification performance of memory load at the run level got higher classification accuracy when using rapid event-related experimental design. As for EEG features, the classification performance of memory load was related to channel selection. The combination of EEG and fMRI features did not contribute to load classification accuracy.

EEG contains complex, high-temporal-resolution information, and computational assessment maximizes our potential to glean insight from this information. Here we present the Batch EEG Automated Processing Platform (BEAPP), an automated, flexible EEG processing platform incorporating freely available software tools for batch processing of multiple EEG files across multiple processing steps. BEAPP does not prescribe a specified EEG processing pipeline; instead, it allows users to choose from a menu of options for EEG processing, including steps to manage EEG files collected across multiple acquisition setups (e.g., for multisite studies), minimize artifact, segment continuous and/or event-related EEG, and perform basic analyses. Overall, BEAPP aims to streamline batch EEG processing, improve accessibility to computational EEG assessment, and increase reproducibility of results.

Although the neuroimaging modality such as electroencephalography (EEG) has shown promising research results in achieving objectivity during the screening and diagnosis of AUD patients. However, the translation of these findings for clinical applications has been largely understudied and hence less clear. This study advocates the use of EEG as a diagnostic and screening tool for AUD patients that may help the clinicians during clinical decision making. In this context, a comprehensive review on EEG-based methods is provided including related electrophysiological techniques reported in the literature. More specifically, the EEG abnormalities associated with the conditions of AUD patients are summarized. The aim is to explore the potentials of objective techniques involving quantities/features derived from resting EEG, event-related potentials or event-related oscillations data.

But due to their low SNR, EEG signals must be processed to obtain the ERP waveform. Such a processing can be carried using a number of toolboxes that may provide different results on further analyses. Here, we present an experimental design that quantitatively evaluates the effect of choosing a particular toolbox in the further ERP analysis. We select three widely used toolboxes: EEGLAB, SPM12, and Fieldtrip to process EEG data acquired from a Flanker-like task with a Biosemi Active-Two device. Results show that although there is not a significant difference between ERP obtained from each toolbox, the choice of a specific toolbox may have subtle effects in the resulting ERP waveforms.

However, these images may be more or less relevant in the context of the information provided. In such cases there is likely to be a complex interplay between users' emotional and cognitive responses and the degree of information recall. This study used event-related electroencephalography (EEG) to shed light on these interrelationships. Images providing emotional cues influenced emotions and EEG responses and these responses were in turn related to the degree of information recall. Importantly, the study shows that the neural correlates of emotion vary depending on whether the emotion-inducing image is relevant to the information provided or not and that these correlates are significantly related to recall.

Electroencephalography (EEG) has become an important preclinical and clinical technique to investigate the underlying mechanisms of neurophysiological dysfunctions in psychiatric disorders. Patients with schizophrenia show marked deficits in auditory event-related potentials (ERP), the detection of deviant auditory stimuli (mismatch negativity, MMN), the generation and synchronization of 40 Hz gamma oscillations in response to steady-state auditory stimulation (ASSR) and reduced auditory-evoked oscillation in the gamma range. Due to a novel data-logging technology (Neurologger, TSE Systems), it is now possible to record wireless EEG data in awake, free-moving small rodents without any restrictions due to size of the device or attached cables. Recently, a new version of the Neurologger was released with improved performance to record time-locked event-related EEG signals. In this study, we were able to show in mice that pharmacological intervention with the NMDA receptor antagonists Ketamine and MK-801 can impair a comprehensive selection of EEG/ERP readouts (ERP N1 amplitude, 40 Hz ASSR, basal and evoked gamma oscillation, MMN) and therefore mimic the EEG deficits observed in patients with schizophrenia. Our data support the translational value of NMDA receptor antagonists as a model for preclinical evaluation of sensory processing deficits relevant to schizophrenia. Further, the new Neurologger system is a suitable device for wireless recording of clinically relevant EEG biomarkers in freely moving mice and a robust translational tool to investigate novel therapeutic approaches regarding sensory processing deficits related to psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.

Event related potentials (ERPs) measured non-invasively with electroencephalography (EEG) can be associated with infrequent targets amongst a stream of images. Human-machine symbiosis may be augmented by enabling human interaction with a computer, without overt movement, and/or enable optimization of image/information sorting processes involving humans. Features of the human visual system impact on the success of the RSVP paradigm, but pre-attentive processing supports the identification of target information post presentation of the information by assessing the co-occurrence or time-locked EEG potentials. This paper presents a comprehensive review and evaluation of the limited, but significant, literature on research in RSVP-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Applications that use RSVP-based BCIs are categorized based on display mode and protocol design, whilst a range of factors influencing ERP evocation and detection are analyzed. Guidelines for using the RSVP-based BCI paradigms are recommended, with a view to further standardizing methods and enhancing the inter-relatability of experimental design to support future research and the use of RSVP-based BCIs in practice.

Design/methodology/approach In addition to the review of papers using EEG to study consumer cognitive processes, the authors also discuss relevant decisions and considerations in conducting event-related potential (ERP) studies. Further, a framework proposed by Plassmann et al. (2015) was used to discuss the applications of EEG in marketing research from papers reviewed. Findings This paper successfully used Plassmann et al.'s (2015) framework to discuss five applications of neuroscience to marketing research. A review of growing EEG studies in the field of marketing and other interdisciplinary fields reveals the advantages and potential of using EEG in combination with other methods. This calls for more research using such methods. Research limitations/implications A technical overview of ERP-related terminology provides researchers with a background for understanding and reviewing ERP studies. A discussion of method-related considerations and decisions provides marketing researchers with an introduction to the method and refers readers to relevant literature. Practical implications The marketing industry has been quick to adopt cutting edge technology, including EEG, to understand and predict consumer behavior for the purpose of improving marketing practices. This paper connects the academic and practitioner spheres by presenting past and potential EEG research that can be translatable to the marketing industry. Originality/value The authors review past literature on the use of EEG to study consumer-related topics in marketing and interdisciplinary fields, to demonstrate its advantages over-traditional methods in studying consumer-relevant behaviors. To foster increasing use of EEG in consumer neuroscience research, the authors further provide technical and marketing-specific considerations for both academic and market researchers. This paper is one of the first to review past EEG papers and provide methodological background insights for marketing researchers.

Intrinsic EEG and task-related changes in EEG affect Go/NoGo task performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Event-related potentials (ERPs); Brain dynamics; Attention; Decision-making; Cognitive control	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; ERP COMPONENTS; QUANTITATIVE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PRESTIMULUS ALPHA; VERTEX RESPONSE	Substantial research into the brain dynamics underlying cognitive functioning during tasks links the brain's EEG activity to the stimulus-evoked ERP activity. This study focused on examining how the resting state intrinsic EEG, and the change from rest to the task, affect these stimulus-response processes. Forty young adults (aged 20.3 +/- 2.3 years) had EEG recorded during eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) resting states, and then during an auditory Go/NoGo task. Amplitude in the delta to beta bands was analyzed for the overall resting state EEG, the reactive change from EC to EO, and for the change from EO to the task (termed task-related change here). The relationships between these EEG measures and Go/NoGo behavioral outcomes and ERPs were assessed. Greater resting state delta and theta amplitudes were linked to Go N1-1 enhancements, but only resting state delta correlated with the NoGo N1-1. These relationships replicate previous data and highlight the functional relevance of low frequency intrinsic activity in attentional processes. However, delta increases from EO to the task predicted poorer Go response accuracy and variability, and enhanced Go Slow Wave (SW) positivity. This increase in delta, and smaller alpha-1 increments, were associated with longer mean RTs. Theta increases predicted larger Go N1-1 amplitudes, but lower NoGo accuracy rates, while beta-1 increments were predictive of NoGo SW negativity. These novel effects suggest that task-related EEG changes impact decision-making and cognitive control processes, and subsequent behavioral performance.

Award-winning advertisements (AAs) were selected on the basis of the professional standards that consider creativity as a prerequisite. However, it is unknown if AA is related to satisfactory advertising performance among customers or only to the experts' viewpoints towards the advertisements. This issue in the field of affective engineering and design merits in-depth evaluation. We recruited 30 subjects and performed an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment while watching AAs and non-AAs (NAAs). The event-related potential (ERP) data showed that AAs evoked larger positive potentials 250-1400 ms after stimulus onset, particularly in the right fronto-temporal regions. The behavioral results were consistent with the professional recognition given to AAs by experts. The perceived levels of creativity and "product-like" quality were higher for the AAs than for the NAAs. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) analysis further revealed statistically significant differences in the theta, alpha, beta, and gamma band activity in the right fronto-temporal regions between the AAs and NAAs. Our results confirm that EEG features from the time/frequency domains can differentiate affective responses to AAs at a neural circuit level, and provide scientific evidence to support the identification of AAs.

ERPs have excellent temporal resolution therefore, it is considered as an accurate measure for the cognitive research. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique and is most widely used to measure ERPs. The aim of this paper is to measure the ERPs in the cognitive task and detects or determines some of the components of ERPs. One of the ERP components which are found here is P300. P300 was elicited with auditory stimulus. The auditory stimulus was designed according to the oddball paradigm in which the participant detects a less frequent 'target' stimulus in a regular series of standard stimuli. This stimulus consists of series of alphabets and digits in which only digit is the target. Two age group people (20 +/- 5 years and 40 +/- 5 years) participated in this experiment. Then, P300 latency and amplitude are compared between these two age groups.

Spatial filtering pipeline evaluation of cortically coupled computer vision system for rapid serial visual presentation	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES			English	Article						Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP); cortically coupled computer vision; electroencephalography (EEG); event-related potentials (ERPs); spatial filtering; brain-computer interface (BCI)	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; MOTOR IMAGERY; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; INTERFACE; PATTERN; SEARCH; ERP	Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) is a paradigm that supports the application of cortically coupled computer vision to image search. In RSVP, images are presented to participants which can evoke Event-related Potentials (ERPs) in their Electroencephalogram (EEG). Supervised spatial filtering techniques are often applied to enhance the discriminative information in the EEG. In this paper, we make two primary contributions: 1) We propose a novel spatial filtering method called Multiple Time Window LDA Beamformer (MTWLB); 2) We provide a comprehensive comparison of nine spatial filtering pipelines using three spatial filtering schemes, namely, MTWLB, xDAWN, Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and three linear classification methods Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR) and Logistic Regression (LR). The results reveal that MTWLB and xDAWN enhance the classification performance but CSP does not. The results also support the conclusion that LR can be effective for a RSVP-based BCI if discriminative features are available.

We measured event-related potentials (ERPs) with electroencephalography (EEG) and collected fMRI data from identical experiments where participants performed visual and auditory discrimination tasks separately or simultaneously and with or without distractors. To overcome the low temporal resolution of fMRI, we used a novel ERP-based application of multivariate representational similarity analysis (RSA) to parse time-averaged fMRI pattern activity into distinct spatial maps that each corresponded, in representational structure, to a short temporal ERP segment. Discriminant analysis of ERP-fMRI correlations revealed 8 cortical networks-2 sensory, 3 attention, and 3 other-segregated by 4 orthogonal, temporally multifaceted and spatially distributed functions. We interpret these functions as 4 spatiotemporal components of attention: modality-dependent and stimulus-driven orienting, top-down control, mode transition, and response preparation, selection and execution.

It can be defined as a spectrum disorder, and patients with epilepsy possess abnormalities in cognitive functions. A number of factors can cause cognitive dysfunctions in epileptic syndromes, including etiology, the age of onset, type of seizure and severity, duration, and antiepileptic drugs. Event-related potentials (ERPs) are very useful clinical and research instruments to evaluate cognitive function in patients with neuropsychiatry disorders. Event-related potentials directly reflect cortical neuronal activity and provide a particular level of temporal resolution. Among various ERP components, the P300 is the most important component for assessing cognitive processes such as attention, working memory, and concentration. Numerous studies have reported the abnormalities in amplitude or latency of P300 component of ERP in epileptic patients, and these abnormalities are indicative of cognitive dysfunction. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to consolidate the existing literature in connection with the use of P300 in epileptic patients.

One prominent class of actions, the human locomotion, has been object of several studies, all focused on manipulating the shape of degraded human figures like point-light walker (PLW) stimuli, represented as walking on the spot. Nevertheless, since the main goal of the locomotor function is to displace the whole body from one position to the other, these stimuli might not fully represent a goal-directed action and thus might not be able to induce the same motor resonance mechanism expected when observing a natural locomotion. To explore this hypothesis, we recorded the event-related potentials (ERP) of canonical/scrambled and translating/centered PLWs decoding. We individuated a novel ERP component (N2c) over central electrodes, around 435 ms after stimulus onset, for translating compared to centered PLW, only when the canonical shape was preserved. Consistently with our hypothesis, sources analysis associated this component to the activation of trunk and lower legs primary sensory-motor and supplementary motor areas. These results confirm the role of own motor repertoire in processing human action and suggest that ERP can detect the associated motor resonance only when the human figure is explicitly involved in performing a meaningful action.

One of the EEG-based BCIs leverages event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by changes in specific external stimuli, which are sensitive to artifacts. To date, numerous methods have been proposed to remove artifacts from EEG. In this paper, we compare different artifact rejection methods for the operation of a BCI utilizing the ERP components such as P300 and N200, including independent component analysis (ICA), adaptive filtering, and artifact subspace reconstruction. We investigate the effect artifact removal by each method on the ERP waveform as well as BCI classification accuracy. The result demonstrates that the ERP waveforms through ICA showed a less across-trial variability in P300 amplitudes compared to other methods, as well as higher BCI classification accuracy. Our results may help the design of signal processing pipeline for EEG-based BCI systems.

Children with autism displayed enhanced sensitivity to large, high-contrast low-spatial frequency stimuli as indexed by significantly shorter P1 response latencies to large vs. small gratings. The current study also found that children with autism had larger amplitude responses to large gratings irrespective of contrast. A linear regression established that P1 adaptive mean amplitude for large, high-contrast sinusoidal gratings significantly predicted hyperresponsiveness item mean scores on the Sensory Experiences Questionnaire for children with autism, but not for neurotypical children.

Pre-intervention test-retest reliability of EEG and ERP over four recording intervals	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Test-retest reliability; EEG; ERP; Repeated measurements; Crossover design	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MENSTRUAL-CYCLE; TEMPORAL STABILITY; ALZHEIMER PATIENTS; QUANTITATIVE EEG; PERFORMANCE; ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; PREDICTION; COMPONENTS	In this study we present the test-retest reliability of pre-intervention EEG/ERP (electroencephalogram/event-related potentials) data across four recording intervals separated by a washout period (18-22 days). POz-recording-reference EEG/ERP (28 sites, average reference) were recorded from thirty-two healthy male participants. Participants were randomly allocated into different intervention sequences, each with four intervention regimens: 10 mg vortioxetine, 20 mg vortioxetine, 15 mg escitalopram and Placebo. We report classical EEG spectra: delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-30 Hz), gamma 1 (30-45 Hz) and gamma 2 (45-80 Hz) of resting state and vigilance-controlled, and of auditory steady state response, as well as ERP components N100, P200 and P300 in auditory oddball task and error related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) in hybrid flanker task. Reliability was quantified using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). We found that theta, alpha and beta of continuous EEG were highly reliable (ICCs >= 0.84). Evoked power of other tasks demonstrated larger variability and less reliability compared to the absolute power of continuous EEG. Furthermore, reliabilities of ERP measures were lower compared to those of the EEG spectra. We saw fair to excellent reliability of the amplitude of the components such as Pe (0.60-0.82) and P300 (0.55-0.80). Moreover, blood tests confirmed that there was no measurable drug carry-over from the previous intervention. The results support that EEG/ERP is reliable across four recording intervals, thus it can be used to assess the effect of different doses and types of drugs with CNS effects.

Recognition memory is one cognitive ability that varies from person to person and that variation may be related to different genetic phenotypes. One gene that may impact recognition memory is the monoamine oxidase A gene (MAO-A), which influences the transcription rate of MAO-A. Examination of how MAO-A phenotypes impact behavioral and event-related potentials (ERPs) correlates of recognition memory may help explain individual differences in recognition memory performance. Therefore, the current study uses electroencephalography (EEG) in combination with genetic phenotyping of the MAO-A gene to determine how well-characterized ERP components of recognition memory, the early frontal old/new effect, left parietal old/new effect, late frontal old/new effect, and the late posterior negativity (LPN) are impacted by MAO-A phenotype during item and source memory. Our results show that individuals with the MAO-A phenotype leading to increased transcription have lower response sensitivity during both item and source memory. Additionally, during item memory the left parietal old/new effect is not present due to increased ERP amplitude for correct rejections. The results suggest that MAO-A phenotype changes EEG correlates of recognition memory and influences how well individuals differentiate between old and new items.

Traditional emotion recognition modalities (e.g. face and voice) always could not identify the totally true emotion state. Recently, with the development of electroencephalogram (EEG) equipment, utilizing EEG signals to build emotion recognition system is more and more feasible and meaningful. In this paper, an abstract emotional words classification task is designed, which requires participants judge the emotion polarity (positive or negative) for given words. Based on EEG signals, a series of study is re-explored, including data collecting, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification model. Furthermore, the Event Related Potential (ERP) components and behavioral data analysis uncover some meaningful conclusion on emotion recognition.

This component is usually measured approximately 200-300 ms post-feedback at a single electrode in the frontal-central area (e.g., Fz or FCz). The present review argues that this singular focus on the FRN fails to leverage EEG's greatest strength, its temporal resolution, by underutilizing the rich variety of event-related potential (ERP) and EEG time-frequency components encompassing the wider temporal heterogeneity of reward processing. The primary objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive understanding of often overlooked ERP and EEG correlates beyond the FRN in the context of reward processing with the secondary goal of guiding future research toward multistage experimental designs and multicomponent analyses that leverage the temporal power of EEG. We comprehensively review reward-related ERPs (including the FRN, readiness potential or RP, stimulus-preceding negativity or SPN, contingent-negative variation or CNV, cue-related N2 and P3, Feedback-P3, and late-positive potential or LPP/slow-wave), and reward-related EEG time-frequency components (changes in power at alpha, beta, theta, and delta bands). These electrophysiological signatures display distinct time-courses, scalp topographies, and reflect independent psychological processes during anticipatory and/or outcome stages of reward processing. Special consideration is given to the time-course of each component and factors that significantly contribute to component variation. Concluding remarks identify current limitations along with recommendations for potential important future directions.

While it has some major advantages such as high temporal resolution, relative affordability, and easy accessibility, even its shortcomings are being addressed through the advancement in its analysis. As a result, numerous researches have been examining EEG components as potential biomarkers of various psychiatric diseases. In this chapter, we discuss several promising EEG markers, ranging from resting state EEG to stimuli induced ERP components, from electrodes level to source level, and from band power to functional connectivity networks. In addition, we present the findings of previous studies with an emphasis on how each EEG component vary depending of the specific psychiatric illnesses. The psychiatric disorders discussed in this chapter are (1) schizophrenia, (2) bipolar disorder, (3) major depressive disorder, (4) anxiety related disorders (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder) and (5) disorders related to cognitive impairments (e.g., dementia and minimal cognitive impairment. Lastly, we introduce how the limitations of EEG, which mostly occur as a byproduct of sensor-level analysis, can be addressed through source-level analysis.

It has become the de-facto mobile, portable, non-invasive brain imaging sensor to harness brain information in real time. It is now being used to translate or decode brain signals, to diagnose diseases or to implement Brain Computer Interface (BCI) devices. The automatic decoding is mainly implemented by using quantitative algorithms to detect the cloaked information buried in the signal. However, clinical EEG is based intensively on waveforms and the structure of signal plots. Hence, the purpose of this work is to establish a bridge to fill this gap by reviewing and describing the procedures that have been used to detect patterns in the electroencephalographic waveforms, benchmarking them on a controlled pseudo-real dataset of a P300-Based BCI Speller and verifying their performance on a public dataset of a BCI Competition.

Forecasting event-related potentials (ERPs) have a number of potential benefits for brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Accurate predictions of neural responses can reduce the latencies of neural signal classification algorithms and closed-loop feedback systems. Various models of ERPs propose that there exists a causal dependency between post-event neural responses and ongoing pre-event neural dynamics. Accordingly, we implement a deep neural network that extracts features from pre-event data in order to predict a single-trial ERP. To capture the variability of a single trial, the network constructs the post-event waveform in two parts: 1) generating ongoing neural activity and 2) generating event-related components comprising the ERP. We evaluate our model by forecasting 500 milliseconds of single channel post-event data from a Rapid Series Visual Presentation (RSVP) task. Our results indicate a significant increase in forecasting performance compared to baseline methods, suggesting that deep neural networks can extract informative features from pre-event EEG data in order to generate a prediction of the post-event waveform.

Event-related potential (ERP) recording was done using a 256-channel EEG system. Results indicated that ERP is affected by advanced age. There was a significant difference in P200 mean latency between the younger participants and older participants for the target (low-probability) stimuli, but no such significance was evident for the P200 mean latency during the presentation of the standard (high-probability) stimuli. As for the P200 mean peak amplitude, the results for the target (low-probability) stimuli did show a significant difference between the two age groups, while the results for the standard (high-probability) stimuli did not show any significant difference between the two age groups. The results of this study are explained in light of aging effects on attentional recruitment and frontal lobe intactness.

The purpose of this study was to systematically quantify the relationship between FOS and ERP responses to a visual oddball task in both time and frequency domains. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and electroen-cephalography (EEG) sensors were co-located over the prefrontal cortex while participants performed a visual oddball task. Fifteen participants completed 2 data collection sessions each, where they were instructed to keep a mental count of oddball images. The oddball condition produced a positive ERP at 200 ms followed by a negativity 300-500 ms after image onset in the frontal electrodes. In contrast to previous FOS studies, a FOS response was identified only in DC intensity signals and not in phase delay signals. A decrease in DC intensity was found 150-250 ms after oddball image onset with a 400-trial average in 10 of 15 participants. The latency of the positive 200 ms ERP and the FOS DC intensity decrease were significantly correlated for only 6 (out of 15) participants due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the FOS response. Coherence values between the FOS and ERP oddball responses were found to be significant in the 3-5 Hz frequency band for 10 participants. A significant Granger causal influence of the ERP on the FOS oddball response was uncovered in the 2-6 Hz frequency band for 7 participants. Collectively, our findings suggest that, for a majority of participants, the ERP and the DC intensity signal of the FOS are spectrally coherent, specifically in narrow frequency bands previously associated with event-related oscillations in the prefrontal cortex. However, these electro-optical relationships were only found in a subset of participants. Further research on enhancing the quality of the event-related FOS signal is required before it can be practically exploited in applications such as brain-computer interfacing.

However, nearly five decades have transpired since this innovative research, making it potentially valuable to use a modern-day approach to reproduce a first-generation neuromarketing study. Thus, the purpose of this study is to replicate and extend Krugman's original work. Design/methodology/approach To measure participants' neural activity, two within-subject experiments were conducted to test the effectiveness of advertising using EEG. Independent factors, as defined by Krugman (1971), were three national brand ads differentiated by their level of effectiveness (high/low) associated with recall and arousal. Findings Results from Study 1 largely support Krugman's original findings, in that an inverse relationship is observed among brain waves (beta, theta and alpha) across multiple exposures and levels. Meaning, similar patterns of activation and dissipation occur regardless of ad type or frequency. Findings from Study 2 were successful in accomplishing what Krugman originally could not by distinguishing between the ads utilizing an event-related potential (ERP) design. Originality/value This study demonstrates that a single neuromarketing approach can be used in multiple ways to provide richer insight while adding value during the research process. At the very least, the re-inquiry is an informative act associated with the theoretical relevance of using EEG measurement in marketing research.

We have developed a technique for planar multielectrode array (MEA) implantation on the mouse skull surface, which enables multisite EEG in awake and freely moving mice and reusability of the MEA probes. With this method, we reliably obtain 30-channel low-noise EEG from awake mice. Baseline and stimulus-evoked EEG recordings can be readily obtained and analyzed. For example, we have demonstrated EEG responses to auditory stimuli. Broadband noise elicits reliable 30-channel auditory event-related potentials (ERPs), and chirp stimuli induce phase-locked EEG responses just as in human sound presentation paradigms. This method is unique in achieving chronic implantation of novel MEA technology onto the mouse skull surface for chronic multisite EEG recordings. Furthermore, we demonstrate a reliable method for reusing MEA probes for multiple serial implantations without loss of EEG quality. This skull surface MEA methodology can be used to obtain simultaneous multisite EEG recordings and to test EEG biomarkers in diverse mouse models of human neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. Reusability of the MEA probesmakes it more cost-effective to deploy this system for various studies.

Here we changed to a variable ISI task to prevent/reduce preferential phase occurrence. Discrete Fourier transforms decomposed prestimulus EEG at Cz for each trial to calculate the phase of different frequencies at stimulus onset; we combined these into the delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands, and then sorted trials into phase quartiles for each. ERPs from the raw EEG, assessed using temporal Principal Components Analyses, were examined as a function of phase at stimulus onset. Preferential phase occurrence was reduced as predicted, but random phase substantially impacted component amplitudes. For example, negativity in delta enhanced Go and NoGo P3b; and in theta reduced NoGo but not Go P3b. Overall, EEG phases at stimulus onset support differential cognitive processing in this two-choice task.

Here, we propose a novel automatic pipeline (APP) for pre-processing and artifact rejection of EEG data, which innovates relative to existing methods by not only following state-of-the-art guidelines but also further employing robust statistics. Methods: APP was tested on event-related potential (ERP) data from healthy participants and schizophrenia patients, and resting-state (RS) data from healthy participants. Its performance was compared with that of existing automatic methods (FASTER for ERP data, TAPEEG and Prep pipeline for RS data) and supervised pre-processing by experts. Results: APP rejected fewer bad channels and bad epochs than the other methods. In the ERP study, it produced significantly higher amplitudes than FASTER, which were consistent with the supervised scheme. In the RS study, it produced spectral measures that correlated well with the automatic alternatives and the supervised scheme. Conclusion: APP effectively removed EEG artifacts, performing similarly to the supervised scheme and outperforming existing automatic alternatives. Significance: The proposed automatic pipeline provides a reliable and efficient tool for pre-processing large datasets of both evoked and resting-state EEG.

Although brain correlates of face processing have been established in previous fMRI and electroencephalography (EEG)/MEG studies, little is known about how the brain representation of faces and emotional expressions of faces in freely moving humans. The present study aimed to detect brain electrical potentials that occur during the viewing of human faces in natural settings. 64-channel wireless EEG and eye-tracking data were recorded in 19 participants while they moved in a mock art gallery and stopped at times to evaluate pictures hung on the walls. Positive, negative and neutral valence pictures of objects and human faces were displayed. The time instants in which pictures first occurred in the visual field were identified in eye-tracking data and used to reconstruct the triggers in continuous EEG data after synchronizing the time axes of the EEG and eye-tracking device. EEG data showed a clear face-related event-related potential (ERP) in the latency interval ranging from 165 to 210 ms (N170); this component was not seen whilst participants were viewing non-living objects. The face ERP component was stronger during viewing disgusted compared to neutral faces. Source dipole analysis revealed an equivalent current dipole in the right fusiform gyrus (BA37) accounting for N170 potential. Our study demonstrates for the first time the possibility of recording brain responses to human faces and emotional expressions in natural settings. This finding opens new possibilities for clinical, developmental, social, forensic, or marketing research in which information about face processing is of importance.

A similar expansion appears to be beginning in regard to decomposition of the EEG amplitude spectrum into frequency components via frequency PCA. However, to date, there has been no exploration of the brain's dynamic EEG-ERP linkages using PCA decomposition to assess components in each measure. Here, we recorded intrinsic EEG in both eyes-closed and eyes-open resting conditions, followed by an equiprobable go/no-go task. Frequency PCA of the EEG, including the nontask resting and within-task prestimulus periods, found seven frequency components within the delta to beta range. These differentially predicted PCA-derived go and no-go N1 and P3 ERP components. This demonstration suggests that it may be beneficial in future brain dynamics studies to implement PCA for the derivation of data-driven components from both the ERP and EEG.

Point-of-care brain injury evaluation of conscious awareness: wide scale deployment of portable HCS EEG evaluation	NEUROSCIENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS			English	Article						Disorders of Consciousness; EEG; ERP; Halifax Consciousness Scanner; P300	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VEGETATIVE STATE; PREDICTS RECOVERY; COMA; DISORDERS; P300; ERPS	Survivors of severe brain injury may remain in a decreased state of conscious awareness for an extended period of time. Clinical scales are used to describe levels of consciousness but rely on behavioural responses, precipitating misdiagnosis. We have previously utilized event-related potentials (ERPs) to circumvent reliance on behavioural responses. However, practical implementation barriers limit the clinical utility of ERP assessment at point-of-care (POC). To address this challenge, we developed the Halifax Consciousness Scanner (HCS)-a rapid, semi-automated electroencephalography system. The current study evaluated: (i) HCS feasibility in sub-acute, POC settings nationwide; (ii) ERP P300 responses in patients with acquired brain injury versus healthy controls; and (iii) correlations within and between clinical measures and P300 latencies. We assessed 28 patients with severe, chronic impairments from brain injuries and contrasted the results with healthy control data (n = 100). Correlational analyses examined relationships between P300 latencies and the commonly used clinical scales. P300 latencies were significantly delayed in patients compared to healthy controls (P < 0.05). Clinical assessment scores were significantly inter-correlated and correlated significantly with P300 latencies (P < 0.05). In sub-acute and chronic care settings, the HCS provided a physiological measure of neurocognitive processing at POC for patients with severe acquired brain injury, including those with disorders of consciousness.

In these applications, users are commonly instructed to avoid eye movements while keeping their eyes open. This secondary task can lead to exhaustion and subjects may not succeed in suppressing eye movements. In this work, we investigate the option to use a BCI with eyes-closed. Twelve healthy subjects participated in a single electroencephalography (EEG) session where they were listening to a rapid stream of bisyllabic words while alternatively having their eyes open or closed. In addition, we assessed usability aspects for the two conditions with a questionnaire. Our analysis shows that eyesclosed does not reduce the number of eye artifacts and that event-related potential (ERP) responses and classification accuracies are comparable between both conditions. Importantly, we found that subjects expressed a significant general preference toward the eyes-closed condition and were also less tensed in that condition. Furthermore, switching between eyes-closed and eyes-open and vice versa is possible without a severe drop in classification accuracy. These findings suggest that eyes-closed should be considered as a viable alternative in auditory BCIs that might be especially useful for subjects with limited control over their eye movements.

Electrophysiological underpinnings of response variability in the Go/NoGo task	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Brain dynamics; Attention; Cognition; Event-related potentials (ERPs); Principal components analysis (PCA); Response variability	REACTION-TIME VARIABILITY; CURRENT SOURCE DENSITY; PRESTIMULUS ALPHA; ERP RESPONSES; EEG ALPHA; INTRINSIC EEG; COMPONENTS; DELTA; DETERMINANTS; PERFORMANCE	Response variability has been identified as a useful predictor of executive function and performance in non-clinical samples in the Go/NoGo task. The present study explores the utility of reaction time variability (RTV) and EEG measures as predictors of Go/NoGo performance outcomes and ERP component amplitudes. Forty-four young adults had EEG recorded across eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) resting states, and during an auditory Go/NoGo task. The 18 individuals with the lowest/highest RTV were assessed for differences in behavioural outcomes. As expected, individuals with high RTV committed more Go/NoGo errors and had smaller Go P3b and NoGo P3a amplitudes, and greater Go Slow Wave positivity, reflecting inefficient decision-making and response control efforts underlying performance. When RTV and EEG measures were modelled as predictors of Go/NoGo responses, RTV and task-related changes in delta were identified as positive predictors of Go SW amplitude; while RTV and prestimulus delta amplitudes negatively predicted NoGo accuracy rates. Prestimulus delta was also found to solely predict Go mean RT and NoGo SW negativity; effects that were independent of RTV. As delta has been implicated in attention-related mechanisms, these findings suggest that inadequate attention and task engagement underpin the variability in Go/NoGo performance.

There still remain some problems in the accurate N400 waveform extraction from fewer-trial EEG data under the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) level. In this study, a supervised signal-to-noise ratio maximizer (SSM) method to obtain N400 waveform from multi-channel EEG data is proposed. The SSM algorithm designs a spatial filter for low-rank ERP component and extracts the N400 by 40-trial EEG datasets of each subject. The algorithm has more excellent performance in estimating the accurate N400 waveform from simulation data and real EEG data, compared to SIM and the regularized SOBI algorithms. The results show that the proposed method can effectively achieve the N400 extraction from fewer-trial EEG data.

Trial latencies estimation of event-related potentials in EEG by means of genetic algorithms	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; ERP; P300; single-trial; latency; genetic algorithm; intra-subject variability	P300; TIME	Objective. Event-related potentials (ERPs) are usually obtained by averaging thus neglecting the trial-to-trial latency variability in cognitive electroencephalography (EEG) responses. As a consequence the shape and the peak amplitude of the averaged ERP are smeared and reduced, respectively, when the single-trial latencies show a relevant variability. To date, the majority of the methodologies for single-trial latencies inference are iterative schemes providing suboptimal solutions, the most commonly used being the Woody's algorithm. Approach. In this study, a global approach is developed by introducing a fitness function whose global maximum corresponds to the set of latencies which renders the trial signals most aligned as possible. A suitable genetic algorithm has been implemented to solve the optimization problem, characterized by new genetic operators tailored to the present problem. Main results. The results, on simulated trials, showed that the proposed algorithm performs better than Woody's algorithm in all conditions, at the cost of an increased computational complexity (justified by the improved quality of the solution). Application of the proposed approach on real data trials, resulted in an increased correlation between latencies and reaction times w.r.t. the output from RIDE method. Significance. The above mentioned results on simulated and real data indicate that the proposed method, providing a better estimate of single-trial latencies, will open the way to more accurate study of neural responses as well as to the issue of relating the variability of latencies to the proper cognitive and behavioural correlates.

Four 30-channel EEG recordings on a single subject were performed, each about one month apart. The subject was exposed to 450MHz MWR modulated at 40Hz at the 1g peak spatial average specific absorption rate of 0.3W/kg. During a recording, 40 cycles of 30s on-off MWR exposure were used. The artifact-free responses to 126 MWR-ON stimuli and 134 MWR-OFF stimuli were averaged over stimuli and channels.Results: Regarding EEG signals locked to MWR-OFF stimulus, the enhanced signal level at alpha frequency band and about twice higher signal to noise ratio at 200 to 440ms after the stimulus have been detected. No remarkable response in EEG signals locked to MWR-ON stimulus.Conclusions: The detection of offset effect confirms that there should be an imprint generated by MWR in brain. The results of this preliminary study provide evidence for the detection of MWR-induced ERP in EEG signal and encourage further research in this direction.

A Reinforcement-Based Learning Paradigm Increases Anatomical Learning and Retention-A Neuroeducation Study	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography (EEG); event-related potential (ERP); neuroeducation; reinforcement learning; reward positivity; N250; anatomy education	PERCEPTUAL EXPERTISE; ACQUISITION; POSITIVITY; NEGATIVITY; FEEDBACK; REWARD	In anatomy education, a key hurdle to engaging in higher-level discussion in the classroom is recognizing and understanding the extensive terminology used to identify and describe anatomical structures. Given the time-limited classroom environment, seeking methods to impart this foundational knowledge to students in an efficient manner is essential. Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT) methods incorporate pre-class exercises (typically online) meant to establish foundational knowledge in novice learners so subsequent instructor-led sessions can focus on deeper, more complex concepts. Determining how best do we design and assess pre-class exercises requires a detailed examination of learning and retention in an applied educational context. Here we used electroencephalography (EEG) as a quantitative dependent variable to track learning and examine the efficacy of JiTT activities to teach anatomy. Specifically, we examined changes in the amplitude of the N250 and reward positivity event-related brain potential (ERP) components alongside behavioral performance as novice students participated in a series of computerized reinforcement-based learning modules to teach neuroanatomical structures. We found that as students learned to identify anatomical structures, the amplitude of the N250 increased and reward positivity amplitude decreased in response to positive feedback. Both on a retention and transfer exercise when learners successfully remembered and translated their knowledge to novel images, the amplitude of the reward positivity remained decreased compared to early learning. Our findings suggest ERPs can be used as a tool to track learning, retention, and transfer of knowledge and that employing the reinforcement learning paradigm is an effective educational approach for developing anatomical expertise.

In experimental conditions, ERPs can be approximated by weighted sums of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) basis signals calculated from clean data. Projection of measured signals onto the PCA subspace significantly decreases noise. Furthermore, Kalman filtering has been used to optimize the combining of the PCA filtered signal with an a priori expected ERP. The main strength of the proposed algorithm arises from manipulating a priori cross-channel information in the form of a PCA weight covariance matrix. Here, the implementation of the method has been quantified using synthetic multi-channel ERP signals to which known amounts of synthetic noise is added to all the channels. The use of synthetic data means and signal and noise are known and so signal-to-noise enhancement may be quantified. For a wide range of initial SNRs, PCA filtering increases SNR by 10 dB and Kalman filtering yields an additional 10 dB improvement.

The actual EEG signal is accompanied by a large amount of neurogenic noises and non-neurogenic interferences. Aimed at the issue of reconstructing the valuable ERP signal from polluted EEG signal, an efficient approach that combining ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and independent component analysis (ICA) is proposed. Firstly, the noisy signal is decomposed by EEMD, and several interested intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) components are obtained based on correlation between the decomposed IMFs and the original signal. Then, these interested IMF components are de-noised with ICA. Finally, the desired ERP signal is reconstructed from these de-noised IMFs. Experimental results show the merit of the proposed algorithm on EEG signal de-noising.

Atypicality of the N170 Event-Related Potential in Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Meta-analysis	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY-COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE AND NEUROIMAGING			English	Article						Autism spectrum disorder (ASD); Electroencephalography (EEG); Event-related potential (ERP); Face processing; Meta-analysis; N170	EMOTIONAL FACES; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; SOCIAL COGNITION; YOUNG-CHILDREN; GAZE DIRECTION; ERP EVIDENCE; ADULTS; RECOGNITION; PERCEPTION	BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with impaired face processing. The N170 event-related potential (ERP) has been considered a promising neural marker of this impairment. However, no quantitative review to date has integrated the literature to assess whether the N170 response to faces in individuals with ASD differs from that of typically developing (TD) individuals. METHODS: This meta-analysis examined the corpus of literature investigating difference in N170 response to faces in individuals with ASD and without ASD. Data from 23 studies (N-ASD = 374, N-TD = 359) were reviewed. Meta-analysis was used to examine the effect size of the difference in N170 latency and amplitude among individuals with ASD and without ASD. Analyses were also conducted examining hemispheric differences, potential moderators, and publication bias. RESULTS: On average, N170 latencies to faces were delayed in individuals with ASD, but amplitudes did not differ for individuals with ASD and TD individuals. Moderator analyses revealed that N170 amplitudes were smaller in magnitude in the ASD participants relative to the TD participants in adult samples and in those with higher cognitive ability. However, effects differed as a function of hemisphere of recording. No evidence of publication bias was found. CONCLUSIONS: Atypicality of N170 - particularly latency-to faces appears to be a specific biomarker of social-communicative dysfunction in ASD and may relate to differential developmental experiences and use of compensatory cognitive mechanisms. Future research should examine phenotypic differences that contribute to N170 heterogeneity, as well as specificity of N170 differences in ASD versus non-ASD clinical populations, and N170 malleability with treatment.

Early diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's with event-related potentials and event-related desynchronization in N-back working memory tasks	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Alzheimer'S disease; Mild cognitive impairment; Working memory; Event-related potentials; Event-related (de)synchronization	MASS UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS; OSCILLATORY RESPONSES; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; EEG DYNAMICS; BAND POWER; DISEASE; BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION; HEALTHY; PROGRESSION	Background and Objective: In this study we investigate whether or not event-related potentials (ERP) and/or event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) can be used to differentiate between 27 healthy elderly (HE), 21 subjects diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 15 mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Methods: Using 32-channel EEG recordings, we measured ERP responses to a three-level (N-back, N = 0,1,2) visual working memory task. We also performed ERD analysis over the same EEG data, dividing the full-band signal into the well-known delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands. Both ERP and ERD analyses were followed by cluster analysis with correction for multicomparisons whenever significant differences were found between groups. Results: Regarding ERP (full-band analysis), our findings have shown both patient groups (MCI and AD) with reduced P450 amplitude (compared to HE controls) in the execution of the non-match 1-back task at many scalp electrodes, chiefly at parietal and centro-parietal areas. However, no significant differences were found between MCI and AD in ERP analysis whatever was the task. As for sub-band analyses, ERD/ERS measures revealed that HE subjects elicited consistently greater alpha ERD responses than MCI and AD patients during the 1-back task in the match condition, with all differences located at frontal, central and occipital regions. Moreover, in the non-match condition, it was possible to distinguish between MCI and AD patients when they were performing the 0-back task, with MCI presenting more desynchronization than AD on the theta band at temporal and fronto-temporal areas. In summary, ERD analyses have revealed themselves more valuable than ERP, since they showed significant differences in all three group comparisons: HE vs. MCI, HE vs. AD, and MCI vs. AD. Conclusions: Based on these findings, we conclude that ERD responses to working memory (N-back) tasks could be useful not only for early MCI diagnosis or for improved AD diagnosis, but probably also for assessing the likelihood of MCI progression to AD, after further validated by a longitudinal study.

Research on burnout often indicates deficits in cognitive functioning, such as memory problems or impaired voluntary control over attention. Many studies focus on behavioral and self-reported measures of burnout consequences; however, a limited number have focused on its consequences on a neural level. In our EEG study (N = 88; 42 with burnout), we analyzed the event-related potentials (ERP) associated with stimulus, response and feedback processing using two experimental procedures - the Go/NoGo Task and the Doors Task. Our results show that while there is no difference in performance between burnout and control group, on the neural level there are significant differences in all analyzed aspects of information processing: stimulus, response and feedback processing, indicated by the N200 and P300, Pe, and P200 event-related potentials, respectively.

Twenty-six healthy participants performed three cognitive tasks: 1) n-back (0-, 2-and 3-back), 2) discrimination/selection response task (DSR) and 3) word generation (WG) tasks. The data provided includes: 1) measured data, 2) demographic data, and 3) basic analysis results. For n-back (dataset A) and DSR tasks (dataset B), event-related potential (ERP) analysis was performed, and spatiotemporal characteristics and classification results for 'target' versus 'non-target' (dataset A) and symbol 'O' versus symbol 'X' (dataset B) are provided. Time-frequency analysis was performed to show the EEG spectral power to differentiate the task-relevant activations. Spatiotemporal characteristics of hemodynamic responses are also shown. For the WG task (dataset C), the EEG spectral power and spatiotemporal characteristics of hemodynamic responses are analyzed, and the potential merit of hybrid EEG-NIRS BCIs was validated with respect to classification accuracy. We expect that the dataset provided will facilitate performance evaluation and comparison of many neuroimaging analysis techniques.

Moving Beyond ERP Components: A Selective Review of Approaches to Integrate EEG and Behavior	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						EEG; ERP; blind source separation; partial least squares; canonical correlations analysis; representational similarity analysis; deep learning; hierarchical Bayesian model	BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; THETA OSCILLATIONS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; BRAIN NETWORKS; ALPHA RHYTHMS; FMRI; FUSION; ATTENTION	Relationships between neuroimaging measures and behavior provide important clues about brain function and cognition in healthy and clinical populations. While electroencephalography (EEG) provides a portable, low cost measure of brain dynamics, it has been somewhat underrepresented in the emerging field of model-based inference. We seek to address this gap in this article by highlighting the utility of linking EEG and behavior, with an emphasis on approaches for EEG analysis that move beyond focusing on peaks or "components" derived from averaging EEG responses across trials and subjects (generating the event-related potential, ERP). First, we review methods for deriving features from EEG in order to enhance the signal within single-trials. These methods include filtering based on user-defined features (i.e., frequency decomposition, time-frequency decomposition), filtering based on data-driven properties (i.e., blind source separation, BSS), and generating more abstract representations of data (e.g., using deep learning). We then review cognitive models which extract latent variables from experimental tasks, including the drift diffusion model (DDM) and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. Next, we discuss ways to access associations among these measures, including statistical models, data-driven joint models and cognitive joint modeling using hierarchical Bayesian models (HBMs). We think that these methodological tools are likely to contribute to theoretical advancements, and will help inform our understandings of brain dynamics that contribute to moment-to-moment cognitive function.

Single-Trial EEG Analysis Predicts Memory Retrieval and Reveals Source-Dependent Differences	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; memory retrieval; old/new effect; multi-variate analysis; prediction	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; EXPLICIT MEMORY; FAMILIARITY; RECOLLECTION; CLASSIFICATION; STRENGTH; IMPLICIT	We used pattern classifiers to extract features related to recognition memory retrieval from the temporal information in single-trial electroencephalography (EEG) data during attempted memory retrieval. Two-class classification was conducted on correctly remembered trials with accurate context (or source) judgments vs. correctly rejected trials. The average accuracy for datasets recorded in a single session was 61% while the average accuracy for datasets recorded in two separate sessions was 56%. To further understand the basis of the classifier's performance, two other pattern classifiers were trained on different pairs of behavioral conditions. The first of these was designed to use information related to remembering the item and the second to use information related to remembering the contextual information (or source) about the item. Mollison and Curran (2012) had earlier shown that subjects' familiarity judgments contributed to improved memory of spatial contextual information but not of extrinsic associated color information. These behavioral results were similarly reflected in the event-related potential (ERP) known as the FN400 (an early frontal effect relating to familiarity) which revealed differences between correct and incorrect context memories in the spatial but not color conditions. In our analyses we show that a classifier designed to distinguish between correct and incorrect context memories, more strongly involves early activity (400-500 ms) over the frontal channels for the location distinctions, than for the extrinsic color associations. In contrast, the classifier designed to classify memory for the item (without memory for the context), had more frontal channel involvement for the color associated experiments than for the spatial experiments. Taken together these results argue that location may be bound more tightly with the item than an extrinsic color association. The multivariate classification approach also showed that trial-by-trial variation in EEG corresponding to these ERP components were predictive of subjects' behavioral responses. Additionally, the multivariate classification approach enabled analysis of error conditions that did not have sufficient trials for standard ERP analyses. These results suggested that false alarms were primarily attributable to item memory (as opposed to memory of associated context), as commonly predicted, but with little previous corroborating EEG evidence.

The neural correlates of temperamental inhibitory control in toddlers	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						event-related potentials; effortful control; early childhood	EFFORTFUL CONTROL; SELF-REGULATION; GO/NOGO TASK; CHILDREN; ATTENTION; NOGO; GO	The current study examined the association between effortful control and a well-studied neural index of self-regulation, the N2 event-related potential (ERP) component, in toddlers. Participants included 107 toddlers (44 girls) assessed at 30, 36 and 42 months of age. Participants completed a Go/NoGo task while electroencephalography data were recorded. The study focused on the N2 ERP component. Parent-reported effortful control was examined in association with the NoGo N2 ERP component. Findings suggest a positive association between the NoGo N2 component and the inhibitory control subscale of the wider effortful control dimension, suggesting that the N2 component may index processes associated with temperamental effortful control.

As part of this, the auditory N100 event-related potential (ERP) component is attenuated in patients with schizophrenia, with stronger attenuation occurring during auditory verbal hallucinations. Changes in the N100 component assumingly reflect disturbed responsiveness of the auditory system toward external stimuli in schizophrenia. With this premise, we investigated the therapeutic utility of neurofeedback training to modulate the auditory-evoked N100 component in patients with schizophrenia and associated auditory verbal hallucinations. Ten patients completed electroencephalography neurofeedback training for modulation of N100 (treatment condition) or another unrelated component, P200 (control condition). On a behavioral level, only the control group showed a tendency for symptom improvement in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score in a pre-/postcomparison (t((4)) = 2.71, P = .054); however, no significant differences were found in specific hallucination related symptoms (t((7)) = -0.53, P = .62). There was no significant overall effect of neurofeedback training on ERP components in our paradigm; however, we were able to identify different learning patterns, and found a correlation between learning and improvement in auditory verbal hallucination symptoms across training sessions (r = 0.664, n = 9, P = .05). This effect results, with cautious interpretation due to the small sample size, primarily from the treatment group (r = 0.97, n = 4, P = .03). In particular, a within-session learning parameter showed utility for predicting symptom improvement with neurofeedback training. In conclusion, patients with schizophrenia and associated auditory verbal hallucinations who exhibit a learning pattern more characterized by within-session aptitude may benefit from electroencephalography neurofeedback. Furthermore, independent of the training group, a significant spatial pre-post difference was found in the event-related component P200 (P = .04).

Different image qualities were obtained by changing sigma values in the Gaussian kernel function. The experimental results illustrated that the measurable event-related potentials and eye-tracking parameters varied with the change of the image quality. The more blurred the image, the higher and earlier the P300 (event-related potentials at latency about 300-550ms) was elicited. Meanwhile, the visual fixation duration decreased and the detection rate increased with the increase of sigma. The blurred image quality could be evaluated based on the synthetic results of the reciprocal of P300 latency and the visual fixation duration. The result showed a good correlation with the subjective rating scores, which proved the feasibility of utilizing electroencephalography and eye-tracking technology to evaluate the blurred image quality.

Combined assessment of attentional reserve and cognitive-motor effort under various levels of challenge with a dry EEG system	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						attentional reserve; dry EEG; EEG spectral content; ERP; mental workload; motor performance	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY LOAD; MENTAL WORKLOAD; THETA OSCILLATIONS; MOVEMENT ARTIFACT; TASK-DIFFICULTY; HEAD MOVEMENT; BRAIN; PERFORMANCE; P300	A novel ERP approach was proposed to index variations in mental workload, particularly in attentional reserve, which is complementary to EEG spectral content thought to reflect mental effort. To our knowledge, no study has assessed mental effort and attentional reserve simultaneously in EEG gel-based and, importantly, dry systems, which are particularly well suited for real-world settings. Therefore, by systematically considering ERP, EEG spectral, and importantly the combination of both, this study examined if a small set of dry EEG electrodes could detect changes in both spectral and ERP metrics to assess the mental workload under various challenges with a similar fidelity to their gel-based counterparts in a laboratory setting. By employing both EEG gel-based and dry systems, the ERP and spectral markers were computed while participants executed a visuomotor task under three levels of challenge. For both EEG systems, more challenging levels of difficulty were associated with concomitant changes in ERP amplitude, and spectral power reflected a reduction of the attentional reserve and an increase in cognitive-motor effort, respectively. Those variations in attentional reserve and cognitive-motor effort collectively indexed mental workload with nearly identical fidelity for both gel-based and dry EEG systems. These findings promise to assess the mental workload in situations where the use of dry EEG systems could be advantageously employed to examine human cognitive-motor performance.

In this paper, we mainly proposed an approach based on microstates to examine the encoding of mental rotation from the spatial-temporal changes of EEG signals. In particular, we collected EEG data from 11 healthy subjects in a mental rotation cognitive task using 12 different stimulus pictures representing left and right hands at various rotational angles. We applied the microstate method to investigate the microstates conveyed by the event-related potential extracted from EEG data during mental rotation, and obtained four microstate modes (referred to as modes A, B, C, D, respectively). Subsequently, we defined several measures, including microstate sequences, topographical map, hemispheric lateralization, and duration of microstate, to characterize the dynamics of microstates during mental rotation. We observed that (1) the microstates sequence had a specified progressing mode, i.e., A -> B -> A; (2) the activation of the right parietal occipital region was stronger than that of the left parietal occipital region according to the hemispheric lateralization of the microstates mode A; and (3) the duration of the second microstates mode A showed the shorter duration in the vertical stimuli, named "angle effect".

At present, EEG identification usually requires external stimuli or particular tasks imposed on participators, such as identification based on movement imagination (MI) and event-related potential (ERP), which restricts its promotion in real life. To overcome the limitation, we assume a task-related EEG can be divided into a background EEG (BEEG) containing one's unique intrinsic features and a residue EEG (REEG) composed of task-evoked EEG and random noise. Furthermore, we suppose only a few features can reveal one's identity. Therefore, BEEG represents a low-rank characteristic, suitable for personal identification. In this paper, we proposed a fast LRMD-based EEG identification algorithm with maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) and rational quadratic kernel, which can efficiently extract BEEG out and deliver a high accuracy classification. Extensive experiments conducted on three public EEG datasets and a self-collected multi-task EEG dataset all achieve outstanding performance under the low rank of BEEG data matrix and various time length scales of short-time Fourier Transform (STFT), which means that our approach does not depend on the task type.

Recently single-trial ERP extraction has become one of the main research areas in neuroscience. Spatiotemporal filtering method which uses more than one channel is one of these extraction methods. A modified spatiotemporal filtering method is proposed here for single-trial estimation of correlated ERP component parameters (peak latency and peak amplitude). The error of this method in extracting the peak amplitude and peak latency of ERP components is less than 10% and changing the temporal correlation coefficient of the main ERP components, does not change the results notably. Our proposed method for peak amplitude and peak latency estimation is proved to be better than other reported methods (especially for peak amplitude estimation) and has less computational cost in comparison with other spatiotemporal methods. The ability of our method to generalize to any number of correlated ERP components is one of the key points in our work.

Increasing the mobility of EEG data collection using a Latte Panda computer	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Latte Panda; Portable; Ecological; Hardware	AUDITORY-EVOKED RESPONSES; SPECTRAL COMPLEXITY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; P2; ERP; ELECTRODES; RHYTHM; PHASE	Background: Electroencephalography (EEG) experiments often require several computers to ensure accurate stimulus presentation and data collection. However, this requirement can make it more difficult to perform such experiments in mobile settings within, or outside, the laboratory. New method: Computer miniaturisation and increasing processing power allow for EEG experiments to become more portable. Our goal is to show that a Latte Panda, a small Windows 10 computer, can be used to accurately collect EEG data in a similar manner to a laptop. Using a stationary bike, we also suggest that the Latte Panda will allow for more portable EEG experiments. Results: Significant and reliable MMN and P3 responses, event-related potentials (ERPs) typically associated with auditory oddball tasks, were observed and were consistent when using either the laptop or Latte Panda for EEG data collection. Similar MMN and P3 ERPs were also measured in the sitting and stationary biking conditions while using a Latte Panda for data collection. Comparison with existing method: Data recorded by the Latte Panda computer produced comparable and equally reliable results to the laptop. As well, similar ERPs during sitting and biking would suggest that EEG experiments can be conducted in more mobile situations despite the increased noise and artifacts associated with muscle movement. Conclusions: Our results show that the Latte Panda is a low-cost, more portable alternative to a laptop computer for recording EEG data. Such a device will further allow for more portable and mobile EEG experimentation in a wider variety of environments.	[Kuziek, Jonathan W.

J	Bojorges-Valdez, E; Yanez-Suarez, O				Bojorges-Valdez, Erik; Yanez-Suarez, Oscar			Association between EEG spectral power dynamics and event related potential amplitude on a P300 speller	BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS & ENGINEERING EXPRESS			English	Article						event related potentials; detrended fluctuation analysis; power spectral density time series; scaling exponent; BCI; EEG	RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; AUDITORY ODDBALL; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; TIME-COURSE; RESPONSES; DESYNCHRONIZATION; STIMULI; NOISE; THETA	Objective: Event related potentials (ERPs) are phenomena that produce alterations on the spectral power of different bands synced with stimuli presentation. Such a perspective overlooks that the spectral power time series present spontaneous oscillations, the dynamics of which have been associated with the state of health and could be also linked to superior processes such as attention, memory, or cognition. In this work, amplitude of the ERP has been associated with dynamics of the power spectral density (PSD) time series. Approach: Data from a public P3 speller database were analyzed. Statistics about latency, amplitude and scalp distribution of the ERP confirm correct task realization. The spectral power over alpha, beta and gamma bands were correlated with ERP amplitude, considering such estimations time-locked with stimuli presentation. Additionally, PSD time series over the same bands were constructed using a sliding window not synced with stimulation. From these time series, a scaling exponent was computed using a detrended fluctuation analysis approach, and such indices were correlated with ERP amplitude of all registered electrodes. Main results: The correlation between ERP amplitude and scaling exponents of PSD series achieve statistical significance in almost all channels and for all analyzed bands (excepting alpha at C4). In particular, beta and gamma PSD series achieve R-2 values above 0.6 for Cz. Meanwhile, the correlation analysis with time-locked PSD achieves a statistically significant relationship with ERP amplitude (p < 0.05) but with a coefficient of determination (R-2) below 0.2, only for gamma and alpha over the C4 and Pz channels. Significance: The ERP amplitude and scaling exponent of the PSD time series show an anticorrelated behavior, suggesting that larger ERP amplitudes are elicited when the PSD series are less autocorrelated, similar to white noise, further suggesting that the processes involved in the generation of such dynamics could be related to the mechanisms of cognitive responses.

J	Gallant, SN; Pun, C; Yang, LX				Gallant, Sara N.; Pun, Carson; Yang, Lixia			Age differences in the neural correlates underlying control of emotional memory: An event-related potential study	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Event-related potentials; Aging; Emotion; Memory; Intentional forgetting	COGNITIVE CONTROL; BRAIN POTENTIALS; PROCESSING-SPEED; ERP; ITEM; RECOGNITION; ATTENTION; INFORMATION; PERFORMANCE; INHIBITION	The ability to selectively remember important information and forget irrelevant details is fundamental to successful memory. Research has shown that both younger and older adults can intentionally remember and forget information varying in emotional valence; however, whether the neural correlates of these processes change with age is unknown. In this event-related potential (ERP) study, we sought to fill this knowledge gap using the item-directed forgetting (DF) task. Younger and older adults encoded positive, negative, or neutral words that were cued as either to-be-remembered (TBR) or to-be-forgotten (TBF), while brain activity was recorded with electroencephalography (EEG). Behaviorally, both age groups showed DF effects, although the magnitude of DF was reduced in older adults. Moreover, DF was not influenced by the emotional valence of words in either age group. In the brain, age differences emerged across both word- and cue-related ERPs. Whereas the late positive potential (LPP) was greater for negative than positive words in younger adults, older adults showed a reduced LPP for negative versus positive items. In response to memory cues, younger adults' ERPs showed enhanced parietal and frontal positivity following TBR and TBF cues, respectively. In contrast, older adults displayed greater frontal activity while encoding TBR items than younger adults but age invariance in parietal ERPs following TBR cues. Together, these findings suggest that both younger and older adults are able to intentionally forget information that varies in emotional valence but that the neural mechanisms underlying these processes may change with age.

Depression is a severe mental disorder. However, the neural mechanisms underlying affective interference (difficulties in directing attention away from negative distractors) in depression patients are still not well-understood. In particular, the connections between brain regions remain unclear. Using the emotional face-word Stroop task, we aimed to reveal the altered electroencephalography (EEG) functional connectivity in patients with depression, using concepts from event-related potentials (ERPs) and time series clustering. Approach. In this study, the EEG signals of ten healthy participants and ten depression patients were collected from a 64-sensor cap. Subsequently, EEG signals were segmented into temporal windows corresponding to the ERPs. For each duration, the dynamic time warping algorithm was used to calculate the similarities between EEG signals from different electrodes, and differences of these similarities were compared between the groups. Finally, hierarchical clustering was used to identify functionally connected regions and examine changes in depression. Main results. It was observed that during the time interval of 400-600 ms (N450 components), depression patients had more long-range connections than did healthy control patients and exhibited abnormal functional connectivity via the superior and middle frontal gyrus, specifically, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DL-PFC, Brodmann's area 8 and 9), which is related to the control and resolution of affective interference. Moreover, the functionally connected region of depression patients was much larger than that of healthy participants, which is caused by brain resource reorganization. Significance. These findings thus provide new insights into the neural mechanisms of depression and further identify the DL-PFC and connections between certain electrodes as quantitative indicators of depression.

A number of studies have reported the characteristics of human event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to the evaluation of goods-to-goods brand extension. In contrast, human brain responses to the evaluation of service extension are relatively unexplored. The aim of this study was investigating cognitive processes underlying the evaluation of service-to-service brand extension with electroencephalography (EEG). A total of 56 text stimuli composed of service brand name (S1) followed by extended service name (S2) were presented to participants. The EEG of participants was recorded while participants were asked to evaluate whether a given brand extension was acceptable or not. The behavioral results revealed that participants could evaluate brand extension though they had little knowledge about the extended services, indicating the role of brand in the evaluation of the services. Additionally, we developed a method of grouping brand extension stimuli according to the fit levels obtained from behavioral responses, instead of grouping of stimuli a priori. The ERP analysis identified three components during the evaluation of brand extension: N2, P300, and N400. No difference in the N2 amplitude was found among the different levels of a fit between S1 and S2. The P300 amplitude for the low level of fit was greater than those for higher levels (p < 0.05). The N400 amplitude was more negative for the mid-and high-level fits than the low level. The ERP results of P300 and N400 indicate that the early stage of brain extension evaluation might first detect low-fit brand extension as an improbable target followed by the late stage of the integration of S2 into S1. Along with previous findings, our results demonstrate different cognitive evaluation of service-to-service brand extension from goods-to-goods.

The use of single-trial ERP in a real-time BCI application is challenging, due to its inherent noise contamination. Usually, multiple-trial ERPs are averaged to derive discriminative features of different classes by reducing their noise effects. Time-domain filtering is implemented here using an array wavelet transform. Sometimes, several channels can carry the signals, which are irrelevant to actual EPR information against the respective stimuli. A spatial filtering method based on clustering is introduced, to suppress such channels if any. Hence, the single-trial ERP is filtered in both the spatial and temporal domains to improve its discriminative features. The spatial-temporal discriminate analysis is employed to derive the features leading to the performance of target and non-target classification by using linear discriminant analysis. The proposed method is validated using a data set recorded from our experiments. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is superior to that of the recently developed algorithms for single-trial ERP classification.

Expertise-related differences in the performance of simple and complex tasks: an event-related potential evaluation of futsal players	SCIENCE AND MEDICINE IN FOOTBALL			English	Article						Congruency; EEG; N1; event-related potential (ERP); expertise; futsal		Background: In recent years, anecdotal evidence has pointed to the importance of futsal as a significant activity for the development of perceptual and technical skills, possibly due to the intensity of the game providing a multitude of different stimuli to the players. However, no scientific evidence to date exists regarding the processes that may underpin such benefits. The purpose of this study was to assess differences in electro-cortical activity and reaction time (RT) between expert and recreational futsal players.Methods: 11 expert and 12 recreational futsal players (mean age: 28.7 4.9 years) performed congruent and incongruent trials of a modified Flanker task on a customised computer screen. RT generated by an index-finger mouse press was recorded via a customised micro-processing system and electro-cortical activity was recorded by electroencephalography during task performance.Results: There was a significant difference in RT and error rate in congruent and incongruent task performance, and difference in electro-cortical activity showing an enhanced N1 ERP mean amplitude within the parietal region in the expert compared to recreational group.Conclusion: Similar to previous research, a greater level of expertise leads to recruitment of brain areas necessary for the efficient integration and processing of information required to produce desired goal-directed behaviour.

Evaluation of electrical brain activity using Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) is one of the methods to investigate the underlying reasons of tinnitus perception. Previous studies using ERPs suggest that the precognitive memory in tinnitus groups is negatively affected in comparison to the normal hearing groups. In this study, cognitive memory has been assessed using visual and auditory P300 response with oddball paradigm. Fifteen chronic tinnitus subjects and six normal hearing subjects participated in the experiment. T-test with significance level of 0.05 was applied on amplitude and latency of auditory and visual P300 for all electroencephalography (EEG) channels separately to compare tinnitus and normal hearing groups where the tinnitus group showed meaningful lower amplitude of auditory P300 peak in three EEG channels.

Using galvanometers, such sustained displacement of the EEG baseline was recorded in the early days of EEG recordings. To stabilize the EEG baseline and eliminate artefacts, EEG was performed later by voltage amplifiers with high-pass filters that dismiss slow DC potentials. This left slow DC potential recordings as a neglected diagnostic source in the routine clinical setting over the last few decades. Brain DC waves may arise from physiological processes or pathological phenomena. Recordings of DC potentials are fundamental electro-clinical signatures of some neurological and psychological disorders and may serve as diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment monitoring tools. We here review the utility of both physiological and pathological brain DC potentials in different aspects of neurological and psychological disorders. This may enhance our understanding of the role of brain DC potentials and improve our fundamental clinical and research strategies for brain disorders.

The generated potential distribution can be measured with elctrodes placed on the scalp (electroencephalography, EEG). EEG signals can be related to sponteneous, event related or evoked potential recordings. The EEG pattern change in stiuations of alertness, resting or sleep. It is possible to communicate with the environment and control a computer or another device, by using mu and P300 waves. These systems are called brain computer interfaces or interactions, and widely used. Oxygenation in the brain can be observed with functional near-inrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). By using these systems, brain functions of people whose work require attention, can be monitored. In this study, EEG and fNIRS are proposed for some military purpose. A person whose task requires high alertness can be monitored using their brain functions. Observance of a person by a command center in some critical tasks such as the jet piloting where it is required to give rapid and correct decisions under stress or under the risk of loss of conscious, or the surveillance of critical areas or devices would highly support the performance of the mission. Inaddition, it is possible to use EEG signals to make easier the lives of veterans who have normal brain functions but suffer from physical or speech disabilities or in the investigation of their brain trauma.

Identifying the relationship between oscillatory dynamics and event-related responses	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Semantics; Syntax; EEG; Oscillatory dynamics; Event related potentials	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; LEVEL LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; THETA-POWER INCREASES; SYNTACTIC ANOMALIES; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; EVOKED-RESPONSES; EEG-DATA; POTENTIALS; VIOLATIONS; BETA	Event related potentials (ERPs) and time frequency analysis of the EEG can identify the temporally distinct coordination of groups of neurons across brain regions during sentence processing. Although there are strong arguments that ERP components and neural oscillations are driven by the same changes in the neural signal, others argue that the lack of clear associations between the two suggests oscillatory dynamics are more than just time frequency representations of ERP components, making it unclear how the two are related. The current study seeks to examine the neural activity underlying auditory sentence processing of both semantic and syntactic errors to clarify if ERP and time frequency analyses identify the same or unique neural responses. Thirty-nine adults completed an auditory semantic judgment task and a grammaticality judgment task. As expected, the semantic judgment task elicited a larger N400 and greater increase in theta power for semantic errors compared to correct sentences and the syntactic judgment task elicited a greater P600 and beta power decrease for both grammatical error types compared to syntactically correct sentences. Importantly, we identified a significant relationship between the N400 and P600 ERPs and theta and beta oscillatory dynamics during semantic and syntactic processing. These findings suggest that ERPs and neural oscillations measure similar neural processes; however, unaccounted for variance may indicate that neural oscillations provide additional information regarding fluctuations in power within a given frequency band. Future studies that vary semantic and syntactic complexity are necessary to understand the cognitive processes that are indexed by these oscillations.

Though a variety of experimental methodologies have been used to investigate cognitive fatigue in vigilance, relatively little research has utilized electroencephalography (EEG), specifically event-related potentials (ERPs), to explore the nature of cognitive fatigue, also known as the vigilance decrement. Moreover, much of the research that has been done on vigilance and ERPs uses non-traditional vigilance paradigms, limiting generalizability to the established body of behavioral results and corresponding theories. In this study, we address concerns with prior research by (1) investigating the vigilance decrement using a well-established visual vigilance task, (2) utilizing a task designed to attenuate possible confounding ERP components present within a vigilance paradigm, and (3) informing our interpretations with recent findings from ERP research. We averaged data across electrodes located over the frontal, central, and parietal scalp. Then, we generated waveforms locked to the onset of critical low-frequency or non-critical high-frequency events during a 40 min task that was segregated into time blocks for data analysis. There were three primary findings from the analyses of these data. First, mean amplitude of N1 was greater during later blocks for both low-frequency and high-frequency events, a contradictory finding compared to past visual vigilance studies that is further discussed with respect to current interpretations of the N1 in visual attention tasks. Second, P3b mean amplitude following low-frequency events was reduced during later blocks, with a later onset latency. Third and finally, the decrease in P3b amplitude correlated with individual differences in the magnitude of the vigilance decrement, assessed using d'. The results provide evidence for degradations of cognitive processing efficiency brought on by extended time on task, leading to delayed processing and decreased discriminability of critical stimuli from non-critical stimuli. These conclusions are discussed in the context of the vigilance decrement and corresponding theoretical accounts.

During the performance of a modified concealed information test (CIT) task, a series of Chinese names were presented, which served as the target, irrelevant, or the probe stimuli for both the guilty and innocent groups. For participants in the guilty group, the probe stimulus was their individual name, whereas for the innocent group, the probe stimulus was one irrelevant name. In particular, data from concurrent fNIRS and ERP recordings were carefully inspected for participants from the two groups. Interestingly, we discovered that for the guilty group, the probe stimulus elicited significantly higher P300 amplitude at parietal site and also evoked significantly stronger oxyhemoglobin (HbO) concentration changes in the bilateral superior frontal gyrus and bilateral middle frontal gyrus than the irrelevant stimuli. However, this is not the case for the innocent group, in which participants exhibited no significant differences in both ERP and fNIRS measures between the probe and irrelevant stimuli. More importantly, our findings also demonstrated that the combined ERP and fNIRS feature was able to differentiate the guilty and innocent groups with enhanced sensitivity, in which AUC (the area under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) is 0.94 for deception detection based on the combined indicator, much higher than that based on the ERP component P300 only (0.85) or HbO measure only (0.84).

Therefore, individuals' tend to find faces unconsciously, even in objects. Why is face-likeness perceived in non-face objects? Previous event-related potential (ERP) studies showed that the P1 component (early visual processing), the N170 component (face detection), and the N250 component (personal detection) reflect the neural processing of faces. Inverted faces were reported to enhance the amplitude and delay the latency of P1 and N170. To investigate face-likeness processing in the brain, we explored the face-related components of the ERP through a face-like evaluation task using natural faces, cars, insects, and Arcimboldo paintings presented upright or inverted. We found a significant correlation between the inversion effect index and face like scores in P1 in both hemispheres and in N170 in the right hemisphere. These results suggest that judgment of face-likeness occurs in a relatively early stage of face processing.

From ERPs to MVPA Using the Amsterdam Decoding and Modeling Toolbox (ADAM)	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						MVPA; temporal generalization; decoding; EEG signal processing; time-frequency analysis; ERPs	HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; MULTIVARIATE PATTERN-ANALYSIS; ATTENTIONAL SELECTION; OBJECT RECOGNITION; TEMPORAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; ROC CURVE; EEG-DATA; BRAIN; REPRESENTATIONS	In recent years, time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) has gained much popularity in the analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. However, MVPA may appear daunting to those who have been applying traditional analyses using event-related potentials (ERPs) or event-related fields (ERFs). To ease this transition, we recently developed the Amsterdam Decoding and Modeling (ADAM) toolbox in MATLAB. ADAM is an entry-level toolbox that allows a direct comparison of ERP/ERF results to MVPA results using any dataset in standard EEGLAB or Fieldtrip format. The toolbox performs and visualizes multiple-comparison corrected group decoding and forward encoding results in a variety of ways, such as classifier performance across time, temporal generalization (time-by-time) matrices of classifier performance, channel tuning functions (CTFs) and topographical maps of (forward-transformed) classifier weights. All analyses can be performed directly on raw data or can be preceded by a time-frequency decomposition of the data in which case the analyses are performed separately on different frequency bands. The figures ADAM produces are publication-ready. In the current manuscript, we provide a cookbook in which we apply a decoding analysis to a publicly available MEG/EEG dataset involving the perception of famous, non-famous and scrambled faces. The manuscript covers the steps involved in single subject analysis and shows how to perform and visualize a subsequent group-level statistical analysis. The processing pipeline covers computation and visualization of group ERPs, ERP difference waves, as well as MVPA decoding results. It ends with a comparison of the differences and similarities between EEG and MEG decoding results. The manuscript has a level of description that allows application of these analyses to any dataset in EEGLAB or Fieldtrip format.	[Fahrenfort, Johannes J.; van Driel, Joram; Olivers, Christian N.

J	Coll, MP				Coll, Michel-Pierre			Meta-analysis of ERP investigations of pain empathy underlines methodological issues in ERP research	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						empathy; pain; ERP; methods; meta-analysis	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NEURAL RESPONSES; OTHERS PAIN; BRAIN POTENTIALS/FIELDS; EMOTION; SELF; PERCEPTION; GUIDELINES; BIAS; EEG	Empathy has received considerable attention from the field of cognitive and social neuroscience. A significant portion of these studies used the event-related potential (ERP) technique to study the mechanisms of empathy for pain in others in different conditions and clinical populations. These show that specific ERP components measured during the observation of pain in others are modulated by several factors and altered in clinical populations. However, issues present in this literature such as analytical flexibility and lack of type 1 error control raise doubts regarding the validity and reliability of these conclusions. The current study compiled the results and methodological characteristics of 40 studies using ERP to study empathy of pain in others. The results of the meta-analysis suggest that the centro-parietal P3 and late positive potential component are sensitive to the observation of pain in others, while the early N1 and N2 components are not reliably associated with vicarious pain observation. The review of the methodological characteristics shows that the presence of selective reporting, analytical flexibility and lack of type 1 error control compromise the interpretation of these results. The implication of these results for the study of empathy and potential solutions to improve future investigations are discussed.

In the present research, 15 children with ADHD were studied along with 19 age-matched control subjects (aged 7-11years) as they attempted to reproduce shorter (1000 ms) and longer (2200 ms) time intervals. Trial-mean event-related potential (ERP) and event-related spectral perturbation measures were used to compare the electroencephalography (EEG) source-level activity patterns of the ADHD and control subjects during the time-encoding and reproduction phases. For both short and long intervals, the performance of subjects with ADHD was significantly less accurate and more variable than that of the age-matched controls. During the encoding phase, the ADHD and control ERPs differed significantly for the midfrontal source cluster. The midfrontal P300 amplitude evoked by the onset of the encoding phase was significantly higher for the ADHD group. Similarly, the amplitude of contingent negative variation for the ADHD group was lower for the midfrontal independent component (IC) cluster during long-interval encoding. Theta event-related synchronization in the right occipital cluster also differed between groups during both the encoding and reproduction phases. Moreover, children with ADHD failed to show a frontal selection positivity component in the reproduction phase. Significant differences were found in the mean alpha power for the prefrontal source cluster during the time reproduction phase. These results suggest electrophysiological evidence for time perception deficiencies, selective visual processing disturbances, and working memory impairment in children with ADHD.

The purpose is removing noise caused by EEG activities which are irrelevant to stimuli presented to a subject from single-trial event-related potential (ERP) data. Canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) is extended by adding a regularization term that controls the spatial smoothness of the decomposed components on a scalp. An initialization method using geometrical information is also proposed. The geometric structure of an EEG signal is expressed as an undirected graph where the similarities between electrodes are defined by their relative distances on a scalp. The effectiveness is demonstrated in a noise-removing experiment using pseudo-ERP, where the proposed method achieved better performance than the conventional CPD.

J	Ehrlich, SK; Cheng, G				Ehrlich, Stefan K.; Cheng, Gordon			Human-agent co-adaptation using error-related potentials	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						electroencephalography (EEG); brain-computer interface (BCI); event-related potentials (ERP); error-related potentials (ErrP); error monitoring; human-robot interaction (HRI); co-adaptation	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; COGNITIVE CONTROL; ERP COMPONENTS; EEG; PERFORMANCE; CORTEX; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION; NEGATIVITY	Objective. Error-related potentials (ErrP) have been proposed as an intuitive feedback signal decoded from the ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG) of a human observer for improving human-robot interaction (HRI). While recent demonstrations of this approach have successfully studied the use of ErrPs as a teaching signal for robot skill learning, so far, no efforts have been made towards HRI scenarios where mutual adaptations between human and robot are expected or required. These are collaborative or social interactive scenarios without predefined dominancy of the human partner and robots being perceived as intentional agents. Here we explore the usability of ErrPs as a feedback signal from the human for mediating co-adaptation in human-robot interaction. Approach. We experimentally demonstrate ErrPs-based mediation of co-adaptation in a human-robot interaction study where successful interaction depended on co-adaptive convergence to a consensus between them. While subjects adapted to the robot by reflecting upon its behavior, the robot adapted its behavior based on ErrPs decoded online from the human partner's ongoing EEG. Main results. ErrPs were decoded online in single trial with an avg. accuracy of 81.8% +/- 8.0% across 13 subjects, which was sufficient for effective adaptation of robot behavior. Successful co-adaptation was demonstrated by significant improvements in human-robot interaction efficacy and efficiency, and by the robot behavior that emerged during co-adaptation. These results indicate the potential of ErrPs as a useful feedback signal for mediating co-adaptation in human-robot interaction as demonstrated in a practical example. Significance. As robots become more widely embedded in society, methods for aligning them to human expectations and conventions will become increasingly important in the future. In this quest, ErrPs may constitute a promising complementary feedback signal for guiding adaptations towards human preferences. In this paper we extended previous research to less constrained HRI scenarios where mutual adaptations between human and robot are expected or required.

J	Su, KM; Hairston, WD; Robbins, K				Su, Kyung-min; Hairston, W. David; Robbins, Kay			EEG-Annotate: Automated identification and labeling of events in continuous signals with applications to EEG	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; Single-trial ERP; Time-locked; Event identification; Stimulus-response	ADAPTATION REGULARIZATION; THETA OSCILLATIONS; ERP; POTENTIALS; CLASSIFICATION; INTEGRATION; FRAMEWORK; SELECTION; PATTERN; ALPHA	Background: In controlled laboratory EEG experiments, researchers carefully mark events and analyze subject responses time-locked to these events. Unfortunately, such markers may not be available or may come with poor timing resolution for experiments conducted in less-controlled naturalistic environments. New method: We present an integrated event-identification method for identifying particular responses that occur in unlabeled continuously recorded EEG signals based on information from recordings of other subjects potentially performing related tasks. We introduce the idea of timing slack and timing tolerant performance measures to deal with jitter inherent in such non-time-locked systems. We have developed an implementation available as an open-source MATLAB toolbox (http://github.com/VisLab/EEG-Annotate) and have made test data available in a separate data note. Results: We applied the method to identify visual presentation events (both target and non-target) in data from an unlabeled subject using labeled data from other subjects with good sensitivity and specificity. The method also identified actual visual presentation events in the data that were not previously marked in the experiment. Comparison with existing methods: Although the method uses traditional classifiers for initial stages, the problem of identifying events based on the presence of stereotypical EEG responses is the converse of the traditional stimulus-response paradigm and has not been addressed in its current form. Conclusions: In addition to identifying potential events in unlabeled or incompletely labeled EEG, these methods also allow researchers to investigate whether particular stereotypical neural responses are present in other circumstances. Timing-tolerance has the added benefit of accommodating inter- and intra-subject timing variations. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Conventional methods to identify cognitive declines (i.e., neuropsychological testing and clinical judgment) can lead to false positive diagnoses of cognitive impairment. Tools such as electroencephalography (EEG) offer additional measures of cognitive processing, indexing the electrophysiological changes associated with aging, MCI and AD. Objective: We reviewed the literature on EEG to determine if auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) could distinguish between healthy aging, MCI, and AD. Method: We searched two electronic databases (Medline and PyscInfo) for articles published between January 2005 and April 2017. Articles were considered for review if they included: i) participants 60 years of age or older; ii) healthy older adults or those diagnosed with MCI or AD; iii) at least one auditory elicited ERP component. Results: Our search revealed 1532 articles (800 after removing duplicates); 719 were excluded through title/abstract review, and of the 81 remaining articles, 30 satisfied inclusion criteria. All studies compared cognitive function between at least two of the three selected populations. Our findings suggest that the P300 and N200 components may distinguish between healthy cognitive aging, MCI, and AD. Conclusion: ERPs may be sensitive to progressive cognitive changes due to MCI and AD. The P300 and N200 may help identify patients who are likely to progress from MCI to AD, and could be a valuable clinical tool.

An EEG Brain-Computer Interface Approach for Classifying Vigilance States in Humans: A Gamma Band Focus Supports Low Misclassification Rates	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION			English	Article							WORKING-MEMORY; COMMUNICATION; CLASSIFICATION; ALERTNESS; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS; BOREDOM; P300; TASK	This research investigated a brain-computer interface (BCI) for classifying vigilance states. A BCI approach based on event-related potential (ERP) and spectral features of electroencephalographic (EEG) data derived from an auditory oddball paradigm was employed. A 128-channel EEG system recorded potentials while participants simultaneously completed a prolonged visual match-to-sample task. It was hypothesized that better classification rates would be found for a group of bored participants, as compared to the not-bored participants. The best classification rates were found by extracting EEG features from gamma frequencies at middle and late latencies (for the standard tones). Critically, the BCI paradigm was most effective for the bored participants (mean misclassification rate=13%), as compared to the not-bored participants (mean misclassification rate=21%). These findings extend our knowledge of reliable latencies and spectral features of ERP data most salient to the classification of vigilance states.	[Van Benthem, K. D.; Cebulski, S.; Herdman, C.

Event-Related Potentials Measured From In and Around the Ear Electrodes Integrated in a Live Hearing Device for Monitoring Sound Perception	TRENDS IN HEARING			English	Article						Ear-EEG; cEEGrid; hearing aid; auditory evoked potentials	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; AID	Future hearing devices could exploit brain signals of the user derived from electroencephalography (EEG) measurements, for example, for fitting the device or steering signal enhancement algorithms. While previous studies have shown that meaningful brain signals can be obtained from ear-centered EEG electrodes, we here present a feasibility study where ear-EEG is integrated with a live hearing device. Seventeen normal-hearing participants were equipped with an individualized in-the-ear hearing device and an ear-EEG system that included 10 electrodes placed around the ear (cEEGrid) and 3 electrodes spread out in the concha. They performed an auditory discrimination experiment, where they had to detect an audible switch in the signal processing settings of the hearing device between repeated presentations of otherwise identical stimuli. We studied two aspects of the ear-EEG data: First, whether the switches in the hearing device settings can be identified in the brain signals, specifically event-related potentials. Second, we evaluated the signal quality for the individual electrode positions. The EEG analysis revealed significant differences between trials with and without a switch in the device settings in the N 100 and P300 range of the event-related potential. The comparison of electrode positions showed that the signal quality is better for around-the-ear electrodes than for in-concha electrodes. These results confirm that meaningful brain signals related to the settings of a hearing device can be acquired from ear-EEG during real-time audio processing, particularly if electrodes around the ear are available.

Measurement of attentional reserve and mental effort for cognitive workload assessment under various task demands during dual-task walking	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Attentional reserve; Mental effort and workload; Event-related potentials; Spectral power; Locomotion; Ecologically valid human performance	ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; MOTOR INTERFERENCE; THETA OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL DYNAMICS; HEALTHY OLDER; EEG; BRAIN; PERFORMANCE	Previous work focused on cognitive workload assessment suggests EEG spectral content and component amplitudes of the event-related potential (ERP) waveform may index mental effort and attentional reserve, respectively. Although few studies have assessed attentional reserve and mental effort during upper-extremity performance, none have employed a combined approach to measure cognitive workload during locomotion. Therefore, by systematically considering ERPs, spectral content and importantly their combination, this study aimed to examine whether concurrent changes in spectral content and ERPs could collectively serve as an index of cognitive workload during locomotion. Specifically, ERP and EEG biomarkers were assessed as participants performed a cognitive task under two levels of difficulty (easy or hard) and two conditions (seated or walking).

Traditionally, calibrating the perception threshold of distortion relies on subjective test, which may suffer from strategy and bias of the human. In this paper, electroencephalography (EEG) is used as a novel psychophysiological method to evaluate the human perception of quantification-aroused video distortion. By the means of classification based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA), the separability of event-related potentials (ERPs) aroused by human perception to video quality change is measured by the area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). Relating the EEG signals to behavior data, the sigmoid-typed relationship between the perceptibility of distortion and separability of the P300 component is discovered. Based on this relationship, the perceptibility of distortion can be evaluated by EEG signals alone, which provides a potential neurally informed method for the calibration of perception threshold of video distortion.

This study aimed to investigate how sex interacts with concussion effects on early event-related brain potentials (ERP) measures (P1, N1) of emotional facial expressions (EFE) processing in asymptomatic, multi-concussion athletes during an EFE identification task. Methods: Forty control athletes (20 females and 20 males) and 43 multi-concussed athletes (22 females and 21 males), recruited more than 3 months after their last concussion, were tested. Participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory II, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale, and an Emotional Facial Expression Identification Task. Pictures of male and female faces expressing neutral, angry, and happy emotions were randomly presented and the emotion depicted had to be identified as fast as possible during EEG acquisition. Results: Relative to controls, concussed athletes of both sex exhibited a significant suppression of P1 amplitude recorded from the dominant right hemisphere while performing the emotional face expression identification task. The present study also highlighted a sex-specific suppression of the N1 component amplitude after concussion which affected male athletes. Conclusions: These findings suggest that repeated concussions alter the typical pattern of right-hemisphere response dominance to EFE in early stages of EFE processing and that the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the processing of emotional stimuli are distinctively affected across sex.

Excitability regulation in the dmPFC might be crucial for fear processing, while abnormal patterns could lead to mental illness. Notwithstanding, non-invasive paradigms to measure excitability regulation during fear processing in humans are missing. To address this challenge we adapted an approach for excitability characterization, combining electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the dmPFC during an instructed fear paradigm, to dynamically dissect its role in fear processing. Event-related (ERP) and TMS-evoked potentials (TEP) were analyzed to trace dmPFC excitability. We further linked the excitability regulation patterns to individual MRI-derived gray matter structural integrity of the fear network. Increased cortical excitability was demonstrated to threat (T) processing in comparison to no-threat (NT), reflected by increased amplitude of evoked potentials. Furthermore, TMS at dmPFC enhanced the evoked responses during T processing, while the structural integrity of the dmPFC and amygdala predicted the excitability regulation patterns to fear processing. The dmPFC takes a special role during fear processing by dynamically regulating excitability. The applied paradigm can be used to non-invasively track response abnormalities to threat stimuli in healthy subjects or patients with mental disorders.

Prestimulus delta and theta contributions to equiprobable Go/NoGo processing in healthy ageing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG/ERP dynamics; Delta; Theta; Healthy ageing; Principal components analysis (PCA); Auditory Go/NoGo	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; REACTION-TIME VARIABILITY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; SCALP DISTRIBUTION; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ANTERIOR SHIFT; ERP COMPONENTS; LIFE-SPAN; EEG	Ongoing EEG activity contributes to ERP outcomes of stimulus processing, and each of these measures is known to undergo (sometimes significant) age-related change. Variation in their relationship across the life-span may thus elucidate mechanisms of normal and pathological ageing. This study assessed the relationships between low-frequency EEG prestimulus brain states, the ERP, and behavioural outcomes in a simple equiprobable auditory Go/NoGo paradigm, comparing these for 20 young (M-age = 20.4 years) and 20 healthy older (M-age = 68.2 years) adults. Prestimulus delta and theta amplitudes were separately assessed; these were each dominant across the midline region, and reduced in the older adults. For each band, (within-subjects) trials were sorted into ten increasing prestimulus EEG levels for which separate ERPs were derived. The set of ten ERPs for each band-sort was then quantified by PCA, independently for each group (young, older adults). Four components were primarily assessed (P1, N1-1, P2/N2b complex, and P3), with each showing age-related change. Mean RT was comparable, but intra-individual RT variability increased in older adults. Prestimulus delta and theta each generally modulated component positivity, indicating broad influence on task processing. Prestimulus delta was primarily associated with the early sensory processes, and theta more with the later stimulus-specific processes; prestimulus theta also inversely modulated intra-individual RT variability across the groups. These prestimulus EEG ERP dynamics were consistent between the young and older adults in each band for all components except the P2/N2b, suggesting that across the lifespan, Go/NoGo categorisation is differentially affected by prestimulus delta and theta.

Event related potential analysis techniques for autism spectrum disorders: A review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						Electroencephalogram; Event-related potential; Coherence; Spectrogram; Phase synchrony; Classifier	YOUNG-CHILDREN; MIRROR NEURONS; EEG COMPLEXITY; ATYPICAL FACE; CONNECTIVITY; PERCEPTION; DIAGNOSIS; FEATURES; INDEX; AGE	Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) comprise all pervasive neurodevelopmental diseases marked by deficits in social and communication skills, delayed cognitive development, restricted and repetitive behaviors. The core symptoms begin in early childhood, may continue life-long resulting in poor performance in adult stage. Event related potential (ERP) is basically a time-locked electroencephalogram signal elicited by various stimuli, related to sensory and cognitive processes. The various ERP based techniques used for the study of ASD are considered in this review. ERP based study offers the advantage of being a non-invasive technique to measure the brain activity precisely. The techniques are categorized into three based on the processing domain: time, frequency and time frequency. Power spectral density, coherence, phase synchrony, multiscale entropy, modified multiscale entropy, sum of signed differences, synchrostates and variance are some of the measures that have been widely used to study the abnormalities in frequency bands and brain connectivity. Various signal processing techniques such as Fast Fourier Transform, Discrete Fourier Transform, Short-Time Fourier Transform, Principal Component Analysis, Wavelet Transform, Directed Transfer Function etc. have been used to analyze the recorded signals so as to unravel the distinctive event-related potential patterns in individuals with ASD. The review concludes that ERP proves to be an efficient tool in detecting the brain abnormalities and connectivity issues, indicating the heterogeneity of ASD. Many advanced techniques are utilized to decipher the underlying neural circuitry so as to aid in therapeutic interventions for improving the core areas of deficits.

Seven patients (four males, with the mean age 34.85 +/- 4.25) were asked to fill out Beck's depression questionnaires. EEG signals of subjects were recorded during Stroop test. This test entailed 360 stimulations, which included 120 congruent, 120 incongruent, and 120 neutral stimulations lasting for 12min. Subsequently, the dorso lateral prefrontal cortex in patients' left hemisphere was stimulated for six sessions using tDCS. At the end of tDCS treatment period, subjects filled out Beck's depression questionnaires again and EEG signal recordings were repeated simultaneously with Stroop test. Wavelet coefficients of EEG frequency bands in every stimulation type were extracted from ERP components. The changes in Beck score before and after tDCS were estimated using neural network model. The ERP results showed that the latency period of N400 component after applying tDCS decreased significantly. Moreover, a significant correlation was observed between percentage changes of congruent and incongruent accuracy and the increase in the average energy of wavelet coefficients in alpha band in Pz electrode with p=0.0128, r=0.9060 and p=0.0037, r=0.95, respectively. Additionally, the results of neural network model revealed that the changes in Beck score were estimated with an average error of 0.0519. Consequently, the improvement of depressed patients treated with tDCS could be estimated with good accuracy using average energy of wavelet coefficients in alpha band.

The study included two separate experiments. In the first experiment, the point-probing paradigm was used to study the response time of attention bias characteristics under different emotions. In the second experiment, ERP technology was used to study the attention resources allocation method of tennis experts to the tennis scene, trying to explain the expert's attention advantage from the perspective of central nervous system. Through this study, we find that for the tennis experts, there is an attention competition between the tennis scenes and the negative emotional faces, which shows that in the presence of attention competition, tennis experts will have a higher attention level to the scene information related to professional skills; sports experts have an attention bias tendency to skill-related scene information, which may be the mechanism behind the phenomenon that "experts can process scene information faster or at a higher level".

The aim is to systematically review and critically evaluate underlying event related potential (ERP) features in euthymic BD relating to differences in sensory processes, attention, inhibition and conflict monitoring compared with healthy controls. 911 unique articles were identified using the PubMed database and 14 studies met the inclusion criteria. Individuals with BD in a euthymic state have reduced P50 sensory gating and reduced P100 amplitudes compared with healthy controls. Many studies demonstrated reduced P300 amplitudes and normal P300 latencies in BD. In addition, reduced NoGo N2 and abnormal NoGo P3 activity were observed in BD. Finally, there is some evidence of reduced error-related negativity amplitudes in BD. Importantly, ERP modulations vary with stimulus factors and clinical profile. The functional significance of these findings and clinical implications are discussed. ERP differences in BD arise at various stages of cognitive processing, specifically in early auditory and visual processing, attention allocation, context updating, inhibition and conflict monitoring. Treating these deficits and their underlying neurobiological disturbances corresponding to abnormal performance on cognitive tasks may aid functional remission.

Optimizing Within-Subject Experimental Designs for jICA of Multi-Channel ERP and fMRI	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						fMRI; ERP; EEG; independent component analysis (ICA); multimodal neuroimaging; modeling; simulation; data fusion	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; SIMULTANEOUS EEG-FMRI; DATA FUSION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; SEPARATION; REGISTRATION; INTEGRATION; NETWORKS	Joint independent component analysis (jICA) can be applied within subject for fusion of multi-channel event-related potentials (ERP) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to measure brain function at high spatiotemporal resolution (Mangalathu-Arumana et al., 2012). However, the impact of experimental design choices on jICA performance has not been systematically studied. Here, the sensitivity of jICA for recovering neural sources in individual data was evaluated as a function of imaging SNR, number of independent representations of the ERP/fMRI data, relationship between instantiations of the joint ERP/fMRI activity (linear, non-linear, uncoupled), and type of sources (varying parametrically and non-parametrically across representations of the data), using computer simulations. Neural sources were simulated with spatiotemporal and noise attributes derived from experimental data. The best performance, maximizing both cross-modal data fusion and the separation of brain sources, occurred with a moderate number of representations of the ERP/fMRI data (10-30), as in a mixed block/event related experimental design. Importantly, the type of relationship between instantiations of the ERP/fMRI activity, whether linear, non-linear or uncoupled, did not in itself impact jICA performance, and was accurately recovered in the common profiles (i.e., mixing coefficients). Thus, jICA provides an unbiased way to characterize the relationship between ERP and fMRI activity across brain regions, in individual data, rendering it potentially useful for characterizing pathological conditions in which neurovascular coupling is adversely affected.

J	Lee, MH; Williamson, J; Won, DO; Fazli, S; Lee, SW				Lee, Min-Ho; Williamson, John; Won, Dong-Ok; Fazli, Siamac; Lee, Seong-Whan			A High Performance Spelling System based on EEG-EOG Signals With Visual Feedback	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interfaces (BCI); electroencephalography (EEG); electrooculogram (EOG); P300 speller; visual feedback	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; EYE-MOVEMENTS; P300; COMMUNICATION; WHEELCHAIR; CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION; PARALYSIS; FUSION; MODEL	In this paper, we propose a highly accurate and fast spelling system that employs multi-modal electroencephalography-electrooculography (EEG-EOG) signals and visual feedback technology. Over the last 20 years, various types of speller systems have been developed in brain-computer interface and EOG/eyetracking research; however, these conventional systems have a tradeoff between the spelling accuracy (or decoding) and typing speed. Healthy users and physically challenged participants, in particular, may become exhausted quickly; thus, there is a need for a speller system with fast typing speed while retaining a high level of spelling accuracy. In this paper, we propose the first hybrid speller system that combines EEG and EOG signals with visual feedback technology so that the user and the speller system can act cooperatively for optimal decision-making. The proposed spelling system consists of a classic row-column event-related potential (ERP) speller, an EOG command detector, and visual feedback modules. First, the online ERP speller calculates classification probabilities for all candidate characters from the EEG epochs. Second, characters are sorted by their probability, and the characters with the highest probabilities are highlighted as visual feedback within the row-column spelling layout. Finally, the user can actively select the character as the target by generating an EOG command. The proposed system shows 97.6% spelling accuracy and an information transfer rate of 39.6 (+/- 13.2) [bits/min] across 20 participants. In our extended experiment, we redesigned the visual feedback and minimized the number of channels (four channels) in order to enhance the speller performance and increase usability. Most importantly, a new weighted strategy resulted in 100% accuracy and a 57.8 (+/- 23.6) [bits/min] information transfer rate across six participants. This paper demonstrates that the proposed system can provide a reliable communication channel for practical speller applications and may be used to supplement existing systems.

In TMS studies, the stimulation intensity (SI) is commonly normalized to the resting motor threshold (rMT) that produces muscle responses in 50% of stimulations applied to the motor cortex (M1). Since rMT is influenced by spinal excitability and coil-to-cortex distance, responses recorded from the cortex, instead of a peripheral muscle, could provide a more accurate marker for cortical excitability. Combining TMS with electroencephalography (EEG) enables the measurement of brain-wide cortical reactivity to TMS. We quantified TMS-induced changes in oscillatory power and the phase of EEG with event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) and inter-trial coherence (ITC). We studied the SI-dependency of ERSP and ITC responses by stimulating the dominant M1 of ten healthy volunteers using single-pulse TMS with 150 pulses at 60%, 80%, 100%, and 120% of rMT. We found SI-dependent ERSP and ITC responses in M1, most notably with the wide-band (8-70 Hz) early ITC responses averaged 20-60 ms after TMS. With approximately linear SI-dependence, the early ITC response was consistent between SIs (intraclass correlation = 0.78, p < 0.001). Our results reveal the potential of oscillatory EEG responses, in place of rMT, as a measure of the cortical excitability threshold in M1.

However, building the classifier for identifying event-related potential (ERP) responses, i.e., calibrating the P300 speller, is still a time-consuming and user-dependent problem. This paper proposes a novel method to reduce calibration times significantly. In the proposed method, a small number of ERP epochs from the current user were used to build a reference epoch. Based on this reference, the Riemannian distance measurement was used to select similar ERP samples from an existing data pool, which contained other-subject ERP responses. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine, and stepwise LDA were trained as ERP classifiers on the selected database and then were used to identify the user-attended character. With only 12 s of EEG data to calibrate, an average character recognition accuracy for 55 subjects of up to 87.82% was obtained. The LDA that built on other-subject samples that were selected by Riemannian distance outperformed the other classifiers. Compared with other state-of-the-art studies, this method significantly reduces P300 speller calibration times, while maintaining the character recognition accuracy.

This agrees with studies that have consistently demonstrated preferential brain processing for looming stimuli. This study investigates and demonstrates that looming sounds can similarly benefit emergency braking in managing a vehicle with adaptive cruise control (ACC). Specifically, looming auditory notifications induced the faster emergency braking times relative to a static auditory notification. Next, we compare the event-related potential (ERP) evoked by a looming notification, relative to its static equivalent. Looming notifications evoke a smaller fronto-central N2 amplitude than their static equivalents. Thus, we infer that looming sounds are consistent with the visual experience of an approaching collision and, hence, induced a corresponding performance benefit. Subjective ratings indicate no significant differences in the perceived workload across the notification conditions. Overall, this work suggests that auditory warnings should have congruent physical properties with the visual events that they warn for.

As a critical element of driving safety, traffic signs are generally evaluated using questionnaires and by measuring reaction time. This study investigated the cognitive processing of traffic signs by measuring event-related potential (ERP) and explored semantic and emotional processing. A stimulus 1-stimulus 2 paradigm was adopted. Traffic sign-word pairs were organized into semantically congruent and semantically incongruent groups. Larger N400 amplitude and theta activity were simultaneously elicited by semantically incongruent traffic sign-word pairs, which indicated the semantic distance between traffic signs and words. A greater late positive potential was elicited by semantically congruent traffic sign-word pairs, which reflected participants' positive emotional arousal. Additionally, this study measured ERP to assess semantic distance and emotional arousal in the traffic sign understanding process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Coderre, EL				Coderre, Emily L.			A Semantic Priming Event-related Potential (ERP) Task to Study Lexico-semantic and Visuo-semantic Processing in Autism Spectrum Disorder	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Behavior; Issue 134; Semantic priming; EEG; autism spectrum disorder; lexico-semantic; visuo-semantic; word; picture	LANGUAGE; N400; PICTURES; REAL; N300	Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have characteristic deficits in understanding the meaning of language, or semantic processing. However, some evidence indicates that semantic processing of non-linguistic stimuli is intact, suggesting that semantic deficits may be language-specific. To appropriately characterize semantic processing deficits in individuals with ASD, comparison of within-modality linguistic (e.g., written words) and non-linguistic (e.g., pictures) stimuli is required. This paper describes such a methodology that makes use of a semantic priming paradigm during concurrent recording of electroencephalographic (EEG) data. EEG provides a dynamic measure of brain activity that is well-suited to characterize subtle differences in semantic processing that may not be observable at the behavioral level. The semantic priming paradigm presents a prime picture or word (e.g., dog) followed by a target picture or word that is either related (e.g., cat) or unrelated (e.g., pencil) to the prime. This paradigm can thus be used to evaluate semantic processing across different modalities, and to compare lexico-semantic and visuo-semantic processing abilities in individuals with ASD and how they might differ from TD individuals. The specific steps involved in creating the stimuli, performing the EEG testing, and analyzing the EEG data are discussed. Representative results illustrate how the N400 component of the event-related potential (ERP) is reduced following semantically-related prime-target pairs compared to unrelated pairs. Comparisons of the N400 between conditions, modalities, and groups can provide estimates of the success of semantic processing, and can thereby be used to characterize semantic deficits in individuals with ASD or other clinical populations.

Short summary: EEG recordings and ERP measurements of young adults with positive and negative family history of alcoholism where obtained while they performed a Go/No-Go task to assess inhibitory processes. Offspring of alcoholics showed a different ERP pattern compared to the control group and exerted greater effort than the control group. Methods: ERP measurements were obtained by electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of 65 participants divided into two groups: one group of 30 subjects with positive family history of alcoholism and a control group of 35 subjects with negative family history of alcoholism. They performed a Go/No-Go task, where each individual was required to classify visual stimuli by colour (Go) and inhibit their response to a No-Go signal. Results: OA have higher P3 amplitudes during the Go condition in all of the regions analysed and higher No-Go P3 amplitudes than control subjects in the frontal region. Unlike controls, OA have no differences between the P3 amplitudes across conditions. Conclusions: The absence of differences between the P3 Go and No-Go observed in the OA group can be interpreted as a possible alteration related with inhibition, in a way that they may need to recruit similar resources for inhibitory and classificational processes for both conditions. Therefore, the P3 component may be considered as a useful endophenotype and a vulnerability marker to develop addictive behaviour.

J	Ford, JM				Ford, Judith M.			The Difficulty in Finding Relationships Between ERPs and Clinical Symptoms of Schizophrenia	CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; symptoms; evoked potential; auditory evoked potential; schizophrenia	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; P300; FEATURES	It has been surprisingly difficult to find associations between neural signatures of schizophrenia and the symptoms that define it. That is, many of the legacy components of the event-related potential (ERP) P50, N100, P200, P300are reduced in patients with schizophrenia, in first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia, in schizophrenia patients early in their illness, and even in people at clinical high risk for schizophrenia. Nevertheless, these ERP components tend to be relatively insensitive to symptoms. This might be due to a number of reasons. First, this could reflect a lack of relationship, a failure to report disappointing findings, or a failure to test for relationships. Second, many ERP studies were not designed to be sensitive to symptoms or to the mechanisms that might underlie them. Third, assessing symptoms is sometimes dependent on the patients' ability to describe unfathomable experiences and the clinicians' ability to understand and interpret them. Fourth, medications and comorbidities may decouple the symptoms from the neurobiology. Finally, we must also consider the possibility that the schizophrenia diagnosis breeds truer than the symptoms it comprises.

Thirty-four healthy subjects completed two event-related potential tests in the same sequence. Unilateral wrist extension was involved in both tests as the movement task. Instruction Response Movement (IRM) was a brisk movement response task with visual "go" signal, while Cued Instruction Response Movement (CIRM) added a visual cue contenting the direction information to create a prolonged motor preparation stage. Recorded EEG data were segmented and averaged to show time domain changes and then transformed into time-frequency mapping to show the time-frequency changes. All components were calculated and compared among C3, Cz, and C4 locations. The motor potential appeared bilaterally in both tests' movement execution stages, and Cz had the largest peak value among the investigated locations (p<0.01). In CIRM, a contingent negative variation (CNV) component presented bilaterally during the movement preparation stage with the largest amplitude at Cz. ERD of the mu rhythm (mu ERD) presented bilateral sensorimotor cortices during movement execution stages in both tests and was the smallest at Cz among the investigated locations. In the movement preparation stage of CIRM, mu ERD presented mainly in the contralateral sensory motor cortex area (C3 and C4 for right and left wrist movements, respectively) and showed significant differences between different locations. EEG changes in the time and time-frequency domains showed different topographical features. Movement execution was controlled bilaterally, while movement preparation was controlled mainly by contralateral sensorimotor cortices. Mu ERD was found to have stronger contra-lateralization features in the movement preparation stage and might be a better indicator for detecting movement intentions. This information could be helpful and might provide comprehensive information for studying movement disorders (such as those in post-stroke hemiplegic patients) or for facilitating the development of neuro-rehabilitation engineering technology such as brain computer interface.

Event-related potential (ERP) correlates of face processing in verbal children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and their first-degree relatives: a family study	MOLECULAR AUTISM			English	Article						Autistic disorder; Electrophysiology; ERP; N170; Endophenotype	SENSITIVE N170; GAZE-FIXATION; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; DIFFERENT REFERENCES; EARLY RECOGNITION; YOUNG-CHILDREN; INVERSION; PERCEPTION; OBJECT	Background: Inherited abnormalities of perception, recognition, and attention to faces have been implicated in the etiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) including abnormal components of event-related brain potentials (ERP) elicited by faces. Methods: We examined familial aggregation of face processing ERP abnormalities previously implicated in ASD in 49 verbal individuals with ASD, 36 unaffected siblings (US), 18 unaffected fathers (UF), and 53 unrelated controls (UC). The ASD, US, and UC groups ranged in age from 12 to 21 years, the UF group ranged in age from 30 to 56 years. ERP responses to images of upright and inverted faces and houses were analyzed under disparate EEG reference schemes. Results: Face-sensitive features of N170 and P1 were readily observed in all groups. Differences between ASD and control groups depended upon the EEG reference scheme. Notably, the superiority of face over object for N170 latency was attenuated in ASD subjects, but not their relatives; this occurred exclusively with the average reference. The difference in N170 amplitude between inverted and upright faces was reduced in both ASD and US groups relative to UC, but this effect was significant only with the vertex reference. Furthermore, similar group differences were observed for both inverted faces and inverted houses, suggesting a lack of face specificity for the attenuation of the N170 inversion effect in ASD. Conclusion: The present findings refine understanding of face processing ERPs in ASD. These data provide only modest evidence for highly-selective ASD-sensitive ERP features, and underscore the sensitivity of these biomarkers to ERP reference scheme. These schemes have varied across published studies and must be accounted for in future studies of the relationship between these commonly acquired ERP characteristics, genotype, and ASD.

However, SP is highly susceptible to artifact contamination, such as the galvanic skin response (GSR). This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between SPs recorded from the scalp and intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) by event-related coherence analysis. Methods: The scalp and subdural SPs were simultaneously recorded during NFB training by the DC-EEG machine while undergoing invasive recordings before epilepsy surgery in 10 patients with refractory partial epilepsy. The SPs at the vertex electrode were used as a reference for coherence analysis. Results: The coherence of SPs negatively correlated with the distance between the subdural and scalp electrodes. A significant negative correlation was noted between the linear subdural-scalp electrode distance and the coherence value (r = -0.916, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Scalp-recorded SPs from the vertex area primarily reflect the cortical activity of high lateral convexity. Significance: Our results strongly suggest that SPs in NFB recorded from the vertex scalp electrode is derived from the cortices of high lateral convexity but not from the artifacts, such as GSR.

J	Isel, F; Kail, M				Isel, Frederic; Kail, Michele			Morphosyntactic integration in French sentence processing: Event-related brain potentials evidence	JOURNAL OF NEUROLINGUISTICS			English	Article						Morphosyntactic complexity; Contextual information; Online grammaticality judgment; French sentences; EEG	SUBJECT-VERB AGREEMENT; ONLINE GRAMMATICALITY JUDGMENTS; ERP EVIDENCE; TIME-COURSE; GENDER AGREEMENT; NUMBER AGREEMENT; VIOLATIONS; LANGUAGE; SPANISH; SYNTAX	The present event-related brain potentials (ERP) study investigated the online integration of morphosyntactic information in auditory French sentences using a violation paradigm. Two main factors were manipulated: (1) The degree of complexity of the morphosyntactic violation, (2) The moment when the agreement violation occurs within the sentence. Both types of morphological agreement violations (intra/inter) elicited a biphasic anterior, negativity/P600 ERP pattern. However, the amplitude of this pattern was larger for the interphrasal violation than for the intraphrasal one. This result suggests an easier detection but a more costly integration when the agreement violation occurs between elements belonging to different syntactic units. Moreover, an effect of position was observed but only when the violation concerned elements of a single syntactic unit. Taken together, the present findings suggest that morphological integration may be modulated by both the complexity of morphosyntactic agreement and the moment at which it takes place during the course of sentence processing.

EEG data were collected while participants performed a lexical decision task. The critical stimuli included negative words, unambiguous neutral words, and ambiguous neutral words. ERP results showed that negative words elicited a smaller N400 and a larger LPC than unambiguous neutral words, while the difference between negative words and ambiguous neutral words in the two components was only found over some midline electrodes. These results suggest that the typical emotional effect might be squeezed out when the potential role of meaning complexity were magnified, leaving a pure effect isolated to emotional valence and arousal. These results indicate that meaning complexity is one of the factors that contribute to the emotional effect. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Due to the limitation of computation burden for multi-way data and the low algorithm performance of stability and efficiency, multi-way ERP data are conventionally reorganized into low-order tensor or matrix before further analysis. However, the reorganization may hamper mode specification and spoil the interaction information among different modes. New method: In this study, we applied a fifth-order tensor decomposition to a set of fifth-order ERP data collected by exerting proprioceptive stimulus on left and right hand. One of the latest nonnegative CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (NCP) decomposition methods implemented by alternating proximal gradient (APG) was employed. We also proposed an improved DIFFIT method to select the optimal component number for the fifth-order tensor decomposition. Results: By the fifth-order NCP model with a proper component number, the ERP data were fully decomposed into spatial, spectral, temporal, subject and condition factors in each component. The results showed more pairs of components with symmetric activation region in left and right hemisphere elicited by contralateral stimuli on hand. Comparison with existing method(s): In our experiment, more interesting components and coherent brain activities were extracted, compared with previous studies. Conclusions: The discovered activities elicited by proprioceptive stimulus are in line with those in relevant cognitive neuroscience studies. Our proposed method has proved to be appropriate and viable for processing high-order EEG data with well-preserved interaction information among all modes.

Syntactic language processing with Wh-related questions are more complicated sentence pattern where difficulties might appear in specific groups to comprehend. However, we have investigated the neural correlates of syntactic Malay language processing among a group of women where the subjects would respond by pressing buttons in order to match the several binary visual pictorial stimuli with Wh-questions. There were simply two types of Wh-questions in this study, who subjects questions and which object questions. A high dense EEG sensor net was used to record the Event Related Potentials (ERP). N400 ERP component was extracted and analysed. Higher amplitude of N400 component was found significantly in the right hemisphere of the temporal -parietal region during which object question response indicating lateralized integrated semantic information and memory processing in the brain. To extend and compare this outcome, further work in the specific language impairment group and in the pregnancy group is our future plan.

In humans, deficits in this mechanism are measured through the orbicularis muscle response using electromyography (EMG). Although this mechanism can be modulated by several brain structures and is impaired in some pathologies as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, neural PPI evaluation is rarely performed in humans. Since eye blinks are a consequence of PPI stimulation, they strongly contaminate the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. This paper describes a method to reduce muscular artifacts and enable neural PPI assessment through EEG in parallel to muscular PPI evaluation using EMG. Both types of signal were simultaneously recorded in 22 healthy subjects. PPI was evaluated by the acoustical startle response with EMG and by the P2-N1 event-related potential (ERP) using EEG in Fz, Cz, and Pz electrodes. In order to remove EEG artifacts, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was performed using two methods. Firstly, visual inspection discarded components containing artifact characteristics as ocular and tonic muscle artifacts. The second method used visual inspection as gold standard to validate parameters in an automated component selection using the SASICA algorithm. As an outcome, EEG artifacts were effectively removed and equivalent neural PPI evaluation performance was obtained using both methods, with subjects exhibiting consistent neural as well as muscular PPI. This novel method improves PPI test, enabling neural gating mechanisms assessment within the latency of 100-200 ms, which is not evaluated by other sensory gating tests as P50 and mismatch negativity.

Deciphered intents, after detecting electrical signals from the human scalp, are translated into control commands used to operate external devices, computer displays and virtual objects in the real-time. BCI provides an augmentative communication by creating a muscle-free channel between the brain and the output devices, primarily for subjects having neuromotor disorders, or trauma to nervous system, notably spinal cord injuries (SCI), and subjects with unaffected sensorimotor functions but disarticulated or amputated residual limbs. This review identifies the potentials of electroencephalography (EEG) based BCI applications for locomotion and mobility rehabilitation. Patients could benefit from its advancements such as wearable lower-limb (LL) exoskeletons, orthosis, prosthesis, wheelchairs, and assistive-robot devices. The EEG communication signals employed by the aforementioned applications that also provide feasibility for future development in the field are sensorimotor rhythms (SMR), event-related potentials (ERP) and visual evoked potentials (VEP). The review is an effort to progress the development of user's mental task related to LL for BCI reliability and confidence measures. As a novel contribution, the reviewed BCI control paradigms for wearable LL and assistive-robots are presented by a general control framework fitting in hierarchical layers. It reflects informatic interactions, between the user, the BCI operator, the shared controller, the robotic device and the environment. Each sub layer of the BCI operator is discussed in detail, highlighting the feature extraction, classification and execution methods employed by the various systems. All applications' key features and their interaction with the environment are reviewed for the EEG-based activity mode recognition, and presented in form of a table. It is suggested to structure EEG-BCI controlled LL assistive devices within the presented framework, for future generation of intent-based multifunctional controllers. Despite the development of controllers, for BCI-based wearable or assistive devices that can seamlessly integrate user intent, practical challenges associated with such systems exist and have been discerned, which can be constructive for future developments in the field.

Event-related brain potentials and the study of reward processing: Methodological considerations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; MEDIAL-FRONTAL-CORTEX; TIME-ESTIMATION TASK; PREDICTION ERROR; DECISION-MAKING; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES; MONETARY GAINS; COGNITIVE LOAD; NEURAL SYSTEM	There is growing interest in using electroencephalography and specifically the event-related brain potential (ERP) methodology to study human reward processing. Since the discovery of the feedback related negativity (Miltner et al., 1997) and the development of theories associating the feedback related negativity and more recently the reward positivity with reinforcement learning, midbrain dopamine function, and the anterior cingulate cortex (i.e., Holroyd and Coles, 2002) researchers have used the ERP methodology to probe the neural basis of reward learning in humans. However, examination of the feedback related negativity and the reward positivity cannot be done without an understanding of some key methodological issues that must be taken into account when using ERPs and examining these ERP components. For example, even the component name - the feedback related negativity - is a source of debate within the research community as some now strongly feel that the component should be named the reward positivity (Proudfit, 2015). Here, ten key methodological issues are discussed - confusion in component naming, the reward positivity, component identification, peak quantification and the use of difference waveforms, frequency (the N200) and component contamination (the P300), the impact of feedback timing, action, and task learnability, and how learning results in changes in the amplitude of the feedback-related negativity/reward positivity. The hope here is to not provide a definitive approach for examining the feedback related negativity/reward positivity, but instead to outline the key issues that must be taken into account when examining this component to assist researchers in their study of human reward processing with the ERP methodology.

S.; Mans, Keri; Kenemans, J. Leon			Susceptibility to audio signals during autonomous driving	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PERCEPTUAL LOAD; NOVELTY; PERFORMANCE; ATTENTION; P3A	We investigate how susceptible human drivers are to auditory signals in three situations: when stationary, when driving, or when being driven by an autonomous vehicle. Previous research has shown that human susceptibility is reduced when driving compared to when being stationary. However, it is not known how susceptible humans are under autonomous driving conditions. At the same time, good susceptibility is crucial under autonomous driving conditions, as such systems might use auditory signals to communicate a transition of control from the automated vehicle to the human driver. We measured susceptibility using a three-stimulus auditory oddball paradigm while participants experienced three driving conditions: stationary, autonomous, or driving. We studied susceptibility through the frontal P3 (fP3) Electroencephalography Event-Related Potential response (EEG ERP response). Results show that the fP3 component is reduced in autonomous compared to stationary conditions, but not as strongly as when participants drove themselves. In addition, the fP3 component is further reduced when the oddball task does not require a response (i.e., in a passive condition, versus active). The implication is that, even in a relatively simple autonomous driving scenario, people's susceptibility of auditory signals is not as high as would be beneficial for responding to auditory stimuli.

Early and late cortical responses to directly gazing faces are task dependent	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Direct gaze; N170; P1; P3b; Task dependence	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; GAZE-DIRECTION; EYE CONTACT; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; PERSON PERCEPTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; AVERTED GAZE; TIME-COURSE; N170	Gender categorisation of human faces is facilitated when gaze is directed toward the observer (i.e., a direct gaze), compared with situations where gaze is averted or the eyes are closed (Macrae, Hood, Milne, Rowe, & Mason, Psychological Science, 13(5), 460-464, 2002). However, the temporal dynamics underlying this phenomenon remain to some extent unknown. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess the neural correlates of this effect, focusing on the event-related potential (ERP) components known to be sensitive to gaze perception (i.e., P1, N170, and P3b). We first replicated the seminal findings of Macrae et al. (2002, Experiment 1) regarding facilitated gender discrimination, and subsequently measured the underlying neural responses. Our data revealed an early preferential processing of direct gaze as compared with averted gaze and closed eyes at the P1, which reverberated at the P3b (Experiment 2). Critically, using the same material, we failed to reproduce these effects when gender categorisation was not required (Experiment 3). Taken together, our data confirm that direct gaze enhances the early P1, as well as later cortical responses to face processing, although the effect appears to be task dependent.

Our understanding of the functional significance of these ERP components has been hampered by variability in their robustness, as well as their temporal and scalp distribution across studies. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of choice of reference electrode or spatial filter on the number, timing and scalp distribution of ERP elicited during task-switching. We compared four configurations, including the two most common (i.e., average mastoid reference and common average reference) and two novel ones that aim to reduce volume conduction (i.e., reference electrode standardization technique (REST) and surface Laplacian) on mixing cost and switch cost effects in cue-locked and target-locked ERP waveforms in 201 healthy participants. All four spatial filters showed the same well-characterized ERP components that are typically seen in task-switching paradigms: the cue-locked switch positivity and target-locked N2/P3 effect. However, both the number of ERP effects associated with mixing and switch cost, and their temporal and spatial resolution were greater with the surface Laplacian transformation which revealed rapid temporal adjustments that were not identifiable with other spatial filters. We conclude that the surface Laplacian transformation may be more suited to characterize EEG signatures of complex spatiotemporal networks involved in cognitive control.	[Wong, Aaron S.

Individual judgments of smile happiness were collected to assess the processing of different types of smile when these were presented as a social response in a cognitive conflict task. Two main factors were considered: (a) Expression characteristics of the smile were manipulated: that is, happy (happy-happy), neutral (neutral-happy), or sad (sad-happy) eyes were morphed in faces with smiling mouth; (b) The performance context in which the smiling face appeared as social response (after fast, average, or slow correct response). Participants rated happy-happy faces the happiest followed by neutral-happy faces, then sad-happy faces (happy-happy > neutral-happy > sad-happy). Moreover, faces were rated more happy after fast responses as compared with average or slow responses (fast > average > slow). In addition to subjective ratings, we recorded the electroencephalography (EEG) and calculated event-related brain potentials (ERPs). The ERPs showed modulations of early visual potentials according to the expression characteristics of the face. The P1 was larger for sad-happy than neutral-happy faces. Moreover, the relationship between performance and face had a significant impact on the early posterior negativity (EPN), an ERP component associated with emotion processing. Faces elicited the largest EPN amplitude after average and slow responses as compared with fast responses. These results show that smile processing and interpretation are determined both by the distinctive perceptual features of the smile expression and by the performance context in which the smiling face occurs.

The aim of the study was to examine if ERPs recorded during an oddball task would predict cognitive functioning and information processing speed in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients and controls at the individual level. Seventy-eight participants (35 MS patients, 43 healthy age-matched controls) completed visual and auditory 2- and 3-stimulus oddball tasks with 128-channel EEG, and a neuropsychological battery, at baseline (month 0) and at Months 13 and 26. ERPs from 0 to 700 ms and across the whole scalp were transformed into 1728 individual spatio-temporal datapoints per participant. A machine learning method that included penalized linear regression used the entire spatio-temporal ERP to predict composite scores of both cognitive functioning and processing speed at baseline (month 0), and months 13 and 26. The results showed ERPs during the visual oddball tasks could predict cognitive functioning and information processing speed at baseline and a year later in a sample of MS patients and healthy controls. In contrast, ERPs during auditory tasks were not predictive of cognitive performance. These objective neurophysiological indicators of cognitive functioning and processing speed, and machine learning methods that can interrogate high-dimensional data, show promise in outcome prediction.

Analysis of the Emotional-Cognitive Processes using a Modified Multisource Interference Task and Recording of EEG and Behavioral Responses	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						electroencephalogram (EEG); event-related potentials (ERPs); sensorimotor reaction; modified multisource interference task (mMSIT); emotional facial images	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; VISUAL-ATTENTION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; AROUSAL; FACES; REPETITION; ERP	We investigated changes in the EEG signals and the latency of behavioral responses in the cognitive test with interfering emotional stimuli. It was hypothesized that the cognitive process would be not only influenced by emotional factors but would also result in different patterns by emotional types (e.g., annoyance, happiness, neutrality, etc.) We developed a new method, the modified multisource interference task (mMSIT), to test our hypotheses. The EEG signals and behavioral responses were collected. Participants were required to press a button after stimulation; simultaneously, four-channel EEGs (F3, F4, Cz, and Pz) were recorded from 21 healthy participants. Event-related potentials (ERPs) and time-frequency EEG spectrograms were analyzed. Behavioral patterns were quantified by measuring the reaction times and error rates for button pressing. The P2 amplitudes at presentation of images of annoyed faces were found to be significantly lower than those for neutral and happy interference faces. The spectral powers of the range in F4 and Pz were also significantly smaller in annoyed interference compared to others. Additionally, the latency of behavioral responses for annoyed faces was significantly longer compared to that for happy faces. However, an error rate increase for annoyed faces was not observed. These results show that electrophysiological responses and behavioral reactions are significantly affected at visual perception of annoyed faces. Our findings demonstrate that negative emotional interference can increase the load of cognitive processing as a distractor, and our results show that the mMSIT is a useful task in studies of normal human cognition and emotions.

The well-known P300 component of the human event-related potential (ERP) has long been proposed to index "context-updating"-critical for cognitive control-in simple target detection tasks. However, task switching ERP studies have revealed both target P3 (300-350ms) and later sustained P3-like potentials (400-1,200ms) to first targets ensuing transition cues, although it remains unclear whether these target P3-like potentials also reflect context updating operations. To address this question, we applied novel single-trial EEG analyses-residue iteration decomposition (RIDE)-in order to disentangle target P3 sub-components in a sample of 22 young adults while they either repeated or switched (updated) task rules. The rationale was to revise the context updating hypothesis of P300 elicitation in the light of new evidence suggesting that "the context" consists of not only the sensory units of stimulation, but also associated motor units, and intermediate low- and high-order sensorimotor units, all of which may need to be dynamically updated on a trial by trial basis. The results showed functionally distinct target P3-like potentials in stimulus-locked, response-locked, and intermediate RIDE component clusters overlying parietal and frontal regions, implying multiple functionally distinct, though temporarily overlapping context updating operations. These findings support a reformulated version of the context updating hypothesis, and reveal a rich family of distinct target P3-like sub-components during the reactive control of target detection in task-switching, plausibly indexing the complex and dynamic workings of frontoparietal cortical networks subserving cognitive control.

In order to reduce the electrical impedance between electrodes and skin of the scalp, we use conductive gel. However, it takes time to setup EEG. This problem is solved by dry electrodes, which do not require to use the conductive gel, however, the signal quality of dry electrodes is lower than that of wet electrodes. In this research, we propose a method to improve quality of the dry EEG signal. In order to design a restoration filter, we prepare wet and dry EEG signals recorded simultaneously. Then the filter is trained by both wet and dry EEG signals to restore wet EEG signal from dry EEG signal input. We used the fully connected deep neural network (DNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN). We conducted an experiment using the oddball paradigm to demonstrate the proposed method and compare with the classical Wiener filter.

We arranged an experiment of olfactory stimulation by analyzing Event Related Potential during perception of 2 odor stimuli: pleasant (Rose, 2-phenyl ethanol C2H4O2) and neuter (Neuter, Vaseline Oil CH2). We recruited 15 adult safe non-smokers volunteers. In order to record OERP, we used VOS EEG, a new device dedicated to odorous stimulation in EEG. After the OERP task, the subject filled a visual analogic scale, regarding the administered smell, on three dimensions: pleasantness (P), arousing (A) and familiarity (F). We performed an artificial neural network analysis that highlighted three groups of significant features, one for each amplitude component. Three neural network classifiers were evaluated in terms of accuracy on both full and restricted datasets, showing the best performance with the latter.

A total of 66 undergraduate students' EEG were collected while they participated in a chemistry-related decision-making task in which they had to retrieve the relevant chemistry concepts in order to make correct decisions for each task item. The results showed that it was only in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) cluster that distinct patterns in EEG dynamics were displayed for the correct and incorrect responses. The logistic regression results indicated that ACC theta power from 300 ms to 250 ms before stimulus onset was the most informative factor for estimating the likelihood of making correct decisions in the chemistry-related decision-making task, while it was the ACC low beta power from 150 ms to 250 ms after stimulus onset. The results suggested that the ACC theta augmentation before the stimulus onset serves to actively maintain the relevant information for retrieval from long-term memory, while the ACC low beta augmentation after the stimulus onset may serve the function of mapping the encoded stimulus onto the relevant criteria that the given participant has held within his or her mind to guide the decision-making responses.

Do sport-related concussions result in long-term cognitive impairment? A review of event-related potential research	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						Concussion; Mild traumatic brain injury; Electroencephalography; Event-related brain potentials; Cognitive function	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; PERSISTENT INFLUENCE; NEUROELECTRIC INDEXES; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; ERROR-DETECTION; P300 LATENCY; CONFLICT; ERP; IMPACT; ATTENTION	Sport-related concussions have become a major public health concern although the long-term effects on cognitive function remain largely unknown. Event-related potentials (ERPs) are ideal for studying the long-term impact of sport-related concussions, as they have excellent temporal precision and provide insight that cannot be obtained from behavioral or neuropsychological measures alone. We reviewed all available published studies that have used stimulus or response-locked ERPs to document cognitive control processes in individuals with a history of concussion. Collectively, cross-sectional evidence suggests consistent reductions in P3 amplitude in previously concussed individuals, as well as a possible impairment in cognitive processing speed (P3 latency) and error monitoring processes (ERN). The persistent neurophysiological changes found may be related to the number of previous concussions sustained and the time since injury. Future studies incorporating prospective research designs are warranted before definitive statements can be offered regarding the long-term impact of sport-related concussions on cognitive control.

In this study, we investigated the influence of background music on executive functions (particularly on inhibitory functions). Participants completed a standardized cued Go/NoGo task during three different conditions while an EEG was recorded (1: with no background music, 2: with relaxing, or 3: with exciting background music). In addition, we collected reaction times, omissions, and commissions in response to the Go and NoGo stimuli. From the EEG data, event-related potentials (ERPs) were calculated for the Go and NoGo trials. From these ERPs, the N2 and P3 components were specifically analyzed since previous studies have shown that these components (and particularly the Go-NoGo difference waves) are strongly associated with inhibitory functions. The N2 and P3 components of the difference waves (N2d and P3d) were used for statistical analyses. The statistical analyses revealed no differences between the three conditions in terms of amplitudes and latencies of the N2d and P3d components. In addition, reaction times, omissions, and commissions were comparable across all conditions. Our results suggest that in the context of this paradigm, music as background acoustic stimulation has no detrimental effects on the performance of a Go/NoGo task and neural underpinnings.

Such conflicts can be produced consciously and by subliminally processed information. Interestingly, both sources of conflict interact suggesting that they share neural mechanisms. Here, we ask whether conjoint effects between different sources of conflict are modulated by microstructural basal ganglia dysfunction. To this end, we carried out an electroencephalography study and examined event-related potentials (ERPs) including source localization using a combined flanker-subliminal priming task in patients with X-linked dystonia Parkinsonism (XDP) and a group of healthy controls. XDP in its early stages is known to predominantly affect the basal ganglia striosomes. The results suggest that conjoint effects between subliminal and conscious sources of conflicts are modulated by the striosomes and were stronger in XDP patients. The neurophysiological data indicate that this effect is related to modulations in conflict monitoring and response selection (N2 ERP) mechanisms engaging the anterior cingulate cortex. Bottom-up perceptual gating, attentional selection, and motor response activation processes in response to the stimuli (P1, N1, and lateralized readiness potential ERPs) were unaffected. Taken together, these data indicate that striosomes modulate the processing of conscious and subliminal sources of conflict suggesting that microstructural basal ganglia properties are relevant for cognitive control.

Eighteen patients (10 males, with the mean age 34.43 13.14) were asked to fill out Beck's depression questionnaire. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals of subjects were recorded in three channels (Pz, Cz, and Fz) during Stroop test. This test entailed 360 stimulations, which included 120 congruent, 120 incongruent, and 120 neutral stimulations. To analyze the data, 18 time features in each type of stimulus were extracted from the ERP components and the optimal features were selected. The correlation between the subjects' scores in Beck's depression questionnaires and the extracted time features in each recording channel was calculated in order to select the best features. Total area, and peak-to-peak time window in the Cz channel in both the congruent and incongruent stimulus showed significant correlation with Beck scores, with r = 0.5984, p = 0.008 and r = 0.5890, p = 0.01, respectively. Consequently, given the correlation between time features and the subjects' Beck scores with different degrees of depression, it can be interpreted that in case of growth in degrees of depression, stimulations involving congruent images would produce more challenging interferences for the patients compared to incongruent stimulations which can be more effective in diagnosing the level of disorder.

The assessment of event-related potentials (ERPs) during the Stroop task has been used to study age-related decline in the efficiency of inhibitory processes. Studies using ERPs have found that the P300 amplitude increases and the N500 amplitude is attenuated in healthy elderly adults compared to those in young adults. On the other hand, it has been reported that theta excess in resting EEG with eyes closed is a good predictor of cognitive decline during aging 7 years later, while a normal EEG increases the probability of not developing cognitive decline. The behavioral and ERP responses during a Counting-Stroop task were compared between 22 healthy elderly subjects with normal EEG (Normal-EEG group) and 22 healthy elderly subjects with an excess of EEG theta activity (Theta-EEG group). Behaviorally, the Normal-EEG group showed a higher behavioral interference effect than the Theta-EEG group. ERP patterns were different between the groups, and two facts are highlighted: (a) the P300 amplitude was higher in the Theta-EEG group, with both groups showing a P300 effect in almost all electrodes, and (b) the Theta-EEG group did not show an N500 effect. These results suggest that the diminishment in inhibitory control observed in the Theta-EEG group may be compensated by different processes in earlier stages, which would allow them to perform the task with similar efficiency to that of participants with a normal EEG. This study is the first to show that healthy elderly subjects with an excess of theta EEG activity not only are at risk of developing cognitive decline but already have a cognitive impairment.

Specific focus lay on the P300 event-related brain potential (ERP) component to provide indication for internal processes related to attention and stimulus categorization. A high-quality (HQ) recording of a spoken word was impaired on each of three perceptual dimensions at a time, "discontinuity" (F), "noisiness" (N) and "coloration" (C), with F being realized through random erasure of distinct frames in the speech signal parts of the audio file. In an active three-stimulus oddball task, repeated presentations of the HQ stimulus led to the formation of a sensory/perceptual HQ reference, which was interrupted by infrequent occurrences of degraded "oddball" stimuli (F, N, C). Initial analysis of the obtained subjective and electrophysiological data suggested the following conclusions: 1) Participants perceived the three degraded stimuli as clearly impaired, but equal in terms of degradation intensity. Thus, variations in neural responses were assumed to reflect changes in the perceptual dimension along which the speech degradation had been induced. 2) Timing of the evoked P300 corresponded with temporal differences in the impairments, implying a later onset for "discretely" (F) compared to "continuously" (N, C) degraded stimuli after being categorized as task-irrelevant. Hence, P300 peak latency might prove useful to dissociate both classes of speech quality impairments on a neural level of analysis.

Electrophysiologic markers, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERP), have high temporal resolution sensitive to detect plastic changes of the brain associated with symptomatic improvement following tDCS application. Methods We performed systematic review to identify electrophysiological markers that reflect tDCS effects on plastic brain changes in psychiatric disorders. A total of 638 studies were identified by searching PubMed, Embase, psychINFPO. Of these, 21 full-text articles were assessed eligible and included in the review. Results Although the reviewed studies were heterogeneous in their choices of tDCS protocols, targeted electrophysiological markers, and disease entities, their results strongly support EEG/ERPs to sensitively reflect plastic brain changes and the associated symptomatic improvement following tDCS. Conclusion EEG/ERPs may serve a potent tool in revealing the mechanisms underlying psychiatric symptoms, as well as in localizing the brain area targeted for stimulation. Future studies in each disease entities employing consistent tDCS protocols and electrophysiological markers would be necessary in order to substantiate and further elaborate the findings of studies included in the present systematic review.

Effect of attention bias modification on event-related potentials in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: A preliminary brain function and psycho-behavioral study	NEUROGASTROENTEROLOGY AND MOTILITY			English	Article						attentional bias; electroencephalography; evoked potentials; irritable bowel syndrome	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; SOCIALLY ANXIOUS INDIVIDUALS; GUT-DIRECTED HYPNOTHERAPY; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; ANXIETY DISORDERS; CLINICAL-PRACTICE; HEALTH-CARE; THERAPY	BackgroundAttention bias modification normalizes electroencephalographic abnormalities in alpha and beta power percentages related to attention in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Yet, it is unknown whether ABM contributes to the normalization of event-related potentials (ERP) in these patients. We hypothesized that ERP related to attention deficit would be normalized after ABM implementation in individuals with IBS. MethodsThirteen patients with IBS and 10 control subjects completed a 2-month intervention that included five ABM sessions. Each session included 128 trials, resulting in a total of 640 trials during the study period. Event-related potentials were measured at the first and fifth sessions. As per the international 10-20 system for electroencephalographic electrode placement, right parietal P4 was evaluated to measure the attention component of facial expression processing. Key ResultsA group comparison of P100 latency at P4 revealed that latencies were significantly different between groups in session 1 (IBS vs control, 1088 vs 97 +/- 14; t=-2.51, P=.0203). This difference was absent in session 5 (94 +/- 11 vs 93 +/- 11, respectively; t=-0.397, P=.6954, r=.09), indicating an effect of ABM in the IBS group. Conclusions and inferencesAttention bias modification may have clinical utility for normalizing brain function and specifically attentional abnormalities in patients with IBS.

Stimulus repetition at 1 Hz induces a strong habituation of the largest ERP responses, the vertex waves (VWs). VWs are elicited by stimuli regardless of their modality, provided that they are salient and behaviorally relevant. In contrast, the effect of stimulus repetition on the earlier sensory components of ERPs has been less explored, and the few existing results are inconsistent. To characterize how the different ERP waves habituate over time, we recorded the responses elicited by 60 identical somatosensory stimuli (activating either non-nociceptive A beta or nociceptive A beta afferents), delivered at 1 Hz to healthy human participants. We show that the well-described spatiotemporal sequence of lateralized and vertex ERP components elicited by the first stimulus of the series is largely preserved in the smaller-amplitude, habituated response elicited by the last stimuli of the series. We also found that the earlier lateralized sensory wave habituates across the 60 trials following the same decay function of the VWs: this decay function is characterized by a large drop at the first stimulus repetition followed by smaller decreases at subsequent repetitions. Interestingly, the same decay functions described the habituation of ERPs elicited by repeated non-nociceptive and nociceptive stimuli. This study provides a neurophysiological characterization of the effect of prolonged and repeated stimulation on the main components of somatosensory ERPs. It also demonstrates that both lateralized waves and VWs are obligatory components of ERPs elicited by non-nociceptive and nociceptive stimuli.

Differences in Cortical Sources of the Event-Related P3 Potential Between Young and Old Participants Indicate Frontal Compensation	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Aging; P3; P300	LATE ERP RESPONSES; N-BACK TASK; WORKING-MEMORY; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; INDEPENDENT COMPONENTS; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; DEVIANT STIMULI; BRAIN; EEG; AGE	The event-related P3 potential, as elicited in auditory signal detection tasks, originates from neural activity of multiple cortical structures and presumably reflects an overlap of several cognitive processes. The fact that the P3 is affected by aging makes it a potential metric for age-related cognitive change. The P3 in older participants is thought to encompass frontal compensatory activity in addition to task-related processes. The current study investigates this by decomposing the P3 using group independent component analysis (ICA). Independent components (IC) of young and old participants were compared in order to investigate the effects of aging. Exact low-resolution tomography analysis (eLORETA) was used to compare current source densities between young and old participants for the P3-ICs to localize differences in cortical source activity for every IC. One of the P3-related ICs reflected a different constellation of cortical generators in older participants compared to younger participants, suggesting that this P3-IC reflects shifts in neural activations and compensatory processes with aging. This P3-IC was localized to the orbitofrontal/temporal, and the medio-parietal regions. For this IC, older participants showed more frontal activation and less parietal activation as measured on the scalp. The differences in cortical sources were localized in the precentral gyrus and the parahippocampal gyrus. This finding might reflect compensatory activity recruited from these cortical sources during a signal detection task.

Two kinds of scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) references, namely, AR (average of all recording channels) and reference electrode standardization technique (REST), were comparatively investigated via the time-varying processing of N170. Results showed that the latency and amplitude of N170 were significantly different between REST and AR, with the former being earlier and smaller. In particular, the information flow from right temporal-parietal P8 to left P7 in the time-varying network was earlier in REST than that in AR, and this phenomenon was reproduced by simulation, in which the performance of REST was closer to the true case at source level. These findings indicate that reference plays a crucial role in ERP data interpretation, and importantly, the newly developed approximate zero-reference REST would be a superior choice for precise evaluation of the scalp spatio-temporal changes relating to various cognitive events.

In the human brain, feedback processing is often examined by measuring an event-related potential, the feedback-related negativity component. Typically, the feedback-related negativity component is investigated by directly comparing gain with loss feedback randomized across trials; however, this method does not control for confounds associated with unexpected feedback. For this study we used a blocked design gambling task to investigate the sensitivity of feedback-related negativity to positive and negative feedback separately for gains and losses. While there appeared to be no significant feedback-related negativity in the loss domain, results revealed an enlarged feedback-related negativity during the omission of gains compared to the reception of gains. These findings further support the reward positivity hypothesis which declares that the feedback-related negativity is associated with the processing of outcomes in the context of gains as opposed to losses, irrespective of unexpectedness.

This study tested-via behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) measures-two accounts: deficiencies in error monitoring and deficiencies in action updating. High and low narcissists were a engaged in a monetary gambling task by choosing between a high-risk and a low-risk option while the electroencephalogram (EEG) was being recorded. Two ERP components relevant to outcome evaluation-feedback-related negativity (FRN) and P3-were analyzed, with the FRN serving as an index of error monitoring and the P3 as an index of action updating. Generally, high and low narcissists differed in the high-risk condition but not in the low-risk condition. At the behavioral level, high (vs low) narcissists made riskier decisions following high-risk decision outcomes, which was in line with past findings; at the neurophysiological level, while no FRN difference emerged between high and low narcissists, the outcome valence effect (positive vs negative) on the P3 was stronger among low narcissists than high narcissists following high-risk decision outcomes. One possible interpretation of the results is that narcissism is associated with reduced action updating. The findings contribute to the understanding of narcissistic decision-making and self-regulation.	[Yang, Ziyan; Gu, Ruolei; Luo, Yu L.

Serial bedside electrophysiologic testing can probe for higher order cortical responses temporally and spatially propagated through cortical networks, while long-latency event-related potentials may help differentiate patients with coma or vegetative state from a state of residual consciousness. Transcranial magnetic stimulation co-registered to high-density EEG may reveal widespread pulse-stimulated cortical activation of various brain regions. These emerging electrophysiologic techniques show promise as powerful diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tools.

Differential Sources for 2 Neural Signatures of Target Detection: An Electrocorticography Study	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						electrocorticography; high frequency band; neural generators; P3b; target detection	EVENT-RELATED FMRI; INTRACEREBRAL POTENTIALS; P300 COMPONENT; VISUAL-STIMULI; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ODDBALL TASK; RARE TARGET; PARIETAL; CORTEX; EEG	Electrophysiology and neuroimaging provide conflicting evidence for the neural contributions to target detection. Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) studies localize the P3b event-related potential component mainly to parietal cortex, whereas neuroimaging studies report activations in both frontal and parietal cortices. We addressed this discrepancy by examining the sources that generate the target-detection process using electrocorticography (ECoG). We recorded ECoG activity from cortex in 14 patients undergoing epilepsy monitoring, as they performed an auditory or visual target-detection task. We examined target-related responses in 2 domains: high frequency band (HFB) activity and the P3b. Across tasks, we observed a greater proportion of electrodes that showed target-specific HFB power relative to P3b over frontal cortex, but their proportions over parietal cortex were comparable. Notably, there was minimal overlap in the electrodes that showed target-specific HFB and P3b activity. These results revealed that the target-detection process is characterized by at least 2 different neural markers with distinct cortical distributions. Our findings suggest that separate neural mechanisms are driving the differential patterns of activity observed in scalp EEG and neuroimaging studies, with the P3b reflecting EEG findings and HFB activity reflecting neuroimaging findings, highlighting the notion that target detection is not a unitary phenomenon.

J	Lee, MH; Williamson, J; Lee, YE; Lee, SW				Lee, Min-Ho; Williamson, John; Lee, Young-Eun; Lee, Seong-Whan			Mental fatigue in central-field and peripheral-field steady-state visually evoked potential and its effects on event-related potential responses	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						brain-computer interface; competing effect; event-related potential; peripheral-field stimulus; steady-state visual evoked potential; visual fatigue	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; ATTENTION; SSVEP; COMPONENTS; P300	The steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) is a natural response of the brain to visual stimulation at specific frequencies and is used widely for electroencephalography-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Although the SSVEP is useful for its high level of decoding accuracy, visual fatigue from the repetitive visual flickering is an unavoidable problem. In addition, hybrid BCI systems that combine the SSVEP with the event-related potential (ERP) have been proposed recently. These hybrid BCI systems would improve the decoding accuracy; however, the competing effect by simultaneous presentation of the visual stimulus could possibly supervene the signal in the hybrid system. Nevertheless, previous studies have not sufficiently reported these problems of visual fatigue with SSVEP stimuli or the competing effect in the SSVEP+ERP system. In this study, two different experiments were designed to explore our claims. The first experiment evaluated the visual fatigue level and decoding accuracy for the different types of SSVEP stimuli, which were the peripheral-field SSVEP (pSSVEP) and the central-field SSVEP (cSSVEP). We report that the pSSVEP could reduce the visual fatigue level by avoiding direct exposure of the eye-retina to the flickering visual stimulus, while also delivering a decoding accuracy comparable to that of cSSVEP. The second experiment was designed to examine the competing effect of the SSVEP stimuli on ERP performance and vice versa. To do this, the visual stimuli of ERP and SSVEP were presented simultaneously as part of the BCI speller layout. We found a clear competing effect wherein the evoked brain potentials were influenced by the SSVEP stimulus and the band power at the target frequencies was also decreased significantly by the ERP stimuli. Nevertheless, these competing effects did not lead to a significant loss in decoding accuracy; their features preserved sufficient information for discriminating a target class. Our work is the first to evaluate the visual fatigue and competing effect together, which should be considered when designing BCI applications. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the pSSVEP is a viable substitution for the cSSVEP because of its ability to reduce the level of visual fatigue while maintaining a minimal loss of decoding accuracy.

Building on prior behavioral investigations, this study assesses the link between individual differences in low-level neural attentional responding and false memory susceptibility on the misinformation effect, a paradigm in which false event memories are induced via misleading post-event information. Twenty-four subjects completed the misinformation effect paradigm after which high-density (256-channel) EEG data was collected as they engaged in an auditory oddball task. Temporal-spatial decomposition was used to extract two attention-related components from the oddball data, the P3b and Classic Slow Wave. The P3b was utilized as an index of individual differences in salient target attentional responding while the slow wave was adopted as an index of variability in task-level sustained attention. Analyses of these components show a significant negative relationship between slow-wave responses to oddball non-targets and perceptual false memory endorsements, suggestive of a link between individual differences in levels of sustained attention and false memory susceptibility. These findings provide the first demonstrated link between individual differences in basic attentional responses and false memory. These results support prior behavioral work linking attention and false memory and highlight the integration between attentional processes and real-world episodic memory.

If analyzed and patterns are recognized properly this has a high potential application in medicine, psychology, rehabilitation, and many other areas. However, EEG signals are inherently noise-prone, and it is not possible for human to see patterns in raw signals most of the time. Application of appropriate computational intelligence is must to make sense of the raw EEG signals. Moreover, if the signals are collected by a consumer grade wireless EEG acquisition device, the amount of interference is ever more complex to avoid, and it becomes impossible to see any sorts of pattern without proper use of computational intelligence to discover patterns. The objective of EEG based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems is to extract specific signature of the brain activity and to translate them into command signals to control external devices or understand human brains action mechanism to stimuli. A typical BCI system is comprised of a Signal Processing module which can be further broken down into four submodules namely, Pre-processing, Feature Extraction, Feature Selection and Classification. Computational intelligence is the key to identify and extract features also to classify or discover discriminating characteristics in signals. In this chapter we present an overview how computational intelligence is used to discover patterns in brain signals. From our research we conclude that, since EEG signals are the outcome of a highly complex non-linear and non-stationary stochastic biological process which contain a wide variety of noises both from internal and external sources; thus, the use of computational intelligence is required at every step of an EEG-based BCI system starting from removing noises (using advanced signal processing techniques such as SWTSD, ICA, EMD, other than traditional filtering by identifying/exploiting different artifact/noise characteristics/patterns) through feature extraction and selection (by using unsupervised learning like PCA, SVD, etc.) and finally to classification (either supervised learning based classifier like SVM, probabilistic classifier like NB or unsupervised learning based classifiers like neural networks namely RBF, MLP, DBN, k-NN, etc.). And the usage of appropriate computational intelligence significantly improves the end results.	[Mutasim, Aunnoy K.; Tipu, Rayhan Sardar; Bashar, M. Raihanul; Amin, M.

In this study, we reexamined findings that EEG activity in healthy elderly individuals aged over 85 years (range 85-94) was the same or different compared to individuals younger than 84 years (range 65-84). We performed EEG frequency analysis to investigate the characteristics of resting state frequency components in a cross-sectional study. In individuals aged 85 and older, the dominant frequency component demonstrated a significant shift toward the slower alpha frequency in the left temporal and occipital regions. However, among the oldest individuals, a spectral peak appeared at 9.0-10.0 Hz, and power curves at peak frequency exhibited a sharp rise. Interestingly, healthy individuals older than 85 did not exhibit an appreciable change in EEG, suggesting that "slowing" is not a characteristic sign of aging.

J	Hashimoto, Y; Yotsumoto, Y				Hashimoto, Yuki; Yotsumoto, Yuko			The Amount of Time Dilation for Visual Flickers Corresponds to the Amount of Neural Entrainments Measured by EEG	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						time perception; duration perception; neural entrainment; time; EEG	INTERNAL CLOCK; OSCILLATORY PROCESSES; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; PERCEPTION; MECHANISMS	The neural basis of time perception has long attracted the interests of researchers. Recently, a conceptual model consisting of neural oscillators was proposed and validated by behavioral experiments that measured the dilated duration in perception of a flickering stimulus (Hashimoto and Yotsumoto, 2015). The model proposed that flickering stimuli cause neural entrainment of oscillators, resulting in dilated time perception. In this study, we examined the oscillator-based model of time perception, by collecting electroencephalography (EEG) data during an interval-timing task. Initially, subjects observed a stimulus, either flickering at 10-Hz or constantly illuminated. The subjects then reproduced the duration of the stimulus by pressing a button. As reported in previous studies, the subjects reproduced 1.22 times longer durations for flickering stimuli than for continuously illuminated stimuli. The event-related potential (ERP) during the observation of a flicker oscillated at 10 Hz, reflecting the 10-Hz neural activity phase-locked to the flicker. Importantly, the longer reproduced duration was associated with a larger amplitude of the 10-Hz ERP component during the inter-stimulus interval, as well as during the presentation of the flicker. The correlation between the reproduced duration and the 10-Hz oscillation during the inter-stimulus interval suggested that the flicker-induced neural entrainment affected time dilation. While the 10-Hz flickering stimuli induced phase-locked entrainments at 10 Hz, we also observed event-related desynchronizations of spontaneous neural oscillations in the alpha-frequency range. These could be attributed to the activation of excitatory neurons while observing the flicker stimuli. In addition, neural activity at approximately the alpha frequency increased during the reproduction phase, indicating that flicker-induced neural entrainment persisted even after the offset of the flicker. In summary, our results suggest that the duration perception is mediated by neural oscillations, and that time dilation induced by flickering visual stimuli can be attributed to neural entrainment.

J	Liesefeld, HR				Liesefeld, Heinrich Rene			Estimating the Timing of Cognitive Operations With MEG/EEG Latency Measures: A Primer, a Brief Tutorial, and an Implementation of Various Methods	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						magnetoencephalography (MEG); electroencephalography (EEG); component latency; mental chronometry; event-related potential/field (ERP/ERF)	BASE-LINE CORRECTION; HIGH-PASS FILTERS; VISUAL-SEARCH EVIDENCE; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; INCORRECT CONCLUSIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; ERP; ATTENTION; ARTIFACTS; EEG	The major advantage of MEG/EEG over other neuroimaging methods is its high temporal resolution. Examining the latency of well-studied components can provide a window into the dynamics of cognitive operations beyond traditional response-time (RT) measurements. While RTs reflect the cumulative duration of all time-consuming cognitive operations involved in a task, component latencies can partition this time into cognitively meaningful sub-steps. Surprisingly, most MEG/EEG studies neglect this advantage and restrict analyses to component amplitudes without considering latencies. The major reasons for this neglect might be that, first, the most easily accessible latency measure (peak latency) is often unreliable and that, second, more complex measures are difficult to conceive, implement, and parametrize. The present article illustrates the key advantages and disadvantages of the three main types of latency-measures (peak latency, onset latency, and percent-area latency), introduces a MATLAB function that extracts all these measures and is compatible with common analysis tools, discusses the most important parameter choices for different research questions and components of interest, and demonstrates its use by various group analyses on one planar gradiometer pair of the publicly available Wakeman and Henson (2015) data. The introduced function can extract from group data not only single-subject latencies, but also grand-average and jackknife latencies. Furthermore, it gives the choice between different approaches to automatically set baselines and anchor points for latency estimation, approaches that were partly developed by me and that capitalize on the informational richness of MEG/EEG data. Although the function comes with a wide range of customization parameters, the default parameters are set so that even beginners get reasonable results. Graphical depictions of latency estimates, baselines, and anchor points overlaid on individual averages further support learning, understanding and trouble-shooting. Once extracted, latency estimates can be submitted to any analysis also available for (averaged) RTs, including tests for mean differences, correlational approaches and cognitive modeling.

Weak proactive cognitive/motor brain control accounts for poor children's behavioral performance in speeded discrimination tasks	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						ERPs; EEG; Cognitive control; proactive inhibitory control; Anterior insular cortex	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; GO/NO-GO TASK; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; FRONTAL-CORTEX; SPATIOTEMPORAL ANALYSIS; ERP COMPONENTS; CHILDHOOD; ADOLESCENCE; MATURATION; ADULTS	Background: Motor and inhibitory control rely on frontal cortex activity, which is known to reach full maturation only in late adolescence. The development of inhibitory control has been studied using event-related potentials (ERP), focusing on reactive processing (i.e. the N2 and the P3 components). Scarce information exists concerning pre-stimulus activity as that represented by the Bereinshafstpotential (BP) and by the prefrontal negativity (pN). Further, no literature exists concerning the post-stimulus components originating within the anterior insula (pN1, pP1, pP2). This study aims at associating children performance with these motor-cognitive processing in frontal brain areas. Methods: High-resolution EEG recordings were employed to measure ERPs from 18 children (12 years old) and 18 adults (28 years old) during a visuo-motor discriminative response task. Response time (RT), commission (CE) and omission errors, and RT variability were compared between groups. At brain level, two pre-stimulus (BP and pN) and seven post-stimulus (P1; pN1; N1; pP1; N2; pP2; P3) ERP components were compared between groups. Results: Children showed slower and more variable RTs and poorer inhibition (higher CEs) than adults. At electrophysiological level, children presented smaller BP and pN. After stimulus onset, children showed lower amplitude of N1, pP1, P3, and pP2 components. The P1, pP1, N2 and P3 were delayed compared to adults. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that children are characterized by less intense task-related proactive activities in frontal cortex, which may account for subsequent poor and delayed reactive processing and, thus, for inaccurate and slow performance.

The MATLAB-based open source toolbox Randomization Graphical User interface (Ragu) provides, among other methods, a test for topographic consistency, a topographic analysis of variance, t-mapping and microstate analyses. Up to two within-subject factors and one between-subject factor, each with an open number of levels, can be defined and analyzed in Ragu. Ragu analyses include all sensor signals and no a-priori models have to be applied during the analyses. Additionally, periods of significant effects can be controlled for multiple testing using global overall statistics over time. Here, we introduce the different alternatives to apply Ragu, based on a step by step analysis of an example study. This example study examined the neural activity in response to semantic unexpected sentence endings in exchange students at the beginning of their stay and after staying in a foreign-language country for 5 months.

Performance monitoring and post-error adjustments in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: an EEG analysis	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY & NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL INDEXES; ERP COMPONENTS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ADHD; CHILDREN; CORTEX; VARIABILITY; ADOLESCENTS	Background: Recently, research into attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has focused increasingly on its neurobiological underpinnings, revealing (among other things) frontal lobe alterations. Specifically, action-monitoring deficits have been described, including impaired behavioural adjustments following errors. Our aim was to examine the neurophysiological background of post-error behavioural alterations in an adult ADHD sample for the first time, hypothesizing that people with ADHD would differ from controls in neurophysiological markers of cognitive preparation and stimulus processing, specifically following errors. Methods: In total, 34 people with ADHD and 34 controls participated in an electroencephalography measurement while performing a flanker task. The final number of electroencephalography samples included in the analyses ranged from 23 to 28. We recorded event-related potentials for the erroneous response itself (error-related negativity) and for events following errors (intertrial interval: contingent negative variation; next flanker stimulus: P300). Results: Over frontal electrode sites, error-related negativity amplitudes were significantly reduced in people with ADHD across response conditions. Both groups showed reduced P300 amplitudes on flanker stimuli following errors. Moreover, during the intertrial interval, patients exhibited significantly reduced contingent negative variation, specifically following errors. At the behavioural level, we observed no significant group differences in post-error data. Limitations: Only adults were examined (no longitudinal data). Conclusion: Based on previous reports of post-error behavioural alterations in childhood samples, we conclude that people with ADHD develop compensatory strategies across the lifespan that lead to inconspicuous post-error behaviour in adulthood. Neurophysiologically, however, subtle alterations remain, indicating a perseverance of at least some frontal lobe deficits in people with ADHD who are partially medicated, particularly with respect to action-monitoring and post-error adaptation.

Recent ADHD studies highlight the great potential of non-invasive event-related potential (ERP) technique. It is thus worth combining multiple features to form sensitive and robust biomarkers to distinguish ADHD from normal children. Methods: In this paper, we collected the EEG signals of sixty-eight ADHD children and seventy-three age-match typically developing children during a classic Simon-spatial Stroop task. A channel optimization method was used to select the feature channel. Time-domain features and frequency-domain features were extracted from EEG data. Three classifiers were used to classify ADHD children from typically developing children by using multiple features as well as each single feature. Results: ADHD children showed weaker N2 and P2 signals than typically developing children. Behavior response results showed that, children with ADHD exhibited lower correct response rates, longer average response time and higher data variance. In classification experiment, performance of three classifiers trained on multiple features was much better than that on single feature. Multiple features classification achieved the highest accuracy of 96.6%, while single time-domain and frequency-domain feature only achieved the highest accuracy of 88.10% and 92.85% respectively. All the highest accuracies were achieved on feature channel in inferior parietal cortex. Conclusion: Feature channel generally performed better than empirical channel. The multiple ERP features classification method has a good recognition accuracy, being worth researching in ADHD's auxiliary diagnosis.

We start by considering the problem of estimating ERP ensemble averages in the time domain. An estimator allowing for weights and time shifts for each trial is discussed. Then we consider spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal multivariate filters for improving the estimation, including principal component analysis, the common spatial pattern and blind source separation. Then, we review time-frequency analysis methods. The reader is provided with definitions in order to understand the most commonly used linear and non-linear measures used in the time-frequency domain. We continue with a brief discussion on the importance of the analysis in the spatial domain, including topographic maps and tomographies. Next, we review procedures for applying inferential statistics to ERP studies. Emphasis is given to procedures based on permutation tests, which account for the multiple comparison problem and adapt to the form and degree of correlation between hypotheses. Finally, we consider the problem of classifying ERP single-trials, pointing to recent literature covering the most promisingmethods currently available, namely, Riemannian geometry, random forests and neural networks.

An Implicit View	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						event-related potentials; experience goods; late positive potential; P200; personalized product designs	PRODUCT DESIGN; EMOTIONAL PERCEPTION; BRAIN; ERP; NEUROSCIENCE; POTENTIALS; ACTIVATION; SEARCH; CORTEX; EEG	Understanding the process by which consumers evaluate the designs of experience goods is critical for firms designing and delivering experience products. As the implicit process involved in this evaluation, and given the possible social desirability bias inherent to traditional methods of product design evaluation in certain conditions, neuroscientific methods are preferred to gain insight into the neural basis of consumers' evaluation of experience good designs. We here used event-related potentials (ERPs) and a revised go/no-go paradigm to investigate consumers' neural responses to experience good designs. Personalized product designs and neutral landscape pictures were randomly presented to 20 student participants; they were asked to view these product designs without making any decisions. The paired t-test and repeated-measures analysis of correlation showed that the P200 and late positive potential (LPP) elicited by the most-preferred experience good designs were significantly higher than that elicited by least-preferred designs, and the two ERP components were positively correlated with the personalized rating scores. Thus, P200 and LPP might be the early and late indices of consumers' evaluation of experience good designs, respectively, and may facilitate an understanding of the temporal course of this evaluation. Furthermore, these two ERP components can be used to identify consumers' preferences toward experience good designs. In addition, given the use of personalized experimental stimuli, these findings may help to explain why customized products are preferred by consumers.

High-precision voluntary movements are largely independent of preceding vertex potentials elicited by sudden sensory events	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article						saliency; vertex potential; event-related potentials; voluntary movement; motor control	VISUAL SELECTIVE ATTENTION; SIMPLE REACTION-TIME; BRAIN POTENTIALS; EEG RESPONSES; LOCATION; ACCURACY; SEARCH; ERP; VARIABILITY; TRACKING	Salient and fast-rising sensory events generate a large biphasic vertex wave (VW) in the human electroencephalogram (EEG). We recently reported that the VW is coupled with a modulation of concomitantly-applied isometric force. In the present study, in five experiments, we tested whether the VW is also related to high-precision visuomotor control. We obtained three results. First, the saliency-induced increase in VW amplitude was paralleled by a modulation in two of the five extracted movement parameters: a reduction in the onset time of the voluntary movement (P<0.005) and an increase in movement accuracy (P<0.005). Second, spontaneous trial-by-trial variability in vertex wave amplitude, for a given level of stimulus saliency, was positively correlated with movement onset time (P<0.001 in four out of five experiments). Third, this latter trial-by-trial correlation was explained by a widespread EEG negativity independent of the occurrence of the positive VW, although overlapping in time with it. These results indicate that (i) the execution of a voluntary high-precision movement remains relatively independent of the neural processing reflected by the preceding VW, with (ii) the exception of movement onset time, for which saliency-based contextual effects are dissociated from trial-by-trial effects. These results also indicate that (iii) attentional effects can produce spurious correlations between event-related potentials (ERPs) and behavioural measures. Although sudden salient stimuli trigger characteristic EEG responses coupled with distinct reactive components within an ongoing isometric task, the results of the present study indicate that the execution of a subsequent voluntary movement appears largely protected from such saliency-based modulation, with the exception of movement onset time.

Using trial-level data and multilevel modeling to investigate within-task change in event-related potentials	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						analysis; statistical methods; ERPs; error processing; face processing	COGNITIVE CONTROL; TIME-COURSE; FACE; ERP; PERCEPTION; RELIABILITY; DESIGNS; US	EEG data, and specifically the ERP, provide psychologists with the power to examine quickly occurring cognitive processes at the native temporal resolution at which they occur. Despite the advantages conferred by ERPs to examine processes at different points in time, ERP researchers commonly ignore the trial-to-trial temporal dimension by collapsing across trials of similar types (i.e., the signal averaging approach) because of constraints imposed by repeated measures ANOVA. Here, we present the advantages of using multilevel modeling (MLM) to examine trial-level data to investigate change in neurocognitive processes across the course of an experiment. Two examples are presented to illustrate the usefulness of this technique. The first demonstrates decreasing differentiation in N170 amplitude to faces of different races across the course of a race categorization task. The second demonstrates attenuation of the ERN as participants commit more errors within a task designed to measure implicit racial bias. Although the examples presented here are within the realm of social psychology, the use of MLM to analyze trial-level EEG data has the potential to contribute to a number of different theoretical domains within psychology.

In the visual system, the extrastriate body area (EBA), an occipito-temporal region, responds to full body and body part images under the organizational principle of their functional/semantic meaning. Although frequency-specific modulations of neural activity associated with perceptive and cognitive functions are increasingly attracting the interest of neurophysiologists and cognitive neuroscientists, perceiving single body parts with different functional meaning and full body images induces time-frequency modulations over occipito-temporal electrodes are yet to be described. Here, we studied this issue by measuring EEG in participants who passively observed fingers, hands, arms and faceless full body images with four control plant stimuli, each bearing hierarchical analogy with the body stimuli. We confirmed that occipito-temporal electrodes (compatible with the location of EBA) show a larger event-related potential (ERP, N190) for body-related images. Furthermore, we identified a body part-specific (i.e. selective for hands and arms) theta event-related synchronization increase under the same electrodes. This frequency modulation associated with the perception of body effectors over occipitotemporal cortices is in line with recent findings of categorical organization of neural responses to human effectors in the visual system.

A watch purchasing experiment was conducted and electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded while participants making purchasing decisions. Switzerland was chosen as COI stereotype-congruent country; Belgium, France and Denmark were chosen as COI stereotype-incongruent countries of watches. Event related potential (ERP) data showed remarkable augmented P200 amplitudes and attenuated N270 in stereotype-congruent group than that in stereotype-incongruent group. P200 is associated with unconscious implicit emotional priming of stereotype. N270 not only reflects cognitive monitoring but also connects with behavioral control in stereotype-based decision making. In contrast to previous neuropsychological findings on racial stereotype and gender stereotype, our data suggest stereotype in product judgement may share the same automatic stereotype activation process on P200 with person judgement. But the cognitive monitoring mechanism of stereotype may be more sensitive in product evaluation (reflecting on N270) than in person evaluation (reflecting on N400 in previous research).

The purpose of this review is to highlight a number of recent studies that have investigated the alpha band (8-12 Hz) oscillatory activity present in magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography, to provide new insights into the maladaptive network activity underlying attentional impairments in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Studies reviewed demonstrate that event-related decrease in alpha is attenuated during visual selective attention, primarily in ADHD inattentive type, and is often significantly associated with accuracy and reaction time during task performance. Furthermore, aberrant modulation of alpha activity has been reported across development and may have abnormal or atypical lateralization patterns in ADHD. Modulations in the alpha band thus represent a robust, relatively unexplored putative biomarker of attentional impairment and a strong prospect for future studies aimed at examining underlying neural mechanisms and treatment response among individuals with ADHD. Potential limitations of its use as a diagnostic biomarker and directions for future research are discussed.

Spectral and temporal electroencephalography measures reveal distinct neural networks for the acquisition, consolidation, and interlimb transfer of motor skills in healthy young adults	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Event-related desynchronization; Motor learning; N30; Phase slope index; Plasticity	SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; CROSS-LIMB TRANSFER; DEPENDENT PLASTICITY; CORTEX; MECHANISMS; OSCILLATIONS; HUMANS; CONNECTIVITY; EXCITABILITY; MODULATION	Objective: Plasticity of the central nervous system likely underlies motor learning. It is however unclear, whether plasticity in cortical motor networks is motor learning stage-, activity-, or connectivity-dependent. Methods: From electroencephalography (EEG) data, we quantified effective connectivity by the phase slope index (PSI), neuronal activity by event-related desynchronization, and sensorimotor integration by N30 during the stages of visuomotor skill acquisition, consolidation, and interlimb transfer. Results: Although N30 amplitudes and event-related desynchronization in parietal electrodes increased with skill acquisition, changes in PSI correlated most with motor performance in all stages of motor learning. Specifically, changes in PSI between the premotor, supplementary motor, and primary motor cortex (M1) electrodes correlated with skill acquisition, whereas changes in PSI between electrodes representing M1 and the parietal and primary sensory cortex (S1) correlated with skill consolidation. The magnitude of consolidated interlimb transfer correlated with PSI between bilateral M1s and between S1 and M1 in the non-practiced hemisphere. Conclusions: Spectral and temporal EEG measures but especially PSI correlated with improvements in complex motor behavior and revealed distinct neural networks in the acquisition, consolidation, and interlimb transfer of motor skills.

Several techniques in EEG relies on analyzing the topographical distribution of the data. One of the most common analysis is EEG microstates (EEG-ms). EEG-ms reflects the stable topographical representation of EEG signal lasting a few dozen milliseconds. EEG-ms were associated with resting state fMRI networks and related mental processes and abnormalities. One challenge in EEG-ms analysis is the polarity invariant property for the signal, in which the relative direction of local minima and maxima is taking into consideration. Thus, identifying those topographies requires special handling for the data using modified clustering algorithms. Here, we propose a polarity invariant transformation for EEG data to eliminate the difficulties with handling the polarity of the data during the EEG-ms identification part, which would allow better clustering EEG data. Our results demonstrate how the transformation work and show the benefit of using such a transformation.

The pattern of neural activation seen in healthy individuals during picture naming is disrupted in individuals with aphasia, but the time-course of the disruption remains unclear. Specifically, it remains unclear which anatomical and temporal aspects of neural processing are necessary for correct naming. Here, we tested two individuals with stroke induced aphasia, and compared the differences in the event-related potentials (ERPs) and current sources when they made correct vs. erroneous responses during picture naming. The pre-articulatory ERP activity was significantly different between the two responses. Current source analysis revealed that the ability to recruit left temporal and frontal areas within a 300-550 ms time window after stimulus onset contributed to correct responses. These results suggest that targeted neuromodulation in these areas could lead to better treatment outcomes in patients with aphasia.

These experimental conditions are associated with respiratory discomfort, i.e., dyspnea. Premotor potentials are also observed in resting breathing in patients with reduced automatic respiratory drive or respiratory muscle strength due to respiratory or neurological disease, presumably in an attempt to maintain ventilation. The aim of this study was to determine if small voluntary increases in ventilation or smaller load-capacity imbalances, that generate an awareness of breathing but aren't necessarily dyspneic, give rise to respiratory premotor potentials in healthy participants. In 15 healthy subjects, EEG was recorded during voluntary large breaths (similar to 3x tidal volume, that were interspersed with smaller non-voluntary breaths in the same trial; in 10 subjects) and breathing with a 'low' inspiratory threshold load (similar to 7 cmH(2)O; in 8 subjects). Averaged EEG signals at Cz and FCz were assessed for premotor potentials prior to inspiration. Premotor potential incidence in large breaths was 40%, similar to that in the smaller non-voluntary breaths in the same trial (20%; p > 0.05) and to that in a separate trial of resting breathing (0%; p > 0.05). The incidence of premotor potentials was 25% in the low load condition, similar to that in resting breathing (0%; p > 0.05). In contrast, voluntary sniffs were always associated with a higher incidence of premotor potentials (100%; p < 0.05). We have demonstrated that in contrast to respiratory and neurological disease, there is no significant cortical contribution to increase tidal volume or to maintain the load-capacity balance with a small inspiratory threshold load in healthy participants as detected using event-related potential methodology. A lack of cortical contribution during loading was associated with low ratings of respiratory discomfort and minimal changes in ventilation. These findings advance our understanding of the neural control of breathing in health and disease and how respiratory-related EEG may be used for medical technologies such as brain-computer interfaces.

J	Gheza, D; Paul, K; Pourtois, G				Gheza, Davide; Paul, Katharina; Pourtois, Gilles			Dissociable effects of reward and expectancy during evaluative feedback processing revealed by topographic ERP mapping analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Performance monitoring; Reward processing; ERN; Reward positivity; ACC; PCC	GANGLIA DIFFERENTIATES REWARDS; PREDICTION ERROR; POTENTIAL ACTIVITY; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; BRAIN; THETA; NEGATIVITY; POSITIVITY; COMPONENT; DOPAMINE	Evaluative feedback provided during performance monitoring (PM) elicits either a positive or negative deflection similar to 250-300 ms after its onset in the event-related potential (ERP) depending on whether the outcome is reward-related or not, as well as expected or not. However, it remains currently unclear whether these two deflections reflect a unitary process, or rather dissociable effects arising from non-overlapping brain networks. To address this question, we recorded 64-channel EEG in healthy adult participants performing a standard gambling task where valence and expectancy were manipulated in a factorial design. We analyzed the feedback locked ERP data using a conventional ERP analysis, as well as an advanced topographic ERP mapping analysis supplemented with distributed source localization. Results reveal two main topographies showing opposing valence effects, and being differently modulated by expectancy. The first one was short-lived and sensitive to no reward irrespective of expectancy. Source-estimation associated with this topographic map comprised mainly regions of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. The second one was primarily driven by reward, had a prolonged time-course and was monotonically influenced by expectancy. Moreover, this reward-related topographical map was best accounted for by intracranial generators estimated in the posterior cingulate cortex. These new findings suggest the existence of dissociable brain systems depending on feedback valence and expectancy. More generally, they inform about the added value of using topographic ERP mapping methods, besides conventional ERP measurements, to characterize qualitative changes occurring in the spatio-temporal dynamic of reward processing during PM.

This BCI-VR system prototype was functionally tested on multiple participants and demonstrated live before an audience during the 2017 'Hack the Brain' at the Dublin Science Gallery. The availability of a low cost, effective, BCI-VR solution targeted at researchers and developers, which is capable of analysing a subject's BCI performance and presenting neurofeedback VR to a level acceptable for academic and industry experimentation, has the potential to open up this field to much wider range of researchers and could help increase the functional outcomes for stroke rehabilitation.

In this article we suggest that this construction includes imagined rules and constraints that if violated may affect the subjects' suspension of disbelief. In this direction, we examine whether the cognitive processing of people experiencing interactive narratives varies based on whether the outcomes of their actions are perceived to be predictable and plausible, according to the narrative context. In order to explore this hypothesis, we devised an event-related-potential experiment and created a video game featuring a number of player-instigated narrative events within three different categories: (a) predictable-plausible, (b) unpredictable-plausible, and (c) unpredictable-implausible. Based on the analysis of the N400 and P600 ERP components, our results show that there is a significant detectable difference between the three categories. Additionally, the results strongly indicate that experiencers of interactive narratives do indeed create storyworlds' rules and constraints in their minds, and that the imagined rules of these worlds can be felt to be broken by implausible events.

This involuntary cognitive process is considered as attentional bias (AB). AB has been hypothesized to have causal effects on drug abuse and drug relapse, but its underlying neural mechanisms are still unclear. This study investigated the neural basis of AB in abstinent heroin addicts (AHAs), combining event-related potential (ERP) analysis and source localization techniques. Electroencephalography data were collected in 21 abstinent heroin addicts and 24 age-and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) during a dot-probe task. In the task, a pair of drug-related image and neutral image was presented randomly in left and right side of the cross fixation, followed by a dot probe replacing one of the images. Behaviorally, AHAs had shorter reaction times (RTs) for the congruent condition compared to the incongruent condition, whereas this was not the case in the HCs. This finding demonstrated the presence of AB towards drug cues in AHAs. Furthermore, the image-evoked ERPs in AHAs had significant shorter P1 latency compared to HCs, as well as larger N1, N2, and P2 amplitude, suggesting that drug-related stimuli might capture attention early and overall require more attentional resources in AHAs. The target-related P3 had significantly shorter latency and lower amplitude in the congruent than incongruent condition in AHAs compared to HCs. Moreover, source localization of ERP components revealed increased activity for AHAs as compared to HCs in the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (dPCC), superior parietal lobule and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) for image-elicited responses, and decreased activity in the occipital and the medial parietal lobes for target-elicited responses. Overall, the results of our study confirmed that AHAs may exhibit AB in drug-related contexts, and suggested that the bias might be related to an abnormal neural activity, both in early and late attention processing stages.

Avoiding sedentary behaviors requires more cortical resources than avoiding physical activity: An EEG study	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Automatic behaviors; Electroencephalography; ERP; Exercise; LRP; Physical activity	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; APPROACH TENDENCIES; ATTENTIONAL BIAS; CURRENT-DENSITY; REACTION-TIME; EXERCISE; IMPLICIT; MODEL; ASSOCIATIONS; METAANALYSIS	Why do individuals fail to exercise regularly despite knowledge of the risks associated with physical inactivity? Automatic processes regulating exercise behaviors may partly explain this paradox. Yet, these processes have only been investigated with behavioral outcomes (i.e., based on reaction times). Here, using electro-encephalography, we investigated the cortical activity underlying automatic approach and avoidance tendencies toward stimuli depicting physical activity and sedentary behaviors in 29 young adults who were physically active or physically inactive but with the intention of becoming physically active. Behavioral results showed faster reactions when approaching physical activity compared to sedentary behaviors and when avoiding sedentary behaviors compared to physical activity. These faster reactions were more pronounced in physically active individuals and were associated with changes during sensory integration (earlier onset latency and larger positive deflection of the stimulus-locked lateralized readiness potentials) but not during motor preparation (no effect on the response-locked lateralized readiness potentials). Faster reactions when avoiding sedentary behaviors compared to physical activity were also associated with higher conflict monitoring (larger early and late NI event-related potentials) and higher inhibition (larger N2 event-related potentials), irrespective of the usual level of physical activity. These results suggest that additional cortical resources were required to counteract an attraction to sedentary behaviors. Data and Materials [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1169140].

Thus, early-onset (EO; age < 16 years old), relative to late-onset (LO; age >= 16 years old), tobacco smoking may be uniquely deleterious for developmentally immature systems that regulate neural signaling reactivity. This study investigated how age of tobacco smoking onset affects neurophysiological measures of smoking cue reactivity and reported craving in adult smokers. ED smokers (EOS; n = 8; 4 females), LO smokers (LOS; n =10; 5 females), and healthy non-smokers (HNS; n = 10; 5 females) participated in an event-related potential (ERP) cue reactivity study with tactile and image stimuli. Participants handled neutral objects during one interval and smoking-related objects during a second interval. After each interval, they viewed smoking-related, neutral, or arousing images using an oddball paradigm. P300 ERPs and craving for tobacco were recorded during each session. P300 amplitudes were significantly higher in central midline (Cz) channel to smoking, but not neutral or arousing, images after handling smoking objects. Specifically, Cz P300 smoking amplitudes were significantly greater in EOS, relative to LOS and HNS, and associated with greater craving at baseline. There were no other group differences in mood or craving. EOS exhibited greater P300 reactivity to smoking-related stimuli, relative to LOS, suggesting a more sensitized neural response. EO smoking during early neuromaturation may alter neurophysiological signaling involved in responding to smoking-related stimuli, which could impact the outcome of smoking cessation interventions.

Patients with a severe prolonged Disorder of Consciousness can show classical EEG responses to their own name compared with others' names	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article							VEGETATIVE STATE; COVERT COGNITION; BRAIN; MODULATION; AWARENESS	Patients in Vegetative State (VS), also known as Unresponsive Wakefulness State (UWS) are deemed to be unaware of themselves or their environment. This is different from patients diagnosed with Minimally Conscious state (MCS), who can have intermittent awareness. In both states, there is a severe impairment of consciousness; these disorders are referred to as disorders of consciousness (DOC) and if the state is prolonged, pDOC. There is growing evidence that some patients who are behaviourally in VS/UWS can show neural activation to environmental stimuli and that this response can be detected using functional brain imaging (fMRI/PET) and electroencephalography (EEG). Recently, it has also been suggested that a more reliable detection of brain responsiveness and hence a more reliable differentiation between VS/UWS and MCS requires person-centred and person-specific stimuli, such as the subject's own name stimulus. In this study we obtained event related potential data (ERP) from 12 healthy subjects and 16 patients in pDOC, five of whom were in the VS/UWS and 11 in the Minimally Conscious State (MCS). We used as the ERP stimuli the subjects' own name, others' names and reversed other names. We performed a sensor level analysis using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software. Using this paradigm in 4 DOC patients (3 in MCS, and 1 in VS/UWS) we detected a statistically significant difference in EEG response to their own name versus other peoples' names with ERP latencies (similar to 300 ms and similar to 700 ms post stimuli). Some of these differences were similar to those found in a control group of healthy subjects. This study shows the feasibility of using self-relevant stimuli such as a subject's own name for assessment of brain function in pDOC patients. This neurophysiological test is suitable for bed-side/hospital based assessment of pDOC patients. As it does not require sophisticated scanning equipment it can feasibly be used within a hospital or care setting to help professionals tailor medical and psycho-social management for patients.

The current study is the first aimed at investigating inhibitory control in a negative mood condition on a psychophysiological and behavioral level in BED with a combination of electroencephalography (EEG) and eye tracking (ET). MethodWe conducted a combined EEG and ET study with overweight individuals with BED (BED+, n=24, mean age=31, mean BMI=35 kg/m(2)) and without BED (BED-, n=23, mean age=28, mean BMI=35 kg/m(2)) and a normal-weight (NWC, n=26, mean age 28, mean BMI=22 kg/m(2)) control group. We assessed self-report data regarding impulsivity and emotion regulation as well as the processing of food stimuli under negative mood in an antisaccade task. Main outcome variables comprise event-related potentials (ERP) regarding conflict processing (N2) and performance monitoring (error-related negativity [ERN/Ne]) assessed by EEG and inhibitory control (errors in the first and second saccade) assessed by ET. ResultsBED+ patients reported increased impulsivity and higher emotion regulation difficulties compared with the other groups. The eye tracking data revealed impaired inhibitory control in BED+ compared with both control groups. Further, we found preliminary evidence from EEG recordings that conflict processing might be less thorough in the BED+ sample as well as in the NWC sample. In the BED+ sample this might be connected to the inhibitory control deficits on behavioral level. While the BED- sample showed increased conflict processing latencies (N2 latencies), which might indicate a compensation mechanism, the BED+ sample did not show such a mechanism. Performance monitoring (ERN/Ne latencies and amplitudes) was not impaired in the BED+ sample compared with both control samples. DiscussionParticipants with BED reported higher impulsivity and lower emotion regulation capacities. The combined investigation of electrocortical processes and behavior contributes to an advanced understanding of behavioral and electrocortical processes underlying inhibitory control in BED. Inhibitory control and negative mood, probably amplified by emotion regulation deficits, should be addressed further in the investigation and treatment of BED.

EEG Dynamics and Neural Generators in Implicit Navigational Image Processing in Adults with ADHD	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ADHD; EEG dynamics; ERP Generator; oddball paradigm	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; MEMORY; NETWORK; THETA; ADOLESCENTS; POTENTIALS	In contrast to childhood ADHD that is characterized by inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity, most adults with ADHD predominantly exhibit inattention. We used a new oddball paradigm using implicit navigational images and analyzed EEG dynamics with swLORETA inverse modeling of the evoked potential generators to study cortical processing in adults with ADHD and age-matched controls. In passive observation, we demonstrated that P350 amplitude, alpha-beta oscillation event-related synchronization (ERS) anticipation, and beta event-related desynchronization (ERD) were significantly smaller in ADHD. In the active condition, P100 duration was reduced and N140 amplitude increased for both deviant and frequent conditions in the ADHD. Alpha ERS and delta-theta ERS were reduced in the ADHD in the deviant condition. The left somatosensory area (BA2) and the right parietal lobe (BA31, BA40) contributed more to the P100 generators in the control than in the ADHD group, while the left frontal lobe (BA10) contributed more to the P100 generators in the ADHD. The left inferior parietal lobe (BA40) contributed more to the N140 generators in the control than the ADHD group while the right posterior cingulate (BA30) contributed more to the N140 generators in the ADHD. These findings reinforce the notion that earlier cortical stages of visual processing are compromised in adult ADHD by inducing the emergence of different even-related potential generators and EEG dynamics in ADHD. Considering that classical approaches for ADHD diagnosis are based on qualitative clinical investigation possibly biased by subjectivity, EEG analysis is another objective tool that might contribute to diagnosis, future neurofeedback or brain stimulation therapies.

During the last several decades, numerous studies have developed brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) with the goals ranging from providing means of communication to functional rehabilitation. Here we review the research on non-invasive, electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCI systems for communication and rehabilitation. We focus on the approaches intended to help severely paralyzed and locked-in patients regain communication using three different BCI modalities: slow cortical potentials, sensorimotor rhythms and P300 potentials, as operational mechanisms. We also review BCI systems for restoration of motor function in patients with spinal cord injury and chronic stroke. We discuss the advantages and limitations of these approaches and the challenges that need to be addressed in the future.

In humans, attention modulation is regulated by the frontal cortex, and is often reflected by changes in specific components of the event-related potential (ERP). Although brain networks for attention modulation have been widely studied in primates and avian species, little is known about attention modulation in amphibians. The present study aimed to investigate the attention modulation networks in an anuran species, the Emei music frog (Babina daunchina). Male music frogs produce advertisement calls from within underground nest burrows that modify the acoustic features of the calls, and both males and females prefer calls produced from inside burrows. We broadcast call stimuli to male and female music frogs while simultaneously recording electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from the telencephalon and mesencephalon. Granger causal connectivity analysis was used to elucidate functional brain networks within the time window of ERP components. The results show that calls produced from inside nests which are highly sexually attractive result in the strongest brain connections; both ascending and descending connections involving the left telencephalon were stronger in males while those in females were stronger with the right telencephalon. Our findings indicate that the frog brain allocates neural attention resources to highly attractive sounds within the window of early components of ERP, and that such processing is sexually dimorphic, presumably reflecting the different reproductive strategies of males and females.

This study aimed to investigate whether individuals with childhood trauma show altered frontal lobe activity during response inhibition tasks. Methods: In total, 157 healthy individuals were recruited and instructed to perform a Go/Nogo task during electroencephalography recording. Source activities of N2 and P3 of Nogo event-related potentials (ERP) were analyzed. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS) were applied. Individuals were divided into three groups based on their total CTQ score: low CTQ, middle CTQ, and high CTQ groups. Results: The high CTQ group exhibited significantly higher BIS scores than the low CTQ group. P3 amplitudes of the differences between Nogo and Go ERP waves exhibited higher mean values in the low CTQ than the high CTQ group, with trending effects. In Nogo-P3, the source activities of the right anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral medial frontal cortex (MFC), bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and right precentral gyrus were significantly lower in the high CTQ than the low CTQ group.

CARE-rCortex: A Matlab toolbox for the analysis of CArdio-REspiratory-related activity in the Cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; Cardio-respiratory event-related potentials; Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD); Event-Related Synchronization (ERS)	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; TOPOGRAPHY; POTENTIALS; DYNAMICS; HUMANS	Background: Although cardio-respiratory (CR) system is generally controlled by the autonomic nervous system, interactions between the cortex and these primary functions are receiving an increasing interest in neurosciences. New method: In general, the timing of such internally paced events (e.g. heartbeats or respiratory cycles) may display a large variability. For the analysis of such CR event-related EEG potentials, a baseline must be correctly associated to each cycle of detected events. The open-source toolbox CARE-rCortex provides an easy-to-use interface to detect CR events, define baselines, and analyse in time-frequency (TF) domain the CR-based EEG potentials. Results: CARE-rCortex provides some practical tools to detect and validate these CR events. Users can define baselines time-locked to a phase of respiratory or heart cycle. A statistical test has also been integrated to highlight significant points of the TF maps with respect to the baseline. We illustrate the use of CARE-rCortex with the analysis of two real cardio-respiratory datasets. Comparison with existing methods: Compared to other open-source toolboxes, CARE-rCortex allows users to automatically detect CR events, to define and check baselines for each detected event. Different baseline normalizations can be used in the TF analysis of EEG epochs. Conclusions: The analysis of CR-related EEG activities could provide valuable information about cognitive or pathological brain states. CARE-rCortex runs in Matlab as a plug-in of the EEGLAB software, and it is publicly available at https://github.com/FannyGrosselin/CARE-rCortex.

J	Lara, T; Molina, E; Madrid, JA; Correa, A				Lara, Tania; Molina, Enrique; Antonio Madrid, Juan; Correa, Angel			Electroencephalographic and skin temperature indices of vigilance and inhibitory control	PSICOLOGICA			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; ERP COMPONENTS; CIRCADIAN-RHYTHMS; TIME; SLEEP; PERFORMANCE; CHRONOTYPE; TASK; GO	Neurophysiological markers of the ability to sustain attention and exert inhibitory control of inappropriate responses have usually relied on neuroimaging methods, which are not easily applicable to real-world settings. The current research tested the ability of electroencephalographic and skin temperature markers to predict performance during the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART), which demands vigilance and inhibitory control. In Experiment 1, we recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) during the performance of SART and found that event-related potentials underlying inhibitory control (N1 and N2/P3) were influenced by a time on task effect, suggesting a decrement in attentional resources necessary for optimal inhibitory control. In Experiments 2 and 3, we recorded skin temperatures (distal, proximal and the distal-proximal temperature gradient -DPG) and found that they were sensitive to differential demands of mental workload, and that they were related to behavioural performance in the SART. This study suggests that the recording of EEG and skin temperature may be used to monitor fluctuations of attention in natural settings, although further research should clarify the exact psychological interpretation of these physiological indices.

J	Muzammel, M; Yusoff, MZ; Meriaudeau, F				Muzammel, Muhammad; Yusoff, Mohd Zuki; Meriaudeau, Fabrice			Event-Related Potential Responses of Motorcyclists Towards Rear End Collision Warning System	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						ERP components; motorcycle accidents; motorcyclist safety; physiological response; warning systems	ATTENTION; DRIVERS; IMPACT; EEG; COMPONENT; TACTILE; TASK; TIME; ERP	There are many types of collision warning systems to increase the safety of motorcyclists. These systems use different types of collision detection techniques with each one having some limitations, restricting the performance of the system. To find the effectiveness of collision warning system notifications, it is important to study the physiological response of drivers toward these systems. Existing studies are limited to the physiological response of car drivers and use only buzzer warnings for these systems. Unfortunately, no such work in that particular domain has been reported for motorcyclists. Since motorcycles have different maneuverability as compared with cars and other vehicles, it is important to investigate the response of motorcyclists toward these collision warning systems. Also, it is believed that providing verbal information about any potential hazard will further assist the motorcyclist to avoid it. The aim of this paper is to investigate the physiological responses of motorcyclists to the rear end collision warning system when auditory verbal warnings are utilized. To study the response of the motorcyclists, the N100, N200, P300, and N400 eventrelated potential components have been extracted from the recorded Electroencephalography data. It has been found that the rear end collision warning system with auditory verbal warnings significantly increases the alertness of the motorcyclist and can be helpful to avoid the possible rear-end collision scenarios. This system has shown positive effects at neural levels on motorcyclists and reduces their reaction time and attentional resources required for processing the target correctly.

Despite continuous improvements, it remains a challenging technique, and a standard methodology for data analysis is yet to be established. Here we review the methodologies that are currently available to address the challenges at each step of the data analysis pipeline. We start by surveying methods for preprocessing both EEG and fMRI data. On the EEG side, we focus on the correction for several MR-induced artifacts, particularly the gradient and pulse artifacts, as well as other sources of EEG artifacts. On the fMRI side, we consider image artifacts induced by the presence of EEG hardware inside the MR scanner, and the contamination of the fMRI signal by physiological noise of non-neuronal origin, including a review of several approaches to model and remove it. We then provide an overview of the approaches specifically employed for the integration of EEG and fMRI when using EEG to predict the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal, the so-called EEG-informed fMRI integration strategy, the most commonly used strategy in EEG-fMRI research. Finally, we systematically review methods used for the extraction of EEG features reflecting neuronal phenomena of interest.

The role of the N170 ERP	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Schizotypy; Cannabis; N170; Event-related potential; Cognition; Schizotypal personality	PSYCHOSIS-LIKE EXPERIENCES; FACIAL EMOTION MEMORY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; FACES; ASSOCIATION; PERSONALITY; ALCOHOL; ADOLESCENCE; DISORDERS; ATTENTION	Cannabis use is a known risk factor for the development of psychosis, although the precise nature of this relationship is unclear. The phenomenological experiences associated with cannabis use vary dramatically, and for some resemble certain features of psychosis. We hypothesized that individuals who report particularly unusual experiences associated with cannabis use would demonstrate similar electrophysiological patterns to those who score high on schizotypal personality traits. The Cannabis Experiences Questionnaire (CEQ) and the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) were used to measure these experiences and traits. A sample of 97 individuals were placed into one of three experimental or two control groups based on their questionnaire scores. These were the "High CEQ", "High SPQ", "High on Both", "Average Users" and "Control" (non-using) groups. Participants completed a visual face perception task. Electroencephalography was used to measure the neural response to the stimuli. The N170 event-related potential (ERP) was used to measure perceptual encoding of the stimulus. The experimental groups elicited significantly reduced N170 ERPs compared to the Control group. The Average User group did not significantly differ from the Control group, and approached significance with the High SPQ group. None of the high scoring groups significantly differed in N170 ERP response from each other. Replicating past research, the CEQ and SPQ scales moderately correlated with each other. The attenuated N170 ERP demonstrated by the high scoring experimental groups may reflect a manifestation of an underlying shared vulnerability. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Decoding of EEG Signals Using Deep Long Short-Term Memory Network in Face Recognition Task	2018 IEEE SYMPOSIUM SERIES ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (IEEE SSCI)			English	Proceedings Paper	8th IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI)	NOV 18-21, 2018	Bengaluru, INDIA	IEEE		Event Related Potential; N250; P600; Long Short Term Memory with attention; eLORETA	NEURAL-NETWORKS; BRAIN; FAMILIAR; CLASSIFICATION	The paper proposes a novel approach to classify the human memory response involved in the face recognition task by the utilization of event related potentials. Electroencephalographic signals are acquired when a subject engages himself/herself in familiar or unfamiliar face recognition tasks. The signals are analyzed through source localization using eLORETA and artifact removal by ICA from a set of channels corresponding to those selected sources, with an ultimate aim to classify the EEG responses of familiar and unfamiliar faces. The EEG responses of the two different classes (familiar and unfamiliar face recognition)are distinguished by analyzing the Event Related Potential signals that reveal the existence of large N250 and P600 signals during familiar face recognition. The paper introduces a novel LSTM classifier network which is designed to classify the ERP signals to fulfill the prime objective of this work. The first layer of the novel LSTM network evaluates the spatial and local temporal correlations between the obtained samples of local EEG time-windows. The second layer of this network models the temporal correlations between the timewindows. An attention mechanism has been introduced in each layer of the proposed model to compute the contribution of each EEG time-window in face recognition task. Performance analysis reveals that the proposed LSTM classifier with attention mechanism outperforms the efficiency of the conventional LSTM and other classifiers with a significantly large margin. Moreover, source localization using eLORETA shows the involvement of inferior temporal and frontal lobes during familiar face recognition and pre-frontal lobe during unfamiliar face recognition. Thus, the present research outcome can be used in criminal investigation, where meticulous differentiation of familiar and unfamiliar face detection by criminals can be performed from their acquired brain responses.

To this end, here, we record human electroencephalography (EEG) data associated with viewing face stimuli; then, we exploit spatiotemporal EEG information to determine the neural correlates of facial identity representations and to reconstruct the appearance of the corresponding stimuli. Our findings indicate that multiple temporal intervals support: facial identity classification, face space estimation, visual feature extraction and image reconstruction. In particular, we note that both classification and reconstruction accuracy peak in the proximity of the N170 component. Further, aggregate data from a larger interval (50-650 ms after stimulus onset) support robust reconstruction results, consistent with the availability of distinct visual information over time. Thus, theoretically, our findings shed light on the time course of face processing while, methodologically, they demonstrate the feasibility of EEG-based image reconstruction.

We used a three-stimulus visual oddball paradigm that comprised a small diamond standard stimulus (66.7%), a large diamond target stimulus (16.7%), and deviant word stimuli (16.7%) written in Kanji. Furthermore, half the deviant words were negative emotional words (e.g., destruction or scream) and the others half were neutral words (e.g., structure or range). Healthy participants (N = 26) were instructed to press a button after the target appeared while ignoring the other stimuli. EEG was recorded from Fz, Cz, and Pz sites and the average of EEG that time-locked to the onset of stimuli was calculated. Results indicated that the P3 amplitude for the target at Pz was the largest among the three sites, whereas the P3 amplitude for deviant words at Cz and Pz was larger than those at Fz. Furthermore, the P3 amplitudes for negative words increased in comparison to those for neutral words. These results suggest that increased amplitudes to word stimuli are regarded as deviant P3, and changes reflect passive attentional capture elicited by negative emotional information. Implications for using ERPs for estimating attentional bias to threat information are discussed.

Such automated navigation support, however, comes with a reduced processing of the surrounding environment and often with a decline of spatial orienting ability. To prevent such deskilling and to support spatial learning, the present study investigated incidental spatial learning by comparing standard navigation instructions with two modified navigation instruction conditions. The first modified instruction condition highlighted landmarks and provided additional redundant information regarding the landmark (contrast condition), while the second highlighted landmarks and included information of personal interest to the participant (personal-reference condition). Participants' spatial knowledge of the previously unknown virtual city was tested three weeks later. Behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) data demonstrated enhanced spatial memory performance for participants in the modified navigation instruction conditions without further differentiating between modified instructions. Recognition performance of landmarks was better and the late positive complex of the event-related potential (ERP) revealed amplitude differences reflecting an increased amount of recollected information for modified navigation instructions. The results indicate a significant long-term spatial learning effect when landmarks are highlighted during navigation instructions.

We performed a tDCS-EEG study in which we analyzed the effects of tDCS polarities (anode, cathode, sham) over the MPFC during a verbal irony task. We presented visual short stories portraying everyday situations followed by written statements in either an ironic or literal condition, whose meaning was referred to in the previous context. We manipulated the valence of the stimuli by presenting positive sentences or negative sentences in the ironic and literal conditions. The results revealed that the participants who received the anodal stimulation showed no differences in the N400 amplitude in response to the literal and the ironic condition. This could suggest that anodal stimulation has modulatory effects on N400 responses during irony comprehension. Our results indicated that the MPFC might be critical in accessing ironic information at the initial stage of irony comprehension. Finally, we found that the ironic compliments were more difficult to understand compared to the literal ones, suggesting that irony comprehension is affected by the valence of the information presented.

The current study aims to propose a non-invasive, cost-effective, early diagnostic protocol for individuals suffering with MCI in an outpatient setting. Elderly participants (n=11) were screened for MCI utilizing the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) questionnaire preceding a visual stimuli task. Participants were presented with facial stimuli to elicit event related potentials (ERP) while their cortical activity was recorded utilizing electroencephalogram (EEG). Combining regional neurophysiological biomarkers into a multidimensional feature space allowed for differentiation between healthy and MCI participants based on their respective MoCA scores. This study illustrates the feasibility of recording reliable EEG in an outpatient setting while presenting a novel method for diagnosing MCI in elderly (age >60) populations.	[White, A.

Since these deficits are predictive for patients functional outcome, understanding their origin is of great importance to improve their daily lives. A specific component of the deficit involves social decision-making, which can be studied using the Ultimatum Game (UG). In this task, a "proposer" proposes a share of money to a "responder", who can either accept or reject this offer. If the responder accepts the proposal, both win money. If the responder refuses, both players end up with nothing. Therefore, the UG evaluates decision-making strategies and social interaction. Methods: We compared the neuronal bases of schizophrenic patients with healthy controls, while performing the UG. Electroencephalography (EEG) was used to find differences in the event-related potential (ERP) components typical for the UG, namely the P2 and feedback-related negativity (FRN). Source reconstruction was further used to define the origin of these differences. Results: In the proposer condition, no differences were found in amplitude of the P2 and FRN components. In contrast, in the responder condition, significant differences were found for the amplitude of the FRN (p = 0.009). Using source reconstruction, a different activation in a border zone of the dorsolateral and the medial prefrontal cortex was revealed in schizophrenic patients to underlie this component. Conclusions: We suggest that the difference found in the FRN amplitude is associated with difficulties of patients in interpreting another's behavior. Although schizophrenic patients correctly activate neuronal bases in the proposer condition, they were not able to activate the same networks in the responder condition, thereby exposing their difficulties in social interaction.

We hypothesized that EEG patterns in healthy subjects with induced sensory reduction would be comparable to EEG found after chronic loss of sensory feedback. EEG signals from 64 scalp locations were measured from 10 healthy subjects. Participants dorsiflexed their ankle after prolonged vibration of the tibialis anterior (TA). Beta band time frequency decompositions were calculated using wavelets and compared across conditions. Changes in patterns of movement-related brain activity were observed following attenuation of sensory feedback. A significant decrease in beta power of eventrelated synchronization was associated with simple ankle dorsiflexion after prolonged vibration of the TA. Attenuation of sensory feedback in young, healthy subjects led to a corresponding decrease in beta band synchronization. This temporary change in beta oscillations suggests that these modulations are a mechanism for sensorimotor integration. The loss of sensory feedback found in spinal cord injury patients contributes to changes in EEG signals underlying motor commands. Similar alterations in cortical signals in healthy subjects with reduced sensory feedback implies these changes reflect normal sensorimotor integration after reduced sensory input rather than brain plasticity. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Transient attenuation of sensory afferents in young, healthy adults led to similar changes in brain activity found previously in volunteers with incomplete spinal cord injury. Beta band power associated with ankle movement in these controls was attenuated after prolonged vibration of the tibialis anterior. Evoked potential measurements suggest that prolonged vibration reduces phasing across trials as the mechanism behind this attenuation of cortical activity.

Frontal midline regions such as the cingulate cortex and pre-supplementary motor area are considered critical brain substrates of this deficit. Electrophysiological equivalent of the above dysfunction is a fronto-central event related potential (ERP) which occurs after an error called the error related negativity (ERN). In this study, we sought to compare the ERN parameters between medication-naive, comorbidity-free subjects with OCD and healthy controls (HC). Age, sex and handedness matched subjects with medication-naive, comorbidity-free OCD (N = 16) and Healthy Controls (N = 17) performed a modified version of the flanker task while EEG was acquired for ERN. EEG signals were recorded from the electrodes FCz and Cz. Clinical severity of OCD was assessed using the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. The subjects with OCD had significantly greater ERN amplitude at Cz and FCz. There were no significant correlations between ERN measures and illness severity measures. Overactive performance monitoring as evidenced by enhanced ERN amplitude could be considered as a biomarker for OCD.

More than 40 years of electroencephalography (EEG)-based research has culminated in the recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the theta/beta (EEG power) ratio (TBR) as a diagnostic marker of ADHD. Method: This review article focuses on resting-state EEG power research in ADHD. Results: Inconsistent findings in the literature and suggestions of reduced specificity threaten the utility of TBR as a biomarker of ADHD. The use of fixed EEG bands may be a significant limitation, particularly in youth, and alternative approaches are needed. Conclusion: We propose that a personalized theta-to-alpha cut point or transition frequency is a better frame of reference for the measurement of TBR. Such an approach is better placed to test maturational lag and cortical hypoarousal models of ADHD and may in turn have greater utility in supporting diagnosis.

Here we investigated the relevance of low spatial frequency (LSF) and high spatial frequency (HSF) in facial cues for direct gaze processing. We identified two distinct peaks in the ERP response, the N170 and N240 components. These two components were related to different stimulus conditions and influenced by different spatial frequencies. In particular, larger N170 and N240 amplitudes were observed for direct gaze than for averted gaze, but only in the N240 component was this effect modulated by spatial frequency, where it was reliant in LSF information. By contrast, larger N170 and N240 components were observed for faces than for non-facial stimuli, but this effect was only modulated by spatial frequency in the N170 component, where it relied on HSF information. The present study highlights the existence of two functionally distinct components related to direct gaze processing.

J	Li, HY; Jia, HB; Yu, DC				Li, Huayun; Jia, Huibin; Yu, Dongchuan			The influence of vertical disparity gradient and cue conflict on EEG omega complexity in Panum's limiting case	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						cue conflict; global functional connectivity; omega complexity; Panum's limiting case; vertical disparity gradient	SPATIAL COMPLEXITY; MULTICHANNEL EEG; DOUBLE FUSION; BRAIN; PERCEPTION; DEPTH; TASK; PERFORMANCE; CAMOUFLAGE; STEREOPSIS	Using behavioral measures and ERP technique, researchers discovered at least two factors could influence the final perception of depth in Panum's limiting case, which are the vertical disparity gradient and the degree of cue conflict between two-and three-dimensional shapes. Although certain event-related potential components have been proved to be sensitive to the different levels of these two factors, some methodological limitations existed in this technique. In this study, we proposed that the omega complexity of EEG signal may serve as an important supplement of the traditional event-related potential technique. We found that the trials with lower vertical gradient disparity have lower omega complexity (i.e., higher global functional connectivity) of the occipital region, especially that of the right-occipital hemisphere. Moreover, for occipital omega complexity, the trials with low-cue conflict have significantly larger omega complexity than those with medium-and high-cue conflict. It is also found that the electrodes located in the middle line of the occipital region (i.e., POz and Oz) are more crucial to the impact of different levels of cue conflict on omega complexity than the other electrodes located in the left-and right-occipital hemispheres. These evidences demonstrated that the EEG omega complexity could reflect distinct neural activities evoked by Panum's limiting case configurations, with different levels of vertical disparity gradient and cue conflict. Besides, the influence of vertical disparity gradient and cue conflict on omega complexity may be regional dependent. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The EEG omega complexity could reflect distinct neural activities evoked by Panum's limiting case configurations with different levels of vertical disparity gradient and cue conflict. The influence of vertical disparity gradient and cue conflict on omega complexity is regional dependent. The omega complexity of EEG signal can serve as an important supplement of the traditional ERP technique.

J	Chung, K; Lee, D; Park, JY				Chung, Kyungmi; Lee, Daeho; Park, Jin Young			Involuntary Attention Restoration During Exposure to Mobile-Based 360 degrees Virtual Nature in Healthy Adults With Different Levels of Restorative Experience: Event-Related Potential Study	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						smartphone; virtual reality; attention; surveys and questionnaires; electroencephalography; evoked potentials	MISMATCH-NEGATIVITY; MEDITATION; ERP; BENEFITS; STRESS; P3A; ENVIRONMENTS; REACTIVITY; CHILDREN; RECOVERY	Background: With the global trend of urbanization, there are increasing reports of a possible association between decreased exposure to nature and increased occurrence of mental disorders. New 360 degrees virtual reality (VR) technology using smartphones and portable VR glasses can overcome spatial and temporal limitations to help people deal with mental fatigue in everyday life. Objective: On the basis of attention restoration theory (ART), this study aimed to investigate whether the amplitude of the mismatch negativity (MMN)/P3a complex could act as an event-related potential (ERP) biomarker of involuntary attention restoration during exposure to 360 degrees virtual nature in healthy young adults with different levels of restorative VR experience. Methods: A total of 40 healthy adults completed prequestionnaires on demographics and simulator sickness and postquestionnaires on simulator sickness and perceived restorativeness before and after exposure to virtual nature, respectively. During the VR exposure, brain activity was measured by electroencephalography as participants were asked to conduct a 2-tone passive auditory oddball task. Results: The amplitude and latency of the MMN/P3a complex were compared between individuals reporting a highly restorative experience and those reporting a less restorative experience. Although viewing a virtual nature environment, the high restorative group (N=19) exhibited significantly reduced P3a amplitudes compared with the low restorative group (N=20; t(38)=2.57; P=.02; d=0.59). Particularly, a moderate but significant negative correlation was found between the self-reported restorativeness scores and the P3a amplitudes at the fronto-central region (r=-.38; P=.02). However, the latency of the MMN/P3a complex did not significantly differ between the 2 groups (auditory mismatch negativity: t(38)=-1.47; P=.15 and P3a: t(38)=-0.31; P=.76). Conclusions: Considering individuals' restorative experience, the amplitude of the fronto-central MMN/P3a complex can potentially be employed as a distinct ERP component of interest in involuntary attention restoration during virtual nature experience in healthy young adults. The findings for the 360 degrees virtual nature experience seem to be consistent with those of previous ERP studies on the effects of meditation practice. This study extends the findings of previous ART and ERP studies of real-world meditation, restoration, and mental fatigue management into the virtual world created by mobile phone-based VR glasses and 360 degrees video content.

However, it is unclear whether infant temperament affects parents' neural responses to infant stimuli. 85 infants (6-12 months) were filmed in distress-eliciting tasks, which were coded for infants' negative affect. Mothers' reported infant affect was obtained from the Infant Behavior Questionnaire Very Short Form-Revised. Mothers' EEG activity was recorded while passively viewing photos of own, familiarized, and unfamiliar infants. Multiple regression indicated that mothers who reported greater infant negative affect showed a smaller difference in the late positive potential (LPP) response to own infant versus familiarized infant, controlling for researcher-coded infant negative affect. The findings suggest that parents' perceptions of their infant's temperament, but not independent measures of infant temperament, are related to electrocortical indices of emotional attention.

EEG is an acquisition technique of brain signal from brain scalp using electrodes. The main task here is to classify the EEG data into innocent and guilty. Data acquisition of 10 subjects has been carried out. The signal preprocessing is performed by passing the raw EEG signals through a band-pass filter. From these preprocessed EEG signals, it is necessary to extract significant features. In the time domain, the extraction of the statistical parameters such as mobility, activity and complexity is done from the EEG signals. The binary classification of the guilty and innocent classes in performed using k-nearest neighbor classifier. In order to validate the deceit identification system, 5-fold cross validation has been applied on the each of the subjects. To validate the performance of the classifier, performance measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are taken into consideration. Out of three Hjorth parameters, mobility yielded better classification accuracy of up to 96.7%. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Recently, the brain-computer interface (BCI) contributes greatly to the smart home system. We design a BCI-based smart home system, in which the event-related potentials (ERP) are induced by the image interface based on the oddball paradigm. Then, we investigate the influence of mental fatigue on the ERP classification by the Fisher linear discriminant analysis. The results indicate that the classification accuracy of ERP decreases as the brain evolves from the normal stage to the mental fatigue stage. In order to probe into the difference of the brain, cognitive process between mental fatigue and normal states, we construct multivariate weighted recurrence networks and analyze the variation of the weighted clustering coefficient and weighted global efficiency corresponding to these two brain states. The findings suggest that these two network metrics allow distinguishing normal and mental fatigue states and yield novel insights into the brain fatigue behavior resulting from a long use of the ERP-based smart home system. These properties render the multivariate recurrence network, particularly useful for analyzing electroencephalographic recordings from the ERP-based smart home system. Published by AIP Publishing.

The present study used concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in order to investigate the 'when' and 'where' of earliest prioritization of emotional over neutral expressions. We measured event-related potentials (ERPs) and blood oxygen dependent (BOLD) signal changes in response to facial expressions of varying emotional intensity and different valence categories. Facial expressions were presented superimposed by two horizontal bars and participants engaged in a focal bars task (low load, high load), in order to manipulate the availability of attentional resources during face perception. EEG data revealed the earliest expression effects in the P1 range (76-128 ms) as a parametric function of stimulus arousal independent of load conditions. Conventional fMRI data analysis also demonstrated significant modulations as a function of stimulus arousal, independent of load, in amygdala, superior temporal sulcus, fusiform gyrus and lateral occipital cortex. Correspondingly, EEG-informed fMRI analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between single-trial P1 amplitudes and BOLD responses in amygdala and lateral posterior occipital cortex. Our results are in line with the hypothesis of the amygdala as fast responding relevance detector and corresponding effects in early visual face processing areas across facial expressions and load conditions.

According to behavioural measures, we are biased to consider valid the conclusion of an argument based on the veracity of the conclusion itself rather than on the formal logic of the argument. Nowadays, brain imaging techniques can be used to explore peoples responses as they reason with linguistic materials. Using the Event-Related Potential technique in a categorical syllogism reading task, an N400 enhancement was found for the processing of invalid conclusions preceded by true premises (e.g. All men are mortal). By contrast, when initial premises consisted of socially prejudiced statements previously rated as false (e.g. All blond girls are dumb), valid rather than invalid conclusions enhanced the N400 response. Considering what the modulation of N400 indexes (i.e. word anticipation processes), our data suggests that people cannot follow the logic of an argument to anticipate upcoming words if they clash with veracity.

Recent work using time frequency measures has proved promising in understanding the neurophysiology behind auditory change detection. These measures, unfortunately, have not been fully studied in children. Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe the spectro-temporal characteristics of the MMN response using words in healthy Mexicans preschool children. Method: 20 children (10 boys and 10 girls) of preschool age participated a neuropsychological evaluation and an auditory discrimination task during EEG recording. Event Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP) and Inter-Trial Coherence (ITC) was obtained for frequent and infrequent trials. Results: The ERP showed a typical MMN and LDN response. ERSP increases in the theta band corresponded to the auditory change detection, though no differences between boys and girls was found. Conclusions: In Mexican preschool children, the MMN is like what has been previously reported in adults. However, in contrast to similar studies, sex did not influence the neurophysiological measures. Significance: We established parameters for future research in children using the MMN.

Neural plasticity is modified over the human menstrual cycle: Combined insight from sensory evoked potential LTP and repetition suppression	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article						Long-term potentiation; Mismatch negativity; EEG; Predictive coding; Hebbian learning; Female	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; BAYESIAN MODEL SELECTION; SEX HORMONAL MODULATION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; VISUAL-CORTEX; ESTROUS-CYCLE; FREE-ENERGY; BRAIN; RESPONSES	In healthy women, fluctuations in hormones including progesterone and oestradiol lead to functional changes in the brain over the course of each menstrual cycle. Though considerable attention has been directed towards understanding changes in human cognition over the menstrual cycle, changes in underlying processes such as neural plasticity have largely only been studied in animals. In this study we explored predictive coding and repetition suppression via the roving mismatch negativity paradigm as a model of short-term plasticity (Garrido, Kilner, Kiebel, et al., 2009), and Hebbian learning via visual sensory long-term potentiation (LTP) as a model of long-term plasticity (Teyler et al., 2005). Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded in 20 females during their early follicular and mid-luteal phases. Event-related potential (ERP) analyses were complemented with dynamic causal modelling (DCM) to characterise changes in the underlying neural architecture. More sustained variability in the ERP response to a change in tone during the luteal phase are interpreted as a delayed habituation of the P3a component in the luteal relative to the follicular phase. The additional increased forward connection strength over tone repetitions compared to the follicular phase suggests that, in this phase, females may be less efficient when processing deviations from predicted sensory input (error). In contrast, there appears to be no reliable change in sensory LTP. This suggests that predictive coding, but not Hebbian plasticity is modified in the mid-luteal compared to the follicular phase, at least at the days of the menstrual cycle tested. This finding implicates the human menstrual cycle in complex changes in neural plasticity and provides further evidence for the importance of considering the menstrual cycle when including females in electrophysiological research.

In everyday life, it is frequently associated with concentration problems. The present study used visual event-related potentials ( ERPs) in a Posner-type spatial cueing task with valid, invalid and spatially neutral cues to delineate the potential neurophysiological correlates of these concentration problems. Altered attentional functioning at early, sensory stages was found in DP patients but not in anxiety-and depression-matched psychosomatic patients without DP. Specifically, DP was associated with decreased suppression of stimuli at unattended locations, shown as absent processing costs for invalidly versus neutrally cued stimuli over P1 (135-150 ms). Attentional benefits at N1, and all attentional effects at later, cognitive processing stages (P2-N2, P3) were similar in both groups. We propose that this insufficient early suppression of unattended stimuli may result from atypical sensory gain control in DP.

In order to facilitate development of error-tailored Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) correction systems, we focused on internal, human-initiated errors, and investigated EEG correlates of user outcome successes and errors during a continuous 3D virtual tennis game against a computer player. We used a multisensory, 3D, highly immersive environment. Missing and repelling the tennis ball were considered, as 'error' (miss) and 'success' (repel). Unlike most previous studies, where the environment "encouraged" the participant to perform a mistake, here errors happened naturally, resulting from motor-perceptual-cognitive processes of incorrect estimation of the ball kinematics, and can be regarded as user internal, self-initiated errors. Results show distinct and well-defined Event-Related Potentials (ERPs), embedded in the ongoing EEG, that differ across conditions by waveforms, scalp signal distribution maps, source estimation results (sLORETA) and time-frequency patterns, establishing a series of typical features that allow valid discrimination between user internal outcome success and error. The significant delay in latency between positive peaks of error- and success-related ERPs, suggests a cross-talk between top-down and bottom-up processing, represented by an outcome recognition process, in the context of the game world. Success-related ERPs had a central scalp distribution, while error-related ERPs were centro-parietal. The unique characteristics and sharp differences between EEG correlates of error/success provide the crucial components for an improved BCI system. The features of the EEG waveform can be used to detect user action outcome, to be fed into the BCI correction system. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Neurofeedback. (C) 2016 IBRO.

J	Huang, YL; Xie, JS; Wang, RM				Huang, Yanli; Xie, Jiushu; Wang, Ruiming			Electroencephalography delta, theta, and alpha oscillations in valence-space metaphorical associations	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						affective words; conceptual metaphor theory; electroencephalography; embodied cognition; event-related desynchronization; event-related synchronization; oscillations; valence-space associations	EEG; ATTENTION; SYNCHRONIZATION; LATERALIZATION; PERFORMANCE; DYNAMICS	Conceptual metaphor theory holds that understanding abstract affective words relies on concrete spatial information, known as valence-space metaphorical associations. Previous studies show that these metaphorical associations are related to several event-related potentials. However, we know nothing about the neural oscillations underlying these associations. The present study adopted a priming paradigm and the electroencephalographic time-frequency analysis to reveal the brain oscillatory activities related to the processing of valence-space associations. In the experiment, participants first memorized a positive or a negative word. Then, a dot was presented at the higher or lower position of the screen and was horizontally centered. Participants detected the location of the cue and made behavioral responses while their brain electrical activities were recorded. Results found that (a) when participants memorized a negative word and judged the lower spatial cue, the power of the delta band was suppressed compared with memorizing a positive word; (b) when participants memorized a positive word and judged the higher spatial cue, the power of the theta band was suppressed compared with memorizing a negative word; (c) when participants memorized a negative word and judged the lower spatial cue, the power of the alpha band was suppressed compared with memorizing a positive word. These event-related desynchronization results suggest that the processing of valence-space associations is related to inhibition, attention, working memory, and semantic process. The present study provides the first evidence of cortical oscillations involved in conceptual metaphors.

For a meaningful interpretation of brain dynamics underlying more natural cognitive processing in active humans, ecologically valid test scenarios are essential. To understand whether brain dynamics in restricted artificial lab settings reflect the neural activity in complex natural environments, we systematically tested the auditory event-related P300 in both settings. We developed an integrative approach comprising an initial P300-study in a highly controlled laboratory set-up and a subsequent validation within a realistic driving scenario. Using a simulated dialog with a speech-based input system, increased P300 amplitudes reflected processing of infrequent and incorrect auditory feedback events in both the laboratory setting and the real world setup. Environmental noise and movement-related activity in the car driving scenario led to higher data rejection rates but revealed comparable theta and alpha frequency band pattern. Our results demonstrate the possibility to investigate cognitive functions like context updating in highly artifact prone driving scenarios and encourage the consideration of more realistic task settings in prospective brain imaging approaches.

Congenital amusia - a neurodevelopmental disorder that primarily affects music perception, including musical syntax - provides a special opportunity to understand the nature of this overlap. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we investigated whether individuals with congenital amusia have parallel deficits in processing language syntax in comparison to control participants. Twelve amusic participants (eight females) and 12 control participants (eight females) were presented melodies in one session, and spoken sentences in another session, both of which had syntactic-congruent and - incongruent stimuli. They were asked to complete a music-related and a language-related task that were irrelevant to the syntactic incongruities. Our results show that amusic participants exhibit impairments in the early stages of both music-and language-syntactic processing. Specifically, we found that two event-related potential (ERP) components - namely Early Right Anterior Negativity (ERAN) and Left Anterior Negativity (LAN), associated with music-and language-syntactic processing respectively, were absent in the amusia group. However, at later processing stages, amusics showed similar brain responses as controls to syntactic incongruities in both music and language. This was reflected in a normal N5 in response to melodies and a normal P600 to spoken sentences. Notably, amusics' parallel music-and language-syntactic impairments were not accompanied by deficits in semantic processing (indexed by normal N400 in response to semantic incongruities). Together, our findings provide further evidence for shared music and language syntactic processing, particularly at early stages of processing.

The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of ear-EEGs for development of an endogenous BCI system that uses self-modulated brain activity. We performed preliminary and main experiments where EEGs were measured on the scalp and behind the ears to check the reliability of ear-EEGs as compared to scalp-EEGs. In the preliminary and main experiments, subjects performed eyes-open and eyes-closed tasks, and they performed mental arithmetic (MA) and light cognitive (LC) tasks, respectively. For data analysis, the brain area was divided into four regions of interest (ROIs) (i.e., frontal, central, occipital, and ear area). The preliminary experiment showed that the degree of alpha activity increase of the ear area with eyes closed is comparable to those of other ROIs (occipital > ear > central > frontal). In the main experiment, similar event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) patterns were observed between the four ROIs during MA and LC, and all ROIs showed the mean classification accuracies above 70% required for effective binary communication (MA vs. LC) (occipital = ear = central = frontal). From the results, we demonstrated that ear-EEG can be used to develop an endogenous BCI system based on cognitive tasks without external stimuli, which allows the usability of ear-EEGs to be extended.

However, seemingly contradictory effects of AVP have been found in both animal and human studies, e.g., promoting aggression on one hand and facilitating social bonding on the other hand. Therefore, we hypothesize that the role of AVP in social behaviors is context-dependent. To this end, we examined the modulatory effect of AVP on male's behavioral and neural responses to infant and adult cues. After intranasal and double-blind treatment of AVP or placebo, male participants were asked to rate their subjective approaching willingness to infant and adult faces in specific contexts informed by cue words while EEG recording. Our results showed that AVP treatment increased approaching ratings to neutral and positive other-gender adult faces compared to emotional matched same-gender adult faces, and to negative girl faces compared to negative boy faces. Furthermore, compared to placebo treatment, AVP treatment induced larger N1 amplitudes to neutral cues associated with both adults and infants, whereas AVP treatment only sustained pronounced late positive potential amplitudes to neutral cues of infants but not adults. Those findings implicate differential roles of AVP in the processing of adult-and infant-related cues and thus lend support to the context-dependent account.

Therefore, it is crucially important to improve early and differential diagnosis of the disease. Event-related potentials (ERP) measured non-invasively by electroencephalography have shown diagnostic potential in AD. Aims: The aim of this study was to compare the efficiency of P300 and N200 potentials and reaction time (RT) with commonly used protein biomarkers measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), including amyloid beta peptide (A beta(1)(-4)(2)), total tau (t-tau), tau protein phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau(181)), tau protein phosphorylated at serine 199 (p-tau(199)), tau protein phosphorylated at threonine 231 (p-tau(231)), and visinin-like protein 1 (VILIP-1) in differential diagnosis of AD in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients. Subjects: The study involved 49 AD patients, 28 patients with MCI, 4 healthy control subjects and 16 patients with other primary causes of dementia. Results: ERP (P300RT, N200RT, P300 counting and N200 counting) showed a moderate to strong correlation with protein CSF biomarkers. We confirmed previous observations of moderate to strong correlation between ERP and neuropsychological testing and showed that P300 latency and RT are shortened in AD patients on therapy with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Using ERP and RT, a predictive model for determination of AD likelihood in MCI patients was developed, detecting 56.3% of MCI patients with high risk for development of AD in our cohort. MCI patients with pathological levels of A beta(1)(-4)(2) had prolonged P300 latency, indicating that a combination of ERP and CSF protein biomarkers could improve the differential diagnosis of AD in MCI patients. Additionally, the results suggested the potential of P300 latency in differentiating AD and FTD patients. Conclusion: Our data provide possible solutions for improvement of differential diagnosis of AD, and reveal that the diagnostic efficiency of CSF protein biomarkers t-tau, p-tau(18)(1), p-tau(199) , p-tau(231) and VILIP-1 could be improved by adding ERP in clinical practice.

Given its excellent temporal resolution, the event-related potential (ERP) technology has been used to address this issue. The feedback-related negativity (FRN) component of ERPs has been studied intensively with the averaged linked mastoid reference method (LM). However, it is unknown whether FRN can be induced by an expectancy violation in an antonym relations context and whether LM is the most suitable reference approach. To address these issues, the current research directly compared the ERP components induced by expectancy violations in antonym expectation and gambling tasks with a within-subjects design and investigated the effect of the reference approach on the experimental effects. Specifically, we systematically compared the influence of the LM, reference electrode standardization technique (REST) and average reference (AVE) approaches on the amplitude, scalp distribution and magnitude of ERP effects as a function of expectancy violation type. The expectancy deviation in the antonym expectation task elicited an N400 effect that differed from the FRN effect induced in the gambling task; this difference was confirmed by all the three reference methods. Both the amplitudes of the ERP effects (N400 and FRN) and the magnitude as the expectancy violation increased were greater under the LM approach than those under the REST approach, followed by those under the AVE approach. Based on the statistical results, the electrode sites that showed the N400 and FRN effects critically depended on the reference method, and the results of the REST analysis were consistent with previous ERP studies. Combined with evidence from simulation studies, we suggest that REST is an optional reference method to be used in future ERP data analysis.

While supported by much circumstantial evidence, experimental tests grounded in formal trial-by-trial predictions are rare. One partial exception is event-related potential (ERP) studies of the auditory mismatch negativity (MMN), where computational models have found signatures of pwPEs and related model-updating processes. Here, we tested this hypothesis in the visual domain, examining possible links between visual mismatch responses and pwPEs. We used a novel visual "roving standard" paradigm to elicit mismatch responses in humans (of both sexes) by unexpected changes in either color or emotional expression of faces. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model, we simulated pwPE trajectories of a Bayes-optimal observer and used these to conduct a comprehensive trial-by-trial analysis across the time X sensor space. We found significant modulation of brain activity by both color and emotion pwPEs. The scalp distribution and timing of these single-trial pwPE responses were in agreement with visual mismatch responses obtained by traditional averaging and subtraction (deviant-minus-standard) approaches. Finally, we compared the Bayesian model to a more classical change model of MMN. Model comparison revealed that trial-wise pwPEs explained the observed mismatch responses better than categorical change detection. Our results suggest that visual mismatch responses reflect trial-wise pwPEs, as postulated by PC. These findings go beyond classical ERP analyses of visual mismatch and illustrate the utility of computational analyses for studying automatic perceptual processes.

In adults, initial expertise for a novel script can emerge in less than 2 hours through repeated exposure or training. Here, we aimed to assess changes in the visual N1 related to the process of learning associations between unknown written characters and familiar, spoken syllables or words. Thirty-two healthy literate adults learned to associate a set of foreign characters with either syllables or German words within a single experimental session. EEG was recorded during a visual one-back character repetition detection task in which trained characters, untrained characters and familiar letters were presented before and after the training. A bilateral occipito-temporal increase in the N1 negativity with training was only found for the newly learned characters, but not for the control characters. In conclusion, the present data indicate that expertise to novel characters can be induced by a short character-sound association training and is reflected by a bilateral modulation of the visual N1 amplitude. However, no differentiation was found regarding the comparison of word or syllable training, indicating that the visual N1 most likely reflects gaining expertise driven by phonological associations common to both training types.

Multimodal characterization of the semantic N400 response within a rapid evaluation brain vital sign framework	JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE			English	Article						N400; ERP; MEG; Semantic language; Clinical application	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; LEXICAL DECISION; MEG-DATA; WORD; CONSCIOUSNESS; DISORDERS; SENTENCES; EEG	Background: For nearly four decades, the N400 has been an important brainwave marker of semantic processing. It can be recorded non-invasively from the scalp using electrical and/or magnetic sensors, but largely within the restricted domain of research laboratories specialized to run specific N400 experiments. However, there is increasing evidence of significant clinical utility for the N400 in neurological evaluation, particularly at the individual level. To enable clinical applications, we recently reported a rapid evaluation framework known as"brain vital signs"that successfully incorporated the N400 response as one of the core components for cognitive function evaluation. The current study characterized the rapidly evoked N400 response to demonstrate that it shares consistent features with traditional N400 responses acquired in research laboratory settings-thereby enabling its translation into brain vital signs applications. Methods: Data were collected from 17 healthy individuals using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG), with analysis of sensor-level effects as well as evaluation of brain sources. Individual-level N400 responses were classified using machine learning to determine the percentage of participants in whom the response was successfully detected. Results: The N400 response was observed in both M/EEG modalities showing significant differences to incongruent versus congruent condition in the expected time range (p <0.05). Also as expected, N400-related brain activity was observed in the temporal and inferior frontal cortical regions, with typical left-hemispheric asymmetry. Classification robustly confirmed the N400 effect at the individual level with high accuracy (89%), sensitivity (0.88) and specificity (0.90). Conclusion: The brain vital sign N400 characteristics were highly consistent with features of the previously reported N400 responses acquired using traditional laboratory-based experiments.

Our study investigates whether pragmatic and hedonic qualities can be distinguished using two types of implicit measure: behavioural and neurophysiological. Participants interacted with two different software tools designed to emphasize hedonic and pragmatic qualities, respectively. Their implicit evaluations of the two prototypes were examined with the Approach Avoidance Task (AAT) and simultaneous electroencephalographic recordings (EEG), using snapshots from the interaction scenarios. While the AAT showed no differences, the analysis of event-related EEG potentials revealed differences around 300 ms after stimulus presentation. Significant higher cortical activity in the frontal cortex was found for approach tendencies towards snapshots taken from the hedonic prototype interaction. Higher potentials in the parietal (motor) cortex were found for avoidance tendencies towards the pragmatic prototype. The findings show that hedonic and pragmatic user experience qualities can be distinguished based on neuroelectrical data.

Temporal dissociation of salience and prediction error responses to appetitive and aversive taste	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						affect; conditioning; EEG; error processing	FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DOPAMINE NEURONS; REWARD; MODEL; REPRESENTATION; METAANALYSIS; SENSITIVITY; HYPOTHESIS; DIFFERENCE	The feedback-related negativity (FRN), a frontocentral ERP occurring 200-350 ms after emotionally valued outcomes, has been posited as the neural correlate of reward prediction error, a key component of associative learning. Recent evidence challenged this interpretation and has led to the suggestion that this ERP expresses salience instead. Here, we distinguish between utility prediction error and salience by delivering or withholding hedonistically matched appetitive and aversive tastes, and measure ERPs to cues signaling each taste. We observed a typical FRN (computed as the loss-minus-gain difference wave) to appetitive taste, but a reverse FRN to aversive taste. When tested axiomatically, frontocentral ERPs showed a salience response across tastes, with a particularly early response to outcome delivery, supporting recent propositions of a fast, unsigned, and unspecific response to salient stimuli. ERPs also expressed aversive prediction error peaking at 285 ms, which conformed to the logic of an axiomatic model of prediction error. With stimuli that most resemble those used in animal models, we did not detect any frontocentral ERP signal for utility prediction error, in contrast with dominant views of the functional role of the FRN ERP. We link the animal and human literature and present a challenge for current perspectives on associative learning research using ERPs.	[Hird, E.

Emotional eating and instructed food-cue processing in adolescents: An ERP study	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Event-related potentials; Adolescence; Emotional eating; Late positive potential; Food-cue processing	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NEURAL SOURCE ACTIVITY; VISUAL-ATTENTION; COGNITIVE REGULATION; HIGH-CALORIE; STRESS; RESPONSES; BEHAVIOR; STIMULI; OBESITY	We examined the P3 (250-500 ms) and Late Positive Potential (LPP; 500-2000 ms) event-related potentials (ERPs) to food vs. nonfood cues among adolescents reporting on emotional eating (EE) behavior. Eighty-six adolescents 10-17 years old were tested using an instructed food versus nonfood cue viewing task (imagine food taste) during high-density EEG recording. Self-report data showed that EE increased with age in girls, but not in boys. Both P3 and LPP amplitudes were greater for food vs. nonfood cues (food-cue bias). Exploratory analyses revealed that, during the LPP time period, greater EE was associated with a more positive food-cue bias in the fronto-central region. This heightened fronto-central food-cue bias LPP is in line with a more activated prefrontal attention system. The results suggest that adolescents with higher EE may engage more top-down cognitive resources to regulate their automatic emotional response to food cues, and/or they may exhibit greater reward network activation to food cues than do adolescents with lower EE, even in the absence of an emotional mood induction.

This study investigated whether electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of vSTM vary with cognitive development over individuals' lifespan. We measured vSTM performance and EEG in a lateralized whole-report task in a healthy birth cohort, whose cognitive function (intelligence quotient) was assessed in youth and late-middle age. Higher vSTM capacity (K; measured by Bundesen's theory of visual attention) was associated with higher amplitudes of the contralateral delay activity (CDA) and the central positivity (CP). In addition, rightward hemifield asymmetry of vSTM (K-lambda) was associated with lower CDA amplitudes. Furthermore, more severe cognitive decline from young adulthood to late-middle age predicted higher CDA amplitudes, and the relationship between K and the CDA was less reliable in individuals who show higher levels of cognitive decline compared to individuals with preserved abilities. By contrast, there was no significant effect of lifespan cognitive changes on the CP or the relationship between behavioral measures of vSTM and the CP. Neither the CDA, nor the CP, nor the relationships between K or K-lambda and the event-related potentials were predicted by individuals' current cognitive status. Together, our findings indicate complex age-related changes in processes underlying behavioral and EEG measures of vSTM and suggest that the K-CDA relationship might be a marker of cognitive lifespan trajectories.

In order to achieve a good stability performance, the sequence of self-face photo including first-occurrence position and non-first-occurrence position are taken into account in the serial occurrence of visual stimuli. In addition, a Fisher linear classification method and event-related potential technique for feature analysis is adapted to yield remarkably better outcomes than that by most of the existing methods in the field. The results have shown that the EEG-based person authentications via brain-computer interface can be considered as a suitable approach for biometric authentication system.

N-back training and transfer effects revealed by behavioral responses and EEG	BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						age-related differences; N-back task; P300 ERP; transfer effects; working memory training	IMPROVING FLUID INTELLIGENCE; WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY; OLDER-ADULTS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; COGNITIVE PLASTICITY; EXECUTIVE-CONTROL; AGE-DIFFERENCES; FAR TRANSFER; DUAL-TASK; METAANALYSIS	Introduction Cognitive function performance decreases in older individuals compared to young adults. To curb this decline, cognitive training is applied, but it is not clear whether it improves only the trained task or also other cognitive functions. To investigate this, we considered an N-back working memory (WM) training task and verified whether it improves both trained WM and untrained cognitive functions. Methods Results As EEG studies have noted task difficulty and age-related changes in time-locked EEG responses, called event-related potentials (ERPs), we focused on the relation between the P300 ERP component, task difficulty level, and behavior response accuracy and reaction time (RT) in young and older healthy adults. We used two groups of young and older healthy participants to assess the effect of N-back training: cognitive training group (CTG) and passive control group (PCG). Before and after training, cognitive tests were administered to both groups to evaluate transfer effects. Despite the observed age-related differences in the P300 ERP component and in terms of RT and accuracy, our findings demonstrate a stronger improvement in the trained task for older CTGs compared to younger CTGs, larger near- and far-transfer effect to WM and fluid intelligence for both younger and older CTGs, and a far-transfer effect to attention but only for older adults. Significant differences in response accuracy were shown between young and older subjects in spatial memory and attention tests. Conclusion The application of a WM training is a promising tool for both healthy adults, and in particular for older subjects, as it showed physiological and behavioral differences in cognitive plasticity across life span and evidence of benefits in the trained task and near-/far-transfer effects to other cognitive functions.

We aim to link the target-elicited N2 in a dot-probe task and the drug-related attention bias in heroin dependence and further estimate the brain regions involved in the generation of the target-elicited N2. We recorded 64-channel electroencephalograms (EEG) from 17 abstinent heroin addicts (AHAs) and 17 healthy controls (HCs) during the dot-probe visual task. Individual N2 sources were localized using exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA). Compared to HCs, AHAs generated larger N2 amplitude in both congruent and incongruent conditions, suggesting that target detection processing in AHAs might require more attention resources. Moreover, N2 component was mainly generated in the Brodmann areas (BAs) 7, 23, 24, 31, 30, 32, and 40, implying that the frontoparietal cortex played a critical role in target detection processes.

Does acute radio-frequency electromagnetic field exposure affect visual event-related potentials in healthy adults?	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Radio-frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF); RF-EMF provocation; Mobile phones; Visual event-related potentials (ERPs); P1; N1	MOBILE PHONE EXPOSURE; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; DOSIMETRIC EVALUATION; HUMAN SLEEP; SYSTEM; ALPHA; TIME; EEG	Objective: To use improved methods to address the question of whether acute exposure to radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) affects early (80-200 ms) sensory and later (180-600 ms) cognitive processes as indexed by event-related potentials (ERPs). Methods: Thirty-six healthy subjects completed a visual discrimination task during concurrent exposure to a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)-like, 920 MHz signal with peak-spatial specific absorption rate for 10 g of tissue of 0 W/kg of body mass (Sham), 1 W/kg (Low RF) and 2 W/kg (High RF). A fully randomised, counterbalanced, double-blind design was used. Results: P1 amplitude was reduced (p =.02) and anterior N1 latency was increased (p =.04) during Exposure compared to Sham. There were no effects on any other ERP latencies or amplitudes. Conclusions: RF-EMF exposure may affect early perceptual (P1) and preparatory motor (anterior N1) processes. However, only two ERP indices, out of 56 comparisons, were observed to differ between RF-EMF exposure and Sham, suggesting that these observations may be due to chance. Significance: These observations are consistent with previous findings that RF-EMF exposure has no reliable impact on cognition (e.g., accuracy and response speed).

Robust and Gaussian spatial functional regression models for analysis of event-related potentials	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Bayesian methods; Event-related potential; Functional data analysis; Functional mixed models; Functional regression; Correlated normal-exponential-gamma	MIXED MODELS; EEG; INFERENCE; BRAIN	Event-related potentials (ERPs) summarize electrophysiological brain response to specific stimuli. They can be considered as correlated functions of time with both spatial correlation across electrodes and nested correlations within subjects. Commonly used analytical methods for ERPs often focus on pre-determined extracted components and/or ignore the correlation among electrodes or subjects, which can miss important insights, and tend to be sensitive to outlying subjects, time points or electrodes. Motivated by ERP data in a smoking cessation study, we introduce a Bayesian spatial functional regression framework that models the entire ERPs as spatially correlated functional responses and the stimulus types as covariates. This novel framework relies on mixed models to characterize the effects of stimuli while simultaneously accounting for the multilevel correlation structure. The spatial correlation among the ERP profiles is captured through basis-space Matern assumptions that allow either separable or nonseparable spatial correlations over time. We induce both adaptive regularization over time and spatial smoothness across electrodes via a correlated normal-exponential-gamma (CNEG) prior on the fixed effect coefficient functions. Our proposed framework includes both Gaussian models as well as robust models using heavier-tailed distributions to make the regression automatically robust to outliers. We introduce predictive methods to select among Gaussian vs. robust models and models with separable vs. non-separable spatiotemporal correlation structures. Our proposed analysis produces global tests for stimuli effects across entire time (or time-frequency) and electrode domains, plus multiplicity-adjusted pointwise inference based on experiment-wise error rate or false discovery rate to flag spatiotemporal (or spatio-temporal-frequency) regions that characterize stimuli differences, and can also produce inference for any prespecified waveform components. Our analysis of the smoking cessation ERP data set reveals numerous effects across different types of visual stimuli.

We arranged an experiment of olfactive conditioned evoked potentials by analyzing Event Related Potential (ERP) of adult safe volunteers during the conditioning perception of 2 odor stimuli, in an experiment of emotional face recognition task. Specifically, it was developed a paradigm of classical conditioning in which the three types of odors (pleasant, unpleasant, neuter) were conditioned on images of neuter face expression and these results were compared with direct results of olfactory stimulation. The main experimental evidence of our study consists in significant values in ERPs components in direction of a greater amplitude and slower latency in unpleasant condition. On the basis of these results one might assume that an unpleasant odor can modulate, in a cross modal way, the perceptions of emotional and neutral face expressions, and it's highlighted in an early ERPs component (P1) in conditioning way only for neutral expressions.

During the retention interval, an uninformative or an informative visual retro-cue guided attention to an item in ASTM. Informative cues speeded response times, but only for young adults. In young adults, informative retro-cues generated greater event-related potential amplitude between 450 and 650 ms at parietal sites, and an increased sustained potential over the left central scalp region, thought to index the deployment of attention and maintenance of the cued item in ASTM, respectively. Both modulations were reduced in older adults. Alpha and low beta oscillatory power suppression was greater when the retro-cue was informative than uninformative, especially in young adults. Our results point toward an age-related decline in orienting attention to the cued item in ASTM. Older adults may be dividing their attention between all items in working memory rather than selectively focusing attention on a single cued item. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It is important to image brain dynamics with high spatial and temporal resolution. Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are noninvasive measurements associated with complex neural activations and interactions that encode brain functions. Electrophysiological source imaging estimates the underlying brain electrical sources from EEG and MEG measurements. It offers increasingly improved spatial resolution and intrinsically high temporal resolution for imaging large-scale brain activity and connectivity on a wide range of timescales. Integration of electrophysiological source imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging could further enhance spatiotemporal resolution and specificity to an extent that is not attainable with either technique alone. We review methodological developments in electrophysiological source imaging over the past three decades and envision its future advancement into a powerful functional neuroimaging technology for basic and clinical neuroscience applications.

Deception is a complex cognition process which involves activities in different brain regions. However, most of current ERP-based LD systems only focus on extracting the various features from the EEG signals on one or few channels. In this study, we used the phase lag index (PLI) to establish brain network connections and applied graph theory approach to investigate structure features in functional networks. Thirty participants were required to tell the truth or lie when facing certain stimuli, and their EEG signals were recorded. Statistical analysis indicates that the differences in the extracted graph-based features between the two groups were significant. Furthermore, calculated result shows that the guilty group shows more obvious small-world property than the innocent group, which provides a new approach that could automatically identify the deception in future.

Time-frequency methods provide another approach that allows the detection of subtle shifts in types and patterns of brain oscillations. We sought to discover whether event-related alpha activity would be significantly affected in asymptomatic multi-concussed athletes. We measured the amplitude of alpha activity (8-12 Hz) from the EEG recorded during a visual-spatial attention task to compare event-related alpha perturbations in 13 multi-concussed athletes and 14 age-equivalent, non-concussed teammates. Relative to non-concussed athletes, multi-concussed athletes showed significantly less event-related perturbations time locked to stimulus presentation. Alpha activity alterations were closely related to the number of concussions sustained. Event-related alpha activity differed in asymptomatic multi-concussed athletes when compared to controls. Our study suggests that low-level neurophysiological underpinnings of the deployment of visual-spatial attention are affected in multi-concussed athletes even though their last concussion occurred on average 30 months prior to testing.

The association of labels with pitches cannot be entirely suppressed even if it interferes with task demands. This suggests a high level of automaticity of pitch labeling in AP. The automatic nature of AP was further investigated in a study by Rogenmoser et al. (2015). Using a passive auditory oddball paradigm in combination with electroencephalography, they observed electrophysiological differences between musicians with and without AP in response to piano tones. Specifically, the AP musicians showed a smaller P3a, an event-related potential (ERP) component presumably reflecting early attentional processes. In contrast, they did not find group differences in the mismatch negativity (MMN), an ERP component associated with auditory memory processes. They concluded that early cognitive processes are facilitated in AP during passive listening and are more important for AP than the preceding sensory processes. In our direct replication study on a larger sample of musicians with (n = 54, 27 females, 27 males) and without (n = 50, 24 females, 26 males) AP, we successfully replicated the non-significant effects of AP on the MMN. However, we could not replicate the significant effects for the P3a. Additional Bayes factor analyses revealed moderate to strong evidence (Bayes factor > 3) for the null hypothesis for both MMN and P3a. Therefore, the results of this replication study do not support the postulated importance of cognitive facilitation in AP during passive tone listening.

Gratitude intervention modulates P3 amplitude in a temporal discounting task	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Temporal discounting; Gratitude; P3; Decision making	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INTERTEMPORAL CHOICE; DECISION-MAKING; POSITIVE AFFECT; DELAY; PERSONALITY; IMPULSIVITY; TIME; INTELLIGENCE; PREFERENCES	Gratitude has been shown to reduce economic impatience. In particular, individuals induced to experience heightened gratitude are more willing to choose delayed larger rewards over immediate smaller rewards (i.e., they have lower discounting rates) than those in a neutral condition. Using the event-related potential (ERP) method, we investigated the relation between gratitude level and neurophysiological correlates. Of interest was motivated information processing, as indexed by the P3 component. Participants were administered a gratitude or a neutral mood induction followed by a temporal discounting task (choosing between a fixed immediate reward versus a future reward that varied across trials) while electroencephalogram (EEG) activity was recorded. Individuals in the gratitude condition had greater P3 amplitude, suggesting greater attention to the future-reward option (the choice option that varied across trials), even when this option was not selected, and providing the first evidence of gratitude-induced changes in electro-physiological activity.

One's surname is an important form of collective self-concept; it represents the line of ancestry, and is psychologically salient. According to this concept, a stranger with the same surname may also elicit salient self-relevant processing, despite unfamiliarity; however, this has not yet been directly investigated. The present study adopted a three-stimulus oddball paradigm and multimodal electroencephalography to study the potential self-relevant processing of such stimuli. Behavioral results indicated that same-surname unfamiliar (SSU) names were rated more self-relevant than different-surname unfamiliar (DSU) names, although they were rated equally unfamiliar to subjects. Analysis of EEG data showed similar P2 enhancement in response to SN and SSU when compared to DSU. In contrast, the self-relevant effect on P3 amplitudes and theta synchronization decreased linearly from SN, SSU, to DSU conditions. Thus, both the behavioral and electrophysiological data indicate that unfamiliar names with the same surname can evoke reliable self-relevant processing.

Perceptual learning induces changes in early and late visual evoked potentials	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						Visual perceptual learning; Electroencephalogram; Event-related potentials; Texture discrimination	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SINGLE-TRIAL; TEXTURE-DISCRIMINATION; SPECIFICITY; MECHANISMS; COMPONENT; SLEEP; BRAIN; MODULATION; ACTIVATION	Studies of visual cortical responses following visual perceptual learning (VPL) have produced diverse results, revealing neural changes in early and/or higher-level visual cortex as well as changes in regions responsible for higher cognitive processes such as attentional control. In this study, we investigated substrates of VPL in the human brain by recording visual evoked potentials with high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) before (Session 1) and after (Session 2) training on a texture discrimination task (TDT), with two full nights of sleep between sessions. We studied the following event-related potential (ERP) components: C1 (early sensory processing), P1 and N1 (later sensory processing, modulated by top-down spatial attention), and P3 (cognitive processing). Our results showed a significant decrease in C1 amplitude at Session 2 relative to Session 1 that was positively correlated with the magnitude of improvement in behavioral performance. Although we observed no significant changes in P1 amplitude with VPL, both N1 amplitude and latency were significantly decreased in Session 2. Moreover, the difference in N1 latency between Session 1 and Session 2 was negatively correlated with behavioral improvement. We also found a significant increase in P3 amplitude following training. Our results suggest that VPL of the TDT task may be due to plasticity in early visual cortical areas as well as changes in top-down attentional control and cognitive processing.

This BCI-VR system prototype was functionally tested on multiple participants and demonstrated live before an audience during the 2017 'Hack the Brain' at the Dublin Science Gallery. The availability of such an open-source, effective, BCI-VR Game Control Development Environment, at a level acceptable for industry experimentation, has the potential to open up this field to a much wider range of researchers and games developers and to assist the investigation of gaming experiences which both incorporate the specific control features available through BCI as a core element of the game play and the potential for its use in neurorehabilitation.

Nevertheless, their value for deciding among alternative cognitive architectures is partly limited by component overlap and the possibility of ambiguity regarding component identity. Here, we apply temporally-generalized multivariate pattern analysis - a recently-proposed machine learning method capable of tracking the evolution of neurocognitive processes over time - to constrain possible alternative architectures underlying the processing of semantic incongruency in sentences. In a spoken sentence paradigm, we replicate established N400/P600 correlates of semantic mismatch. Time-generalized decoding indicates that early vs. late mismatch-sensitive processes are (i) distinct in their neural substrate, arguing against recurrent or latency-shifted single process architectures, and (ii) partially overlapping in time, inconsistent with predictions of strictly serial models. These results are in accordance with an incremental-cascading neurocognitive organization of semantic mismatch processing. We propose time-generalized multivariate decoding as a valuable tool for neurocognitive language studies.

The study reported in this paper explores the impact of service value on buying decisions of product-service portfolios by using event-related potentials (ERPs). Twenty participants were shown product-service portfolios with different service values and were asked to make buying decisions on portfolios with different service value levels. The buying rate and attention-related P2 component in left frontal regions were recorded after the stimuli were shown. The behavioral result shows that the portfolios with higher service value have higher buying rate. The EEG result shows that the P2 component evoked by the portfolio of PS2 (one product and two services) is the largest, which shows different attention resources attracted by portfolios with different service values. Our study explores the impact of different service value on buying decisions of product-service portfolios in both behavioral and neural perspective, providing suppliers a new insight in the design of product-service portfolios.

We used event-related potentials to examine the relative time course of access to affordances. Written object names were primed with the name of an object sharing the same affordance as the target (e.g. precision-grip: "grape" primed by "tweezers") or the same taxonomic category (e.g. fruit: "grape" primed by "apple"). N200 latencies, related to go/nogo semantic category decisions on target words, revealed no difference in facilitation provided by affordance and semantic priming. However, separate analyses of ERPs for go and nogo trials showed that semantic priming led to earlier activation during go trials (around 430 ms), and affordance priming led to earlier activation during nogo trials (around 180 ms). While affordances appear to be peripheral to the conceptual representation of objects, they do lead to direct motor preparation.

Among existing ones, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) have the advantage of being noninvasive, nonobstructive, inexpensive, yield portable solutions, and offer complementary monitoring of electrical and local hemodynamic activities. This article presents a novel system with 128 fNIRS channels and 32 EEG channels with the potential to cover a larger fraction of the adult superficial cortex than earlier works, is integrated with 32 EEG channels, is light and battery-powered to improve portability, and can transmit data wirelessly to an interface for real-time display of electrical and hemodynamic activities. A novel fNIRS-EEG stretchable cap, two analog channels for auxiliary data (e.g., electrocardiogram), eight digital triggers for event-related protocols and an internal accelerometer for movement artifacts removal contribute to improve data acquisition quality. The system can run continuously for 24h. Following instrumentation validation and reliability on a solid phantom, performance was evaluated on (1) 12 healthy participants during either a visual (checkerboard) task at rest or while pedalling on a stationary bicycle or a cognitive (language) task and (2) 4 patients admitted either to the epilepsy (n=3) or stroke (n=1) units. Data analysis confirmed expected hemodynamic variations during validation recordings and useful clinical information during in-hospital testing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a wearable wireless multichannel fNIRS-EEG monitoring system in patients with neurological conditions. Hum Brain Mapp 39:7-23, 2018.

In the present study, we compared the behavioural and EEG outcomes of implicit artificial grammar learning in the visual vs. auditory modality. We controlled for the influence of surface characteristics of sequences (Associative Chunk Strength), thus focusing on the strictly structural aspects of sequence learning, and we adapted the paradigms to compensate for known frailties of the visual modality compared to audition (temporal presentation, fast presentation rate). The behavioural outcomes were similar across modalities. Favouring the idea of modality-specificity, ERPs in response to grammar violations differed in topography and latency (earlier and more anterior component in the visual modality), and ERPs in response to surface features emerged only in the auditory modality. In favour of modality-independence, we observed three common functional properties in the late ERPs of the two grammars: both were free of interactions between structural and surface influences, both were more extended in a grammaticality classification test than in a preference classification test, and both correlated positively and strongly with theta event-related-synchronization during baseline testing. Our findings support the idea of modality-specificity combined with modality-independence, and suggest that memory for visual vs. auditory sequences may largely contribute to cross-modal differences.

However, because of its low signal-to-noise ratio, extracting useful information from these signals continues to be a hard-technical challenge. Many studies focus on simple properties of the ERPs such as peaks, latencies, and slopes of signal deflections. New method: To overcome these limitations, we developed the Wavelet-Information method which uses wavelet decomposition, information theory, and a quantification based on single-trial decoding performance to extract information from evoked responses. Results: Using simulations and real data from four experiments, we show that the proposed approach outperforms standard supervised analyses based on peak amplitude estimation. Moreover, the method can extract information using the raw data from all recorded channels using no a priori knowledge or pre-processing steps. Comparison with existing method(s): We show that traditional approaches often disregard important features of the signal such as the shape of EEG waveforms. Also, other approaches often require some form of a priori knowledge for feature selection and lead to problems of multiple comparisons. Conclusions: This approach offers a new and complementary framework to design experiments that go beyond the traditional analyses of ERPs. Potentially, it allows a wide usage beyond basic research; such as for clinical diagnosis, brain-machine interfaces, and neurofeedback applications requiring single-trial analyses.

Cue reactivity towards bodies in anorexia nervosa - common and differential effects in adolescents and adults	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Adolescents; anorexia nervosa; body; event-related potentials; late positive potential	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EATING-DISORDERS; MOTIVATED ATTENTION; BRAIN; EMOTION; PERCEPTION; RESPONSES; STIMULI; NEUROBIOLOGY; CHILDHOOD	Background Aberrant reward mechanisms with regard to slim body shapes are discussed in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN). The aim of the present study was to examine of cue reactivity toward body shapes in AN via the late positive potential (LPP), an event-related electroencephalography (EEG) component. By including adolescents and adults, aspects of development and chronification could be studied (2 x 2 design). Methods Thirty-two female AN patients (19 adolescents and 13 adults) and 37 control participants (16 adolescents and 21 adults) were included. Standardized photographic stimuli showing women's bodies in underwear from five body mass index (BMI) categories (extremely underweight to extremely overweight) were presented. During picture evaluation, EEG activity was recorded (10-20 system). The LPP was measured in two time windows characterized by different topographies (450-700 ms: posterior; 1000-1300 ms: central). Results Regarding the posterior component, LPP amplitudes were clearly reduced in adult but not in adolescent patients; for both time windows the LPP showed differential patterns over BMI categories for patients and controls. Regarding the central component, a highly significant linear decrease from extremely underweight to extremely overweight body shapes was revealed in patients and no significant modulation in control participants. Conclusions Adolescent and adult patients show increased sustained attention toward extremely underweight bodies. In chronically ill patients, this bias appears to be accompanied by generally reduced automatic attention. The LPP findings provide a differentiated picture of aberrant cue reactivity which could be interpreted as motivated attention toward body shapes in AN.

Relationships between alpha oscillations during speech preparation and the listener N400 ERP to the produced speech	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; WORD; PREDICTION; SENTENCES; COMPONENT; INFORMATION; INTEGRATION; DYNAMICS	While previous studies separately demonstrate EEG spectral modulations during speech preparation and ERP responses to the listened speech, it is unclear whether these responses are related on a trial-by-trial basis between a speaker and listener. In order to determine whether these responses are related in real-time, Electroencephalography (EEG) responses were measured simultaneously within a speaker and listener using a 24 electrode Mobile EEG system (18 participants; 9 pairs) during a sentence completion task. Each trial consisted of a sentence prompt with an incomplete ending (e.g. "I took my dog for a _"). The speaker was instructed to fill in the ending with something expected (e.g. "walk") (40 trials) or unexpected (e.g. "drink") (40 trials). The other participant listened to the speaker throughout the block. We found that lower alpha band activity was reduced when individuals prepared unexpected sentence endings compared to expected sentence endings. Greater reductions in the speaker's lower alpha activity during response preparation were correlated with a more negative N400 response in the listener to the unexpected word. These findings demonstrate that alpha suppression and the N400 ERP effect are present within a hyperscanning context and they are correlated between the speaker and listener during sentence completion.

High similarity between EEG from subcutaneous and proximate scalp electrodes in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						long-term monitoring; subcutaneous EEG; temporal lobe epilepsy; ultra-long-term monitoring; wearable EEG	SUBDERMAL WIRE ELECTRODES; AMBULATORY EEG; EAR-EEG; SLEEP DISORDERS; MONITORING UNIT; CARE-UNIT; LONG-TERM; ACTIGRAPHY; SEIZURES; SYSTEM	Subcutaneous recording using electroencephalography (EEG) has the potential to enable ultra-long-term epilepsy monitoring in real-life conditions because it allows the patient increased mobility and discreteness. This study is the first to compare physiological and epileptiform EEG signals from subcutaneous and scalp EEG recordings in epilepsy patients. Four patients with probable or definite temporal lobe epilepsy were monitored with simultaneous scalp and subcutaneous EEG recordings. EEG recordings were compared by correlation and time-frequency analysis across an array of clinically relevant waveforms and patterns. We found high similarity between the subcutaneous EEG channels and nearby temporal scalp channels for most investigated electroencephalographic events. In particular, the temporal dynamics of one typical temporal lobe seizure in one patient were similar in scalp and subcutaneous recordings in regard to frequency distribution and morphology. Signal similarity is strongly related to the distance between the subcutaneous and scalp electrodes. On the basis of these limited data, we conclude that subcutaneous EEG recordings are very similar to scalp recordings in both time and time-frequency domains, if the distance between them is small. As many electroencephalographic events are local/ regional, the positioning of the subcutaneous electrodes should be considered carefully to reflect the relevant clinical question. The impact of implantation depth of the subcutaneous electrode on recording quality should be investigated further. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study is the first publication comparing the detection of clinically relevant, pathological EEG features from a subcutaneous recording system designed for out-patient ultralong-term use to gold standard scalp EEG recordings. Our study shows that subcutaneous channels are very similar to comparable scalp channels, but also point out some issues yet to be resolved.

The mechanisms underlying the time-dependent effects of acute cardiovascular exercise on motor memory consolidation, however, remain poorly understood. In this study, we sought to determine the impact of a single bout of cardiovascular exercise performed immediately after motor skill practice on those mechanisms using electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG). Specifically, we assessed exercise-induced changes in the activity and connectivity of cortico-motor networks during early consolidation and the impact of these changes on skill retention. Participants practiced a visuo-motor tracking task followed by either a short bout of intense exercise or a rest period. EEG along with EMG data of hand muscles were collected during the production of low-force isometric contractions. Event-related desynchronization, functional connectivity and corticomuscular coherence were measured at baseline, 30, 60 and 90 min after the bout of exercise or the rest period. Improvements in motor memory were inferred via retention tests of the motor skill performed 8 and 24 h after motor practice. We found that participants who performed the single bout of exercise showed better motor skill retention 24 h after motor practice. This improvement in skill retention in the exercise group was associated with significant decreases in beta-band event-related desynchronization in EEG electrodes located over the left sensorimotor areas. We also found that after exercise, alpha-, and even more significantly, beta-band functional connectivity, increased between EEG electrodes located over left and right sensorimotor areas. The exercise group also showed greater beta-band corticomuscular coherence but only in a small number of electrodes. Neither functional connectivity nor corticomuscular coherence measures correlated with skill retention scores. This is the first study exploring brain mechanisms underlying the summative effects of motor learning and cardiovascular exercise on motor memory consolidation. We have identified potential neural substrates through which a single bout of acute exercise, when performed in close temporal proximity to motor practice, strengthens motor memories. Our findings provide new mechanistic insights into a better understanding of the complex temporal relationship existing between cardiovascular exercise and motor memory consolidation.

The present study investigated how harmonic contexts at both local and global levels influence the processing of an incoming chord in an event-related potentials experiment. Chord sequences containing two phrases were presented to musically trained listeners, with the last critical chord either harmonically related or less related to its preceding context at local and/or global levels. ERPs data showed an ERAN-like effect for local context in early time window and a N5-like component for later interaction between the local context and global context. These results suggest that both the local and global contexts influence the processing of an incoming music event, and the local effect happens earlier than the global. Moreover, the interaction between the local context and global context in N5 may suggest that music syntactic integration at local level takes place prior to the integration at global level.

In 2 experiments, using intracranial electroencephalography (EEG), we investigated (1) the neural sources of HEPs, (2) the underlying mechanisms for HEP generation, and (3) the functional role of HEPs in bodily self-consciousness. In Experiment-1, we found that shortly after the heartbeat onset, phase distributions across single trials were significantly concentrated in 10% of the recording sites, mainly in the insula and the operculum, but also in other regions including the amygdala and fronto-temporal cortex. Such phase concentration was not accompanied by increased spectral power, and did not correlate with spectral power changes, suggesting that a phase resetting, rather than an additive "evoked potential" mechanism, underlies HEP generation. In Experiment-2, we further aimed to anatomically refine previous scalp EEG data that linked HEPs with bodily self-consciousness. We found that HEP modulations in the insula reflected an experimentally induced altered sense of self-identification. Collectively, these results provide novel and solid electrophysiological evidence on the neural sources and underlying mechanisms of HEPs, and their functional role in self-consciousness.

Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) manifest several anomalies in their visual selection, with strengths in detail-oriented tasks, but also difficulties in distractor inhibition tasks. Here, we asked whether contradictory aspects of perception in ASD might be due to a different center-surround profile of their attentional focus. In two experiments, we tested two independent samples of children with ASD, comparing them with typically developing (TD) peers. In Experiment 1, we used a psychophysical task that mapped the entire spatial profile of the attentional focus. In Experiment 2, we used dense-array electroencephalography (EEG) to explore its neurophysiological underpinnings. Experiment 1 results showed that the suppression, surrounding the attentional focus, was markedly reduced in children with ASD. Experiment 2 showed that the center-surround profile in TD children resulted in a modulation of the posterior N2 ERP component, with cortical sources in the lateral-occipital and medial/inferior temporal areas. In contrast, children with ASD did not show modulation of the N2 and related activations in the ventral visual stream. Furthermore, behavioural and neurophysiological measures of weaker suppression predicted more severe autistic symptomatology. The present findings, showing an altered center-surround profile during attentional selection, give an important insight to understand superior visual processing in autism as well as the experiencing of sensory overload.

Redirection of attention toward a rare, distracting stimulus event, however, can be measured by the subsequent P3a component of the P300. Chronic schizophrenia patients exhibit robust MMN deficits, as well as reductions in P3a amplitude. While, the substantial literature on the MMN in first-episode and early phase schizophrenia in this population reports reduced amplitudes, there also exist several contradictory studies. Conversely, P3a reduction in this population is relatively consistent, although the literature investigating this is small. The primary goal of this study was to contribute to our understanding of whether auditory change detection mechanisms are altered in early phase schizophrenia and, if so, under what conditions. Event-related potentials elicited by duration, frequency, gap, intensity, and location deviants (as elicited by the optimal multi-feature paradigm) were recorded in 14 early phase schizophrenia (EP) patients and 17 healthy controls (HCs). Electrical activity was recorded from 15 scalp electrodes. MMN/P3a amplitudes and latencies for each deviant were compared between groups and were correlated with clinical measures in EPs. There were no significant group differences for MMN amplitudes or latencies, though EPs did exhibit reduced P3a amplitudes to gap and duration deviants. Furthermore, PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) positive symptom scores were correlated with intensity MMN latencies and duration P3a amplitudes in EPs. These findings suggest that MMNs may not be as robustly reduced in early phase schizophrenia (relative to chronic illness), but that alterations may be more likely in patients with increased positive symptomatology. Furthermore, these findings offer further support to previous work suggesting that the understudied P3a may have good complementary utility as a marker of early cortical dysfunction in psychosis.

In the human brain, the same system is thought to monitor action outcomes regardless of whether the information originates from internal (e.g., proprioceptive) and external (e.g., visual) sensory channels. Neural signatures of processing motor errors and action outcomes communicated by external feedback have been studied extensively; however, the existence of such a general action-monitoring system has not been tested directly. Here, we use concurrent EEG-MEG measurements and a probabilistic learning task to demonstrate that event-related responses measured by electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography display spatiotemporal patterns that allow an effective transfer of a multivariate statistical model discriminating the outcomes across the following conditions: (a) erroneous versus correct motor output, (b) negative versus positive feedback, (c) high-versus low-surprise negative feedback, and (d) erroneous versus correct brain-computer-interface output. We further show that these patterns originate from highly-overlapping neural sources in the medial frontal and the medial parietal cortices. We conclude that information about action outcomes arriving from internal or external sensory channels converges to the same neural system in the human brain, that matches this information to the internal predictions.

However, there is no firm conclusion on acute neuroelectrophysiological changes among methadone-treated subjects as well as the effectiveness of methadone in restoring brain electrical abnormalities among heroin addicts. This study aims to investigate the acute and short-term effects of methadone administration on the brain's electrophysiological properties before and after daily methadone intake over 10weeks of treatment among heroin addicts. EEG spectral analysis and single-trial event-related potential (ERP) measurements were used to investigate possible alterations in the brain's electrical activities, as well as the cognitive attributes associated with MMN and P3. The results confirmed abnormal brain activities predominantly in the beta band and diminished information processing ability including lower amplitude and prolonged latency of cognitive responses among heroin addicts compared to healthy controls. In addition, the alteration of EEG activities in the frontal and central regions was found to be associated with the withdrawal symptoms of drug users. Certain brain regions were found to be influenced significantly by methadone intake; acute effects of methadone induction appeared to be associative to its dosage. The findings suggest that methadone administration affects cognitive performance and activates the cortical neuronal networks, resulting in cognitive responses enhancement which may be influential in reorganizing cognitive dysfunctions among heroin addicts. This study also supports the notion that the brain's oscillation powers and ERPs can be utilized as neurophysiological indices for assessing the addiction treatment traits.

Designs that exploit evoked response potentials (ERPs) in EEG constitute the majority of research efforts dedicated to noninvasive BCIs. Visual, auditory, and tactile stimulation paradigms are used to actively probe the user's brain to collect EEG evidence towards inferring intent in the context of the particular application. As assistive technology devices, however, existing EEG-based BCIs lack sufficient speed and accuracy to safely and reliably restore function at acceptable levels. This is mainly because the recorded EEG signals are not only noisy with a low signal-to-noise ratio, but are also nonstationary, due to physiological or environmental artifacts, sensor failure, and user fatigue. In this chapter, we address how reliable intent inference engines with reasonable speed and accuracy can be developed using parametric modeling. Examples of real-world data in the framework of the ERP-based BCI paradigm are provided to exemplify our detection and classification methods.

Evidence from neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and electrophysiological studies indicates that alterations of error processing are core symptoms in children and adolescents with ADHD. To test whether adults with ADHD show persisting deficits and compensatory processes, we investigated performance monitoring during stimulus-evaluation and response-selection, with a focus on errors, as well as within-group correlations with symptom scores. Methods: Fifty-five participants (27 ADHD and 28 controls) aged 19-55 years performed a modified flanker task during EEG recording with 64 electrodes, and the ADHD and control groups were compared on measures of behavioral task performance, event-related potentials of performance monitoring (N2, P3), and error processing (ERN, Pe). Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) was used to assess ADHD symptom load. Results: Adults with ADHD showed higher error rates in incompatible trials, and these error rates correlated positively with the ASRS scores. Also, we observed lower P3 amplitudes in incompatible trials, which were inversely correlated with symptom load in the ADHD group. Adults with ADHD also displayed reduced error-related ERN and Pe amplitudes. There were no significant differences in reaction time (RT) and RT variability between the two groups. Conclusion: Our findings show deviations of electrophysiological measures, suggesting reduced effortful engagement of attentional and error-monitoring processes in adults with ADHD. Associations between ADHD symptom scores, event-related potential amplitudes, and poorer task performance in the ADHD group further support this notion.

Model-based learning incorporates knowledge about structure and contingencies in the world to assign candidate actions with an expected value. Model-free learning is ignorant of the world's structure; instead, actions hold a value based on prior reinforcement, with this value updated by expectancy violation in the form of a reward prediction error. Because they use such different learning mechanisms, it has been previously assumed that model-based and model-free learning are computationally dissociated in the brain. However, recent fMRI evidence suggests that the brain may compute reward prediction errors to both model-free and model-based estimates of value, signalling the possibility that these systems interact. Because of its poor temporal resolution, fMRI risks confounding reward prediction errors with other feedback-related neural activity. In the present study, EEG was used to show the presence of both model-based and model-free reward prediction errors and their place in a temporal sequence of events including state prediction errors and action value updates. This demonstration of model-based prediction errors questions a long-held assumption that model-free and model-based learning are dissociated in the brain.

Specifically, it investigates the subject/object asymmetry in this type of sentence, following previous results using self-paced reading technique (OLIVEIRA; MAIA, 2010; OLIVEIRA, 2013). Eyetracking and electroencephalography (EEG) techniques were used as diagnostic tools for real-time linguistic processing. The goal was to find evidence of the modus operandi of the parser during the processing of subject and object syntactic functions in Brazilian Portuguese WH-sentences and verify if there are discrepancies between the techniques. The results allow discerning the levels of representational, algorithmic and implementation analysis, in the direction of the classical proposal of Marr (1982).

Here, we propose a novel task-free paradigm aimed at assessing multiple levels of speech processing by combining various speech and nonspeech sounds in an adaptation of a multifeature passive oddball design. We recorded EEG in healthy adult participants, who were presented with these sounds in the absence of sound-directed attention while being engaged in a primary visual task. This produced a range of responses indexing various levels of sound processing and language comprehension: (a) P1-N1 complex, indexing obligatory auditory processing; (b) P3-like dynamics associated with involuntary attention allocation for unusual sounds; (c) enhanced responses for native speech (as opposed to nonnative phonemes) from approximate to 50 ms from phoneme onset, indicating phonological processing; (d) amplitude advantage for familiar real words as opposed to meaningless pseudowords, indexing automatic lexical access; (e) topographic distribution differences in the cortical activation of action verbs versus concrete nouns, likely linked with the processing of lexical semantics. These multiple indices of speech-sound processing were acquired in a single attention-free setup that does not require any task or subject cooperation; subject to future research, the present protocol may potentially be developed into a useful tool for assessing the status of auditory and linguistic functions in uncooperative or unresponsive participants, including a range of clinical or developmental populations.

Here, we asked whether autistic adults are able to make use of two important spatial cues to auditory object formation - the relative timing and amplitude of sound energy at the left and right ears. Using electroencephalography, we measured the brain responses of 15 autistic adults and 15 age- and verbal-IQ-matched control participants as they listened to dichotic pitch stimuli - white noise stimuli in which interaural timing or amplitude differences applied to a narrow frequency band of noise typically lead to the perception of a pitch sound that is spatially segregated from the noise. Responses were contrasted with those to stimuli in which timing and amplitude cues were removed. Consistent with our previous studies, autistic adults failed to show a significant object-related negativity (ORN) for timing-based pitch, although their ORN was not significantly smaller than that of the control group. Autistic participants did show an ORN to amplitude cues, indicating that they do not experience a general impairment in auditory object formation. However, their P400 response - thought to indicate the later attention-dependent aspects of auditory object formation - was missing. These findings provide further evidence of atypical auditory object processing in autism with potential implications for understanding the perceptual and communication difficulties associated with the condition.

Participants chose between two possible interpretations of relative-clause (RC) ambiguous sentences, while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. We manipulated the alignment of the beat within sentences where auditory prosody was removed. Behavioral performance showed no effect of beat placement on the sentences' interpretation, while event-related potentials (ERPs) revealed a positive shift of the signal in the windows corresponding to N100 and P200 components. Additionally, post hoc analyses of the ERPs time locked to the RC revealed a modulation of the P600 component as a function of gesture. These results suggest that beats modulate early processing of affiliate words in continuous speech and potentially have a global impact at the level of sentence-parsing components. We speculate that beats must be synergistic with auditory prosody to be fully consequential in behavior.

ERPs were used to investigate neurocognitive responses to feedback to general information questions for which participants had expressed either being or not being in a TOT state. For questions in which participants were unable to answer within 3 s, they indicated whether they were experiencing a TOT state and then were immediately provided with the correct answer. Feedback during a TOT state, as opposed to not knowing the answer, was associated with enhanced positivity over centro-parietal electrodes 250-700ms post-feedback, and this enhanced positivity mediated a positive relationship between TOTs and later recall. Although effects of increased semantic access during TOT states cannot be ruled out, these results suggest that information received during TOT states elicits enhanced processing-suggestive of curiosity-leading to enhanced learning of studied material.

The focus of the current chapter will be on the interaction of these processes in different stages of visual information processing, giving rise to various interference effects, such as crowding, Stroop and Garner interference, as well as specific interference characteristic of letters and numbers. The stagewise organization of visual perception is reviewed based on experimental studies using behavioral responses or measurements of brain signals, including event-related potentials (ERP) and the electroencephalogram (EEG). Even though perceptual organization can be fast, it interacts with early (crowding) and late (Stroop-congruence) visuospatial target selection. In letter processing, the association with phonemes makes that letters are preferably processed analytically, giving rise to negative congruence effects; for numbers we observe congruence effects in a generic magnitude space instead of the visual space. Furthermore, depending on the stimulus, perceptual organization can also be slow in the presence of distractors.

FUNCTIONAL NEUROMARKERS FOR NEUROPSYCHOLOGY	ACTA NEUROPSYCHOLOGICA			English	Review						neuroimaging; quantitative EEG; event related de/synchronization; event-related potentials	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; STRESS-DISORDER PTSD; LONG-TERM COMA; SEVERE TBI; PATIENT; NEUROFEEDBACK; ERPS	This article is written to commemorate the 40th year of the scientific career of Professor Maria Pachalska, Head of the Department of Neuropsychology and Neurorehabilitation at Krakow University, President of the Polish Neuropsychological Society, and the Editor-in-chief of Acta Neuropsychologica, with whom I have been collaborating for over ten years. The subject matter of our work includes the introduction of HBI methodology to clinics and the search for neuromarkers in particular disease entities. What is the new methodology we are talking about? In general, we think of a biomarker (or biological marker) as a characteristic that can be objectively measured and evaluated as an index of normal or pathological biological processes. For disorders of the central nervous system, biomarkers can be classified as clinical, neuroimaging, biochemical or genetic, according to the type of information they provide. Expectations for the development of biomarkers are high, since they could lead to a significant improvement in diagnosing and possibly preventing neurological and psychiatric diseases. Neuroimaging is an array of neuroscience methods that include the techniques of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), and PET (positron emission tomography), as well as Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Magnetoencephalogram (MEG) techniques, such as quantitative EEG (QEEG), event related de/synchronization (ERD/ERS) and event-related potentials (ERPs).

This is one of the manners for investigating between-subject neural activities involved in social interactions. Emotion perception plays an important role in human social interactions. Interaction and emotional state influence each other. In this study, we aim to investigate how between-subject interaction modulates emotion perception based on event related potentials (ERPs), connectivity analysis and classification analysis. We found that there are distinct differences appearing between paired subjects who performed the task together, which are early ERP components (N250 and N400), late ERP components (P1500 and N1500), and the greater amplitude in N250 for the seconding responding subject compared to the first one. In the exploration of connectivity using phase locking value (PLV), we found that there are significant differences among different frequency bands for each subject under positive and negative stimuli and the significant difference of hyper-connectivity existed in the gamma frequency band between positive and negative stimulus trials. In the classification analysis, we compared the hyper-features for two individual subjects separately, the performance was improved when hyper-features of the PLV was employed compared to the features of power spectrum density.

Besides the effects of sleep depth we investigated how sleep-specific EEG patterns (i.e. sleep spindles and slow oscillations [SOs]) relate to stimulus processing. Using 256-channel EEG we studied processing of auditory stimuli by means of event-related oscillatory responses (de-/synchronisation, ERD/ERS) and potentials (ERPs) in N - 17 healthy sleepers. We varied stimulus salience by manipulating subjective (SON vs. unfamiliar name) and paralinguistic emotional relevance (familiar vs. unfamiliar voice, FV/UFV). Results reveal that evaluation of voice familiarity continues during all NREM sleep stages and even REM sleep suggesting a 'sentinel processing mode' of the human brain in the absence of wake-like consciousness. Especially UFV stimuli elicit larger responses in a 1-15 Hz range suggesting they continue being salient. Beyond this, we find that sleep spindles and the negative slope of SOs attenuate information processing. However, unlike previously suggested they do not uniformly inhibit information processing, but inhibition seems to be scaled to stimulus salience.

We define data alignment as a procedure that reduces subject-dependent variability while preserving aspects of data studied in a particular cross-session analysis or utilized in a zero-training BCI application. We investigated the hypothesis that data alignment methods that reduce subject-dependent variability will simultaneously result in more stable, i.e. less variable across recordings, EEG features and better BCI classifiers. Exploring different families of linear transformations of EEG sensor data, derived from statistical measures computed on five minutes of unlabeled data at the start of test sessions, we investigated whether they produced less variable event-related potentials (ERPs), and whether they increased the zero-training performance of a state-of-the-art deep learning based BCI applied to the task of classifying target versus non-target visual stimuli from EEG data. Our results indicate that zero-phase component analysis (ZCA) sphering-based data alignment methods consistently outperform baseline (no data alignment) and purely channel amplitude-based data alignment methods. We also observed statistically significant improvements in BCI performance on visual target detection tasks after sphering-based data alignment.

Yet, only a few studies have assessed electroencephalographic (EEG) activity with respect to response inhibition in high trait anger individuals. The main goal of this study was therefore to investigate whether individual differences in trait anger in forensic psychiatric patients are associated with individual differences in anger-primed inhibitory control using behavioral and electrophysiological measures of response inhibition. Thirty-eight forensic psychiatric patients who had a medium to high risk of recidivism of violent and/or non-violent behaviors performed an affective Go/NoGo task while EEG was recorded. On the behavioral level, we found higher scores on trait anger to be accompanied by lower accuracy on NoGo trials, especially when anger was primed. With respect to the physiological data we found, as expected, a significant inverse relation between trait anger and the error related negativity amplitudes. Contrary to expectation, trait anger was not related to the stimulus-locked event related potentials (i.e., N2/P3). The results of this study support the notion that in a forensic population trait anger is inversely related to impulse control, particularly in hostile contexts. Moreover, our data suggest that higher scores on trait anger are associated with deficits in automatic error-processing which may contribute the continuation of impulsive angry behaviors despite their negative consequences.

Some distractors might be more distracting than others, for example the human face, which has been shown to be very efficient in attracting attention. Here, we employed the irrelevant-distractor paradigm (Forster & Lavie, 2016) to measure behavioural and neural distraction by completely irrelevant faces or non-faces (cars), while participants performed a letter search task that was more (high-load) or less (low-load) demanding. Under low load conditions, faces and cars equally slowed responses on trials with distractors as compared to those without. In high load conditions, neither faces nor cars were distracting. However, event-related potentials revealed larger face-sensitive N170 responses to faces than cars under both load conditions, suggesting that early face-specific processing is present even under high load. A subsequent Pd modulation between 200 and 300 ms contralateral to the distractor position, which has been linked to the active top-down suppression of lateral distractors (Hickey et al., 2009) was stronger for faces compared to cars. Overall, the EEG data indicate early face-specific processes to irrelevant faces irrespective of attentional load, coupled with stronger top-down suppression for faces. Together, these processes might reduce the influence of irrelevant face distractors on behavioural performance.

Electrophysiological correlates of incidentally learned expectations in human vision	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; event-related potentials; expectation; N2; statistical learning	PERCEPTUAL DECISION-MAKING; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; WORKING-MEMORY; VISUAL-CORTEX; BRAIN; RESPONSES; REGULARITIES; MODULATIONS; POTENTIALS; MECHANISMS	The human visual system is remarkably sensitive to environmental regularities, which can facilitate behavioral performance when sensory events conform to past experience. The point at which prior knowledge is integrated during visual perception is unclear, particularly for incidentally learned associations. One possibility is that expectation shapes neural activity prospectively, in an anticipatory fashion, allowing prior knowledge to affect the earliest stages of sensory processing. Alternatively, cognitive processes underlying object recognition and conflict detection may be necessary precursors, constraining effects to later stages of processing. Here we used electroencephalography (EEG) to uncover neural activity that distinguishes between visual stimuli that match prior exposure and those that deviate from it. Participants identified visual targets that were associated with possible target locations; each location was associated with a high-probability target and a low-probability target. Alongside a behavioral cost for stimuli that had occurred infrequently at a cued location compared with those that had occurred frequently, we observed a focal modulation of the evoked EEG response at 250 ms after target onset. Relative to likely targets, unlikely targets evoked an enhanced negativity at midline frontal electrodes, and individual differences in the magnitude of this effect were correlated with the response time difference between likely and unlikely targets. In contrast, the evoked response at the latency of the P1, a correlate of early sensory processing, was indistinguishable for likely and unlikely targets. Together, these results point to postperceptual processes as a key stage at which experience modulates visual processing. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We combined electroencephalography with an incidental learning paradigm to investigate whether prior knowledge of environmental regularities modulates visual processing at early or late stages of sensory analysis. Our results reveal that modulations of neural activity arising at midlevel processing stages predict behavioral costs for unexpected stimuli rather than effects at early stages of sensory encoding.

Objective: To evaluate the ability to disentangle the differences of visual N170 ERP, generated by facial stimuli (Anger & Fear) as well as the cognitive deterioration of SCI, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to healthy controls (HC). Method: 57 people took part in this study. Images corresponding to facial stimuli of "Anger" and "Fear" were presented to 12 HC, 14 SCI, 17 MCI, and 14 AD participants. EEG data were recorded by using a HD-EEG HydroCel with 256 channels. Results: Results showed that the amplitude of N170 can contribute in distinguishing the SCI group, since statistically significant differences were observed with the HC (p < 0.05) and the MCI group from HC (p < 0.001), as well as AD from HC (p = 0.05) during the processing of facial stimuli. Noticeable differences were also observed in the topographic distribution of the N170 amplitude, while localization analysis by using sLORETA images confirmed the activation of superior, middle-temporal, and frontal lobe brain regions. Finally, in the case of "Fear", SCI and HC demonstrated increased activation in the orbital and inferior frontal gyrus, respectively, MCI in the inferior temporal gyrus, and AD in the lingual gyrus. Conclusion: These preliminary findings suggest that the amplitude of N170 elicited after negative facial stimuli could be modulated by the decline related to pathological cognitive aging and can contribute in distinguishing HC from SCI, MCI, and AD.

Hemispheric asymmetries in rapid temporal processing at age 7 predict subsequent phonemic decoding 2 years later: A longitudinal event-related potential (ERP) study	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Tb; Asymmetric sampling in time; Temporal integration; Hemispheric asymmetry; Event-related potential; Auditory processing; Phonemic decoding; Children	AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; CLINICAL-APPLICATION; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; SYSTEM ACTIVITY; YOUNG-CHILDREN; T-COMPLEX; MATURATION; LANGUAGE; SPECIALIZATION; INTEGRATION	The asymmetric sampling in time hypothesis (AST) suggests that the left and right secondary auditory areas process auditory stimuli according to different sampling rates (Poeppel, 2003). We investigated whether asymmetries consistent with the AST are observable in children at age 7 and whether they become more pronounced at age 9. Data were collected from 50 children who attended a 2-day research program at age 7 and were followed up 2 years later. At both time points, children were presented with tone-pairs, each composed of two 50 ms, 1000 Hz, sinusoidal tones separated by inter-stimulus intervals (ISIS) of 25, 50, 100, or 200 ms. Stimuli were presented binaurally whilst the EEG was recorded. The Ta and Tb, which are components of the auditory event-related potential (ERP), were used as electrophysiological indices of auditory processing. There was no significant effect of age on Ta or Tb responses. Tb responses to the second tone of tone-pairs indicated a left-hemisphere preference for rapidly presented stimuli (50 ms ISI) and a right hemisphere preference for more slowly presented stimuli (100 and 200 ms ISI). The results provide evidence that auditory areas of the left hemisphere preferentially respond to fast temporal rates, and those of the right hemisphere preferentially respond to slow temporal rates in children at age 7 and 9. In 7-year-old children, leftward lateralisation of responses to rapidly presented tones predicted better phonemic decoding ability 2 years later, which suggests that hemispheric specialisation may be a precursor for subsequent phonemic decoding skills.

Dynamic Information Flow Based on EEG and Diffusion MRI in Stroke: A Proof-of-Principle Study	FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS			English	Article						EEG; diffusion MRI; somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP); brain dynamics; stroke	SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PARETIC UPPER-LIMB; WHITE-MATTER INTEGRITY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SOURCE RECONSTRUCTION; MOTOR RECOVERY; BRAIN; MEG; STIMULATION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY	In hemiparetic stroke, functional recovery of paretic limb may occur with the reorganization of neural networks in the brain. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have a high spatial resolution which can be used to reveal anatomical changes in the brain following a stroke. However, low temporal resolution of MRI provides less insight of dynamic changes of brain activity. In contrast, electro-neurophysiological techniques, such as electroencephalography (EEG), have an excellent temporal resolution to measure such transient events, however are hindered by its low spatial resolution. This proof-of-principle study assessed a novel multimodal brain imaging technique namely Variational Bayesian Multimodal Encephalography (VBMEG), which aims to improve the spatial resolution of EEG for tracking the information flow inside the brain and its changes following a stroke. The limitations of EEG are complemented by constraints derived from anatomical MRI and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). EEG data were acquired from individuals suffering from a stroke as well as able-bodied participants while electrical stimuli were delivered sequentially at their index finger in the left and right hand, respectively. The locations of active sources related to this stimulus were precisely identified, resulting in high Variance Accounted For (VAF above 80%). An accurate estimation of dynamic information flow between sources was achieved in this study, showing a high VAF (above 90%) in the cross-validation test. The estimated dynamic information flow was compared between chronic hemiparetic stroke and able-bodied individuals. The results demonstrate the feasibility of VBMEG method in revealing the changes of information flow in the brain after stroke. This study verified the VBMEG method as an advanced computational approach to track the dynamic information flow in the brain following a stroke. This may lead to the development of a quantitative tool for monitoring functional changes of the cortical neural networks after a unilateral brain injury and therefore facilitate the research into, and the practice of stroke rehabilitation.

Depression is mainly characterized as an emotional disorder. The object of this study is to reveal the behavioral and electrophysiological signature of emotional conflict processing in major depressive disorder (MDD) using event-related potentials (ERPs) and standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) analysis. Method: We used a face-word Stroop task involving emotional faces while recording EEG (electroencephalography) in 20 patients with MDD and 20 healthy controls (HCs). And then ERPs were extracted and the corresponding brain sources were reconstructed using sLORETA. Results: Behaviorally, subjects with MDDs manifested significantly increased Stroop effect when examining the RT difference between happy incongruent trials and happy congruent trials, compared with HC subjects. ERP results exhibited that MDDs were characterized by the attenuated difference between P300 amplitude to sad congruent stimuli and sad incongruent stimuli, as electrophysiological evidence of impaired conflict processing in subjects with MDD. The sLORETA results showed that MDD patients had a higher current density in rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rostral ACC) within N450 time window in response to happy incongruent trials than happy congruent stimuli. Moreover, HC subjects had stronger activity in right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) region in response to incongruent stimuli than congruent stimuli, revealing successful inhibition of emotional distraction in HCs, which was absent in MDDs. Conclusion: Our results indicated that rostral ACC was implicated in the processing of negative emotional distraction in MDDs, as well as impaired inhibition of taskirrelevant emotional stimuli, relative to HCs. This work furnishes novel behavioral and neurophysiological evidence that are closely related to emotional conflict among MDD patients.

At the electrophysiological level, PM has been consistently related to two event-related brain potentials (ERPs): the Feedback Related Negativity (FRN) and the P3. In a previous within-subject crossover design study, we showed that feedback's goal impact (i.e., its importance to one's goal) modulated these ERP components, yet in opposing directions. Although high goal impact was associated with a larger P3, the preceding FRN had a lower amplitude than in the low impact condition. We sought to extend these findings here by adopting a between-subjects design for a pure goal impact manipulation. Sixty-eight participants completed a Go/No Go Task while 64-channel electroencephalography was recorded concurrently. They were randomly assigned to either a high or low goal impact condition, manipulated through instructions on the supposed task's diagnosticity, while reward probability was kept similar between conditions. Replicating our previous results, we found that high goal impact yielded a marginally lower FRN, but substantially larger P3 during PM than low goal impact, without arousal or performance differences. Moreover, a principal component analysis confirmed these opposing directions of goal impact modulation. Overall, these results dovetail with the assumption that goal impact influences PM processes.

In comparison, there has been surprisingly little research on how designed notifications might be processed by the brain for the information they convey. The current study uses EEG/ERP methods to evaluate auditory notifications that were designed to cue long-distance truck drivers for task-management and driving conditions, particularly for automated driving scenarios. Two experiments separately evaluated naive students and professional truck drivers for their behavioral and brain responses to auditory notifications, which were either auditory icons or verbal commands. Our EEG/ERP results suggest that verbal commands were more readily recognized by the brain as relevant targets, but that auditory icons were more likely to update contextual working memory. Both classes of notifications did not differ on behavioral measures. This suggests that auditory icons ought to be employed for communicating contextual information and verbal commands, for urgent requests.

EEG patterns of self-paced movement imaginations towards externally-cued and internally-selected targets	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; DECISION-MAKING; BCI RESEARCH; POTENTIALS; INTENTION; STIMULI; P3; CLASSIFICATION; ACTIVATION	In this study, we investigate the neurophysiological signature of the interacting processes which lead to a single reach-and-grasp movement imagination (MI). While performing this task, the human healthy participants could either define their movement targets according to an external cue, or through an internal selection process. After defining their target, they could start the MI whenever they wanted. We recorded high density electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and investigated two neural correlates: the event-related potentials (ERPs) associated with the target selection, which reflect the perceptual and cognitive processes prior to the MI, and the movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs), associated with the planning of the self-paced MI. We found differences in frontal and parietal areas between the late ERP components related to the internally-driven selection and the externally-cued process. Furthermore, we could reliably estimate the MI onset of the self-paced task. Next, we extracted MRCP features around the MI onset to train classifiers of movement vs. rest directly on self-paced MI data. We attained performance significantly higher than chance level for both time-locked and asynchronous classification. These findings contribute to the development of more intuitive brain-computer interfaces in which movement targets are defined internally and the movements are self-paced.

J	Kirchner, EA; Kim, SK				Kirchner, Elsa A.; Kim, Su Kyoung			Multi-Tasking and Choice of Training Data Influencing Parietal ERP Expression and Single-Trial Detection-Relevance for Neuroscience and Clinical Applications	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						P300; prospective positivity; single-trial classification; classifier transfer; human-machine interaction	MENTAL WORKLOAD; DUAL-TASK; P300; POTENTIALS; INTERFACE; COMMUNICATION; TRACKING	Event-related potentials (ERPs) are often used in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for communication or system control for enhancing or regaining control for motor-disabled persons. Especially results from single-trial EEG classification approaches for BCIs support correlations between single-trial ERP detection performance and ERP expression. Hence, BCIs can be considered as a paradigm shift contributing to new methods with strong influence on both neuroscience and clinical applications. Here, we investigate the relevance of the choice of training data and classifier transfer for the interpretability of results from single-trial ERP detection. In our experiments, subjects performed a visual-motor oddball task with motor-task relevant infrequent (targets), motor-task irrelevant infrequent (deviants), and motor-task irrelevant frequent (standards) stimuli. Under dual-task condition, a secondary senso-motor task was performed, compared to the simple-task condition. For evaluation, average ERP analysis and single-trial detection analysis with different numbers of electrodes were performed. Further, classifier transfer was investigated between simple and dual task. Parietal positive ERPs evoked by target stimuli (but not by deviants) were expressed stronger under dual-task condition, which is discussed as an increase of task emphasis and brain processes involved in task coordination and change of task set. Highest classification performance was found for targets irrespective whether all 62, 6 or 2 parietal electrodes were used. Further, higher detection performance of targets compared to standards was achieved under dual-task compared to simple-task condition in case of training on data from 2 parietal electrodes corresponding to results of ERP average analysis. Classifier transfer between tasks improves classification performance in case that training took place on more varying examples (from dual task). In summary, we showed that P300 and overlaying parietal positive ERPs can successfully be detected while subjects are performing additional ongoing motor activity. This supports single-trial detection of ERPs evoked by target events to, e.g., infer a patient's attentional state during therapeutic intervention.

To test for potential influences of early low-level mechanisms on symmetry perception, we used isoluminant, achromatic, and combined (color + luminance) patterns in a psychophysical and an event-related-potential (ERP) experiment. In the psychophysical experiment, pattern contrast was fixed at individual symmetry-discrimination threshold. Participants then judged whether a pattern was symmetric or random. Stimuli at isoluminance were associated with a large bias toward symmetry, achromatic stimuli introduced the opposite bias, and stimuli containing a balance of both color and luminance were perceived without bias. These findings are in line with distinct contrast sensitivity functions for color and luminance, with color providing low-frequency information useful for symmetry detection and luminance providing high-frequency information useful for detection of detail. The subsequent ERP experiment was run at high contrasts to assess processing of symmetry in suprathreshold conditions. Sustained posterior negativity, a symmetry-sensitive ERP component, was observed in all conditions and showed the expected dependence on symmetry. However, interactions between symmetry and contrast type were not observed. In conclusion, while our findings at threshold support models that propose an important contribution of low-level mechanisms to symmetry perception, at suprathreshold these low-level contributions do not persist. Therefore, under everyday viewing conditions, symmetry perception engages a relatively broad cortical network that is not constrained by low-level inputs.

However, the role of the norepinephrine system during task switching is largely enigmatic, despite neurobiological considerations make it likely that the norepinephrine system likely plays an important role. Theoretical considerations also suggest that the norepinephrine system mainly modulates task-switching processes when these rely upon working memory mechanisms. This topic was examined in the current system neurophysiological study integrating event-related potential (ERP) with pupil diameter data as a proximate the norepinephrine system activity. Combined with source localization methods, human brain structure, brain function, and phasic modulations by an important neurobiological system were integrated. The results show that cognitive-neurophysiological subprocesses during the actual switching processes, reflected by the N2 and P3 ERP components, are not modulated by the norepinephrine system. Rather, this system modulates preparatory processes in the fore period of stimuli signaling possible switches of response sets. The source localization results show that this is achieved by modulating neural processes in the temporo-parietal junction (BA40). Importantly, these phasic modulatory effects of the norepinephrine system were only evident when working memory processes had to be used to guide the selection of the appropriate responses for task switching.

The advantages of ECoG-based language mapping over the gold-standard stimulation include: (i) lack of stimulation-induced seizures, (ii) better sensitivity of localization of language areas in young children, and (iii) shorter patient participant time. Despite its potential utility, ECoG-based language mapping is far less commonly practiced than stimulation mapping. Here, we have provided video presentations to explain, point-by-point, our own hardware setting and time-frequency analysis procedures. We also have provided standardized auditory stimuli, in multiple languages, ready to be used for ECoG-based language mapping. Finally, we discussed the technical aspects of ECoG-based mapping, including its pitfalls, to facilitate appropriate interpretation of the data.

Relationships between behavioral and single-trial target detection performance with magnetoencephalography	2018 40TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 18-21, 2018	Honolulu, HI	IEEE Engn Med & Biol			EMOTION; MODEL; P300	Target detection during serial visual presentation tasks is an active research topic in the brain-computer interface (BCI) community as this type of paradigm allows to take advantage of event-related potentials (ERPs) through electroencephalography (EEG) recordings to enhance the accuracy of target detection. The detection of brain evoked responses at the single-trial level remains a challenging task and can be exploited in various applications. Typical non-invasive BCIs based on event-related brain responses use EEG. In clinical settings, brain signals recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG) can be advantageously used thanks to their high spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we address the problem of the relationships between behavioral performance and single-trial detection by considering a task with different levels of difficulty. We consider images of faces with six different facial expressions (anger, disgust, fear, neutrality, sadness, and happiness). We consider MEG signals recorded on ten healthy participants in six sessions where targets were one of the six types of facial expressions in each session. The results support the conclusion that a high performance can be obtained at the single-trial level (AUC = 0:903 +/- 0:045), and that the performance is correlated with the behavioral performance (reaction time and hit rate).

A framework for the extended monitoring of levels of cognitive function in unresponsive patients	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SUBJECTS OWN NAME; BRAIN POTENTIAL ERP; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; IMPAIRED CONSCIOUSNESS; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; COMATOSE PATIENTS; NEURAL RESPONSES; P300; DISORDERS; N400	Generally, prognostication of coma outcome currently combines behavioral, reflex, and possibly neuroimaging tests that are interpreted by an attending physician. Electroencephalography, particularly, event-related brain potentials (ERP) have received attention due to evidence demonstrating the positive predictive value of certain ERP including the mismatch negativity (MMN) and the P3a, for coma emergence. We describe a set of ERP paradigms designed to require and reflect increasing levels of cognitive processing with the added objective of determining the influence of each paradigm's context strength on its ability to elicit ERPs. These paradigms were then used without explicit instructions to participants to attend to the stimuli to determine which paradigms possessed sufficient context "strength" to elicit ERPs in the absence of active participation on the part of the subject; a circumstance often encountered in brain injury patients. These paradigms were then validated on two groups of adults-younger and older, and the difference due to active participation was validated on another group of younger adults. Results show that paradigms with stronger stimulus context features performed better than those with weaker contexts, and that older adults generally had significantly attenuated and delayed responses compared to younger adults. Based on these findings, it is recommended the use of the auditory oddball paradigm that includes novel stimuli to elicit the mismatch negativity and P300, and semantic violation sentences to elicit the N400. These findings also reinforce the procedure of instructing participants about the requirements of a protocol-regardless of the patient's diagnosis or apparent state-in order to help those who are able to attend to show the most robust responses possible.

Testing neurophysiological markers related to fear-potentiated startle	PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH			English	Article						Fear-potentiated startle; P100; Late positive potential; Fear inhibition; Fear discrimination	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DEPRESSED ADOLESCENTS; PTSD; INHIBITION; SYMPTOMS; EMOTION; EXTINCTION; REACTIVITY; SEVERITY	Fear-potentiated startle (FPS) paradigms provide insight into fear learning mechanisms that contribute to impairment among individuals with posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Electrophysiology also has provided insight into these mechanisms through the examination of event-related potentials (ERPs) such as the P100 and LPP. It remains unclear, however, whether the P100 and LPP may be related to fear learning processes within the FPS paradigm. To this end, we tested differences in ERP amplitudes for conditioned stimuli associated (CS +) and not associated (CS-) with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) during fear acquisition. Participants included 54 female undergraduate students (mean age = 20.26). The FPS response was measured via electromyography of the orbicularis oculi muscle. EEG data were collected during the FPS paradigm. While the difference between CS + and CS- P100 amplitude was not significant, LPP amplitudes were significantly enhanced following the CS + relative to CS-. Furthermore, the LPP difference wave (CS + minus CS-) was associated with FPS scores for the CS- during the later portion of fear acquisition. These findings suggest that conditioned stimuli may have altered emotional encoding (LPP) during the FPS paradigm. Thus, the LPP may be a promising neurophysiological marker that is related to fear learning processes.

Violating environmental expectations (e.g., a toothbrush in the fridge) induces a late event-related negativity of the event-related potential/ERP. This N400 ERP has not only been linked to the semantic processing of language, but also to objects and scenes. Inconsistent object-scene relationships are additionally associated with an earlier negative deflection of the EEG signal between 250 and 350 ms. This N300 is hypothesized to reflect pre-semantic perceptual processes. To investigate whether these two components are truly separable or if the early object-scene integration activity (250-350 ms) shares certain levels of processing with the late neural correlates of meaning processing (350-500 ms), we used time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) where a classifier trained at one time point in a trial (e.g., during the N300 time window) is tested at every other time point (i.e., including the N400 time window). Forty participants were presented with semantic inconsistencies, in which an object was inconsistent with a scene's meaning. Replicating previous findings, our manipulation produced significant N300 and N400 deflections. MVPA revealed above chance decoding performance for classifiers trained during time points of the N300 component and tested during later time points of the N400, and vice versa. This provides no evidence for the activation of two separable neurocognitive processes following the violation of context-dependent predictions in visual scene perception. Our data supports the early appearance of high-level, context-sensitive processes in visual cognition.

J	Kim, S; White, A; Scalzo, F; Collier, D				Kim, Sunghan; White, Austin; Scalzo, Fabien; Collier, David			Elastic net ensemble classifier for event-related potential based automatic spelling	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Brain computer interface; Elastic net regression method; Ensemble classifiers; Event-related potentials; Data sparsity; Oddball paradigm; P300	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; MENTAL PROSTHESIS; COMMUNICATION; REGRESSION; SELECTION	Background: Brain-computer interface (BCI) refers to a direct communication between the brain and an object to be controlled by information embedded in various signals originated from the brain. Electro-encephalogram (EEG) is the most common brain signal modality due to its noninvasiveness, ease-of-use, and high time-resolution. P300-based automatic spelling is the most celebrated EEG-based BCI system, which allows its user to relay a message by just staying focused on letters and numbers displayed on a screen. The objectives of this work are (1) to introduce a novel P300 detection algorithm and (2) to compare its performance against the best current practice algorithm for P300 detection. Results: Four volunteers tried to spell letters, "PIRATES", using our automatic spelling system after proper training. Our results indicate that the proposed P300 detection algorithm can speed up the automatic spelling process since it requires a smaller number of flashing sequences than the best current practice algorithm does to recognize target event-related potentials. While the proposed P300 detection algorithm performs better than the best current practice algorithm, it does not necessarily require a heavy computational burden. Conclusion: We designed a novel P300 detection algorithm assuming that the sparsity of EEG signals could be effectively utilized to detect target event-related potentials such as P300. Our pilot study results indicate that utilizing the sparsity of EEG signals can improve the automatic spelling experience. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wu, QJ; Zeng, Y; Zhang, C; Tong, L; Yan, B				Wu, Qunjian; Zeng, Ying; Zhang, Chi; Tong, Li; Yan, Bin			An EEG-Based Person Authentication System with Open-Set Capability Combining Eye Blinking Signals	SENSORS			English	Article						person authentication; EEG; eye blinking; multi-task; score fusion; open-set authentication; permanence capability	VISUAL SELF-REPRESENTATION; BRAIN; RECOGNITION; BIOMETRICS; COMPLEXITY	The electroencephalogram (EEG) signal represents a subject's specific brain activity patterns and is considered as an ideal biometric given its superior forgery prevention. However, the accuracy and stability of the current EEG-based person authentication systems are still unsatisfactory in practical application. In this paper, a multi-task EEG-based person authentication system combining eye blinking is proposed, which can achieve high precision and robustness. Firstly, we design a novel EEG-based biometric evoked paradigm using self-or non-self-face rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). The designed paradigm could obtain a distinct and stable biometric trait from EEG with a lower time cost. Secondly, the event-related potential (ERP) features and morphological features are extracted from EEG signals and eye blinking signals, respectively. Thirdly, convolutional neural network and back propagation neural network are severally designed to gain the score estimation of EEG features and eye blinking features. Finally, a score fusion technology based on least square method is proposed to get the final estimation score. The performance of multi-task authentication system is improved significantly compared to the system using EEG only, with an increasing average accuracy from 92.4% to 97.6%. Moreover, open-set authentication tests for additional imposters and permanence tests for users are conducted to simulate the practical scenarios, which have never been employed in previous EEG-based person authentication systems. A mean false accepted rate (FAR) of 3.90% and a mean false rejected rate (FRR) of 3.87% are accomplished in open-set authentication tests and permanence tests, respectively, which illustrate the open-set authentication and permanence capability of our systems.

Although the interrelation of incoming information and resulting behavioural (motor) effects is well-known to depend on gain control mechanisms, the causal role of sensory gain modulation for response inhibition is elusive. We investigate it using a somatosensory response inhibition (Go/Nogo) task and examine the effects of parietal (somatosensory) cathodal and sham tDCS stimulation on a behavioural and neurophysiological level. For the latter, we combine event-related potential (ERP) and source localization analyses. Behavioural results reveal that cathodal stimulation leads to superior inhibition performance as compared to sham stimulation depending on the intensity of tDCS stimulation. The neurophysiological data show that an early (perceptual) subprocess of the Nogo-N2 ERP-component is differentially modulated by the type of stimulation but not a later (response-related) Nogo-N2 subcomponent. Under cathodal stimulation, the early N2 amplitude is reduced and the right inferior frontal gyrus (BA45) is less active. Cathodal tDCS likely enhances inhibition performance via decreasing the efficiency of gain control and the impact of sensory stimuli to trigger prepotent responses. Thereby, response inhibition processes, associated with structures of the response inhibition network, become less demanded.

Methods: The study recorded 85 subjects (39 aMCI patients and 46 their matched controls) with a 64channel electroencephalogram (EEG). Subjects performed 0-and 1-back tasks. Results: Compared to HC, aMCI patients showed reduced accuracy, delayed mean correct response time (RT) and decreased P300 amplitude at central-parietal and parietal electrodes. A mediation analysis indicated that higher CR reduced neural inefficiency, which might be associated with better task performance in HC. However, no correlation was detected between CR and neural inefficiency in aMCI patients, whereas higher CR was still related to enhanced accuracy and prolonged RT in aMCI patients. Conclusions: The present study reported that higher CR could contribute to better task performance via down-regulating neural inefficiency in HC. In addition, higher CR might modulate attention processes in aMCI via a way distinct from that in HC, and eventually result in better task performance. Significance: The study provided evidence for that improving CR might lower cognitive impairment of healthy elderly and aMCI patients. (C) 2017 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

We expected to find dissociative effects for both factors. The behavioural results showed that the fraction of words perceived as emotional increases with increasing arousal or subjective significance. The electrophysiological (EEG) results showed that both factors influence ERP amplitudes. General effects of subjective significance were found for early (60-120ms and 120-250ms, low subjective significant stimuli evoked higher amplitude than other conditions) and late (350-490ms, high subjective significant stimuli evoked higher amplitude than other conditions) time ranges. Localised arousal effects were found in 250-350ms and 350-490ms time ranges at posterior (amplitude for high arousing stimuli was less positive than for other conditions) and left frontal ROIs (diverse pattern). Localised subjective significance effects were found for the 350-490ms time range at the posterior ROIs (amplitude for high subjective significant stimuli was more positive than for other conditions). The results of this study suggest that the effects of arousal reported in earlier studies might account for a more complex form of activation that was recently postulated, namely subjective significance.

Late deviance detection in rats is reduced, while early deviance detection is augmented by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Mismatch negativity (MMN); MK-801; N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor; Rat; Schizophrenia; Predictive coding	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY GENERATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PREDICTION-ERROR; MMN REDUCTION; MODEL; SCHIZOPHRENIA; RESPONSES; KETAMINE; INTERNEURONS; DEFICITS	One of the most robust electrophysiological features of schizophrenia is reduced mismatch negativity, a component of the event related potential (ERP) induced by rare and unexpected stimuli in an otherwise regular pattern. Emerging evidence suggests that mismatch negativity (MMN) is not the only ERP index of deviance detection in the mammalian brain and that sensitivity to deviant sounds in a regular background can be observed at earlier latencies in both the human and rodent brain. Pharmacological studies in humans and rodents have previously found that MMN reductions similar to those seen in schizophrenia can be elicited by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism, an observation in agreement with the hypothesised role of NMDA receptor hypofunction in schizophrenia pathogenesis. However, it is not known how NMDA receptor antagonism affects early deviance detection responses. Here, we show that NMDA antagonism impacts both early and late deviance detection responses. By recording EEG in awake, freely-moving rats in a drug-free condition and after varying doses of NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801, we found the hypothesised reduction of deviance detection for a late, negative potential (N55). However, the amplitude of an early component, P13, as well as deviance detection evident in the same component, were increased by NMDA receptor antagonism. These findings indicate that late deviance detection in rats is similar to human MMN, but the surprising effect of MK-801 in increasing ERP amplitudes as well as deviance detection at earlier latencies suggests that future studies in humans should examine ERPs over early latencies in schizophrenia and after NMDA antagonism.

Sensory hypersensitivity predicts enhanced attention capture by faces in the early development of ASD	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Autism; Sensory hypersensitivity; Social attention; Salience network; Infant; EEG	AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; YOUNG-CHILDREN; TYPICAL DEVELOPMENT; BIOLOGICAL SENSITIVITY; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; 6-MONTH-OLD INFANTS; ERP RESPONSES; HIGH-RISK; TODDLERS; QUESTIONNAIRE	Sensory sensitivity is prevalent among young children with ASD, but its relation to social communication impairment is unclear. Recently, increased sensory hypersensitivity has been linked to greater activity of the neural salience network (Green et al., 2016). Increased neural sensitivity to stimuli, especially social stimuli, could provide greater opportunity for social learning and improved outcomes. Consistent with this framework, in Experiment 1 we found that parent report of greater sensory hypersensitivity at 2 years in toddlers with ASD (N = 27) was predictive of increased neural responsiveness to social stimuli (larger amplitude event-related potential/ERP responses to faces at P1, P400 and Nc) at 4 years, and this in turn was related to parent report of increased social approach at 4 years. In Experiment 2, parent report of increased perceptual sensitivity at 6 months in infants at low and high familial risk for ASD (N = 35) predicted larger ERP P1 amplitude to faces at 18 months. Increased sensory hypersensitivity in early development thus predicted greater attention capture by faces in later development, and this related to more optimal social behavioral development. Sensory hypersensitivity may index a child's ability to benefit from supportive environments during development. Early sensory symptoms may not always be developmentally problematic for individuals with ASD.	[Jones, E. J.

However, EEG recordings are always contaminated with artifacts from different sources other than neurons, which renders EEG data analysis more difficult, and which potentially results in misleading findings. Therefore, it is essential for many medical and practical applications to remove these artifacts in the preprocessing stage before analyzing EEG data. In the last thirty years, various methods have been developed to remove different types of artifacts from contaminated EEG data; still though, there is no standard method that can be used optimally, and therefore, the research remains attractive as well as challenging. This paper presents an extensive overview of the existing methods for ocular, muscle, and cardiac artifact identification and removal with their comparative advantages and limitations. We also reviewed the schemes developed for validating the performances of algorithms with simulated and real EEG data. In future studies, researchers should focus not only on the combining of different methods with multiple processing stages for efficient removal of artifactual interferences but also on the development of standard criteria for validation of recorded EEG signals.

Recognition memory (old/new effect) involves cognitive subcomponents-familiarity and recollection-which may be temporally and spatially dissociated in the brain. Food words may evoke additional attentional salience which may interact with the old/new effect. Methods: Sixteen satiated female participants undertook a word recognition task consisting of an encoding phase (learning of presented words, 40 food-related and 40 food neutral) and a test phase (recognition of previously learned words and new words). Simultaneously recorded 64-channel EEG data were decomposed into mutually independent components using the Infomax algorithm in EEGLAB. The components were localized using single dipole fitting using a four-shell BESA head model. The resulting (nonartefactual) components with <15% residual variance were clustered across subjects using the kmeans algorithm resulting in five meaningful clusters localized to fronto-parietal regions. Repeated-measures ANOVA was employed to test main effects (old/new and food relevance) and their interaction on cluster time courses. Results: Early task-relevant old/new effects were localized to the medial frontal gyrus (MFG) and later old/new effects to the right parietal regions (precuneus). Food-related (nontask-relevant) salience effects were localized to bilateral parietal regions (left precuneus and right postcentral gyrus). Food-related salience interacted with task relevance, the old/new effect in MFG being significant only for food-neutral words highlighting central the role of MFG as the converging site of endogenous and exogenous salience inputs. Conclusion: Our results indicate ICA to be a valid technique to decompose complex neurophysiological signals involving multiple cognitive processes and implicate the fronto-parietal network as an important attentional network for processing salience and task demands.

Learning in this paradigm accompanies changes in oscillatory activity in forebrain regions, some of which are loci of pathogenic changes in prodromal AD stages. These observations motivated us to examine how cortical event-related potentials (ERPs) during this paradigm are affected by two features of the asymptomatic, AD-related brain abnormality, entorhinal tau accumulation and mild cholinergic deficit. Adult rats received viral overexpression of P301L mutant human tau in the entorhinal cortex, low-dose scopolamine treatment, or both. Electroencephalograms were recorded with epidural electrodes on the surface of the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices during differential and reversal trace eyeblink conditioning. All rats developed conditioned responses to one of two stimuli (auditory or visual) paired with mild eyelid shock (CS+), but not to the other stimulus presented alone (CS-). They were also able to adjust the response when the stimulus contingency was reversed. With learning, the amplitude of several ERP components in the frontal and temporal cortices came to differentiate the CS+ from CS-. Scopolamine affected the learning-related change in temporal P2 and other learning-unrelated components in three regions. Entorhinal tau overexpression primary affected the amplitude of temporal visual ERPs and learning-unrelated frontal and temporal auditory ERP components. The double manipulation only affected two components of temporal auditory ERPs. Thus, cortical ERPs during differential associative learning are sensitive to asymptomatic brain abnormality associated with AD.

The cohort can consist of a handful of subjects for small studies to hundreds or thousands of subjects in open datasets. While there exist various online resources to get started with the analysis of magnetoencephalography (MEG) or electroencephalography (EEG) data, such educational materials are usually restricted to the analysis of a single subject. This is in part because data from larger group studies are harder to share, but also analyses of such data often require subject-specific decisions which are hard to document. This work presents the results obtained by the reanalysis of an open dataset from Wakeman and Henson (2015) using the MNE software package. The analysis covers preprocessing steps, quality assurance steps, sensor space analysis of evoked responses, source localization, and statistics in both sensor and source space. Results with possible alternative strategies are presented and discussed at different stages such as the use of high-pass filtering versus baseline correction, tSSS vs. SSS, the use of a minimum norm inverse vs. LCMV beamformer, and the use of univariate or multivariate statistics. This aims to provide a comparative study of different stages of M/EEG analysis pipeline on the same dataset, with open access to all of the scripts necessary to reproduce this analysis.

During childhood, one of these manipulation processes, namely active controlled retrieval, improves significantly between the age of 6 to 10, suggesting that the neuronal network supporting this function undergoes substantial maturational changes. The present study examined the neural activity of 14 healthy children and 14 adults while performing an active controlled retrieval task. Results showed differences in brain activity according to active controlled retrieval in a 300-500 ms window corresponding to the retrieval period. Active controlled retrieval was associated with a P3b-like potential in parietal sites for both children and adults. In fronto-central sites, children demonstrated a "N400 like" potential associated with active retrieval processing. These results are discussed in terms of maturational development.

Here, we investigated whether Western musical syntax of different complexities can be implicitly acquired by non-native listeners growing up in China. This study used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure how the neural responses to musical sequences that either follow a simple rule, i.e., finite state grammar (FSG), or a complex rule, i.e., phrase structure grammar (PSG), are affected. We tested three groups of Chinese listeners who varied in their proficiency and experience in Western music. Only the high-proficiency group had received formal Western musical training, whereas the low- and moderate-proficiency groups varied in their degree of exposure to Western music. The results showed that in the FSG condition, the event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked by regular and irregular final chords were not significantly different in the low-proficiency group. In contrast, in the moderate- and high-proficiency groups, the irregular final chords evoked an ERAN-N5 biphasic response. In the PSG condition, however, only the high-proficiency group showed an ERAN-N5 biphasic response evoked by irregular final chords. This study provides evidence that although simple structures of Western music, such as FSG, can be acquired by long-term implicit learning, the acquisition of more complex structures, such as PSG, merely from exposure to western music may not be as easy.

Mothers' neural responses to infant faces are associated with activation of the maternal care system and observed intrusiveness with their own child	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Parenting quality; Event-related potentials; P1; P2; LPP; Mothers	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FACIAL ATTRACTIVENESS; CAREGIVING QUALITY; PARENTAL STATUS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ATTACHMENT; SENSITIVITY; BEHAVIOR; FATHERS; EXPRESSION	Certain infant facial characteristics, referred to as baby schema, are thought to automatically trigger parenting behavior and affective orientation toward infants. Electroencephalography (EEG) is well suited to assessing the intuitive nature and temporal dynamics of parenting responses, due to its millisecond temporal resolution. Little is known, however, about the relations between neural processing of infant cues and actual parenting behavior in a naturalistic setting. In the present study we examined the event-related potentials (ERPs) of mothers (N = 33) watching infant faces of varying attractiveness, in relation to activation of the maternal care system and the mothers' observed parenting behavior (sensitivity, nonintrusiveness) with their own child (2-6 years old). The results revealed that, irrespective of the cuteness of the infant face, mothers' neural processing of infant faces involved both early P1 and P2 components (related to orienting/detecting processes) and late positive potentials (LPPs; related to more controlled cognitive evaluation/attentional engagement). Increased early detection and processing of infant faces (reflected by P1 and P2 activity) was related to increased activation of the parental care system. In later stages of face processing, increased attentional engagement with infant faces (as reflected by LPP activity) was associated with more intrusiveness of a mother with her own child during interaction. These findings suggest that individual variations in responses to infant stimuli are associated with individual differences in parental care system activation and parenting quality. Furthermore, the parental care system might be activated relatively automatically, but actual parenting and caregiving behavior requires more conscious control.

A dimensional examination of eating disorder symptoms in relation to cognitive processing: An event-related potentials study	JOURNAL OF APPLIED BIOBEHAVIORAL RESEARCH			English	Article						biopsychosocial; eating attitudes; eating disorders; neuroscience research; psychopathology	QUESTIONNAIRE EDE-Q; GO NOGO TASKS; ANOREXIA-NERVOSA; ERP COMPONENTS; FOOD STIMULI; P300; NORMS; RECOGNITION; PERFORMANCE; INHIBITION	Identifying neurocognitive mechanisms involved in individuals experiencing eating disorder (ED) symptoms may be important for preventing EDs and improving rates of recovery. The present pilot study assessed how cognitive functioning may be associated with ED symptoms in college students (N = 41). Cognitive functioning was examined using electroencephalography during an auditory response inhibition task to measure the P3 component of event-related potentials. Multiple regression analysis revealed that longer P3 latencies in the frontal region of the cortex were significantly and linearly associated with greater ED symptoms F(3, 37) = 13.62, p < .001, R-2 = 0.525, Adj. R-2 = 0.486. These pilot findings build upon prior work in clinical samples in that they indicate that functional brain differences are observable across a wide span of ED symptoms, not just in those with diagnosed ED. The present findings provide support for further exploration of changes in P3 latencies among individuals with ED symptoms to enhance our understanding of neural mechanisms that may pertain to the dimensional aspects of disordered eating attitudes and behaviors.

Enhancing Natural Reward Responsiveness Among Opioid Users Predicts Chronic Pain Relief: EEG Analyses From a Trial of Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement	JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR SOCIAL WORK AND RESEARCH			English	Article						chronic pain; late positive potential; mindfulness; opioid; reward	OPIATE ADDICTION; DRUG CUES; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; THERAPEUTIC MECHANISMS; BRAIN MECHANISMS; ERP FINDINGS; MISUSE; MEDITATION; EMOTION; DYSREGULATION	Objective: Although opioid-treated chronic pain patients evidence blunted responsiveness to natural rewards, focusing on naturally rewarding stimuli can produce analgesia in these patients. A prior randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated that a social work interventionMindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE)enhanced natural reward processing as indicated by event-related brain potentials (ERPs). The aim of the present study was to perform a secondary data analysis on ERPs collected in this RCT to explore whether improvements in electrocortical response to natural reward predicted pain relief. Method: The sample for this secondary analysis included opioid-treated chronic pain patients with complete ERP data (N = 29). Participants were randomized to 8 weeks of MORE or a support group control condition, and ERPs to images representing naturally rewarding stimuli were measured before and after 8 weeks of treatment. We explored associations between changes in brain reward response, chronic pain symptoms, and pain coping. Results: Increases in ERP reward response were significantly associated with decreased pain severity from pretreatment to posttreatment (beta= -.48, p = .007) and improvements in pain catastrophizing (beta = -.36, p = .05) and diverting attention as a means of pain coping (beta = .38, p = .043). Increased ERP reward response predicted decreased pain interference by 3-month follow-up (beta = -.37, p = .048). Conclusions: Chronic pain may be alleviated by enhancing brain response to natural rewards.

An example of this influence is demonstrated by the McGurk-effect where illusory (cross-modal) sounds are perceived following presentation of incongruent audio-visual (AV) stimuli. Previous studies report the engagement of specific cortical modules that are spatially distributed during cross-modal perception. However, the limits of the underlying representational space and the cortical network mechanisms remain unclear. In this combined psychophysical and electroencephalography (EEG) study, the participants reported their perception while listening to a set of synchronous and asynchronous incongruent AV stimuli. We identified the neural representation of subjective cross-modal perception at different organizational levels - at specific locations in sensor space and at the level of the large-scale brain network estimated from between-sensor interactions. We identified an enhanced positivity in the event-related potential peak around 300 ms following stimulus onset associated with cross-modal perception. At the spectral level, cross-modal perception involved an overall decrease in power at the frontal and temporal regions at multiple frequency bands and at all AV lags, along with an increased power at the occipital scalp region for synchronous AV stimuli. At the level of large-scale neuronal networks, enhanced functional connectivity at the gamma band involving frontal regions serves as a marker of AV integration. Thus, we report in one single study that segregation of information processing at individual brain locations and integration of information over candidate brain networks underlie multisensory speech perception.

Nonetheless, compared to augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices requiring muscular control, BCIs provide relatively slow communication. Therefore, implementing techniques improving BCI speed and accuracy is important. Previous studies indicate that facial stimuli elicit N170 and N400 components, in addition to the P300 component associated with P300 BCI. These additional components can increase speed and accuracy. Our study investigated the influence of image size and content using four conditions: large face, small face, large non-face, and small non-face. We predicted faces would provide higher accuracy than non-face stimuli and larger stimuli would provide higher accuracy than small stimuli. We found no significant difference in performance between conditions; however, significant waveform differences were found in each condition.	[Kellicut-Jones, M. R.; Sellers, E.

Conflict resolution can disrupt movement preparation and lead to "errors" in motor programming. These "errors" are physiologically useful by enabling us to adapt our motor behavior to situations with conflicting information. The objective of the present study was to analyze the patterns of cortical activation associated with motor programming errors and the corresponding error corrections. Incongruent flankers around a target arrow were used to trigger errors in anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) prior to gait initiation; i.e. perturbed motor programming but normal execution. Thirty healthy adults performed a gait initiation task. The event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related desynchronization (ERD) after target presentation were analyzed according to the presence or absence of an APA error. The ERP was similar in both conditions, except that the Ne and P300 peak latencies were longer for APA errors. Motor programming errors during gait initiation were characterized by longer, less intense low-beta-band ERD over the sensorimotor cortex and alpha ERS followed by stronger alpha ERD during errors. APA errors were associated with a specific alpha/beta oscillation profile over the sensorimotor cortex; these beta oscillations might be sensitive markers of non-conscious motor error and correction monitoring.

Most of the previous studies are focused in building an individual discrimination model for every subject (subject dependent model). Building subject-independent models is a harder problem due to the high data variability between different subjects and different experiments with the same subject. This paper explores, for the first time, the Factor Analysis as an efficient technique to extract temporal and spatial EEG features suitable to build brain-computer interface for decoding human emotions across various subjects. Our findings show that early waves (temporal window of 200-400 ms after the stimulus onset) carry more information about the valence of the emotion. Also, spatial location of features, with a stronger impact on the emotional valence, occurs in the parietal and occipital regions of the brain. All discrimination models (NN, SVM, kNN, and RF) demonstrate better discrimination rate of the positive valence. These results match closely experimental psychology hypothesis that, during early periods after the stimulus presentation, the brain response-to images with highly positive valence-is stronger.

The present study investigated the interplay of age, task workload, and mental effort using EEG measures and a proactive driving task, in which 16 younger and 16 older participants had to keep a virtual car on track on a curvy road. Total oscillatory power and relative power in Theta and Alpha bands were analyzed, as well as event-related potentials (ERPs) to task-irrelevant regular and irregular sound stimuli. Steering variability and Theta power increased with increasing task load (i.e., with shaper bends of the road), while Alpha power decreased. This pattern of workload and mental effort was found in both age groups. However, only in the older group a relationship between steering variability and Theta power occurred: better steering performance was associated with higher Theta power, reflecting higher mental effort. Higher Theta power while driving was also associated with a stronger increase in reported subjective fatigue in the older group. In the younger group, lower steering variability came along with lower ERP responses to deviant sound stimuli, reflecting reduced processing of task-irrelevant environmental stimuli. In sum, better performance in proactive driving (i.e., more alert steering behavior) was associated with increased mental effort in the older group, and higher attentional focus on the task in the younger group, indicating age-specific strategies in the way younger and older drivers manage demanding (driving) tasks.

Face-sensitive N170 is also sensitive to face inversion, which has been defined as the face-inversion effect. This study aimed to directly compare the relationship between face-sensitive N170 during face perception (upright and inverted faces) and object-related N170 during object perception (two-dimensional and three-dimensional objects). More specifically, the purpose was to clarify whether face-sensitive P1 and N170 components are related to the perception of two-dimensional and three-dimensional objects. Electroencephalography was performed in participants who were shown one of the four types of stimuli: upright faces, inverted faces, two-dimensional objects, or three-dimensional objects. The results revealed that the latency of P1 for three-dimensional objects was significantly longer than that for two-dimensional objects, the latency of N170 for three-dimensional objects was significantly longer than that for two-dimensional objects, and the latency of N170 for inverted faces was significantly longer than that for upright faces. These findings suggest that face-sensitive P1 and N170 components are related to the perception of two-dimensional and three-dimensional objects. Moreover, the results suggest that, similar to the face-inversion effect of face-sensitive N170 affected by mental rotation of the face, the object-related N170 of three-dimensional objects was affected by the mental rotation of two-dimensional objects. This suggests the novel possibility that face-sensitive P1 and N170 components can be used as an index for the perception of two-dimensional and three-dimensional objects.

We tested the hypothesis that stereo input modulates the brain activity related to perceptual analyses of 3D shape configuration during image classification. High-density (256-channel) electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to record the temporal dynamics of visual shape processing under conditions of two-dimensional (2D) and 3D visual presentation. On each trial, observers made image classification judgements (Same'/'Different') to two briefly presented, multi-part, novel objects. On different-object trials, stimuli could either share volumetric parts but not the global 3D shape configuration and have different parts but the same global 3D shape configuration or differ on both aspects. Analyses using mass univariate contrasts showed that the earliest sensitivity to 2D versus 3D viewing appeared as a negative deflection over posterior locations on the N1 component between 160 and 220 ms post-stimulus onset. Subsequently, event-related potential (ERP) modulations during the N2 time window between 240 and 370 ms were linked to image classification. N2 activity reflected two distinct components - an early N2 (240-290 ms) and a late N2 (290-370 ms) - that showed different patterns of responses to 2D and 3D input and differential sensitivity to 3D object structure. The results revealed that stereo input modulates the neural correlates of 3D object shape. We suggest that this reflects differential perceptual processing of object shape under conditions of stereo or mono input. These findings challenge current theories that attribute no functional role for stereo input during 3D shape perception.

While most previous studies on temporal discounting focused their attention on the gain context, only a few explored the loss context. In the present study, both the event-related potentials (ERPs) and the graph theory analysis were employed to investigate the differences in intertemporal decision-making between the gain and loss frameworks. Our results suggested that participants preferred the short latency/small amount (SS) alternatives and exhibited a smaller discount rate in a loss context compared to a gain framework. Furthermore, our ERP data indicated that the P200 component could constitute a preliminary assessment of the decision-making, related to gain and loss. In contrast, the N2 component was associated with negative emotions and showed significantly bigger amplitudes in the loss context, when compared to the gain framework. Further analyses of brain networks suggested the loss decision-making brain network to have a larger small-worldness index given individuals' loss aversion. Taken together, intertemploral decision-making in a loss context was accompanied by a greater brain response due to the negative emotions linked to loss aversion.

As an important part of decision-making field, group decision-making has obvious advantages in fairness, scientificalness and rationality compared with individual decision-making. At the same time, the final result of group decision-making is a result from negotiation with each member of the group participated in. Based on this, this paper studies the behavior of board group decision-making investment through electroencephalogram (EEG) experiment, simulates the process of board group decision-making investment behavior, and provides theoretical guidance for the generation of enterprise investment strategy.

The generators of MMN are believed to include several different cortical regions like the bilateral temporal and the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). However, exact cortical regions associated with MMN remain controversial. In this study, we compared the number of long-distance connections induced by the standard and deviant stimuli during awake state and propofol anesthesia state to identify the cortical areas associated with the generation of MMN. In awake state, we find that deviant stimuli synchronize more information between the right frontal and temporal than standard stimuli. Moreover, we find that the deviant stimuli in awake state activate the bilateral frontal, central areas, the left temporal and parietal areas as compared to the anesthesia state, whereas the standard stimuli do not. These results suggest that, in addition to the bilateral temporal and the right IFG, the bilateral frontal and centro-parietal regions also contribute to the generation of MMN.

However, norm compliant behavior is very heterogeneous. Some people are reliably fair (voluntary compliers). Some are fair to avoid sanctions (sanction-based compliers), and some are reliably unfair (non-compliers). These types play divergent roles in society. However, they remain poorly understood. Here, we combined neural measures (resting electroencephalography and event-related potentials) and economic paradigms to better understand these types. We found that voluntary compliers are characterized by higher baseline activation in the right temporo-parietal junction, suggesting better social cognition capacity compared to sanction-based compliers and non-compliers. The latter two types are differentiated by (a) baseline activation in the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex, a brain area known to be involved in self-control processes, and (b) event-related potentials in a classic self-control task. Both results suggest that sanction-based compliers have better self-control capacity than non-compliers. These findings improve our understanding of fairness norm compliance. Broadly, our findings suggest that established training techniques that boost self-control might help non-compliers adhere to fairness norms.	[Gianotti, Lorena R.

In particular, one behavioural effect of such specialization is that human adults search for and find categories of non-human faces faster and more accurately than a specific non-human face, and vice versa for human faces. However, a recent visual search study showed that neural responses (event-related potentials, ERPs) were identical when finding either a non-human or human face. We used time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis of the EEG data from that study to investigate the dynamics of neural representations during a visual search for own-species (human) or other-species (non-human ape) faces, with greater sensitivity than traditional ERP analyses. The location of each target (i.e., right or left) could be decoded from the EEG, with similar accuracy for human and non-human faces. However, the neural patterns associated with searching for an exemplar versus a category target differed for human faces compared to non-human faces: Exemplar representations could be more reliably distinguished from category representations for human than non-human faces. These findings suggest that the other-species effect modulates the nature of representations, but preserves the attentional selection of target items based on these representations.

EEG signals have shown to elicit a positive deflection known as the P300 event related potential during odd ball experiments. BCIs based on these experiments rely on detection of the P300 potential. EEG signals are noisy, and therefore P300 detection is performed on an average of multiple trials, thus making them inappropriate for BCI applications. We propose a neural network model based on Convolutional Long Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) for single trial P300 classification. EEG data encodes both spatial and temporal information using multiple EEG sensors. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been known to capture spatial information whereas LSTMs are known to capture temporal information. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms previous CNN based approaches on raw EEG signals. The approaches were evaluated on publicly available dataset II of BCI competition III. Another dataset was recorded locally using audio beeps as stimuli to validate these approaches. The ensemble models based on CNNs and ConvLSTM are also proposed. These models perform better than individual architectures.

Brain event-related potentials to phoneme contrasts and their correlation to reading skills in school-age children	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						children; cross-linguistic; dyslexia; EEG; event-related potentials; phonology; reading; speech	EARLY LANGUAGE-ACQUISITION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; FAMILIAL RISK; PHONOLOGICAL REPRESENTATIONS; DYSLEXIC-CHILDREN; POOR READERS; RESPONSES; INFANTS; DISCRIMINATION	Development of reading skills has been shown to be tightly linked to phonological processing skills and to some extent to speech perception abilities. Although speech perception is also known to play a role in reading development, it is not clear which processes underlie this connection. Using event-related potentials (ERPs) we investigated the speech processing mechanisms for common and uncommon sound contrasts (/ba/-/da/-/ga/ and /ata/-/at: a/) with respect to the native language of school-age children in Finland and the US. In addition, a comprehensive behavioral test battery of reading and phonological processing was administered. ERPs revealed that the children could discriminate between the speech sound contrasts (place of articulation and phoneme length) regardless of their native language. No differences emerged between the Finnish and US children in their change detection responses. The brain responses to the phoneme length contrast, however, correlated robustly with reading scores in the US children, with larger responses being linked to poorer reading skills. Finnish children also showed correlations between the reading and phonological measures and ERP responses, but the pattern of results was not as clear as for the US children. The results indicate that speech perception is linked to reading skills and this link is more robust for uncommon speech sound contrasts.

Kristian			P3 amplitude attenuation secondary to increases in target-to-target interval (TTI) during spatial serial order recall: implications for EEG models of working memory function	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Serial order processing; working memory; P300; event-related potentials	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; STIMULUS INTERVAL; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; TASK-DIFFICULTY; BASAL GANGLIA; PROBABILITY; ACTIVATION; ERP	Research suggests that increasing delays in stimulus read-out can trigger declines in serial order recall accuracy due to increases in cognitive demand imposed by the delay; however, the exact neural mechanisms associated with this decline are unclear. Changes in neural resource allocation present as the ideal target and can easily be monitored by examining changes in the amplitude of an ERP component known as the P3. Changes in P3 amplitude secondary to exogenous pacing of stimulus read-out via increased target-to-target intervals (TTIs) during recall could reflect decreased neural resource allocation due to increased cognitive demand. This shift in resource allocation could result in working memory storage decay and the declines in serial order accuracy described by prior research. In order to examine this potential effect, participants were administered a spatial serial order processing task, with the recall series consisting of a series of correct ('match') or incorrect ('non-match' or 'oddball') stimuli. Moreover, the recall series included either a brief (500 ms) or extended (2000 ms) delay between stimuli. Results were significant for the presence of a P3 response to non-match stimuli for both experimental conditions, and attenuation of P3 amplitude secondary to the increase in TTI. These findings suggest that extending the delay between target recognition could increase cognitive demand and trigger a decrease in neural resource allocation that results in a decay of working memory stores.

The fundamental objective of this paper is to enhance the perceptibility of target characters by introducingmotion stimuli to classical rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) spellers that do not require any eye movement, thereby applying them to paralyzed patients with oculomotor dysfunctions. To test the feasibility of the proposed motion-based RSVP paradigm, we implemented three RSVP spellers: 1) fixed-direction motion (FM-RSVP); 2) random-directionmotion (RM-RSVP); and 3) (the conventional) non-motion stimulation (NM-RSVP), and evaluated the effect of the three different stimulation methods on spelling performance. The two motion-based stimulation methods, FM-and RM-RSVP, showed shorter P300 latency and higher P300 amplitudes (i.e., 360.4-379.6 ms; 5.5867-5.7662 mu V) than the NM-RSVP (i.e., 480.4 ms; 4.7426 mu V). This led to higher andmore stable performances for FM-and RM-RSVP spellers than NM-RSVP speller (i.e., 79.06 +/- 6.45% for NM-RSVP, 90.60 +/- 2.98% for RM-RSVP, and 92.74 +/- 2.55% for FM-RSVP). In particular, the proposed motion-based RSVP paradigm was significantly beneficial for about half of the subjects who might not accurately perceive rapidly presented static stimuli. These results indicate that the use of proposed motion-based RSVP paradigm is more beneficial for target recognitionwhen developing BCI applications for severely paralyzed patients with complex ocular dysfunctions.

This study aimed to assess the behavioral and electrophysiological signatures of attentional bias in major depressive disorder (MDD) and explore whether ERP components contain valuable information for discriminating between MDD patients and healthy controls (HCs). Methods: Electroencephalography data were collected from 17 patients with MDD and 17 HCs in a dot-probe task, with emotional-neutral pairs as experimental materials. Fourteen features related to ERP waveform shape were generated. Then, Correlated Feature Selection (CFS), ReliefF and GainRatio (GR) were applied for feature selection. For discriminating between MDDs and HCs, k-nearest neighbor (KNN), C4.5, Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) and Logistic Regression (LR) were used. Results: Behaviorally, MDD patients showed significantly shorter reaction time (RT) to valid than invalid sad trials, with significantly higher bias score for sad-neutral pairs. Analysis of split-half reliability in RT indices indicated a strong reliability in RT, while coefficients of RT bias scores neared zero. These behavioral effects were supported by ERP results. MDD patients had higher P300 amplitude with the probe replacing a sad face than a neutral face, indicating difficult attention disengagement from negative emotional faces. Meanwhile, data mining analysis based on ERP components suggested that CFS was the best feature selection algorithm. Especially for the P300 induced by valid sad trials, the classification accuracy of CFS combination with any classifier was above 85%, and the KNN (k = 3) classifier achieved the highest accuracy (94%). Conclusions: MDD patients show difficulty in attention disengagement from negative stimuli, reflected by P300. The CFS over other methods leads to a good overall performance in most cases, especially when KNN classifier is used for P300 component classification, illustrating that ERP component may be applied as a tool for auxiliary diagnosis of depression.

The present study was designed to find electrophysiological indicators of two central processes involved - segregating the speech mixture into distinct speech sequences corresponding to the two speakers, and then attending to one of the speech sequences. We generated multistable speech stimuli that were set up to create ambiguity as to whether only one or two speakers are talking. Thereby we were able to investigate three perceptual alternatives (no segregation, segregated - speaker A in the foreground, segregated speaker B in the foreground) without any confounding stimulus changes. Participants listened to a continuously repeating sequence of syllables, which were uttered alternately by two human speakers, and indicated whether they perceived the sequence as an inseparable mixture or as originating from two separate speakers. In the latter case, they distinguished which speaker was in their attentional foreground. Our data show a long-lasting eventrelated potential (ERP) modulation starting at 130 ms after stimulus onset, which can be explained by the perceptual organization of the two speech sequences into attended foreground and ignored background streams. Our paradigm extends previous work with pure-tone sequences toward speech stimuli and adds the possibility to obtain neural correlates of the difficulty to segregate a speech mixture into distinct streams.

Working memory impairment is among the earliest signs of MCI. Oscillatory analysis of working memory might be a potential tool for identifying patients at increased risk of developing dementia. Our study aimed to assess the temporospatial pattern of spectral differences during working memory maintenance between MCI patients and healthy controls and to compare the sources of oscillatory activity between the two groups. Event-related spectral perturbation of 17 MCI patients and 21 healthy control participants was studied with 128-channel EEG during the Sternberg working memory task. Source localization was performed by using the eLORETA software. Among the participants, 13 MCI and 15 control participants underwent a structural brain MRI examination. Event-related synchronization (ERS) in the alpha and beta frequency band was significantly lower in MCI patients compared to healthy control participants during retention. Both study groups showed significant memory load-related enhancement in both frequency band. In the MCI group, source localization revealed significantly attenuated beta oscillatory activity in the inferior and middle temporal gyrus, in the fusiform gyrus, and in the cuneus. Beta ERS correlated significantly with the size of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal gyrus. During the retention period, MCI is characterized by decreased alpha and beta ERS compared to controls indicating early impairment in neural networks serving working memory maintenance.

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Relationship Between Brain Data and the Outcome in Disorders of Consciousness	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Review						consciousness; improvement criteria; meta-analysis; minimally conscious state; neurophysiological markers; prognosis; publication bias; unresponsive wakefulness syndrome	SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; PERSISTENT VEGETATIVE STATE; PATIENTS OWN NAME; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; PREDICTS RECOVERY; PROGNOSTIC VALUE; CEREBRAL RESPONSE; FUNCTIONAL MRI; SLEEP PATTERNS; EFFECT SIZE	A systematic search revealed 68 empirical studies of neurophysiological [EEG, event-related brain potential (ERP), fMRI, PET] variables as potential outcome predictors in patients with Disorders of Consciousness (diagnoses Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome [UWS] and Minimally Conscious State [MCS]). Data of 47 publications could be presented in a quantitative manner and systematically reviewed. Insufficient power and the lack of an appropriate description of patient selection each characterized about a half of all publications. In more than 80% studies, neurologists who evaluated the patients' outcomes were familiar with the results of neurophysiological tests conducted before, and may, therefore, have been influenced by this knowledge. In most subsamples of datasets, effect size significantly correlated with its standard error, indicating publication bias toward positive results. Neurophysiological data predicted the transition from UWS to MCS substantially better than they predicted the recovery of consciousness (i.e., the transition from UWS or MCS to exit-MCS). A meta-analysis was carried out for predictor groups including at least three independent studies with N > 10 per predictor per improvement criterion (i.e., transition to MCS versus recovery). Oscillatory EEG responses were the only predictor group whose effect attained significance for both improvement criteria. Other perspective variables, whose true prognostic value should be explored in future studies, are sleep spindles in the EEG and the somatosensory cortical response N20. Contrary to what could be expected on the basis of neuroscience theory, the poorest prognostic effects were shown for fMRI responses to stimulation and for the ERP component P300. The meta-analytic results should be regarded as preliminary given the presence of numerous biases in the data.

This study examined event-related potentials (ERPs) in 23 patients with schizophrenia who experience auditory hallucinations and 19 healthy controls. EEG activity was recorded from 32 scalp sites positioned according to the 10-10 placement system. Linked left and right electrodes at the mastoids served as the reference. The P100, N170 and P300 were measured during an emotional facial identification task, which included neutral, joyful, sad, angry and fearful facial expressions and non-face stimuli (chairs). P100 was measured at O-1/2 and P-718. N170 was measured at P-7/8. P300 was measured at P-z. Patients with schizophrenia were slower at identifying all facial expressions, including neutral ones. They also showed less positive P100 amplitude to sad, angry and fearful facial expressions. N170 amplitudes were smaller in patients in response to neutral, joyful, sad, angry, and fearful facial expression. Patients showed less positive P300 mean amplitudes to all facial expressions, including neutral ones. Within-group comparisons showed that patients exhibited a different pattern of ERP modulation across facial expressions than controls for P100 and N170, but not for P300. Our findings are compatible with the idea that behavioural and electrophysiological face-processing deficits in schizophrenia arise from early-stage deficits in visual processing.

The present study documents that the "subject preference" strategy is also seen in the processing of a sign language, supporting the hypothesis that the "subject"-first strategy is universal and not dependent on the language modality (spoken vs. signed). Deaf signers of Austrian Sign Language (OGS) were shown videos of locally ambiguous signed sentences in SOV and OSV word orders. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data indicated higher cognitive load in response to OSV stimuli (i.e. a negativity for OSV compared to SOV), indicative of syntactic reanalysis cost. A finding that is specific to the visual modality is that the ERP (event related potential) effect reflecting linguistic reanalysis occurred earlier than might have been expected, that is, before the time point when the path movement of the disambiguating sign was visible. We suggest that in the visual modality, transitional movement of the articulators prior to the disambiguating verb position or co-occurring non-manual (face/body) markings were used in resolving the local ambiguity in OGS. Thus, whereas the processing strategy of "subject preference" is cross-modal at the linguistic level, the cues that enable the processor to apply that strategy differ in signing as compared to speech.

EEG measures of brain activity reveal that smoking-related images capture the attention of smokers outside of awareness	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						ERP; Substitution masking; Smoking; Attention; Craving	OBJECT-SUBSTITUTION MASKING; VISUAL-ATTENTION; SOCIAL DRINKERS; ALCOHOL CUES; NEURAL BASIS; BIAS; ADDICTION; QUESTIONNAIRE; PERCEPTION; TASK	The capture of attention by substance-related stimuli in dependent users is a major factor in the maintenance and/or cessation of substance use. The present study examined the automaticity of this process in smokers, as well as the effects of craving. Event-related potential (ERP) measures of spatial-attention allocation (N2pc) and extended target processing (SPCN) were isolated during an object-substitution masking (OSM) task that disrupted the perceptual visibility of smoking-related and office-related targets. Each participant completed two experimental sessions: one in which they were deprived of nicotine for a period of several hours prior to the session (craving), and one before which they were allowed to smoke (non-craving). Results were consistent with an account of automatic attentional capture by smoking-related images outside of awareness, with masked trials yielding a selective enhancement of the attention-sensitive N2pc in response to these images, but in the absence of a corresponding behavioral enhancement on those trials. Finally, the manipulation of craving appeared to increase the overall task demand, yielding an enhancement of the SPCN component across target type and masking conditions. Together, these results suggest that smoking-related visual stimuli in the environment can capture the attention of smokers outside of awareness, in what seems to be an automatic process.

To characterize this processing as it occurs in ecological settings, we focused on unconstrained visual explorations of natural emotional faces (i.e., free eye movements). The General Linear Model (GLM; Smith and Kutas, 2015a, b; Kristensen et al., 2017a) enables such a depiction. It allows deconvolving adjacent overlapping responses of the eye fixation-related potentials (EFRPs) elicited by the subsequent fixations and the event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited at the stimuli onset. Nineteen participants were displayed with spontaneous static facial expressions of emotions (Neutral, Disgust, Surprise, and Happiness) from the DynEmo database (Tcherkassof et al., 2013). Behavioral results on participants' eye movements show that the usual diagnostic features in emotional decoding (eyes for negative facial displays and mouth for positive ones) are consistent with the literature. The impact of emotional category on both the ERPs and the EFRPs elicited by the free exploration of the emotional faces is observed upon the temporal dynamics of the emotional facial expression processing. Regarding the ERP at stimulus onset, there is a significant emotion-dependent modulation of the P2-P3 complex and LPP components' amplitude at the left frontal site for the ERPs computed by averaging. Yet, the GLM reveals the impact of subsequent fixations on the ERPs time-locked on stimulus onset. Results are also in line with the valence hypothesis. The observed differences between the two estimation methods (Average vs. GLM) suggest the predominance of the right hemisphere at the stimulus onset and the implication of the left hemisphere in the processing of the information encoded by subsequent fixations. Concerning the first EFRP, the Lambda response and the P2 component are modulated by the emotion of surprise compared to the neutral emotion, suggesting an impact of high-level factors, in parieto-occipital sites. Moreover, no difference is observed on the second and subsequent EFRP. Taken together, the results stress the significant gain obtained in analyzing the EFRPs using the GLM method and pave the way toward efficient ecological emotional dynamic stimuli analyses.

We made use of a rare dataset in which the same task was recorded using both scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and Electrocorticography (ECoG), respectively. This allowed us to examine with great spatial and temporal detail how the retrieval process works, and in particular how the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is involved. In each trial, participants judged whether a probe face had been among a set of recently studied faces. With a method that combines hidden semi-Markov models and multivariate pattern analysis, the neural signal was decomposed into a sequence of latent cognitive stages with information about their durations on a trial-by-trial basis. Analyzed separately, EEG and ECoG data yielded converging results on discovered stages and their interpretation, which reflected 1) a brief pre-attention stage, 2) encoding the stimulus, 3) retrieving the studied set, and 4) making a decision. Combining these stages with the high spatial resolution of ECoG suggested that activity in the temporal cortex reflected item familiarity in the retrieval stage; and that once retrieval is complete, there is active maintenance of the studied face set in the decision stage in the MTL. During this same period, the frontal cortex guides the decision by means of theta coupling with the MTL. These observations generalize previous findings on the role of MTL theta from long-term memory tasks to short-term memory tasks.

Therefore, it's imperative for visual BCIs to use small and inconspicuous visual stimuli to code characters. Methods: This study developed a new BCI speller based on miniature asymmetric visual evoked potentials (aVEPs), which encodes 32 characters with a space-code division multiple access scheme and decodes EEG features with a discriminative canonical pattern matching algorithm. Notably, the visual stimulus used in this study only subtended 0.5 degrees of visual angle and was placed outside the fovea vision on the lateral side, which could only induce a miniature potential about 0.5 mu V in amplitude and about 16.5 dB in signal-to-noise rate. A total of 12 subjects were recruited to use the miniature aVEP speller in both offline and online tests. Results: Information transfer rates up to 63.33 b/min could be achieved from online tests (online demo URL: https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=kC7btB3mvGY). Conclusion: Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of using very small and inconspicuous visual stimuli to implement an efficient BCI system, even though the elicited EEG features are very weak. Significance: The proposed innovative technique can broaden the category of BCIs and strengthen the brain-computer communication.

Neural activity under cognitive reappraisal can be more accurately investigated using simultaneous EEG-(electroencephalography) fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) than using EEG or fMRI only. Complementary spatiotemporal information can be found from simultaneous EEG-fMRI data to study brain function. Method. An effective EEG-fMRI fusion framework is proposed in this work. EEG-fMRI data is simultaneously sampled on fifteen visually stimulated healthy adult participants. Net-station toolbox and empirical mode decomposition are employed for EEG denoising. Sparse spectral clustering is used to construct fMRI masks that are used to constrain fMRI activated regions. A kernel-based canonical correlation analysis is utilized to fuse nonlinear EEG-fMRI data. Results. The experimental results show a distinct late positive potential (LPP, latency 200-700 ms) from the correlated EEG components that are reconstructed from nonlinear EEG-fMRI data. Peak value of LPP under reappraisal state is smaller than that under negative state, however, larger than that under neutral state. For correlated fMRI components, obvious activation can be observed in cerebral regions, e.g., the amygdala, temporal lobe, cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, and frontal lobe. Meanwhile, in these regions, activated intensity under reappraisal state is obviously smaller than that under negative state and larger than that under neutral state. Conclusions. The proposed EEG-fMRI fusion approach provides an effective way to study the neural activities of cognitive reappraisal with high spatiotemporal resolution. It is also suitable for other neuroimaging technologies using simultaneous EEG-fMRI data.

J	Zabelina, DL; Ganis, G				Zabelina, Darya L.; Ganis, Giorgio			Creativity and cognitive control: Behavioral and ERP evidence that divergent thinking, but not real-life creative achievement, relates to better cognitive control	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Creativity; Divergent thinking; Attention; Cognitive control; ERP; N2	WORKING-MEMORY; NEURAL BASIS; EEG; INVOLVEMENT; INTELLIGENCE; ATTENTION; COMPONENT; CONFLICT; THINKERS; INSIGHT	Two studies used event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine whether and how divergent thinking and creative achievement are linked to attentional flexibility and cognitive control as indexed by response times and by the amplitude of the anterior N2 ERP component. Both experiments used an oddball paradigm in which participants viewed hierarchical letter stimuli and identified target letters in frequent and rare target trials. The successful identification of targets required attentional flexibility when switching levels of attention (from the frequent global to the rare local attentional level, or vice-versa). Divergent thinkers showed smaller switching times on rare target trials, indicating higher levels of attentional flexibility. Furthermore, divergent thinkers engaged cognitive control processes more strongly at the moment of the attentional switch (and before the response), as indicated by a larger N2 difference between frequent and rare targets. In contrast, creative achievement was associated neither with the switching times on rare target trials, nor with a larger N2 difference between frequent and rare targets. All results held when controlling for general intelligence. Results from these studies provide evidence that divergent thinking is associated with higher attentional flexibility and that such attentional flexibility relies on cognitive control processes required when disengaging from one level of attention (e.g., global), and shifting to the other level of attention (e.g., local).

Its amplitude is usually larger for informative compared to uninformative upcoming stimuli, as well as for uncertain relative to predictable ones. In this study, we sought to assess whether these two effects, when combined together, produced a synergistic effect or rather independent ones on the SPN during performance monitoring. Participants performed a speeded Go/NoGo task while 64-channel EEG was recorded concurrently. We focused on the SPN activity generated in anticipation of feedback, which was either positive (for correct and fast reactions) or negative (for correct but slow responses). Further, the feedback's informativeness about the satisfaction status of goals was alternated across blocks. When uncertainty about the action outcome was low (in conditions where positive feedback was either less or more frequent than negative feedback), the SPN amplitude (measured at fronto-central electrodes) did not vary as a function of feedback's relevance or valence. By comparison, when positive and negative feedback were equiprobable (uncertainty was high), the SPN was more pronounced for relevant compared to irrelevant feedback. Interestingly, in this condition, it was also larger at right fronto-central sites for positive than negative feedback. These ERP results suggest that both factors relevance and uncertainty combine and influence reward anticipation at the SPN level.

Several factors, including various attentional mechanisms, negative affect, and stress, impact emotional eating behavior. For example, attentional narrowing on negative events may increase attentional stickiness and thereby prevent the processing of more peripheral events, such as eating behavior. This study contributes to the extant literature by examining the neural correlates underlying the attentional conflict between processing negative events and regulating behavior within a task that emulates how negative life experiences might contribute to unrestrained eating behavior. We explore this question within a normative sample that varies in their self-reported anxiety symptoms. Dense-array EEG was collected while participants played the attentional blink game-a task in which excessive attentional resource allocated to one event (e.g., negative picture) interferes with the adequate attentional processing of a second event that requires action. To assess the attentional conflict, we measured N2 activation, an event-related potentials (ERPs; averaged EEG) associated with conflict processing. Results revealed that N2 activation moderates the association between anxiety and emotional-eating behavior. Thus, increased anxiety combined with more negative N2 activation can contribute to emotional-eating behavior. These results are discussed in the context of ineffective conflict processing contributing to poor emotion regulation.

However, NA-related decreases in working memory performance have not been shown in a full range of working memory paradigms or fully explored in the context of electrophysiological measures of working memory. We examined the impact of NA and related markers on an electroencephalography (EEG) marker of visual working memory (VWM) capacity, referred to as the contralateral delay activity (CDA). This study analyzed data collected from 48 cognitively intact, mildly stressed older adults (50-74 years old) who completed a VWM change-detection task to elicit the CDA, as well as self-rated measures of affect, stress, neuroticism and depression. Regression analyses revealed significant CDA amplitude effects with NA across task conditions. These results indicate a reduction in a physiological measure of VWM capacity in high-NA participants. These results are of interest as NA has been associated with a greater risk for worse cognitive function, detrimental health outcomes and reduced quality of life in older adults. This research adds to our understanding of how NA impacts older adults and gives a potential biomarker for successful intervention outcomes.

Neural processes underlying the orienting of attention without awareness	CORTEX			English	Article						Attention; Perceptual awareness; Object-substitution masking; N2pc; P1	OBJECT-SUBSTITUTION MASKING; SPATIAL ATTENTION; CONSCIOUSNESS; DYNAMICS; DISSOCIATIONS; PERCEPTION; SELECTION; CORTEX; EEG	Despite long being of interest to both philosophers and scientists, the relationship between attention and perceptual awareness is not well understood, especially to what extent they are even dissociable. Previous studies have shown that stimuli of which we are unaware can orient spatial attention and affect behavior. Yet, relatively little is understood about the neural processes underlying such unconscious orienting of attention, and how they compare to conscious orienting. To directly compare the cascade of attentional processes with and without awareness of the orienting stimulus, we employed a spatial-cueing paradigm and used object-substitution masking to manipulate subjects' awareness of the cues. We recorded EEG during the task, from which we extracted hallmark event-related potential (ERP) indices of attention. Behaviorally, there was a 61 ms validity effect (invalidly minus validly cued target RTs) on cue-aware trials. On cue-unaware trials, subjects also had a robust validity effect of 20 ms, despite being unaware of the cue. An N2pc to the cue, a hallmark ERP index of the lateralized orienting of attention, was observed for cue-aware but not cue-unaware trials, despite the latter showing a clear behavioral validity effect. Finally, the P1 sensory-ERP response to the targets was larger when validly versus invalidly cued, even when subjects were unaware of the preceding cue, demonstrating enhanced sensory processing of targets following subliminal cues. These results suggest that subliminal stimuli can orient attention and lead to subsequent enhancements to both stimulus sensory processing and behavior, but through different neural mechanisms (such as via a subcortical pathway) than stimuli we perceive.

Little is known about the dynamics of the neural processes that underpin this form of value-based decision making and no studies have investigated these processes outside of controlled laboratory settings. The current study investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics that accompany economic valuation of products using mobile electroencephalography (EEG) and eye tracking techniques. Participants viewed and rated images of household products in a gallery setting while EEG and eye tracking data were collected wirelessly. A Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) auction task was subsequently used to quantify the individual's willingness to pay (WTP) for each product. WTP was used to classify products into low, low medium, high medium and high economic value conditions. Eye movement related potentials (EMRP) were examined, and independent component analysis (ICA) was used to separate sources of activity from grand averaged EEG data. Four independent components (ICs) of EMRPs were modulated by WTP (i.e., SV) in the latency range of 150-250 ms. Of the four value-sensitive ICs, one IC displayed enhanced amplitude for all value conditions excluding low value, and another IC presented enhanced amplitude for low value products only. The remaining two value-sensitive ICs resolved inter-mediate levels of SV. Our study quantified, for the first time, the neural processes involved in economic value based decisions in a natural setting. Results suggest that multiple spatio-temporal brain activation patterns mediate the attention and aversion of products which could reflect an early valuation system. The EMRP parietal P200 component could reflect an attention allocation mechanism that separates the lowest-value products (IC7) from products of all other value (IC4), suggesting that low-value items are categorized early on as being aversive. While none of the ICs showed linear amplitude changes that parallel SV's of products, results suggest that a combination of multiple components may sub-serve a fine-grained resolution of the SV of products.

Assessing cross-modal target transition effects with a visual-auditory oddball	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Attention; P300; Electroencephalography; Oddball; Context-updating; Multimodal	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; NOVELTY ODDBALL; FUNCTIONAL MRI; WORKING-MEMORY; P300 AMPLITUDE; P3B; DISTRACTION; ATTENTION; PARADIGM; INTERVAL	Prior research has shown contextual manipulations involving temporal and sequence related factors significantly moderate attention-related responses, as indexed by the P3b event-related-potential, towards infrequent (i.e., deviant) target oddball stimuli. However, significantly less research has looked at the influence of cross-modal switching on P3b responding, with the impact of target-to-target cross-modal transitions being virtually unstudied. To address this gap, this study recorded high-density (256 electrodes) EEG data from twenty-five participants as they completed a cross-modal visual-auditory oddball task. This task was comprised of unimodal visual (70% Nontargets: 30% Deviant-targets) and auditory (70% Nontargets: 30% Deviant-targets) oddballs presented in fixed alternating order (i.e., visual-auditory-visual-auditory, etc.) with participants being tasked with detecting deviant-targets in both modalities. Differences in the P3b response towards deviant-targets as a function of preceding deviant-target's presentation modality was analyzed using temporal-spatial PCA decomposition. In line with predictions, the results indicate that the ERP response to auditory deviant-targets preceded by visual deviant-targets exhibits an elevated P3b, relative to the processing of auditory deviant-targets preceded by auditory deviant-targets. However, the processing of visual deviant-targets preceded by auditory deviant targets exhibited a reduced P3b response, relative to the P3b response towards visual deviant-targets preceded by visual deviant-targets. These findings provide the first demonstration of temporally and perceptually de coupled target-to-target cross-modal transitions moderating P3b responses on the oddball paradigm, generally providing support for the context-updating interpretation of the P3b response.

Online Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Protocol for Measuring Cortical Physiology Associated with Response Inhibition	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Neuroscience; Issue 132; Transcranial magnetic stimulation; response inhibition; stop signal task; cortical inhibition; short interval intracortical inhibition; children	HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; INTERVAL INTRACORTICAL INHIBITION; CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY; STOP-SIGNAL; REACTION-TIME; MOVEMENT PREPARATION; TOURETTE SYNDROME; TMS; PARADIGMS; SUPPRESSION	We describe the development of a reproducible, child-friendly motor response inhibition task suitable for online Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) characterization of primary motor cortex (M1) excitability and inhibition. Motor response inhibition prevents unwanted actions and is abnormal in several neuropsychiatric conditions. TMS is a non-invasive technology that can quantify M1 excitability and inhibition using singl- and paired-pulse protocols and can be precisely timed to study cortical physiology with high temporal resolution. We modified the original Slater-Hammel (S-H) stop signal task to create a "racecar" version with TMS pulses time-locked to intra-trial events. This task is self-paced, with each trial initiating after a button push to move the racecar towards the 800 ms target. GO trials require a finger-lift to stop the racecar just before this target. Interspersed randomly are STOP trials (25%) during which the dynamically adjusted stop signal prompts subjects to prevent finger-lift. For GO trials, TMS pulses were delivered at 650 ms after trial onset; whereas, for STOP trials, the TMS pulses occurred 150 ms after the stop signal. The timings of the TMS pulses were decided based on electroencephalography (EEG) studies showing event-related changes in these time ranges during stop signal tasks. This task was studied in 3 blocks at two study sites (n=38) and we recorded behavioral performance and event-related motor-evoked potentials (MEP). Regression modelling was used to analyze MEP amplitudes using age as a covariate with multiple independent variables (sex, study site, block, TMS pulse condition [single-vs. paired-pulse], trial condition [GO, successful STOP, failed STOP]). The analysis showed that TMS pulse condition(p<0.0001) and its interaction with trial condition (p=0.009) were significant. Future applications for this online S-H/TMS paradigm include the addition of simultaneous EEG acquisition to measure TMS-evoked EEG potentials. A potential limitation is that in children, the TMS pulse sound could affect behavioral task performance.

Mismatch Negativity But Not P300 Is Associated With Functional Disability in Schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN			English	Article						auditory information processing; functional outcome; event-related potentials; electroencephalography; psychosis	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY SENSORY MEMORY; FRONTAL-LOBE DYSFUNCTION; ULTRA-HIGH-RISK; NEUROCOGNITIVE DEFICITS; 1ST-EPISODE PSYCHOSIS; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; STIMULUS DEVIANCE; RECENT-ONSET; HUMAN BRAIN	Mismatch negativity (MMN) and P300 event-related potential (ERP) reductions in schizophrenia (SZ) reflect preattentive and attention-mediated auditory processing deficits, respectively. Although both have been linked to cognitive deficits in SZ, their relative contributions to real-world functioning are unclear. We sought to determine the functional significance of disrupted auditory processing in SZ by examining MMN and P300 in typically disabled low-functioning patients and in patients with high levels of independent role functioning. MMN to auditory deviants and P300 to infrequent auditory target and nontarget novel stimuli were assessed in 20 high-functioning SZ patients (HF-SZ), 17 low-functioning patients (LF-SZ), and 35 healthy comparison (HC) subjects. There was a group effect on MMN and P300 amplitudes across stimulus types. MMN was significantly diminished in LF-SZ compared to HF-SZ and HC, and HF-SZ demonstrated comparable MMN to HC. In contrast, P300 was significantly reduced in both LF-SZ and HF-SZ compared to HC. Logistic regression suggested independent sensitivity of MMN to functioning in SZ over and above P300 measures. Neither MMN nor P300 were associated with positive or negative symptom severity. Results replicate MMN and P300 abnormalities in SZ, and also suggest that the neural mechanisms associated with the preattentive detection of auditory deviance are most compromised in patients with functional disability. MMN may index pathophysiological processes that are critical for optimal functioning in SZ.

In this study, we provide meaningful electrophysiological evidence of ED in adult patients with ADHD (n = 39) compared to healthy controls (n = 40) by exploring the electrophysiological correlates of the emotion regulation strategies reappraisal, distraction, and expressive suppression. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during passive viewing of neutral and negative images, as well as during emotion regulation. The patients with ADHD exhibited increased frontal late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes during passive viewing of the aversive images and during emotion regulation. Compared with the healthy controls, a subgroup of medication-naive patients with ADHD (n = 25) also exhibited larger centroparietal LPP amplitudes and provided more negative ratings of the aversive and neutral images. Both the frontal and centroparietal LPP amplitudes were associated with ADHD symptom severity. However, no significant deficit in LPP modulation during emotion regulation was found. These findings strongly support the clinical observation of increased emotional responsivity toward negative stimuli and difficulty during the implementation of emotion regulation strategies and thus encourage the implementation of emotion regulation modules in the treatment of adult patients with ADHD.

Greater neural responses to trajectory errors are associated with superior force field adaptation in older adults	EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY			English	Article						Aging; Electroencephalography (EEG); Event related potential; Error-related negativity; Feedback-related negativity; Sensorimotor adaptation	AGE-RELATED VARIATIONS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; MOTOR ADAPTATION; SENSORIMOTOR ADAPTATION; VISUOMOTOR ADAPTATION; SENSORY PREDICTION; FEEDBACK-CONTROL; NEGATIVITY; DOPAMINE; ADJUSTMENTS	Although age-related declines in cognitive, sensory and motor capacities are well documented, current evidence is mixed as to whether or not aging impairs sensorimotor adaptation to a novel dynamic environment. More importantly, the extent to which any deficits in sensorimotor adaptation are due to general impairments in neural plasticity, or impairments in the specific processes that drive adaptation is unclear. Here we investigated whether there are age-related differences in electrophysiological responses to reaching endpoint and trajectory errors caused by a novel force field, and whether markers of error processing relate to the ability of older adults to adapt their movements. Older and young adults (N = 24/group, both sexes) performed 600 reaches to visual targets, and received audio-visual feedback about task success or failure after each trial. A velocity-dependent curl field pushed the hand to one side during each reach. We extracted ERPs time-locked to movement onset [kinematic error-related negativity (kERN)], and the presentation of success/failure feedback [feedback error-related negativity (FERN)]. At a group level, older adults did not differ from young adults in the rate or extent of sensorimotor adaptation, but EEG responses to both trajectory errors and task errors were reduced in the older group. Most interestingly, the amplitude of the kERN correlated with the rate and extent of sensorimotor adaptation in older adults. Thus, older adults with an impaired capacity for encoding kinematic trajectory errors also have compromised abilities to adapt their movements in a novel dynamic environment.

J	Kuper, K				Kueper, Kristina			On the functional significance of retrieval mode: Task switching disrupts the recollection of conceptual stimulus information from episodic memory	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Retrieval mode; Familiarity; Recollection; Memory specificity; EEG	RECOGNITION MEMORY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL INDEXES; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EXPLICIT MEMORY; FEATURE BINDING; ERP EVIDENCE; FAMILIARITY; OBJECT; COLOR	Episodic memory retrieval is assumed to be associated with the tonic cognitive state of retrieval mode. Despite extensive research into the neurophysiological correlates of retrieval mode, as of yet, relatively little is known about its functional significance. The present event-related potential (ERP) study was aimed at examining the impact of retrieval mode on the specificity of memory content retrieved in the course of familiarity and recollection processes. In two experiments, participants performed a recognition memory inclusion task in which they had to distinguish identically repeated and re-colored versions of study items from new items. In Experiment 1, participants had to alternate between the episodic memory task and a semantic task requiring a natural/artificial decision. In Experiment 2, the two tasks were instead performed in separate blocks. ERPs locked to the preparatory cues in the test phases indicated that participants did not establish retrieval mode on switch trials in Experiment 1. In the absence of retrieval mode, neither type of studied item elicited ERP correlates of familiarity-based retrieval (FN400). Recollection-related late positive complex (LPC) old/new effects emerged only for identically repeated but not for conceptually identical but perceptually changed versions of study items. With blocked retrieval in Experiment 2, both types of old items instead elicited equivalent FN400 and LPC old/new effects. The LPC data indicate that retrieval mode may play an important role in the successful recollection of conceptual stimulus information. The FN400 results additionally suggest that task switching may have a detrimental effect on familiarity-based memory retrieval. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, it is currently unclear if the same neurophysiological processes that differentiate athletes from non-athletes also determine performance within a homogeneous group of athletes. This information can provide valuable help for athletes and coaches aiming to optimize existing training regimes. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the neurophysiological correlates of visuomotor reaction performance in a group of skilled athletes. In 36 skilled badminton athletes, electroencephalography (EEG) was used to investigate pattern reversal and motion onset visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) as well as visuomotor reaction time (VMRT) during a simple reaction task. Stimulus-locked and response-locked event-related potentials (ERPs) in visual and motor regions as well as the onset of muscle activation (EMG onset) were determined. Correlation and multiple regression analyses identified the neurophysiological parameters predicting EMG onset and VMRT. For pattern reversal stimuli, the P100 latency and age best predicted EMG onset (r=0.43; p =.003) and VMRT (r=0.62; p=.001). In the motion onset experiment, EMG onset (r=0.80; p <.001) and VMRT (r=0.78; p<.001) were predicted by N2 latency and age. In both conditions, cortical potentials in motor regions were not correlated with EMG onset or VMRT. It is concluded that previously identified neurophysiological parameters differentiating athletes from non-athletes do not necessarily determine performance within a homogeneous group of athletes. Specifically, the speed of visual perception/processing predicts EMG onset and VMRT in skilled badminton players while motor-related processes, although differentiating athletes from non-athletes, are not associated simple with visuomotor reaction performance.

For medical applications, the availability of real-time data for processing, which could be used as command signals to control robotic devices, is limited to specific platforms. This paper focuses on the possibility to analyse and visualize EEG signal features using OpenViBE acquisition platform in offline mode apart from its default real-time processing capability, and the options available for processing of data in offline mode. We employed OpenViBE platform to acquire EEG signals, pre-process it and extract features for a BCI system. For testing purposes, we analysed and tried to visualize EEG data offline, by developing scenarios, using method for quantification of event-related (de)synchronization ERD/ERS patterns, as well as, built in signal processing algorithms available in OpenViBE-designer toolbox. Acquired data was based on deployment of standard Graz BCI experimental protocol, used for foot kinaesthetic motor imagery (KMI). Results clearly reflect that the platform OpenViBE is a streaming tool that encourages processing and analysis of EEG data online, contrary to analysis, or visualization of data in offline, or global mode. For offline analysis and visualization of data, other relevant platforms are discussed. In online execution of BCI, OpenViBE is a potential tool for the control of wearable lower-limb devices, robotic vehicles and rehabilitation equipment. Other applications include remote control of mechatronic devices, or driving of passenger cars by human thoughts. 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

At present there are neither behavioral nor neurological tests available to detect those preterm infants who would benefit most from early interventions. Neurophysiologic methods, and more specifically, auditory event-related potentials (AERPs) are convenient tools to investigate early cognitive functioning. However, the capability of AERPs as a prognostic factor for mental development in preterm infants remains unclear. The present systematic search of the literature yielded 1016 articles, out of which 13 were included. Both prospective and cross-sectional studies reported a relationship between AERPs and cognitive outcome. Our results show that larger amplitudes and shorter latencies of late AERPs are related to better cognitive outcomes. Additional studies are needed to corroborate our findings regarding this potential use of AERPs in the individual evaluation of preterm born infants.

Its main goal is to allow for non-muscular communication with external world, which may be the only way for patients in a locked-in state. In this paper, many approaches are studied where users healthy brain signals are recorded using electroencephalogram (EEG) and explored in order to be able to control some smart home appliances and a robotic arm for self-feeder to help disabled persons, who cannot move or talk, to live independently in a brain-controlled environment. Specifically, the Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) brain response induced by visual stimulus is used to detect at which frequency the subject is exactly looking, and at this moment the software sends the corresponding request to move the robotic arm to the desired plate to feed himself. Also, a Wi-Fi-based smart home automation is introduced, where light intensity and fan speed are controlled automatically through the physiological state of the individual without any external stimuli, or voluntary through the SSVEP method. Finally, a comfortable way is proposed to let the user choose between two options by an EEG-based color recognition (red and blue colors).

Electrophysiological preliminary study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						FMF; children; cognitive function; event-related potentials; P300	P300 GENERATORS; COLCHICINE; TIME	Objectives: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a periodic autoinflammatory disease with subclinical inflammation occurring between attacks. The aim of the study was to prospectively evaluate the cognitive function of children diagnosed with FMF that were under colchicine therapy and compare them with healthy controls through electrophysiologically event-related potentials (ERPs) study. Methods: Twelve children with FMF and 12 healthy controls were included in the study. During the electroencephalography recordings, all participants were instructed to discriminate rare stimuli (target stimuli) from frequent stimuli (standard stimuli) by pressing a botton on a mouse immediately following the target stimulus. P300, the cognitive component of ERP, was obtained in response to target stimuli and its amplitude and latency were measured. Results: The amplitude of the P300 of the FMF patients was higher and the latencies of the P300 of the FMF patients were shorter than the amplitudes and latencies of control patients, respectively. The difference between the groups was statistically significant for amplitude but not for latency. Conclusions: Cognitive processing reflecting allocation of attention and visual processing speed seems not to be negatively affected in FMF patients with homozygous M694V mutations undergoing colchicine treatment. As this study is unique in its evaluation of the cognitive function of children with FMF, these findings may be helpful for counseling families and patients affected by the condition.

Frontal cortex electrophysiology in reward- and punishment-related feedback processing during advice-guided decision making: An interleaved EEG-DC stimulation study	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Advice information; Decision making; Electroencephalogram; Feedback processing; Transcranial direct current stimulation	ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; IMPROVING JUDGMENT; PROSPECT-THEORY; MOTOR CORTEX; THETA; P300; NEGATIVITY; HEALTHY; ATTENTION	During decision making, individuals are prone to rely on external cues such as expert advice when the outcome is not known. However, the electrophysiological correlates associated with outcome uncertainty and the use of expert advice are not completely understood. The feedback-related negativity (FRN), P3a, and P3b are event-related brain potentials (ERPs) linked to dissociable stages of feedback and attentional processing during decision making. Even though these ERPs are influenced by both reward- and punishment-related feedback, it remains unclear how extrinsic information during uncertainty modulates these brain potentials. In this study, the effects of advice cues on decision making were investigated in two separate experiments. In the first experiment, electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded in healthy volunteers during a decision-making task in which the participants received reward or punishment feedback preceded by novice, amateur, or expert advice. The results showed that the P3a component was significantly influenced by the subjective predictive value of an advice cue, whereas the FRN and P3b were unaffected by the advice cues. In the second, sham-controlled experiment, cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (ctDCS) was administered in conjunction with EEG in order to explore the direct contributions of the frontal cortex to these brain potentials. Results showed no significant change in either advice-following behavior or decision times. However, ctDCS did decrease FRN amplitudes as compared to sham, with no effect on the P3a or P3b. Together, these findings suggest that advice information may act primarily on attention allocation during feedback processing, whereas the electrophysiological correlates of the detection and updating of internal prediction models are not affected.

Electroencephalography (EEG) based BCI is one of the most promising form of this application where a subject learns to control brain waves of type mu-rhythm (8-14 Hz) or beta-rhythm (14-30 Hz) or P300 event related potential or slow cortical potentials (SCPs). Intents of the person is extracted using signal processing techniques. In this study self-regulation of SCPs is studied using wavelet packet analysis (WPA), rather than traditional time or frequency domain methods. WPA, by providing arbitrary time-frequency resolution, enables analyzing signals of stationary and non-stationary nature. It has better time representation than Fourier analysis and better high frequency resolution than Wavelet analysis. WPA subimages are analyzed further by log energy entropy. These feature vectors are fed into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for classification. We use the BCI Competition 2003 datasets la and lb to test our approach. Performance of the MLP is compared with that of k-NN and SVM. Our method achieves accuracies of 92.8% and 63.3% on datasets la and lb respectively. This outperforms the other reported results on the same datasets including the winners of the competition. Overall, WPA followed by Log Energy Entropy and MLP provides an efficient tool for the aforementioned kind of BCI oriented EEG analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, determining the level of cortical activity in patients with disorders of consciousness is a real challenge. Reliable criteria are required to help clinicians in the decision-making process, especially in the acute phase of coma. In this paper, we propose recommendations for recording and interpreting electroencephalography and evoked potentials in comatose patients based on the literature and the clinical experience of a group of neurophysiologists trained in the management of comatose patients.

J	Yang, JB; Zhu, H; Tian, X				Yang, Jinbiao; Zhu, Hao; Tian, Xing			Group-Level Multivariate Analysis in EasyEEG Toolbox: Examining the Temporal Dynamics Using Topographic Responses	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; EEG/MEG; methodology; EEG signal processing; toolbox; topography; multivariate analysis; machine learning		Electroencephalography (EEG) provides high temporal resolution cognitive information from non-invasive recordings. However, one of the common practices-using a subset of sensors in ERP analysis is hard to provide a holistic and precise dynamic results. Selecting or grouping subsets of sensors may also be subject to selection bias, multiple comparison, and further complicated by individual differences in the group-level analysis. More importantly, changes in neural generators and variations in response magnitude from the same neural sources are difficult to separate, which limit the capacity of testing different aspects of cognitive hypotheses. We introduce EasyEEG, a toolbox that includes several multivariate analysis methods to directly test cognitive hypotheses based on topographic responses that include data from all sensors. These multivariate methods can investigate effects in the dimensions of response magnitude and topographic patterns separately using data in the sensor space, therefore enable assessing neural response dynamics. The concise workflow and the modular design provide user-friendly and programmer-friendly features. Users of all levels can benefit from the open-sourced, free EasyEEG to obtain a straightforward solution for efficient processing of EEG data and a complete pipeline from raw data to final results for publication.

Recognition memory advantage for negative emotional words has an early expiry date: Evidence from brain oscillations and ERPs	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Emotional words; Recognition memory; LAG; ERPs; EROs	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AFFECTIVE NORMS; THETA-SYNCHRONIZATION; SPANISH WORDS; EEG ALPHA; VALENCE; DESYNCHRONIZATION; RETRIEVAL; RETENTION; ATTENTION	Evidence from prior studies has shown an advantage in recognition memory for emotional compared to neutral words. Whether this advantage is short-lived or rather extends over longer periods, as well as whether the effect depends on words' valence (i.e., positive or negative), remains unknown. In the present ERP/EEG study, we investigated this issue by manipulating the lag distance (LAG-2, LAG-8 and LAG-16) between the presentation of old and new words in an online recognition memory task. LAG differences were observed at behavior, ERPs and in the theta frequency band. In line with previous studies, negative words were associated with faster reaction times, higher hit rates and increased amplitude in a positive ERP component between 386 and 564 ms compared to positive and neutral words. Remarkably, the interaction of LAG by EMOTION revealed that negative words were associated with better performance and larger ERPs amplitudes only at LAG-2. Also in the LAG-2 condition, emotional words (i.e., positive and negative words) induced a stronger desynchronization in the beta band between 386 and 542 ms compared to neutral words. These early enhanced memory effects for emotional words are discussed in terms of the Negative Emotional Valence Enhances Recapitulation (NEVER) model and the mobilization-minimization hypothesis.

Despite these facts, the neurophysiological studies of vergence eye movement on humans are rare and give ambiguous results. In the present study, the sensory event-related potentials (ERPs) related to the processing of stimuli called for convergence, divergence and saccade were explored. Sixteen healthy subjects (mean 23 years old) performed reflexive (visually-guided) eye movements and event-related potentials from 64 active electrodes were recorded. The significant preponderance of cortical activity for convergence among three conditions was revealed and it concerned both anterior (larger negativity) and posterior cortex (larger positivity). Here, we also reported the longest latency for convergence. These results may suggest larger cortical representation for stimuli presented in near visual space, thus the preponderance of near cells within cortex, which respond to cross retinal image disparity being a cue for convergence.

FieldTrip Made Easy: An Analysis Protocol for Group Analysis of the Auditory Steady State Brain Response in Time, Frequency, and Space	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ASSR; EEG; FieldTrip; group analysis; ERP; beamforming	MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; MEG; TINNITUS; EEG; SCHIZOPHRENIA; LOCALIZATION; ORGANIZATION; CHILDREN; DEFICITS	The auditory steady state evoked response (ASSR) is a robust and frequently utilized phenomenon in psychophysiological research. It reflects the auditory cortical response to an amplitude-modulated constant carrier frequency signal. The present report provides a concrete example of a group analysis of the EEG data from 29 healthy human participants, recorded during an ASSR paradigm, using the FieldTrip toolbox. First, we demonstrate sensor-level analysis in the time domain, allowing for a description of the event-related potentials (ERPs), as well as their statistical evaluation. Second, frequency analysis is applied to describe the spectral characteristics of the ASSR, followed by group level statistical analysis in the frequency domain. Third, we show how time-and frequency-domain analysis approaches can be combined in order to describe the temporal and spectral development of the ASSR. Finally, we demonstrate source reconstruction techniques to characterize the primary neural generators of the ASSR. Throughout, we pay special attention to explaining the design of the analysis pipeline for single subjects and for the group level analysis. The pipeline presented here can be adjusted to accommodate other experimental paradigms and may serve as a template for similar analyses.

It is a form of advertising that involves targeted exposure of brands or products incorporated in other works, usually with or without explicit reference to the brands or products. Brand placement can be presented in different visual and auditory forms in video programs. The present study proposed that different 'representations' (i.e., representable or non-representable) and 'sounds' (i.e., speech or musical sound) of brand placement can affect the viewers' perception of the brand. Event-related potential results indicated significant differences in P1, N1, P2, N270, and P3. Further, event-related spectral perturbation results indicated significant differences in theta, alpha, beta, and gamma (30-100 Hz), in the right parietal, right occipital area, and limbic lobe. 'Non-representable' or 'speech sound' brand placement induced significant temporal and spectral EEG dynamics in viewers.	[Wang, Regina W.

Participants performed a spatial cuing task where an irrelevant color singleton cue was presented prior to a target array. Blockwise, the target was either a red circle or a gray square and had to be searched within homogenous (gray circles) or heterogeneous non-targets (differently colored circles or various shapes). Thereby we aimed to trigger the adoption of different attentional templates: a broader singleton or a narrower, more specific feature template. ERP markers of attentional selection and inhibitory control showed that the amount of cognitive control was overall enhanced when participants searched on the basis of a feature-specific template: the analysis revealed reduced selection (N2pc, frontal P2) and pronounced inhibition (negative shift of frontal N2) of the irrelevant color cue when participants searched for a feature target. On behavioral level attentional capture was most pronounced in the color condition with no differentiation between the task-induced scopes of the attentional template.

These functions are important to achieve goals when different actions need to be executed in close succession. This type of multicomponent behavior, which often further requires the processing of information from different modalities, is important for everyday activities. Yet, possible changes in neurophysiological mechanisms have not been investigated in adolescent ADHD. We examined N = 31 adolescent ADHD patients and N = 35 healthy controls (HC) in two Stop-Change experiments using either uni-modal or bi-modal stimuli to trigger stop and change processes. These stimuli were either presented together (SCD0) or in close succession of 300 milliseconds (SCD300). Using event-related potentials (ERP), EEG data decomposition and source localization we analyzed neural processes and functional neuroanatomical correlates of multicomponent behavior. Compared to HCs, ADHD patients had longer reaction times and higher error rates when Stop and Change stimuli were presented in close succession (SCD300), but not when presented together (SCD0). This effect was evident in the uni-modal and bi-modal experiment and is reflected by neurophysiological processes reflecting response selection mechanisms in the inferior parietal cortex (BA40). These processes were only detectable after accounting for intraindividual variability in neurophysiological data; i.e. there were no effects in standard ERPs. Multi-component behavior is not always deficient in ADHD. Rather, modulations in multi-component behavior depend on a critical temporal integration window during response selection which is associated with functioning of the inferior parietal cortex. This window is smaller than in HCs and independent of the complexity of sensory input.

This study determines the effect of sex on the electropsychological process of various intensities of emotional arousal. Methods: In the Event-related Potential (ERP) session, electroencephalographic (EEG) data was recorded for 90 participants, 60% of whom were females. The participants responded to 30 universal emotional pictures, randomly chosen from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), which were classified as invoking high, moderate, and low intensity of emotional arousal. Results: From the analysis of variance of two-way mixed design, the interaction between sex and emotional intensity was observed in the occipital regions (O2), indexed by the amplitude of P300 and N200 components. Males exhibited higher amplitude of P300 and N200 components (in the occipital region) as responded to high and low emotional arousal stimuli than females. Conclusion: Sex is a fundamental factor that modulates psychological states in reaction to emotional stimuli.

A longitudinal ERP study	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Dyslexia; Event-related potentials; EEG; Brain development; Longitudinal	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA; FOLLOW-UP; PHONOLOGICAL REPRESENTATIONS; LEARNING-DISORDERS; CHILDREN EVIDENCE; FAMILIAL RISK; SCHOOL-AGE; WORD; BRAIN	Developmental dyslexia is a reading disorder that is associated with deficits in phonological processing, where the exact neural basis for those processing deficits remains unclear. In particular, disagreement exists whether degraded phonological representations or an impaired access to the phonological representations causes these deficits. To investigate this question and to trace changes in neurophysiology during the process of reading acquisition, we designed a longitudinal study with event related potentials (ERPs) in children between kindergarten and second grade. We used an explicit word processing task to elicit the late positive component (LPC), which has been shown to reflect phonological processing. A brain-wide analysis of the LPC with an electrode-wise application of mixed effects models showed significantly attenuated amplitudes in the left temporo-parietal region in dyslexic children. Since these differences were only present in the word and not in the picture (i.e. control) condition, the attenuated amplitudes might reflect impaired access to the phonological representations of words. This was further confirmed by the longitudinal development, which showed a rapid increase in amplitude at the beginning of reading instruction and a decrease with continuing automatization, possibly pointing to a progression from grapheme-phoneme parsing to whole word reading. Our longitudinal study provides the first evidence that it is possible to detect neurophysiological differences in the LPC between children with dyslexia and control children in both preliterate and very early stages of reading acquisition, providing new insights about the neurophysiological development and a potential marker of later reading problems.

Neural reward responsiveness in children who engage in nonsuicidal self-injury: an ERP study	JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Nonsuicidal self-injury; rewards; event-related potential; children; feedback negativity	SUICIDAL-BEHAVIOR; DEPRESSION; BORDERLINE; FEEDBACK; RESPONSES; NEUROSCIENCE; RELIABILITY; SENSITIVITY; PREVALENCE; POTENTIALS	Background A better understanding of the correlates of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) in children is important for the identification and prevention of future suicide risk. However, although abnormalities in reward responsiveness might constitute one potential transdiagnostic mechanism of risk for NSSI, no studies have examined initial response to reward in children with a history of NSSI. The goal of the present study was to address this important gap in the literature. To objectively assess initial response to reward, we utilized the feedback negativity (FN) event-related potential, a well-established psychophysiological marker of reward responsiveness. Methods Participants were 57 children (19 with a history of NSSI and 38 demographically matched controls) between the ages of 7 and 11. Diagnostic interviews were used to assess for current and past DSM-IV mood and anxiety diagnoses and NSSI history. Children also completed a guessing task, during which continuous electroencephalography was recorded. Results Children with a history of NSSI exhibited significantly more negative Delta FN (i.e., FN to losses minus FN to gains) than children without NSSI. These findings appeared to be at least partially independent of children's history of psychopathology and current symptoms, suggesting their specificity to NSSI. Conclusions These results provide initial evidence for heightened neural initial reward responsiveness to losses versus rewards in children with a history of NSSI. Pending replications and longitudinal studies, the Delta FN might represent a psychophysiological marker of risk for self-harm.

Similarly, it is unknown in how far the complexity of cognitive flexibility processes is affected by intoxication and hangover effects. We performed a neurophysiological study applying high density electroencephalography (EEG) recording to analyze event-related potentials (ERPs) and perform source localization in a task switching paradigm which varied the complexity of task switching by means of memory demands. The results show that high-dose ethanol intoxication only affects task switching (i.e. cognitive flexibility processes) when memory processes are required to control task switching mechanisms, suggesting that even high doses of ethanol compromise cognitive processes when they are highly demanding. The EEG and source localization data show that these effects unfold by modulating response selection processes in the anterior cingulate cortex. Perceptual and attentional selection processes as well as working memory processes were only unspecifically modulated. In all subprocesses examined, there were no differences between the sober and hangover states, thus suggesting a fast recovery of cognitive flexibility after high-dose ethanol intoxication. We assume that the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) system accounts for the observed effects, while they can hardly be explained by the dopaminergic system.

Electrophysiological measures reveal the role of anterior cingulate cortex in learning from unreliable feedback	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Frontal midline theta; Reward positivity; Anterior cingulate cortex; Feedback reliability	MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; TOP-DOWN CONTROL; PREDICTION ERROR; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; EEG OSCILLATIONS; DECISION-MAKING; CORTICAL AREAS; MIDLINE THETA; REWARD; NEGATIVITY	Although a growing number of studies have investigated the neural mechanisms of reinforcement learning, it remains unclear how the brain responds to feedback that is unreliable. A recent theory proposes that the reward positivity (RewP) component of the event-related brain potential (ERP) and frontal midline theta (FMT) power reflect separate feedback-related processing functions of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In the present study, the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from participants as they engaged in a time estimation task in which feedback reliability was manipulated across conditions. After each response, they received a cue that indicated that the following feedback stimulus was 100%, 75%, or 50% reliable. The results showed that participants' time estimates adjusted linearly according to the feedback reliability. Moreover, presentation of the cue indicating 100% reliability elicited a larger RewP-like ERP component than the other cues did, and feedback presentation elicited a RewP of approximately equal amplitude for all of the three reliability conditions. By contrast, FMT power elicited by negative feedback decreased linearly from the 100% condition to 75% and 50% condition, and only FMT power predicted behavioral adjustments on the following trials. In addition, an analysis of Beta power and cross-frequency coupling (CFC) of Beta power with FMT phase suggested that Beta-FMT communication modulated motor areas for the purpose of adjusting behavior. We interpreted these findings in terms of the hierarchical reinforcement learning account of ACC, in which the RewP and FMT are proposed to reflect reward processing and control functions of ACC, respectively.

Does mindfulness training modulate the influence of spatial attention on the processing of intracutaneous electrical stimuli?	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SEX-DIFFERENCES; EEG; QUESTIONNAIRE; THERAPY; INDEX	Mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) training has been proposed to improve attentional skills by modulating thalamo-cortical loops that affect the sensitivity of relevant cortical areas like the somatosensory cortex. This modulation may be reflected in the electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha rhythm, and could affect the processing of subsequently applied intracutaneous electrical stimuli. Participants took part in an MBSR training and participated in two EEG sessions. EEG was measured in variants of an endogenous orienting paradigm in which attention had to be directed to the left or right forearm. After the orienting interval, the electrical stimulus was applied, equally likely on the attended or the unattended forearm. One group of participants took part in the EEG session before and after the training, while the other group took part after the training, and another time, eight weeks later. The influence of the MBSR training and spatial attention were examined with behavioral measures, lateralized alpha power within the orienting interval, and with event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked by the electrical stimuli. Self-reported mindfulness was clearly affected by the training, but no influence was found on other behavioral measures. Alpha power was clearly lateralized due to spatial attention and several ERP components (N130, N180, P340) were modulated by spatial attention but no support was found for an influence of the MBSR training. Finally, analyses revealed that individual differences in training time modulated some of the observed effects, but no support was found for an influence on attentional orienting.

Target probability was manipulated by varying the set size of the displays between 10, 22, and 30 items. Fixation-related potentials time-locked to first target fixations revealed a pronounced P300 at the centro-parietal cortex with larger amplitudes for set sizes 22 and 30 than for set size 10. With increasing set size, more distractor fixations preceded the detection of the target, resulting in a decreased target probability and, consequently, a larger P300. For distractors, no increase of P300 amplitude with set size was observed. The findings suggest that set size specifically affects target but not distractor processing in overt serial visual search.

This speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT) is commonly explained by variation in just the baseline-to-boundary distance, i.e., the excursion, of accumulation-to-bound models of perceptual decision-making. However, neural evidence is not consistent with this explanation. A compelling account of speeded choice should explain both overt behavior and the full range of associated brain signatures. Here, we reconcile seemingly contradictory behavioral and neural findings. In two variants of the same experiment, we triangulated upon the neural underpinnings of the SAT in the human brain using both EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We found that distinct neural signals, namely the event-related potential (ERP) centroparietal positivity (CPP) and a smoothed motor-evoked potential (MEP) signal, which have both previously been shown to relate to decision-related accumulation, revealed qualitatively similar average neurodynamic profiles with only subtle differences between SAT conditions. These signals were then modelled from behavior by either incorporating traditional boundary variation or utilizing a forced excursion. These model variants are mathematically equivalent, in terms of their behavioral predictions, hence providing identical fits to correct and erroneous reaction time distributions. However, the forced-excursion version instantiates SAT via a more global change in parameters and implied neural activity, a process conceptually akin to, but mathematically distinct from, urgency. This variant better captured both ERP and MEP neural profiles, suggesting that the SAT may be implemented via neural gain modulation, and reconciling standard modelling approaches with human neural data.

To overcome this bias, a special refixation triggering mechanism may have to be recruited. We probed the neural evidence for such a mechanism by combining eye tracking with EEG recording. A distinctive signal associated with refixation planning was observed in the EEG during the presaccadic interval: the presaccadic potential was reduced in amplitude before a refixation compared with normal fixations. The result offers direct evidence for a special refixation mechanism that operates in the saccade planning stage of eye movement control. Once the eyes have landed on the revisited location, acquisition of visual information proceeds indistinguishably from ordinary fixations. NEW & NOTEWORTHY A substantial proportion of eye fixations in human natural viewing behavior are revisits of recently visited locations, i.e., refixations. Our recently developed methods enabled us to study refixations in a free viewing visual search task, using combined eye movement and EEG recording. We identified in the EEG a distinctive refixation-related signal, signifying a control mechanism specific to refixations as opposed to ordinary eye fixations.

Psychopharmacological modulation of event-related potentials suggests that first-hand pain and empathy for pain rely on similar opioidergic processes	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Pain; Empathy; Placebo analgesia; Naltrexone; Shared representations; ERP	CONCENTRIC PLANAR ELECTRODE; LASER-EVOKED POTENTIALS; PLACEBO ANALGESIA; BRAIN; SYSTEM; COMMON; EFFICACY; EEG	Accumulating evidence suggests that empathy for pain recruits similar neural processes as the first-hand experience of pain. The pain-related P2, an event-related potential component, has been suggested as a reliable indicator of neural processes associated with first-hand pain. Recent evidence indicates that placebo analgesia modulates this component for both first-hand pain and empathy for pain. Moreover, a psychopharmacological study showed that administration of an opioid antagonist blocked the effects of placebo analgesia on self-report of both first-hand pain and empathy for pain. Together, these findings suggest that the opioid system plays a similar role during first-hand pain and empathy for pain. However, such a conclusion requires evidence showing that neural activity during both experiences is similarly affected by psychopharmacological blockage of opioid receptors. Here, we measured pain-related P2 amplitudes and self-report in a group of participants who first underwent a placebo analgesia induction procedure. Then, they received an opioid receptor antagonist known to block the previously induced analgesic effects. Self-report showed that blocking opioid receptors after the induction of placebo analgesia increased both first-hand pain and empathy for pain, replicating previous findings. Importantly, P2 amplitudes were also increased during both experiences. Thus, the present findings extend models proposing that empathy for pain is partially grounded in first-hand pain by suggesting that this also applies to the underlying opioidergic neurochemical processes.

However, EEG traces are generally very noisy and can bury the characteristic component in the noise, so various feature extraction methods have been used to extract such features from EEG results. In this paper, we investigate the discriminating P300 potentials using a convolutional neural network (CNN), a widely-used image processing tool.

The current study explored the time course of the effect of trust decisions on outcome evaluation processing using electroencephalographic (EEG) techniques. Twenty-two healthy young adults made trust or distrust decisions regarding a message they received from a stranger in a card game. The results showed that at the early stage of outcome processing, feedback-related negativity (FRN) was more negative for losses than for gains, and more importantly, this valence effect of FRN was greater for outcomes following trust decisions than distrust decisions. At the later stage, the P3 was larger for gains than for losses and for outcomes following trust decisions than distrust decisions. In addition, at both the early and late stages, differences in the mid-frontal theta power between losses and gains were also greater in the trust condition than in the distrust condition. These findings indicate that trust decisions could effectively modulate the processing of outcome evaluation at different stages. The trust effect at the early stage of outcome processing suggests that compared to distrust decisions, trust decisions result in greater motivation and expectancy to obtain positive outcomes. While the trust effect on the later stage of outcome processing suggests that individuals pay more attention and feel stronger emotional experience to the outcomes following trust decisions. This study sheds light on the neural mechanisms of trust decisions modulating outcome processing.

Steady-state evoked potentials distinguish brain mechanisms of self-paced versus synchronization finger tapping	HUMAN MOVEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Beat processing; Left inferior frontal gyrus; Inferior parietal lobule; Event-based timing; Emergent timing; EEG source estimation	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SENSORIMOTOR SYNCHRONIZATION; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; NEURAL ENTRAINMENT; BEAT PERCEPTION; WORKING-MEMORY; MUSICAL BEAT; MOTOR; EEG; RHYTHM	Sensorimotor synchronization (SMS) requires aligning motor actions to external events and represents a core part of both musical and dance performances. In the current study, to isolate the brain mechanisms involved in synchronizing finger tapping with a musical beat, we compared SMS to pure self-paced finger tapping and listen-only conditions at different tempi. We analyzed EEG data using frequency domain steady-state evoked potentials (SSEPs) to identify sustained electrophysiological brain activity during repetitive tasks. Behavioral results revealed different timing modes between SMS and self-paced finger tapping, associated with distinct scalp topographies, thus suggesting different underlying brain sources. After subtraction of the listen-only brain activity, SMS was compared to self-paced finger tapping. Resulting source estimations showed stronger activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus during SMS, and stronger activation of the bilateral inferior parietal lobule during self-paced finger tapping. These results point to the left inferior frontal gyros as a pivot for perception action coupling. We discuss our findings in the context of the ongoing debate about SSEPs interpretation given the variety of brain events contributing to SSEPs and similar EEG frequency responses.

Touching lips and hearing fingers: effector-specific congruency between tactile and auditory stimulation modulates N1 amplitude and alpha desynchronization	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Touch; Speech; Audition; Multisensory integration; ERP; Alpha oscillations	MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; ARTICULATORY FEATURES; SPEECH SOUNDS; BRAIN-REGIONS; BAND ACTIVITY; HUMAN SI; PERCEPTION; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION	Understanding the interactions between audition and sensorimotor processes is of theoretical importance, particularly in relation to speech processing. Although one current focus in this area is on interactions between auditory perception and the motor system, there has been less research on connections between the auditory and somatosensory modalities. The current study takes a novel approach to this omission by examining specific auditory-tactile interactions in the context of speech and non-speech sound production. Electroencephalography was used to examine brain responses when participants were presented with speech syllables (a bilabial sound /pa/ and a non-labial sound /ka/) or finger-snapping sounds that were simultaneously paired with tactile stimulation of either the lower lip or the right middle finger. Analyses focused on the sensory-evoked N1 in the event-related potential and the extent of alpha band desynchronization elicited by the stimuli. N1 amplitude over fronto-central sites was significantly enhanced when the bilabial /pa/ sound was paired with tactile lip stimulation and when the finger-snapping sound was paired with tactile stimulation of the finger. Post-stimulus alpha desynchronization at central sites was also enhanced when the /pa/ sound was accompanied by tactile stimulation of the lip. These novel findings indicate that neural aspects of somatosensory-auditory interactions are influenced by the congruency between the location of the bodily touch and the bodily origin of a perceived sound.

However, it has traditionally been difficult to design experiments with rich three-dimensional contexts that resemble our everyday environments, while maintaining control over the linguistic and nonlinguistic information that is available. Here we test the validity of combining electroencephalography (EEG) and virtual reality (VR) to overcome this problem. We recorded electrophysiological brain activity during language processing in a well-controlled three-dimensional virtual audiovisual environment. Participants were immersed in a virtual restaurant while wearing EEG equipment. In the restaurant, participants encountered virtual restaurant guests. Each guest was seated at a separate table with an object on it (e.g., a plate with salmon). The restaurant guest would then produce a sentence (e.g., "I just ordered this salmon."). The noun in the spoken sentence could either match ("salmon") or mismatch ("pasta") the object on the table, creating a situation in which the auditory information was either appropriate or inappropriate in the visual context. We observed a reliable N400 effect as a consequence of the mismatch. This finding validates the combined use of VR and EEG as a tool to study the neurophysiological mechanisms of everyday language comprehension in rich, ecologically valid settings.

J	Li, STK; Hsiao, JHW				Li, Sara Tze Kwan; Hsiao, Janet Hui-wen			Music reading expertise modulates hemispheric lateralization in English word processing but not in Chinese character processing	COGNITION			English	Article						Music reading expertise; English word processing; Chinese character processing; Visual word processing; EEG; Event-related potential (ERP)	VISUAL-PERCEPTION; BRAIN; RECOGNITION; INFORMATION; FACE; COMPONENTS; PSEUDOWORD; ASYMMETRY; SUPPORTS; POSITION	Music notation and English word reading both involve mapping horizontally arranged visual components to components in sound, in contrast to reading in logographic languages such as Chinese. Accordingly, music-reading expertise may influence English word processing more than Chinese character processing. Here we showed that musicians named English words significantly faster than non-musicians when words were presented in the left visual field/right hemisphere (RH) or the center position, suggesting an advantage of RH processing due to music reading experience. This effect was not observed in Chinese character naming. A follow-up ERP study showed that in a sequential matching task, musicians had reduced RH N170 responses to English nonwords under the processing of musical segments as compared with non-musicians, suggesting a shared visual processing mechanism in the RH between music notation and English non-word reading. This shared mechanism may be related to the letter-by-letter, serial visual processing that characterizes RH English word recognition (e.g., Lavidor & Ellis, 2001), which may consequently facilitate English word processing in the RH in musicians. Thus, music reading experience may have differential influences on the processing of different languages, depending on their similarities in the cognitive processes involved.

While recent neural studies have explored impaired processing of facial expressions, little is known about deficits in emotional speech processing, or the specific stages of processing at which they occur. This study examined if pre-attentive detection and attention to emotional speech is impaired in BD, relative to healthy individuals. Methods: The EEG data was collected from 14 individuals with BD and 14 healthy control (HC) participants while the auditory stimuli was presented via a passive three-stimulus oddball sequence which included emotionally (neutral, happy, sad) spoken syllables and acoustically matched nonvocal tones. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were evaluated in terms of Mismatch Negativity (MMN) and P3a (event-related potentials signals). Results: Individuals with BD showed normal MMN amplitude, but significantly delayed MMN latency and reduced P3a amplitude in response to the emotional syllables compared to HC. Limitations: Small sample size, lack of control of psychopharmacological intervention and no inclusion of an affective prosody-labelling task. Conclusions: The finding that changes in emotional speech prosody in the pre-attentive stages of processing (MMN) were unimpaired in individuals with BD; while automatic orientation towards emotionally salient speech (P3a) was reduced compared to HC, suggests that vocal emotional cues may not be recognised as salient by individuals with BD, resulting in fewer attentional resources allocation to further processing. This may lead to poorer integration of auditory emotional cues and other sensory information and negatively impact interpersonal and psychosocial functions.

Sensory and cross-network contributions to response inhibition in patients with schizophrenia	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						EEG; Stop signal task; Impulsivity; Schizophrenia; Resting state functional connectivity	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; WHITE-MATTER INTEGRITY; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS; MRI; SIGNAL; TASK; DYNAMICS	Patients with schizophrenia show response inhibition deficits equal to or greater than those seen in impulse-control disorders, and these deficits contribute to poor outcome. However, little is known about the circuit abnormalities underlying this impairment. To address this, we examined stop signal task performance in 21 patients with schizophrenia and 21 healthy controls using event related potential (ERP) and resting state functional connectivity. Patients showed prolonged stop signal reaction time (SSRT) and reduced N1, N2, and P3 amplitudes compared to controls. Across groups, P3 amplitudes were maximal after SSRT (i. e., after the time associated with the decision to stop occurred), suggesting that this component indexed response monitoring. Multiple regression analyses showed that longer SSRTs were independently related to 1) patient status, 2) reduced N1 amplitude on successful stop trials and 3) reduced anticorrelated resting state functional connectivity between visual and frontoparietal cortical networks. This study used a combined multimodal imaging approach to better understand the network abnormalities that underlie response inhibition in schizophrenia. It is the first of its kind to specifically assess the brain's resting state functional architecture in combination with behavioral and ERP methods to investigate response inhibition in schizophrenia.

In this study, we explored the electrophysiological correlates of the complex interplay of reward processing with cost anticipation. To this aim, healthy adult participants performed a gambling task where the outcome (monetary reward vs. no-reward) and its expectancy were manipulated on a trial by trial basis while 64-channel EEG was recorded. Crucially, on some trials, the no-reward outcome could be transformed to a rewarding one, pending effort expenditure by means of an orthogonal dot clicking task, enabling us to compare at the electrophysiological level reward processing when cost was anticipated or not. We extracted and compared different markers of reward processing at the feedback level using both classical ERPs and EEG spectral perturbations in specific bands (theta, delta and beta-gamma). At the behavioral level, participants reported enhanced pleasure and relief when the outcome was rewarding but effort expenditure could be avoided, relative to a control condition where the outcome was rewarding but no extra effort was anticipated. In this condition, EEG results showed a larger Reward Positivity ERP component and increased power in the Delta and Beta-gamma bands. By comparison, cost anticipation did not influence the processing of the no-reward outcome at the FRN and frontal midline theta levels. All together, these neurophysiological results suggest that effort avoidance is associated with increased reward processing.

EEG studies often observe load-associated sustained negative activity during SWM retention. Yet, whether and how such sustained negative activity in retention relates to network-specific functional activation/deactivation and relates to individual differences in SWM capacity remain to be elucidated. To cover these gaps, we recorded concurrent EEG-fMRI data in 70 healthy young adults during the Sternberg delayed-match-to-sample SWM task with three memory load levels. To a subset of participants (N = 28) that performed the task properly and had artefact-free fMRI and EEG data, we employed a novel temporo-spatial principal component analysis to derive load-dependent negative slow wave (NSW) from retention-related event-related potentials. The associations between NSW responses with SWM capacity were divergent in the higher (N = 14) and lower (N = 14) SWM capacity groups. Specifically, larger load-related increase in NSW amplitude was associated with greater SWM capacity for the higher capacity group but lower SWM capacity for the lower capacity group. Furthermore, for the higher capacity group, larger NSW amplitude was related to greater activation in bilateral parietal areas of the fronto-parietal network (FPN) and greater deactivation in medial frontal gyrus and posterior mid-cingulate cortex of the default mode network (DMN) during retention. In contrast, the lower capacity group did not show similar pattern. Instead, greater NSW was linked to higher deactivation in right posterior middle temporal gyrus. Our findings shed light on the possible differential EEG-informed neural network mechanism during memory maintenance underlying individual differences in SWM capacity.

J	Simon, DM; Wallace, MT				Simon, David M.; Wallace, Mark T.			Integration and Temporal Processing of Asynchronous Audiovisual Speech	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; VISUAL SPEECH; AUDITORY-CORTEX; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; LEADING SENSE; PERCEPTION; EEG; CONFLICT; BINDING	Multisensory integration of visual mouth movements with auditory speech is known to offer substantial perceptual benefits, particularly under challenging (i.e., noisy) acoustic conditions. Previous work characterizing this process has found that ERPs to auditory speech are of shorter latency and smaller magnitude in the presence of visual speech. We sought to determine the dependency of these effects on the temporal relationship between the auditory and visual speech streams using EEG. We found that reductions in ERP latency and suppression of ERP amplitude are maximal when the visual signal precedes the auditory signal by a small interval and that increasing amounts of asynchrony reduce these effects in a continuous manner. Time-frequency analysis revealed that these effects are found primarily in the theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) bands, with a central topography consistent with auditory generators. Theta effects also persisted in the lower portion of the band (3.5-5 Hz), and this late activity was more frontally distributed. Importantly, the magnitude of these late theta oscillations not only differed with the temporal characteristics of the stimuli but also served to predict participants' task performance. Our analysis thus reveals that suppression of single-trial brain responses by visual speech depends strongly on the temporal concordance of the auditory and visual inputs. It further illustrates that processes in the lower theta band, which we suggest as an index of incongruity processing, might serve to reflect the neural correlates of individual differences in multisensory temporal perception.

How the brain extracts recursive grammar is a central question in musical cognition and other cognitive neuroscience, but the precise mechanism remains unclear. By analyzing event related potentials (ERPs) and neural oscillatory activity, the present study investigated neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the processing of center-embedded structure in music by examining the differences in center-embedded and non-embedded structure processing and evaluating how these differences are affected by musical proficiency. Based on Western musical proficiency, the subjects were divided into two groups, non-experts and experts. The results revealed that for non-experts, the processing of center-embedded structure elicited greater early right-anterior negativity (ERAN) and N5 components as well as, reduced alpha and gamma activities than did the non-embedded structure. For experts, no significant difference in the ERP response was observed between the processing of non-embedded and center-embedded structures; however, the processing of center-embedded structure elicited increased beta activity compared to non-embedded structure. These findings indicate that listeners different in proficiency would rely on different cognitive neural mechanisms in music processing with the syntactic complexity increases.

The goal of this study was to determine whether pain hypervigilance further worsens habituation of event-related potentials, measured in a pain-rating protocol of 25 painful somatosensory electrical stimuli, in patients with chronic pain. Methods: Pain hypervigilance was assessed with the Pain Vigilance Awareness Questionnaire and analyzed using the event-related fixed interval areas multilevel technique, which enables one to study within-session habituation. In a cohort of 111 participants, 33 reported chronic pain. This chronic pain group was compared with 33 pain-free individuals, matched for age and sex. Results: The relationship between pain status and habituation was not moderated by pain hypervigilance. Chronic pain status affected linear habituation and dishabituation (quadratic function) from 220 to 260 ms for nearly all electrodes, and from 580 to 640 ms for frontal electrodes. The effect of pain hypervigilance on habituation was observed primarily from 480 to 820 ms poststimulus for right-sided and central electrodes. Conclusion: Pain hypervigilance and chronic pain independently influence habituation to painful stimuli - although not synergistically. To confirm that these effects are mediated by separate pathways, further research is required, in which electroencephalography is combined with other modalities with adequate spatial resolution, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging.

Many studies have found that unpleasant stimuli could produce stronger emotional effects than pleasant stimuli could. Although there has been a notion that triangle is perceived as negative and circle as positive, there has been no systematic study to map the degrees of valence of shapes with different affective perceptions. Here, we employed four shapes (ellipse, triangle, and line-drawn happy and angry faces) to investigate the behavior and electrophysiological responses, in order to systematically study shape-induced affective perception. The reaction time delay and the event-related potential (ERP), particularly the early ERP component, were applied to find the associations with different affective perceptions. Our behavioral results showed that reaction time for angry face was significantly shorter than those for the other three types of stimuli (p < 0.05). In the ERP results, P1, N1, P2, and N2 amplitudes for angry face were significantly larger than those for happy face. Similarly, P1, N1, P2, and N2 amplitudes for triangle were significantly larger than those for ellipse. Particularly, PI amplitude in the parietal lobe for angry face was the strongest, followed by happy face, triangle, and ellipse. Hence, this work found distinct electrophysiological evidence to map the shape-induced affective perception. It supports the hypothesis that affective strain would induce larger amplitude than affective ease does and strong affective stimuli induce larger amplitude than mild affective stimuli do.

Previous studies have described atypical patterns of decreased short range and increased long range connectivity in ASD [1]. However, it remains unclear whether group level features of circuit dysfunction are consistently present across the range of cognitive function seen in the autism spectrum. The dynamics of neural oscillations in the alpha range (6-12 Hz) are exquisitely sensitive to healthy development of functional and structural connectivity. Alpha-band coherence, measured with high temporal precision electroencephalography (EEG) therefore represents an ideal tool for studying neural connectivity in developmental populations. Here we examined spontaneous alpha phase coherence in a heterogeneous sample of 59 children with ASD and 39 age matched typically developing children. Using a data driven approach, we conducted an unbiased examination of all possible atypical connectivity patterns across all cortical regions. Long-range hypoconnectivity was present in children with ASD compared to typically developing children, with temporal interhemispheric connectivity showing the largest difference between the two groups. Decreased long range alpha coherence distinguishes a heterogeneous group of ASD children from typically developing children. Interhemispheric temporal hypoconnectivity represents a fundamental functional difference in children with ASD across a wide cognitive and age range that may reflect white matter disturbances or increased signal variability at temporal sites in ASD.

Separate lines of research using these measures have often employed the same stimuli, paradigms, and samples; however, there remains relatively little understanding of the way in which individual differences in one of these measures relates to the other, and all prior research has been conducted in psychiatrically healthy samples and using emotional scenes (not faces). Here, 32 combat-exposed U.S. military veterans with varying levels of posttraumatic stress symptomatology viewed affective social stimuli (angry, fearful, and happy faces) and geometric shapes during separate EEG and fMRI BOLD recordings. Temporospatial principal component analysis was used to quantify the face-elicited LPP in a data-driven manner, prior to conducting whole-brain correlations between resulting positivities and fMRI BOLD elicited by faces. Participants with larger positivities to fearful faces (> shapes) showed increased activation in the amygdala; larger positivities to angry and happy faces (> shapes) were associated with increased BOLD activation in the posterior fusiform gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus, respectively. Across all face types, larger positivities were associated with increased activation in the fusiform "face" area. Correlations using mean area amplitude LPPs showed an association with increased activation in the anterior insula for angry faces (> shapes). LPP-BOLD associations were not moderated by PTSD. Findings provide the first evidence of correspondence between face-elicited LPP and BOLD activation across a range of (normal to disordered) psychiatric health.

To investigate how bilinguals monitor their speech errors and control their languages in use, we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in unbalanced Dutch-English bilingual speakers in a cued language-switching task. We tested the conflict-based monitoring model of Nozari and colleagues by investigating the error-related negativity (ERN) and comparing the effects of the two switching directions (i.e., to the first language, L1 vs. to the second language, L2). Results show that the speakers made more language selection errors when switching from their L2 to the L1 than vice versa. In the EEG, we observed a robust ERN effect following language selection errors compared to correct responses, reflecting monitoring of speech errors. Most interestingly, the ERN effect was enlarged when the speakers were switching to their L2 ( less conflict) compared to switching to the L1 (more conflict). Our findings do not support the conflict-based monitoring model. We discuss an alternative account in terms of error prediction and reinforcement learning.

Cognitive impairments in schizophrenia have attracted interests as a treatment target, because they are considered to greatly affect functional outcome. Electrophysiological markers, including electroencephalogram (EEG), particularly, event-related potentials, have contributed to psychiatric research and clinical practice. In this review, we provide a summary of studies relating electrophysiological findings to cognitive performance in schizophrenia. Electrophysiological indices may provide an objective marker of cognitive processes, contributing to the development of effective interventions to improve cognitive and social outcomes.

This paper focuses on detecting those words which are unfamiliar to the users while reading using Electroencephalography (EEG). In particular, a word-familiarity prediction approach based on EEG signals from the user's brain waves has been developed. Word-familiarity refers whether a user is familiar with the word or not while reading the text. The recorded signals have been processed using Wavelet decomposition technique and four features, namely mean, standard deviation, Root Mean Square (RMS) and power have been computed from beta and gamma frequency bands. The prediction of word-familiarity has been performed using Random Forest (RF) classifier. Next, a decision fusion approach has also been used to boost the prediction performance. A dictionary based pop-up window has been developed to provide the meaning of the word when a user is found to be unfamiliar with the text. EEG dataset of 12 users has been developed while they are reading 25 words. The results show that the characteristics of brain waves at the time of unknown word perception can be detected, i.e., when the user comes across an unknown word then the pattern of his brain waves comes out to be totally different from the pattern when he is familiar with the word. Similarly, the pattern of brain waves has been found to be different for the word for which the user has confusion in his mind. An accuracy of 82% has been recorded using the proposed classifier combination approach. Finally, a comparative study with other popular classification technique is also discussed.

Its effects are shown for cognitive processing, and behavior in the motor and perceptual domains. However, evidence of tDCS effects in the perceptual domain particularly for auditory processing is rare. Therefore, and in the context of disturbances in auditory processing in psychiatric populations, e.g., in patients with auditory verbal hallucinations, we aimed to investigate the potential modulatory effect of tDCS on the excitability of left posterior temporal cortex in detail. We included 24 healthy participants in a crossover design, applying sham and anodal stimulation in two measurement sessions 1 week apart. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded while participants listened to tones before, during, and after stimulation. Amplitudes and latencies of P50, N100, and P200 auditory-evoked potentials (AEP) were compared between anodal and sham stimulation, and between time points before, during, and after tDCS. In contrast to previous studies, results demonstrate no significant differences between stimulation types or time points for any of the investigated AEP amplitudes or latencies. Furthermore, a topographical analysis did not show any topographical differences during peak time periods of the investigated AEP for stimulation types and time points besides a habituation effect. Thus, our results suggest that tDCS modulation of excitability of the left posterior temporal cortex, targeting the auditory cortex, does not have any effect on AEP. This is particularly interesting in the context of tDCS as a potential treatment for changed electrophysiological parameters and symptoms of psychiatric diseases, e.g., lower N100 or auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia.

The human brain attempts to partially suppress the processing of potential distractors in order that motor tasks can be completed successfully. The present study sought to further understand the attentional neural systems that activate in response to potential distractors during the execution of movements. Nineteen participants (9 women and 10 men) were administered isometric ankle-dorsiflexion tasks for 10 s at a light intensity. Electroencephalography was used to assess the electrical activity in the brain, and a music excerpt was used to distract participants. Three conditions were administered: auditory distraction during the execution of movement (auditory distraction; AD), movement execution in the absence of auditory distraction (control; CO), and auditory distraction in the absence of movement (stimulus-only; SO). AD was compared with SO to identify the mechanisms underlying the attentional processing associated with attentional shifts from internal association (task-related) to external (task-unrelated) sensory cues. The results of the present study indicated that the EMG amplitude was not compromised when the auditory stimulus was administered. Accordingly, EEG activity was upregulated at 0.368 s in AD when compared to SO. Source reconstruction analysis indicated that right and central parietal regions of the cortex activated at 0.368 s in order to reduce the processing of task-irrelevant stimuli during the execution of movements. The brain mechanisms that underlie the control of potential distractors during exercise were possibly associated with the activity of the frontoparietal network.

Assessment of Multivariate Neural Time Series by Phase Synchrony Clustering in a Time-Frequency-Topography Representation	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SINGLE-TRIALS; EEG; DYNAMICS; DECOMPOSITION; TRANSFORM; COHERENCE; LOCKING	Most EEG phase synchrony measures are of bivariate nature. Those that are multivariate focus on producing global indices of the synchronization state of the system. Thus, better descriptions of spatial and temporal local interactions are still in demand. A framework for characterization of phase synchrony relationships between multivariate neural time series is presented, applied either in a single epoch or over an intertrial assessment, relying on a proposed clustering algorithm, termed Multivariate Time Series Clustering by Phase Synchrony, which generates fuzzy clusters for each multivalued time sample and thereupon obtains hard clusters according to a circular variance threshold; such cluster modes are then depicted in Time-Frequency-Topography representations of synchrony state beyond mere global indices. EEG signals from P300 Speller sessions of four subjects were analyzed, obtaining useful insights of synchrony patterns related to the ERP and even revealing steady-state artifacts at 7.6 Hz. Further, contrast maps of Levenshtein Distance highlight synchrony differences between ERP and no-ERP epochs, mainly at delta and theta bands. The framework, which is not limited to one synchrony measure, allows observing dynamics of phase changes and interactions among channels and can be applied to analyze other cognitive states rather than ERP versus no ERP.

Significant progress has been made in the past two decades to considerably improve the performance of steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interface (BCI). However, there are still some unsolved problems that may help us to improve BCI performance, one of which is that our understanding of the dynamic process of SSVEP is still superficial, especially for the transient-state response. Approach. This study introduced an antiphase stimulation method (antiphase: phase 0/pi), which can simultaneously separate and extract SSVEP and event-related potential (ERP) signals from EEG, and eliminate the interference of ERP to SSVEP. Based on the SSVEP signals obtained by the antiphase stimulation method, the envelope of SSVEP was extracted by the Hilbert transform, and the dynamic model of SSVEP was quantitatively studied by mathematical modeling. The step response of a second-order linear system was used to fit the envelope of SSVEP, and its characteristics were represented by four parameters with physical and physiological meanings: one was amplitude related, one was latency related and two were frequency related. This study attempted to use pre-stimulation paradigms to modulate the dynamic model parameters, and quantitatively analyze the results by applying the dynamic model to further explore the pre-stimulation methods that had the potential to improve BCI performance. Main results. The results showed that the dynamic model had good fitting effect with SSVEP under three pre-stimulation paradigms. The test results revealed that the parameters of SSVEP dynamic models could be modulated by the pre-stimulation baseline luminance, and the gray baseline luminance pre-stimulation obtained the highest performance. Significance. This study proposed a dynamic model which was helpful to understand and utilize the transient characteristics of SSVEP. This study also found that pre-stimulation could be used to adjust the parameters of SSVEP model, and had the potential to improve the performance of SSVEP-BCI.

N400 Response Indexes Word Learning from Linguistic Context in Children	LANGUAGE LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SPHERICAL SPLINES; VOCABULARY; LANGUAGE; ADULTS; BRAIN; ERP; AGE; INSTRUCTION; ACQUISITION	Word learning from linguistic context is essential for vocabulary growth from grade school onward; however, little is known about the mechanisms underlying successful word learning in children. Current methods for studying word learning development require children to identify the meaning of the word after each exposure, a method that interacts with the act of learning. In this study, school-aged children (11-14 years) performed a word learning task as their EEG was recorded. The word learning task required children to identify the meaning of new words presented in sentence triplets that either provided enough context to support word learning or did not provide a supportive context. Children displayed a significant attenuation of the N400 for words for which they identified meanings compared to those for which they were unable to identify meanings. Additionally, the N400 to the final presentation of learned words paralleled that of a known real word. These results indicate that the same mechanisms related to the N400 for extracting word meaning may be associated with word learning in children.

We examined the neural underpinnings of active maintenance and interference management in the n-back task by manipulating load (1-back vs 3-back) and including so-called lure stimuli. ERPs of 27 young adults revealed that the 1-back condition enabling active maintenance showed a positive slow wave (PSW) prior to the next stimulus (-600-0 ms) and augmented P2 (190-290 ms) and P3b (330-430 ms) responses after the stimulus appeared, albeit the latter effects were driven by the initial PSW. Moreover, PSW amplitude correlated negatively with reaction time in the 1-back condition. Responses to lures showed interference, accompanied with different ERP effects for the two load levels. Our results support the view that PSW reflects efficient WM maintenance and suggest two distinct neuronal correlates for interference in WM.

However, few studies have investigated the large-scale networks of P300 as well as the potential relationships between large-scale networks and P300, particularly in EEG signal. When using group independent component analysis (gICA) to investigate the large-scale EEG networks, some resting-state networks, such as the default mode network, have been observed, while the related task-state networks (TSNs) of P300 are still unknown. In this paper, we estimated the time courses of cortical voxels following EEG source localization and then adopted gICA at the group level to identify the related P300-TSNs. Thereafter, we constructed and further investigated the potential relationships between the properties of functional network connectivity (FNC) and P300 amplitude. Our findings revealed six best-fit common functional networks that participated in the generation of P300, namely, the primary visual network, visual network, central executive network, left parietal network, attention network, and sensorimotor network. Specifically, the FNC properties significantly related to the P300 amplitude, as well as some FNC connections. In addition, when using FNC properties to classify the high-and low-amplitude groups, a relatively high-classification accuracy of 87.26% for linear discriminant analysis and of 86.31% for support vector machine were achieved. These findings confirmed the validation of gICA in mining large-scale networks in cortical EEG and may help us better understand the inter-subject P300 variability.

Ethnic effects when facing children: An ERP study	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Intergroup effects; Facial processing; Child faces; EEG; N170; N200	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; OWN-RACE BIAS; SOCIAL-PERCEPTION; FACE PERCEPTION; TIME-COURSE; INFANT; BRAIN; EXPECTATIONS; TEACHERS; GENDER	Abundant research has highlighted a disadvantage experienced by children of ethnic minority groups in, for example, educational and health care settings. In order to understand implicit attitudes that contribute to ethnic disparities, underlying neural correlates have been widely studied. However, this has been limited to the context of adults. Using a sample of nulliparous Caucasian females (N = 46), the current study is the first to examine how early attentional and facial perceptual processing stages, assessed with event-related brain potentials (ERPs), differentiate for stimuli of young ingroup (of the same ethnicity) or outgroup (of a different ethnicity) children. Additionally, we assessed how a differentiation in ERPs may relate to subsequent adult responsiveness to children by measuring both cuteness ratings and motivation to view child faces. Similar to previous findings for adult facial stimuli, we found significant differences in attentional (N200) and facial perceptual (N170) processing when adults were faced with children of different ethnicities. Furthermore, increased differentiation in attentional processing (N200) for ingroup and outgroup children was associated with reduced cuteness ratings of outgroup children. Importantly however, participants showed no overall preference for ingroup child faces, as motivation to view child faces was even greater towards outgroup child faces. In addition, increased self-reported motivation for parental care was related to enhanced cuteness appraisals of outgroup child faces. Taken together, these findings reveal how early social categorization processes may lead to biased behavior when interacting with children of ethnic minorities.

Hearing sounds as words: Neural responses to environmental sounds in the context of fluent speech	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Environmental sounds; Language processing; Event-related potential; N400; Sentence understanding; Context	BRAIN POTENTIALS; SEMANTIC INCONGRUITY; SENTENCE CONTEXT; NATURAL SOUNDS; VISUAL-STIMULI; LANGUAGE; PERCEPTION; ERP; INAPPROPRIATE; RECOGNITION	Environmental sounds (ES) can be understood easily when substituted for words in sentences, suggesting that linguistic context benefits may be mediated by processes more general than some language-specific theories assert. However, the underlying neural processing is not understood. EEG was recorded for spoken sentences ending in either a spoken word or a corresponding ES. Endings were either congruent or incongruent with the sentence frame, and thus were expected to produce N400 activity. However, if ES and word meanings are combined with language context by different mechanisms, different N400 responses would be expected. Incongruent endings (both words and ES) elicited frontocentral negativities corresponding to the N400 typically observed to incongruent spoken words. Moreover, sentential constraint had similar effects on N400 topographies to ES and words. Comparison of speech and ES responses suggests that understanding meaning in speech context may be mediated by similar neural mechanisms for these two types of stimuli.

The P300 event-related potential is mostly characterized by its amplitude or its area, which correlate with the spelling accuracy of the P300 speller. Here, we introduce a novel approach for estimating the efficiency of this BC by considering the P300 signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a parameter that estimates the spatial and temporal noise levels and has a significantly stronger correlation with spelling accuracy. Furthermore, we suggest a Gaussian noise model, which utilizes the P300 event-related potential SNR to predict spelling accuracy under various conditions for LDA-based classification. We demonstrate the utility of this analysis using real data and discuss its potential applications, such as speeding up the process of electrode selection.

Electrophysiological dynamics of Chinese phonology during visual word recognition in Chinese-English bilinguals	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TIME-COURSE; UNCONSCIOUS TRANSLATION; OSCILLATORY RESPONSES; SEMANTIC ACTIVATION; REPETITION; LANGUAGE; BRAIN; EEG; ERP; POTENTIALS	Silent word reading leads to the activation of orthographic (spelling), semantic (meaning), as well as phonological (sound) information. For bilinguals, native language information can also be activated automatically when they read words in their second language. For example, when Chinese-English bilinguals read words in their second language (English), the phonology of the Chinese translations is automatically activated. Chinese phonology, however, consists of consonants and vowels (segmental) and tonal information. To what extent these two aspects of Chinese phonology are activated is yet unclear. Here, we used behavioural measures, event-related potentials and oscillatory EEG to investigate Chinese segmental and tonal activation during word recognition. Evidence of Chinese segmental activation was found when bilinguals read English words (faster responses, reduced N400, gamma-band power reduction) and when they read Chinese words (increased LPC, gamma-band power reduction). In contrast, evidence for Chinese tonal activation was only found when bilinguals read Chinese words (gamma-band power increase). Together, our converging behavioural and electrophysiological evidence indicates that Chinese segmental information is activated during English word reading, whereas both segmental and tonal information are activated during Chinese word reading. Importantly, gamma-band oscillations are modulated differently by tonal and segmental activation, suggesting independent processing of Chinese tones and segments.

The ERN has been proposed as a biomarker for anxiety and a substantial amount of research suggests the ERN increases across development. Further, the ERN may relate to individual differences and the development of cognitive control. Despite the large quantity of research on this topic, there have been no studies focusing on the relationship between pubertal hormones and the ERN. Previous work suggests developmental increases may begin sooner for girls than for boys, suggesting that puberty may impact the ERN. The current study examined the relationship between pubertal hormones and the ERN amplitude in a sample of 99 females between 8 and 14 years old. Each participant and the parent who accompanied them completed the Pubertal Developmental Scale (PDS) to assess the degree to which pubertal indicators are present. Participants also completed a Go/NoGo Task while EEG was recorded and participants provided saliva samples for hormone assays. Results indicated that ERN was significantly related to both the dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) hormone and PDS scores. A simultaneous multivariate regression suggested that DHEA levels significantly predict the ERN, even when controlling for age, behavioral variables, and PDS. These findings suggest that ERN amplitude is related to DHEA levels, further linking puberty to developmental increases in the ERN. Future research should examine this relationship in the context of developmental increases in anxiety symptoms.

N100-P300 Speller is a spelling BCI system that utilizes two kinds of event-related potential (ERP), N100 and P300. This system achieved higher accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR) compared with P300 Speller (Sato H, Washizawa Y, N100-P300 speller BCI with detection of user's input intention. In: Proceedings of 6th international brain-computer interface conference 43, 2014). Since N100-P300 Speller requires nine visual stimulations to input one command, it is necessary to boost the classification accuracy or reduce the flashing intervals in order to improve ITR. The present study aims to improve ITR by an asynchronous stimulationmethod in N100-P300 Speller. The result showed that ITR in the proposed method was improved 0.15 bit/s at an average compared with the conventional N100-P300 Speller. The proposed N100-P300 Speller achieved faster spelling system with lower burden for the user.

Focal and ambient modes were identified by averaging EFRP waveforms about the beginning of long eye fixations followed by short saccades and short fixations followed by long saccades, respectively. Thirty experts with formal training in visual arts and thirty-two non-experts freely viewed 150 figurative paintings presented for 20 s, each. After viewing the painting, the participant answered the question: "Is this painting beautiful?" Differences were found between the group of experts and non-experts due to the amplitude of EFRPs but only in focal mode, which is related to top-down, focused attention on the objects. Long fixations of experts had a higher amplitude of the parietal P2 recorded from right site than non-experts. In the group of experts, the frontal P2 was higher for long fixations on not beautiful paintings in comparison to long fixation on beautiful paintings. Moreover, in focal mode, there were higher occipital lambda response and N1-P2 complex for not beautiful than beautiful paintings. These results are discussed in the light of the results of studies on the effect of visual art expertise on event-related potentials (ERPs), ERP studies during aesthetic judgment task, and the knowledge of different modes of visual processing and EFRPs.

EEG time-warping to study non-strictly-periodic EEG signals related to the production of rhythmic movements	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; Frequency tagging; Time warping; Rhythm; Sensorimotor synchronization; Anisochrony; Non-stationarity	STATE EVOKED-POTENTIALS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; SENSORIMOTOR SYNCHRONIZATION; ENTRAINMENT; DYNAMICS; STIMULATION; SEPARATION; REMOVAL; BEAT	Background: Many sensorimotor functions are intrinsically rhythmic, and are underlined by neural processes that are functionally distinct from neural responses related to the processing of transient events. EEG frequency tagging is a technique that is increasingly used in neuroscience to study these processes. It relies on the fact that perceiving and/or producing rhythms generates periodic neural activity that translates into periodic variations of the EEG signal. In the EEG spectrum, those variations appear as peaks localized at the frequency of the rhythm and its harmonics. New method: Many natural rhythms, such as music or dance, are not strictly periodic and, instead, show fluctuations of their period over time. Here, we introduce a time-warping method to identify non-strictly-periodic EEG activities in the frequency domain. Results: EEG time-warping can be used to characterize the sensorimotor activity related to the performance of self-paced rhythmic finger movements. Furthermore, the EEG time-warping method can disentangle auditoryand movement-related EEG activity produced when participants perform rhythmic movements synchronized to an acoustic rhythm. This is possible because the movement-related activity has different period fluctuations than the auditory-related activity. Comparison with existing methods: With the classic frequency-tagging approach, rhythm fluctuations result in a spreading of the peaks to neighboring frequencies, to the point that they cannot be distinguished from background noise. Conclusions: The proposed time-warping procedure is as a simple and effective mean to study natural nonstrictly-periodic rhythmic neural processes such as rhythmic movement production, acoustic rhythm perception and sensorimotor synchronization.

MEG and electroencephalography (EEG) are closely related complementary methods and should be interpreted together whenever possible. This manuscript covers the basic physical and physiological principles of MEG and discusses the main aspects of state-of-the-art MEG data analysis. We provide guidelines for best practices of patient preparation, stimulus presentation, MEG data collection and analysis, as well as for MEG interpretation in routine clinical examinations. In 2017, about 200 whole-scalp MEG devices were in operation worldwide, many of them located in clinical environments. Yet, the established clinical indications for MEG examinations remain few, mainly restricted to the diagnostics of epilepsy and to preoperative functional evaluation of neurosurgical patients. We are confident that the extensive ongoing basic MEG research indicates potential for the evaluation of neurological and psychiatric syndromes, developmental disorders, and the integrity of cortical brain networks after stroke. Basic and clinical research is, thus, paving way for new clinical applications to be identified by an increasing number of practitioners of MEG.

We previously provided initial evidence of shared and distinct event-related potential (ERP) impairments in ADHD and BD in a direct electrophysiological comparison, but no study to date has compared neural mechanisms underlying attentional impairments with finer-grained brain oscillatory markers. Here, we aimed to compare the neural underpinnings of impaired attentional processes in ADHD and BD, by examining event-related brain oscillations during a reaction-time task under slow-unrewarded baseline and fast-incentive conditions. We measured cognitive performance, ERPs and brain-oscillatory modulations of power and phase variability in 20 women with ADHD, 20 women with BD (currently euthymic) and 20 control women. Compared to controls, both ADHD and BD groups showed increased RTV in the baseline condition and increased RTV, theta phase variability and lower contingent negative variation in the fast-incentive condition. Unlike controls, neither clinical group showed an improvement from the slow-unrewarded baseline to the fast-incentive condition in attentional P3 amplitude or alpha power suppression. Most impairments did not differ between the disorders, as only an adjustment in beta suppression between conditions (lower in the ADHD group) distinguished between the clinical groups. These findings suggest shared impairments in women with ADHD and BD in cognitive and neural variability, preparatory activity and inability to adjust attention allocation and activation. These overlapping impairments may represent shared neurobiological mechanisms of attentional dysfunction in ADHD and BD, and potentially underlie common symptoms in both disorders.

Reduced electroencephalogram responses to standard and target auditory stimuli in bipolar disorder and the impact of psychotic features: Analysis of event-related potentials, spectral power, and inter-trial coherence	BIPOLAR DISORDERS			English	Article						event-related spectral perturbation; inter-trial coherence; N1; oddball; P3b; psychotic features	ODDBALL TASK; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL ENDOPHENOTYPES; RATING-SCALE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; P300; OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; ALPHA; DELTA; ABNORMALITIES	Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with reductions in the P3b event-related potential (ERP) response to target auditory stimuli, which suggests deficits in context updating. Previous studies have typically examined these responses in the temporal domain, which may not capture alterations in specific frequencies of phase-locked or induced electrophysiological activity. Therefore, the present study examined early and late ERPs in temporal and frequency domains in a bipolar sample with and without current psychotic features. Methods: The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded during an auditory oddball task. Seventy-five BD patients and 98 healthy controls (HCs) discriminated between standard and target tones. N1 ERPs to standards and P3b ERPs to targets were analyzed in the temporal domain. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) and inter-trial coherence (ITC) were analyzed in the frequency domain. Results: The early N1 response to standard tones was not significantly different between the total HC and BD samples irrespective of psychotic features. However, N1 amplitude was reduced in BD patients with psychotic features (BDP) compared to HCs and BD patients without psychotic features. P3b was reduced in BD patients versus HCs, with the BDP sample having the most reduced amplitude. In the time-frequency analysis, delta and theta ERSP and ITC were reduced across the time window for both standard and target stimuli in BD patients compared to HCs, but did not differ in the psychotic features analysis. Conclusions: The results provide neural evidence that BD is associated with disrupted sensory, attentional, and cognitive processing of auditory stimuli, which may be worsened with the presence of psychotic features.

However, there is limited research exploring whether variations in natural sleep patterns produce similar difficulties to those seen in sleep deprivation studies. The aim of the current study was to explore whether naturalistic reductions in sleep duration and/or sleep quality were associated with behavioural and electro-physiological measures of cognitive control. Sixty undergraduate students were asked to wear an actigraph for 7 consecutive nights before completing a hybrid Flanker-Go/NoGo task whilst continuous EEG data were recorded. Participants were assigned to high or low sleep quality and short or long sleep duration groups using the National Sleep Foundation guidelines. Results indicated that individuals who, on average, slept < 7 h each night showed inefficiencies in error-monitoring, as reflected by a reduction in amplitude of the error-related negativity (ERN) in comparison to those with longer sleep duration. These findings suggest that natural variations in sleep quantity are associated with atypical error detection.

Throughout taxa, individuals are more likely to become dominant if they act first in social situations and acting fast may provide evolutionary advantage; yet whether fast decision-making is a behavioral predisposition of dominant persons outside of social contexts is not known. Following characterization of participants for social dominance motivation, we found that, indeed, men high in social dominance respond faster-without loss of accuracy-than those low in dominance across a variety of decision-making tasks. Both groups did not differ in a simple reaction task. Then, we selected a decision-making task and applied high-density electroencephalography (EEG) to assess temporal dynamics of brain activation through event related potentials. We found that promptness to respond in the choice task in dominant individuals is related to a strikingly amplified brain signal at approximately 240 ms post-stimulus presentation. Source imaging analyses identified higher activity in the left insula and in the cingulate, right inferior temporal and right angular gyri in high than in low dominance participants. Our findings suggest that promptness to respond in choice situations, regardless of social context, is a biomarker for social disposition.

A Novel, Fast, Reliable, and Data-Driven Method for Simultaneous Single-Trial Mining and Amplitude-Latency Estimation Based on Proximity Graphs and Network Analysis	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						single-trials; data-mining; proximity graphs; network analysis; amplitude; latency; reliability; signal to noise ratio (SNR)	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; DIFFERENT REFERENCES; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; AUDITORY-CORTEX; EEG; BRAIN; VARIABILITY; RECORDINGS; COMPONENT	Both amplitude and latency of single-trial EEG/MEG recordings provide valuable information regarding functionality of the human brain. In this article, we provided a data-driven graph and network-based framework for mining information from multi-trial event-related brain recordings. In the first part, we provide the general outline of the proposed methodological approach. In the second part, we provide a more detailed illustration, and present the obtained results on every step of the algorithmic procedure. To justify the proposed framework instead of presenting the analytic data mining and graph-based steps, we address the problem of response variability, a prerequisite to reliable estimates for both the amplitude and latency on specific N/P components linked to the nature of the stimuli. The major question addressed in this study is the selection of representative single-trials with the aim of uncovering a less noisey averaged waveform elicited from the stimuli. This graph and network-based algorithmic procedure increases the signal-to-noise (SNR) of the brain response, a key pre-processing step to reveal significant and reliable amplitude and latency at a specific time after the onset of the stimulus and with the right polarity (N or P). We demonstrated the whole approach using electroencephalography (EEG) auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) recordings from 42 young healthy controls. The method is novel, fast and data-driven succeeding first to reveal the true waveform elicited by MMN on different conditions (frequency, intensity, duration, etc.). The proposed graph-oriented algorithmic pipeline increased the SNR of the characteristic waveforms and the reliability of amplitude and latency within the adopted cohort. We also demonstrated how different EEG reference schemes (REST vs. average) can influence amplitude-latency estimation. Simulation results revealed robust amplitude-latency estimations under different SNR and amplitude-latency variations with the proposed algorithm.

Adverse childhood experiences are associated with self-regulation and the magnitude of the error-related negativity difference	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Adverse childhood experiences; Error-related negativity; Medial prefrontal cortex	MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; ALTERS DENDRITIC MORPHOLOGY; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; BRAIN ACTIVITY; LIFE STRESS; RISK; ABUSE; VULNERABILITY	Trauma and stress, like that which occurs as a result of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), can change brain structure and function, especially in medial prefrontal and hippocampal areas, and can impact self-regulatory skill. The error-related negativity (ERN) is a medial frontal negative event-related potential (ERP) component that is more negative when a participant makes an erroneous versus correct response. We investigated the association of ACEs to adolescents' ERN and self-regulation. Forty-three 12-15 year olds performed a flanker task while EEG data were recorded. We found an interaction between trial type (correct vs incorrect) and group (low, medium and high trauma groups) on the ERN. The high-trauma group showed a larger Error-Correct difference than the low-and medium-trauma groups. This appeared as trend correlations between overall trauma exposure as a continuous variable and ERN-related variables. Trauma exposure was associated with reduced self-regulatory capacity, and accounting for self-regulation decreased the associations between trauma and the ERN, suggestive of a protective effect for self-regulation.

To react interactively and smoothly to such multimodal signals, infants must integrate all these signals. However, few empirical infant studies have investigated how multimodal social interaction with physical contact facilitates multimodal integration, especially regarding audio - tactile (A-T) information. By using electroencephalogram (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs), the present study investigated how neural processing involved in A-T integration is modulated by tactile interaction. Seven-to 8-months-old infants heard one pseudoword both whilst being tickled (multimodal 'A-T' condition), and not being tickled (unimodal 'A' condition). Thereafter, their EEG was measured during the perception of the same words. Compared to the A condition, the A-T condition resulted in enhanced ERPs and higher beta-band activity within the left temporal regions, indicating neural processing of A-T integration. Additionally, theta-band activity within the middle frontal region was enhanced, which may reflect enhanced attention to social information. Furthermore, differential ERPs correlated with the degree of engagement in the tickling interaction. We provide neural evidence that the integration of A-T information in infants' brains is facilitated through tactile interaction with others. Such plastic changes in neural processing may promote harmonious social interaction and effective learning in infancy.

Adolescents aged 12-15 years were allocated to an exercise and control group. The exercise group performed 20 min of aerobic and coordinative exercise per school day over a period of 8 weeks. Before and after the intervention, stimulus-locked event-related potentials were recorded during a Stroop task using electroencephalography. Cluster-based permutation testing revealed a greater increase of the P300 amplitude in the exercise compared to the control group, most pronounced for the parieto-occipital region. Additionally, increases in P300 amplitude were associated with decreases in incompatible reaction time on the Stroop task. An exercise program implemented during school-break time enhances adolescents' inhibitory control. This benefit seems to be due to an improved allocation of attentional resources towards the cognitive task.

This reduction assumingly results from dysfunctional activation of the primary auditory cortex by inner speech, which reduces its responsiveness to external stimuli. With this study, we tested the feasibility of enhancing the responsiveness of the primary auditory cortex to external stimuli with an upregulation of the event-related potential component N100 in healthy control subjects. A total of 15 healthy subjects performed 8 double-sessions of EEG-neurofeedback training over 2 weeks. The results of the used linear mixed effect model showed a significant active learning effect within sessions (t = 5.99, P < .001) against an unspecific habituation effect that lowered the N100 amplitude over time. Across sessions, a significant increase in the passive condition (t = 2.42, P = .03), named as carry-over effect, was observed. Given that the carry-over effect is one of the ultimate aims of neurofeedback, it seems reasonable to apply this neurofeedback training protocol to influence the N100 amplitude in patients with schizophrenia. This intervention could provide an alternative treatment option for auditory verbal hallucinations in these patients.

It has been shown that the design of preprocessing procedures can affect subsequent EEG data analysis outcomes. Preprocessing of EEG largely includes a number of processes, such as line noise removal, adjustment of referencing, elimination of bad EEG channels, and artifact removal. This chapter presents an overview of the methods available for each process and discusses practical considerations for applying these methods to the EEG signals. In particular, considerable attention is paid to the state-of-the-art artifact removal methods since there are still plenty of opportunities to enhance the artifact removal techniques for EEG, in the perspectives of both signal processing and neuroscience. It is desirable that this chapter provides the readers an overall view of EEG preprocessing pipelines and serves as a handbook guide for the practice of EEG preprocessing.

Source-Modeling Auditory Processes of EEG Data Using EEGLAB and Brainstorm	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; source localization; Brainstorm; EEGLAB; auditory N100; auditory processing	INTERICTAL EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; CROSS-MODAL REORGANIZATION; SOURCE LOCALIZATIONS; EVOKED POTENTIALS; MEG; ARTIFACTS; NEUROPHYSIOLOGY; CONTROVERSIES; ACCURACY; SUPERIOR	Electroencephalography (EEG) source localization approaches are often used to disentangle the spatial patterns mixed up in scalp EEG recordings. However, approaches differ substantially between experiments, may be strongly parameter-dependent, and results are not necessarily meaningful. In this paper we provide a pipeline for EEG source estimation, from raw EEG data pre-processing using EEGLAB functions up to source-level analysis as implemented in Brainstorm. The pipeline is tested using a data set of 10 individuals performing an auditory attention task. The analysis approach estimates sources of 64-channel EEG data without the prerequisite of individual anatomies or individually digitized sensor positions. First, we show advanced EEG pre-processing using EEGLAB, which includes artifact attenuation using independent component analysis (ICA). ICA is a linear decomposition technique that aims to reveal the underlying statistical sources of mixed signals and is further a powerful tool to attenuate stereotypical artifacts (e.g., eye movements or heartbeat). Data submitted to ICA are pre-processed to facilitate good-quality decompositions. Aiming toward an objective approach on component identification, the semi-automatic CORRMAP algorithm is applied for the identification of components representing prominent and stereotypic artifacts. Second, we present a step-wise approach to estimate active sources of auditory cortex event-related processing, on a single subject level. The presented approach assumes that no individual anatomy is available and therefore the default anatomy ICBM152, as implemented in Brainstorm, is used for all individuals. Individual noise modeling in this dataset is based on the pre-stimulus baseline period. For EEG source modeling we use the OpenMEEG algorithm as the underlying forward model based on the symmetric Boundary Element Method (BEM). We then apply the method of dynamical statistical parametric mapping (dSPM) to obtain physiologically plausible EEG source estimates. Finally, we show how to perform group level analysis in the time domain on anatomically defined regions of interest (auditory scout). The proposed pipeline needs to be tailored to the specific datasets and paradigms. However, the straightforward combination of EEGLAB and Brainstorm analysis tools may be of interest to others performing EEG source localization.

In the concept of this study, it is aimed to classify EEG topographies using deep learning. Among the cognitive test paradigms, Stroop test with four colors is used to collect EEG from two participants. P300 and N400 components are selected as two classes. P300 topography is computed using the average of EEG from 280 to 320 ms after the stimuli while 380 to 420 time window is used for N400 topographies. After the EEG artefact rejection processes, 440 topograph images were used to train the deep network. Randomly selected 10 images that were excluded from training set were used for testing. All of the test images were correctly classified while 73% of the training set images were correctly classified.

Masking deficits have been proposed as potential endophenotypes of schizophrenia. Masking performance deficits manifest as strongly reduced amplitudes in the electroencephalogram (EEG). In order to fulfill the criteria of an endophenotype, masking deficits should not vary substantially across time and should be present at the first psychotic event. To verify whether these conditions are met for visual backward masking, we tested patients with first episode psychosis (n = 21) in a longitudinal study. Patients were tested with visual backward masking and EEG three times every six months over a period of one year. We found that the EEG amplitudes of patients with first episode psychosis were higher as compared to those of patients with schizophrenia but lower as compared to those of unaffected controls. More interestingly, we found that the EEG amplitudes of patients with first episode psychosis remained stable over the course of one year. Since chronic schizophrenia patients have strongly reduced amplitudes, we speculate that the neural correlates of masking deficits (EEG amplitudes) continue to decrease as the disease progresses.

Research on alpha unrelated to creativity has revealed different functional roles of the upper (semantic processes) and lower (attentional processes) alpha sub-bands. At the same time, the need to dissect creative thinking into specific cognitive operations, such as, semantic processing, re-representation, or conceptual expansion has become evident. The main aim of the reported study was to test whether increased semantic processing demands linked to creating conceptual re-representations of objects required for evaluating alternate uses modulate activity in the upper and/or lower alpha sub-bands. For this purpose, we performed an alternate use evaluation task (AUeT), in which participants saw word pairs representing common uses, alternate uses, and unrelated word pairs, and evaluated whether a given use was common or uncommon (question 1), and how usable it was (question 2). Such an approach allowed us to examine the time-course of semantic processing involved in evaluating alternate uses. Additionally, the results could be contrasted with event-related potential (ERP) studies on creative language and semantic processing. We assumed that demands related to access and integration of semantic information needed to create a re-representation of objects (alternate uses) would be larger than in the case of common uses, which do not require creating a re-representation. This should be reflected in more activity in the alpha band in response to alternate than common uses, which was observed in the analysis of the upper alpha band over parieto-occipital sites. In the lower alpha band, more activity over the left than right anterior sites was observed for alternate uses, which might reflect increased attentional demands. Additionally, in the ERP analysis, alternate uses evoked larger N400 (400-500 ms) amplitudes than common uses, a pattern that extended to later time windows (500-1,000 ms). Overall, the results indicate increased semantic processing demands in alternate use evaluation, possibly linked to the creation of conceptual re-representations.

Reduced delta-band modulation underlies the loss of P300 responses in disorders of consciousness	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Vegetative state; Minimally conscious state; Electroencephalography; Delta waves; Theta waves; P300	DETECTING AWARENESS; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; VEGETATIVE STATE; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; THETA; RECOVERY; MEMORY; ALPHA; CORRELATE	Objective: The P300 component of a sensory event-related potential is one of the major electrophysiological markers used to explore remnants of cognitive function in patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC). However, measuring the P300 in patients is complicated by significant inter-trial variability commonly observed in levels of arousal and awareness. To overcome this limitation, we analyzed single-trial modulation of power in the delta and theta frequency bands, which underlie the P300. Methods: In a preliminary cross-sectional study using a 24-channel EEG and a passive own-name oddball paradigm, we analyzed event-related synchronization (ERS) across trials in the delta and theta bands in a sample of 10 control and 12 DoC subjects. Results: In comparison to controls, DoC subjects presented a low percentage of trials where delta ERS was observed. In particular, coordinated modulation between delta and theta in response to the stimulus was absent, with a high percentage of trials where only theta ERS was observed. Further, we found a positive correlation between the percentage of epochs with delta ERS and the strength of the P300. Conclusions: Reduced modulation of spectral activity in the delta band in response to stimuli indicates a dissociation in the activity of the neural networks that oscillate in delta and theta ranges and contribute to the generation of the P300. Significance: The reduction in spectral modulation observed in DoC provides a deeper understanding of neurophysiological dysfunction and the means to develop a more fine-grained marker of residual cognitive function in individual patients.

For patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who are suffering from severe communication or motor problems, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can improve the quality of life and patient autonomy. However, current BCI systems are not as widely used as their potential and patient demand would let assume. This underutilization is a result of technological as well as user-based limitations but also of the comparatively poor performance of currently existing BCIs in patients with late-stage ALS, particularly in the locked-in state. Approach. Here we review a broad range of electrophysiological studies in ALS patients with the aim to identify electrophysiological correlates of ALS-related neurodegeneration in motor and non-motor brain regions in to better understand potential neurophysiological limitations of current BCI systems for ALS patients. To this end we analyze studies in ALS patients that investigated basic sensory evoked potentials, resting-state and task-based paradigms using electroencephalography or electrocorticography for basic research purposes as well as for brain-computer interfacing. Main results and significance. Our review underscores that, similarly to mounting evidence from neuroimaging and neuropathology, electrophysiological measures too indicate neurodegeneration in non-motor areas in ALS. Furthermore, we identify an unexpected gap of basic and advanced electrophysiological studies in late-stage ALS patients, particularly in the locked-in state. We propose a research strategy on how to fill this gap in order to improve the design and performance of future BCI systems for this patient group.

This technology will ultimately be used in real-world environments which include the presence of distractors. The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of visual distractors on BCI performance. Methods: Sixteen able-bodied participants underwent neurofeedback training to achieve motor imagery-guided BCI control in an online paradigm using electroencephalography (EEG) to measure neural signals. Participants then completed two sessions of the motor imagery EEG-BCI protocol in the presence of infrequent, small visual distractors. BCI performance was determined based on classification accuracy. Results: The presence of distractors was found to affect motor imagery-specific patterns in mu and beta power. However, the distractors did not significantly affect the BCI classification accuracy; across participants, the mean classification accuracy was 81.5 +/- 14% for non-distractor trials, and 78.3 +/- 17% for distractor trials. Conclusion: This minimal consequence suggests that the BCI was robust to distractor effects, despite motor imagery-related brain activity being attenuated amid distractors. Significance: A BCI system that mitigates distraction-related effects may improve the ease of its use and ultimately facilitate the effective translation of the technology from the lab to the home.

Methods: Participants included N = 25 individuals with Parkinson's disease and an equal number of well-matched controls. EEG was recorded during a three-stimulus auditory oddball paradigm both ON and OFF medication. Results: While control participants showed reliable EEG habituation to novel events over time, individuals with Parkinson's did not. In the OFF condition, individual differences in habituation correlated with years since diagnosis. Pattern classifiers achieved high sensitivity and specificity in discriminating patients from controls, with a maximum accuracy of 82%. Most importantly, the confidence of the classifier was related to years since diagnosis, and this correlation increased as the time course of differential habituation increasingly distinguished the groups. Conclusions: These findings identify systemic alteration in an obligatory neural mechanism that may contribute to higher-level cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.

Parsing a mental program: Fixation-related brain signatures of unitary operations and routines in natural visual search	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Visual search; EEG; Eye movements; Attention; Natural scenes; Oscillations	SACCADE TARGET SELECTION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EYE-MOVEMENTS; WORKING-MEMORY; OBJECT RECOGNITION; PARIETAL CORTEX; SINGLE-TRIAL; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ATTENTIONAL BLINK; EVOKED-POTENTIALS	Visual search involves a sequence or routine of unitary operations (i.e. fixations) embedded in a larger mental global program. The process can indeed be seen as a program based on a while loop (while the target is not found), a conditional construct (whether the target is matched or not based on specific recognition algorithms) and a decision making step to determine the position of the next searched location based on existent evidence. Recent developments in our ability to co-register brain scalp potentials (EEG) during free eye movements has allowed investigating brain responses related to fixations (fixation-Related Potentials; fERPs), including the identification of sensory and cognitive local EEG components linked to individual fixations. However, the way in which the mental program guiding the search unfolds has not yet been investigated. We performed an EEG and eye tracking co-registration experiment in which participants searched for a target face in natural images of crowds. Here we show how unitary steps of the program are encoded by specific local target detection signatures and how the positioning of each unitary operation within the global search program can be pinpointed by changes in the EEG signal amplitude as well as the signal power in different frequency bands. By simultaneously studying brain signatures of unitary operations and those occurring during the sequence of fixations, our study sheds light into how local and global properties are combined in implementing visual routines in natural tasks.

Whereas neuromodulation of sensory or attentional processing is often investigated, neuromodulation of interactive effects between perception and attention, that is, high attentional control demand when the relevant sensory information is perceptually less salient than the irrelevant one, is not well understood. To fill this gap, this pharmacological-electroencephalogram (EEG) study applied an intensity-modulated, focused-attention dichotic listening paradigm together with temporal EEG signal decomposition and source localization analyses. We used a double-blind MPH/placebo crossover design to delineate the effects of methylphenidate (MPH)-a dopamine/norepinephrine transporter blocker-on the resolution of perceptual-attentional conflicts, when perceptual saliency and attentional focus favor opposing ears, in healthy young adults. We show that MPH increased behavioral performance specifically in the condition with the most pronounced conflict between perceptual saliency and attentional focus. On the neurophysiological level, MPH effects in line with the behavioral data were observed after accounting for intraindividual variability in the signal. More specifically, MPH did not show an effect on stimulus-related processes but modulated the onset latency of processes between stimulus evaluation and responding. These modulations were further shown to be associated with activation differences in the temporoparietal junction (BA40) and the superior parietal cortex (BA7) and may reflect neuronal gain modulation principles. The findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of modulated dopamine/norepinephrine transmitter systems for the interactions between perception and attention.

However, experimental results are variable and often difficult to reconcile. Some of these inconsistencies arise from the use of hypothesis-driven analysis approaches that (1) do not assess the consistency of the observed responses within and across individuals, and (2) do not fully exploit information sampled across the entire cortex. Here, we address these issues by recording the electrocorticogram directly from the brain surface of 12 freely moving rats. Using a hypothesis-free approach, we isolated brain oscillations induced by graded nociceptive stimuli and characterized their relation to pain-related behavior. We isolated 4 responses, one phase-locked event-related potential, 2 non-phase-locked event-related synchronizations, and one non-phase-locked event-related desynchronization (ERD), in different frequency bands (delta/theta-ERD, theta/alpha-event-related synchronization, and gamma-band event-related synchronization). All responses except the delta/theta-ERD correlated with pain-related behavior at within-subject level. Notably, the gamma-band event-related synchronization was the only response that reliably correlated with pain-related behavior between subjects. These results comprehensively characterize the physiological properties of the brain oscillations elicited by nociceptive stimuli in freely moving rodents and provide a foundational work to improve the translation of experimental animal findings to human physiology and pathophysiology.

However, the impact of self-esteem on this self-preference has not been studied in a systematic way. Here, the electrophysiological correlates of explicit self-reflection were investigated in individuals with low (LSE) and high self-esteem (HSE). Participants evaluated trait adjectives in reference to the self or to an "other" person (close-other, famous) while EEG was recorded. The analysis of event-related potentials focused on the late positive component (LPC), which exhibits a fronto-central distribution and latency over 500 ms. In both LSE and HSE groups, the amplitudes of LPC were enhanced in the self condition when compared to control conditions (both close-other and famous). Crucially, LPC amplitudes in the HSE group were significantly higher than in the LSE group. Moreover, the self-preference effect, defined as the difference between amplitudes of LPC associated with the evaluation of words in relation to oneself vs. other people, was significantly higher in the HSE group than in the LSE group. Overall, our findings indicate that people with high self-esteem tend to engage in self-referential processing to a higher extent.

In this paper, our first goal is to develop a novel method to track the EEG activation in different brain regions involved in the processing of target and non-target stimuli in oddball paradigm. Secondly we want to identify the difference in the pattern of activation for different oddball tasks. The EEG data has been acquired from twenty healthy volunteers for the visual oddball experiment. In the task two types of visual stimuli target (rare) and non-target (frequent) were randomly presented. The subjects were instructed to press the enter button when they identify the target stimuli. The EEG data acquired is converted into EEG topo-maps. In our method the flow of activation between consecutive topo-maps is estimated by using Horn and Schunck Optical Flow estimation method. It helps to generate the motion field between consecutive topo-maps which is considered as flow of activation between two time frames. Different motion vectors are clustered into a group based on the activation level. These clusters are tracked between different frames as a measure of the activation flow. Finally we analyze the flow of activation across different brain lobes for different cases encountered in the Oddball paradigm by plotting average activation graph with respect to time. Analysis of the data has revealed that high activation has been observed in the Frontal and Occipital lobes in general for the oddball task. Frontal lobe shows high activation for target with response case, this is followed by the Occipital lobe. The activation in frontal lobe starts increasing from frame no 60 (240 ms) (out of 125 frames). Occipital lobe shows high activation for target with no response and no target no response cases in the region from 40 to 60 frames. Parietal lobe shows high activation for target with response near the end of task from frame no. 100 onwards. Hence, we have been able to identify different patterns in the activation flow that differentiates different Oddball tasks. This activation pattern is consistent with the event related potential signal generated by the Oddball paradigm. The pattern for the individual subjects also follow the average pattern of high activation in the frontal and occipital region for target and non target stimuli. We have also used cross correlation (a classical connectivity method) for comparison of the results. A subjective comparison of the results show that our proposed method is capable of tracking the EEG activation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

As such, the MMN provides a useful index of pre-attentive cognition. While decreases in MMN amplitude are robustly observed in chronic schizophrenia, these deficits are less consistently present at the early phase of the illness. The current study utilizes a two-tone pattern paradigm that requires more complex computations than typical oddball stimulus presentations, which may be more appropriate for elucidating MMN deficits in an early phase psychosis (EP) sample. The stimuli were a standard sequence consisting of two alternating tones with different tonal frequencies (eg. ABABAB.), with MMN-eliciting pattern violations created by repetitions of either the A or the B tone. EEG recordings of 15 EP participants and 12 healthy controls (HCs) were collected. While no between-group differences were observed, MMN amplitudes in the EP group were correlated with positive and negative psychosis symptom scores. Follow-up analysis stratifying EP participants according to illness duration showed a reduced MMN amplitude in EP participants with a longer (2+ years) duration of illness, but not in EP participants who were within the first year of illness. These findings suggest a two-tone pattern paradigm may be useful in characterizing MMN-indexed cortical impairment later in the early phase of the illness, but not at first episode.	[Ells, Emma M.

The integration between nonsymbolic and symbolic numbers: Evidence from an EEG study	BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						event-related potentials; integration; nonsymbolic numbers; symbolic numbers	NEURAL MECHANISMS; REPRESENTATIONS; DISCRIMINATION; MAGNITUDE; NUMEROSITY; POTENTIALS; JUDGMENTS; COMPONENT; QUANTITY; CHILDREN	Introduction: Adults can represent numerical information in nonsymbolic and symbolic formats and flexibly switch between the two. While some studies suggest a strong link between the two number representation systems (e.g., Piazza, Izard, Pinel, Le Bihan, & Dehaene, 2004 Neuron, 44(3), 547), other studies show evidence against the strong-link hypothesis (e.g., Lyons, Ansari, & Beilock, 2012 Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 141(4), 635). This inconsistency could arise from the relation between task demands and the closeness of the link between the two number systems. Methods: We used a passive viewing task and event-related potentials (ERP) to examine the temporal dynamics of the implicit integration between the nonsymbolic and symbolic systems. We focused on two ERP components over posterior scalp sites that were found to be sensitive to numerical distances and ratio differences in both numerical formats: a negative component that peaks around 170 ms poststimulus (N1) and a positive component that peaks around 200 ms poststimulus (P2p). We examined adults' (n = 55) ERPs when they were passively viewing simultaneously presented dot quantities and Arabic numerals (i.e., nonsymbolic and symbolic numerical information) in the double-digit range. For each stimulus, the nonsymbolic and symbolic content either matched or mismatched in number. We also asked each participant to estimate dot quantities in a separate behavioral task and observed that they tended to underestimate the actual dot quantities, suggesting a need to adjust the match between nonsymbolic and symbolic information to reflect the perceived quantity of the nonsymbolic information. Results: Using this adjustment, participants showed greater N1 and P2p amplitudes when perceived dot quantities matched Arabic numerals than when there was a mismatch. However, no differences were found between the unadjusted match and mismatch conditions. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that adults rapidly integrate nonsymbolic and symbolic formats of double-digit numbers, but evidence of such integration is best observed when the perceived (rather than veridical) dot quantity is considered.

How the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Controls Affective Processing in Absence of Visual Awareness - Insights From a Combined EEG-rTMS Study	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; rTMS; emotion perception; awareness; ERP; dlPFC	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; THETA-BURST STIMULATION; FACIAL EXPRESSION RECOGNITION; TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY; EMOTION REGULATION; FEARFUL FACES; TOP-DOWN; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; SUBLIMINAL PRESENTATION	The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) plays a key role in the modulation of affective processing. However, its specific role in the regulation of neurocognitive processes underlying the interplay of affective perception and visual awareness has remained largely unclear. Using a mixed factorial design, this study investigated effects of inhibitory continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) of the right DLPFC (rDLPFC) compared to an Active Control condition on behavioral (N = 48) and electroencephalographic (N = 38) correlates of affective processing in healthy Chinese participants. Event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to passively viewed subliminal and supraliminal negative and neutral natural scenes were recorded before and after cTBS application. We applied minimum-norm approaches to estimate the corresponding neuronal sources. On a behavioral level, we found evidence for reduced emotional interference by, and less negative and aroused ratings of negative supraliminal stimuli following rDLPFC inhibition. We found no evidence for stimulation effects on self-reported mood or the behavioral discrimination of subliminal stimuli. On a neurophysiological level, rDLPFC inhibition relatively enhanced occipito-parietal brain activity for both subliminal and supraliminal negative compared to neutral images (112-268 ms; 320-380 ms). The early onset and localization of these effects suggests that rDLPFC inhibition boosts automatic processes of "emotional attention" independently of visual awareness. Further, our study reveals the first available evidence for a differential influence of rDLPFC inhibition on subliminal versus supraliminal neural emotion processing. Explicitly, our findings indicate that rDLPFC inhibition selectively enhances late (292-360 ms) activity in response to supraliminal negative images. We tentatively suggest that this differential frontal activity likely reflects enhanced awareness-dependent down-regulation of negative scene processing, eventually leading to facilitated disengagement from and less negative and aroused evaluations of negative supraliminal stimuli.

EEGNet: a compact convolutional neural network for EEG-based brain-computer interfaces	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; convolutional neural network; brain-computer interface; deep learning; event-related potential; sensory motor rhythm	CORTICAL POTENTIALS; MOTOR IMAGERY; CLASSIFICATION; MOVEMENT; DESYNCHRONIZATION; DYNAMICS; ALGORITHMS; EXTRACTION; SELECTION; SYSTEM	Objective. Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) enable direct communication with a computer, using neural activity as the control signal. This neural signal is generally chosen from a variety of well-studied electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. For a given BCI paradigm, feature extractors and classifiers are tailored to the distinct characteristics of its expected EEG control signal, limiting its application to that specific signal. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have been used in computer vision and speech recognition to perform automatic feature extraction and classification, have successfully been applied to EEG-based BCIs; however, they have mainly been applied to single BCI paradigms and thus it remains unclear how these architectures generalize to other paradigms. Here, we ask if we can design a single CNN architecture to accurately classify EEG signals from different BCI paradigms, while simultaneously being as compact as possible. Approach. In this work we introduce EEGNet, a compact convolutional neural network for EEG-based BCIs. We introduce the use of depthwise and separable convolutions to construct an EEG-specific model which encapsulates well-known EEG feature extraction concepts for BCI. We compare EEGNet, both for within-subject and cross-subject classification, to current state-of-the-art approaches across four BCI paradigms: P300 visual-evoked potentials, error-related negativity responses (ERN), movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP), and sensory motor rhythms (SMR). Main results. We show that EEGNet generalizes across paradigms better than, and achieves comparably high performance to, the reference algorithms when only limited training data is available across all tested paradigms. In addition, we demonstrate three different approaches to visualize the contents of a trained EEGNet model to enable interpretation of the learned features. Significance. Our results suggest that EEGNet is robust enough to learn a wide variety of interpretable features over a range of BCI tasks. Our models can be found at: https://github.com/vlawhern/arl-eegmodels.

J	Chmielewski, WX; Muckschel, M; Beste, C				Chmielewski, Witold X.; Mueckschel, Moritz; Beste, Christian			Response selection codes in neurophysiological data predict conjoint effects of controlled and automatic processes during response inhibition	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						EEG; response inhibition; source localization	ITERATION DECOMPOSITION RIDE; SENSORIMOTOR INTEGRATION PROCESSES; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; PARIETAL CORTEX; ERP COMPONENTS; NEURAL BASIS; CONFLICT; STIMULUS	The inhibition of prepotent responses is a requirement for goal-directed behavior and several factors determine corresponding successful response inhibition processes. One factor relates to the degree of automaticity of pre-potent response tendencies and another factor relates to the degree of cognitive control that is exerted during response inhibition. However, both factors can conjointly modulate inhibitory control. Cognitive theoretical concepts suggest that codings of stimulus-response translations may underlie such conjoint effects. Yet, it is unclear in how far such specific codes, as assumed in cognitive psychological concepts, are evident in neurophysiological processes and whether there are specific functional neuroanatomical structures associated with the processing of such codes. Applying a temporal decomposition method of EEG data in combination with source localization methods we show that there are different, intermingled codes (i.e., "stimulus codes" and "response selection codes") at the neurophysiological level during conjoint effects of "automatic" and "controlled" processes in response inhibition. Importantly, only "response selection codes" predict behavioral performance, and are subject to conjoint modulations by "automatic" and "controlled" processes. These modulations are associated with inferior and superior parietal areas (BA40/BA7), possibly reflecting an updating of internal representations when information is complex and probably difficult to categorize, but essential for behavioral control. Codes proposed by cognitive, psychological concepts seem to have a neurophysiological analogue that fits into current views on functions of inferior and superior parietal regions.

The argument is based upon experimental evidence gathered from five separate studies. First, we focus on spatial representations and demonstrate that, given time pressure, information on the spatial orientation of houses, independent of a participant's own location, is best retrieved when it directly relates to potential actions. Thus providing evidence that even spatial representations code information in a manner directly related to the action. Next, we discuss the concept of representations as such. Using the example of face processing in the human visual system, we argue that the concept of representations should be confined to cases where neuronal activity contains explicit information on the variable of interest and, in turn, that this variable explains the complete part of the explainable variance, i.e. reaches the noise limit. Next, to push towards an investigation of cognition under natural conditions we present a benchmark test of mobile and research-grade EEG systems. Specifically, we demonstrate that the variance over systems contributes a significant part to the total variance of recorded event related potentials. As a next step, using Independent Component Analysis of EEG data we demonstrate that in cognitive tasks some independent components systematically relate to sensory processing as well as to action execution. This supports theories of the common coding theory and, thus, a mechanistic part of the embodied cognition framework. Finally, we demonstrate a real world application investigating face processing in the form of the N170 event related potential during natural visual exploration in a fully mobile setup. This technique allows investigating the physiological basis of cognitive processes under real world conditions. In this presentation we argue that understanding cognitive processes will need to consider the (inter) actions in the natural environment.

The present study aimed to investigate the initial value attribution process, specifically the spatiotemporal activation patterns associated with values and valuation context, using electroencephalographic event-related potentials ERPs). Participants completed a stimulus rating task in which everyday household items marketed up to a price of 4 pound were evaluated with respect to their desirability or material properties. The subjective values of items were evaluated as willingness to pay (WTP) in a Becker-DeGroot-Marschak auction. On the basis of the individual subjective WTP values, the stimuli were divided into high- and low-value items. Source dipole modeling was applied to estimate the cortical sources underlying ERP components modulated by subjective values (high vs. low WTP) and the evaluation condition (value-relevant vs. value-irrelevant judgments). Low-WTP items and value- relevant judgments both led to a more pronounced N2 visual evoked potential at right frontal scalp electrodes. Source activity in right anterior insula and left orbitofrontal cortex was larger for low vs. high WTP at similar to 200 ms. At a similar latency, source activity in right anterior insula and right parahippocampal gyrus was larger for value-relevant vs. value-irrelevant judgments. A stronger response for low- than high-value items in anterior insula and orbitofrontal cortex appears to reflect aversion to low-valued item acquisition, which in an auction experiment would be perceived as a relative loss. This initial low-value bias occurs automatically irrespective of the valuation context. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We demonstrate the spatiotemporal characteristics of the brain valuation process using event-related potentials and willingness to pay as a measure of subjective value. The N2 component resolves values of objects with a bias toward low-value items. The value-related changes of the N2component are part of an automatic valuation process.

A Prospective Study of the Impact of Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation on EEG Correlates of Somatosensory Perception	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						transcranial alternating current stimulation; somatosensory perception; tactile detection; alpha; neuromodulation	EVOKED-RESPONSES; MU RHYTHM; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; AWAKE MONKEYS; BETA RHYTHMS; ALPHA; MODULATION; CORTEX; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; ENTRAINMENT	The (8-12 Hz) neocortical alpha rhythm is associated with shifts in attention across sensory systems, and is thought to represent a sensory gating mechanism for the inhibitory control of cortical processing. The present preliminary study sought to explore whether alpha frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) could modulate endogenous alpha power in the somatosensory system, and whether the hypothesized modulation would causally impact perception of tactile stimuli at perceptual threshold. We combined electroencephalography (EEG) with simultaneous brief and intermittent tACS applied over primary somatosensory cortex at individuals' endogenous alpha frequency during a tactile detection task (n = 12 for EEG, n = 20 for behavior). EEG-measured pre-stimulus alpha power was higher on non-perceived than perceived trials, and analogous perceptual correlates emerged in early components of the tactile evoked response. Further, baseline normalized tactile detection performance was significantly lower during alpha than sham tACS, but the effect did not last into the post-tACS time period. Pre- to post-tACS changes in alpha power were linearly dependent upon baseline state, such that alpha power tended to increase when pre-tACS alpha power was low, and decrease when it was high. However, these observations were comparable in both groups, and not associated with evidence of tACS-induced alpha power modulation. Nevertheless, the tactile stimulus evoked response potential (ERP) revealed a potentially lasting impact of alpha tACS on circuit dynamics. The post-tACS ERP was marked by the emergence of a prominent peak similar to 70 ms post-stimulus, which was not discernible post-sham, or in either pre-stimulation condition. Computational neural modeling designed to simulate macroscale EEG signals supported the hypothesis that the emergence of this peak could reflect synaptic plasticity mechanisms induced by tACS. The primary lesson learned in this study, which commanded a small sample size, was that while our experimental paradigm provided some evidence of an influence of tACS on behavior and circuit dynamics, it was not sufficient to induce observable causal effects of tACS on EEG-measured alpha oscillations. We discuss limitations and suggest improvements that may help further delineate a causal influence of tACS on cortical dynamics and perception in future studies.

This study utilized the EEG recordings of four disabled subjects during repeated stimuli using a six-choice P300 paradigm. The EEG signals were processed with a Butterworth bandpass filter and Wavelet Transform, divided into two categories of the target and non-target trials. The EEG data were improved by removing the high amplitude fluctuation of the signals around the end of each file. The Wavelet Transform was implemented using Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). The target and non target trials were averaged for every five trials, and the averaged non-target trials were reduced further by selecting one of every five consecutive data. The reduced target and non-target trial data were classified using multilayer perceptron and support vector machine. Using SWT, multilayer perceptron gave the maximum accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 96.4%, 96.6%, 96.2% respectively, and support vector machine obtained the maximum accuracy of 98.2%, sensitivity of 100%, and specificity of 96.4% While using DWT, the best performance of multilayer perceptron gave the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 94.5%, 100%, 89.3% respectively, and support vector machine had the maximum accuracy of 98.2%, sensitivity of 96.4%, and specificity of 100%.

Prenatal neural responses to infant faces predict postpartum reflective functioning	INFANT BEHAVIOR & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Pregnancy; EEG/ERP; Reflective functioning; Parenting; Mentalization	LATE PREGNANCY; MENTAL STATES; ANXIETY; BRAIN; ATTACHMENT; TOLERANCE; DISTRESS; PARENT; LINK	Pregnancy is shaped by unfolding psychological and biological changes in preparation for parenthood. A growing literature has examined the postpartum maternal brain. However, few studies examine the maternal brain during pregnancy, and whether brain function in pregnancy may have implications for postpartum caregiving. Using event-related potentials, we examined the late positive potential (LPP) elicited by infant distress and neutral faces in 35 women during their third trimester of pregnancy. Then, at 3 months postpartum, mothers completed a measure of parental reflective functioning to capture how they regarded their capacity to consider their child's thoughts and feelings. We found that in the third trimester, infant distress faces elicited larger LPPs compared to infant neutral faces. Moreover, the LPP elicited by infant neutral faces predicted levels of postpartum reflective functioning. Specifically, a larger LPP elicited by neutral infant faces predicted greater maternal self-reported difficulty recognizing and understanding their own infant's thoughts and feelings. Our findings suggest that studying the pregnant brain may have predictive value for facets of postpartum caregiving and may inform clinical interventions with new mothers.	[Rutherford, Helena J.

The classification of brain patterns for each different subject requires an extensively time-consuming learning stage specific to that person, in order to reach satisfactory accuracy performance. The training session could also be infeasible for disabled patients as they may not fully understand the training instructions. In this paper, we propose a unified classification scheme based on ensemble classifier, dynamic stopping, and adaptive learning. We apply this scheme on the P300-based BCI, with the subject-independent manner, where no learning session is required for new experimental users. According to our theoretical analysis and empirical results, the harmonized integration of these three methods can significantly boost up the average accuracy from 75.00% to 91.26%, while at the same time reduce the average spelling time from 12.62 to 6.78 iterations, approximately to two-fold faster. The experiments were conducted on a large public dataset which had been used in other related studies. Direct comparisons between our work with the others' are also reported in details.

The present study focused on the question whether visual awareness, the subjective experience of seeing, depends on resources of WM. Three dual-task experiments were run. The participants were asked to report their awareness of a low-contrast target stimulus while their WM was loaded by a requirement to concurrently maintain verbal information (Experiment 1) or visuo-spatial information (Experiment 2) in WM, or by a concurrent executive task (Experiment 3). Behavioral responses and event-related brain potential (ERP) correlates of visual awareness in response to the targets were examined. Experiments 1 and 2 revealed that maintenance of information in WM did not have any effect on reported visual awareness and its electro-physiological correlates. Experiment 3 found that executive load decreased reported visual awareness, which was reflected in ERPs around 350-550 ms after stimulus onset as a reduction in the amplitudes of P3 to detected stimuli. The earlier, posterior correlate of visual awareness in N200 time window (180-280 ms) was not affected by load in any of the conditions. The results suggest that visual consciousness and WM share resources at a relatively late stage of conscious processing, which involves active manipulation of contents. The findings are in line with a recent view suggesting that a posterior "hot zone" is responsible for visual awareness, while frontal regions contribute to higher-level cognitive processes that occur after visual awareness has arisen.

Effect of word association on linguistic event-related potentials in moderately to mildly constraining sentences	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							2 CEREBRAL HEMISPHERES; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; LEXICAL ASSOCIATION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; FIELD POTENTIALS; LEVEL CONTEXT; N400; FREQUENCY; DECISION; NETWORK	The processing of word associations in sentence context depends on several factors. EEG studies have shown that when the expectation of the upcoming word is high (high semantic constraint), the within-sentence word association plays a negligible role, whereas in the opposite case, when there is no expectation (as in pseudo-sentences), the role of word association becomes more pronounced. However, what happens when the expectations are not high (mild to moderate semantic constraint) is not yet clear. By adopting a cross-factorial design, crossing sentence congruity with within-sentence word association, our EEG recordings show that association comes into play during semantic processing of the word only when the sentence is meaningless. We also performed an exploratory source localization analysis of our EEG recordings to chart the brain regions putatively implicated in processing the said factors and showed its complementarity to EEG temporal analysis. This study furthers our knowledge on sentence processing and the brain networks involved in it.

A combination of behavioural experiment and neuroscience experiment (event-related potentials) was conducted to understand the cognitive psychological processes and related neural mechanisms of management personnel before and aftertax avoidance. By using the data of Chinese A-share listed companies in 2008-2015, this paper studied the effect of corporate tax avoidance behaviour on firm value and analysed its mechanism of action. Based on the analysis of behavioural data and EEG data, it concludes that the corporate tax avoidance behaviour can increase the firm value, and the well-governed firms can also increase the firm value by reducing the entrusted agency fees generated by tax avoidance. Therefore, it enriches the research on Chinese tax avoidance agency issue, being of a certain guiding significance for the firms and taxation departments.

Among them, brain - computer interface (BCI)-based electrical stimulation (ES) and MI synchronously induced electroencephalo-graph (EEG) analysis is one of the research directions. This paper integrates MI with ES, and introduces the steady-state somatosensory evoked potential (SSSEP) on the MI, and then fuses features. The purpose is to achieve better accuracy, reducing training time, and enhancing target body imagine attention. We use ES and MI synchronous-evoked EEG analysis for rehabilitation training strategy in the process of synchronization. Based on the time - frequency diagram and brain topographic map, we make analysis on event-related desynchronization (ERD), time -frequency characteristic of the steady-state evoked potentials (SSEP), energy characteristics, and distribution regularity of brain regions of each task model. We apply the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), common spatial pattern (CSP), and filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) to classify task pattern recognition on the basis of support vector machine. The results show that based on the lead less the FBCSP has certain superiority, the classification accuracy of ES versus ES& MI achieved 95% or more.

The same is true for sensory processes, and recent evidence shows that there also within-modality differences in the efficacy to trigger motor response inhibition. Yet, modulatory effects of within-modality differences during age-related changes in response inhibition between adolescence and adulthood are still indeterminate. We investigated this question in a system neurophysiological approach combining analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs) with temporal EEG signal decomposition and source localization processes. We used the somatosensory system to examine possible with-inmodality differences. The study shows that differences in response inhibition processes between adolescents and adults are modulated by sensory processes. Adolescents show deficient response inhibition when stimuli triggering these mechanisms are processed via SI somatosensory areas, compared to SII somatosensory areas. Opposed to this, no differences between adolescents and adults are evident, when response inhibition processes are triggered via SII cortical regions. The EEG data suggests that specific neurophysiological subprocesses are associated with this. Adolescents seem to encounter problems assigning processing resources to integrate motor with tactile information in posterior parietal areas when this information is processed via SI. Thus, basic perceptual and age-related processes interactively modulate response inhibition as an important instance of cognitive control.

Analyses showed that (a) healthy elderly presented greater beta power at rest than patients with aMCI patients; (b) during the task, healthy elderly were more accurate than aMCI patients and presented greater beta power than aMCI patients; (c) both groups showed qualitatively similar spectral perturbation responses during the task, but different spatiotemporal response patterns; and (d) aMCI patients presented greater beta phase locking than healthy elderly during the task. Results indicate that beta activity in healthy elderly differs from that of patients with aMCI. Furthermore, the analysis of task-related EEG activity extends evidences obtained during resting and suggests that during the prodromal phase of Alzheimer's disease there is a reduced efficiency in information exchange by large-scale neural networks. The study for the first time shows the potential of task-related beta responses as early markers of aMCI impairments.

Remnants and changes in facial emotion processing in women with remitted borderline personality disorder: an EEG study	EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF PSYCHIATRY AND CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Borderline personality disorder; Emotion; Remission; Event-related potentials; P100; Event-related potentials; N170; Event-related potentials; P300	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; P300 AMPLITUDE; 10-YEAR COURSE; RECOGNITION; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; METAANALYSIS; DYSREGULATION; PERCEPTION; SCALE	According to longitudinal studies, most individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) achieve remission. Since BPD is characterized by disturbed emotion recognition, this study investigated behavioral and electrophysiological correlates of facial emotion classification and processing in remitted BPD. 32 women with remitted BPD (rBPD), 32 women with current BPD (cBPD), and 28 healthy women (HC) participated in an emotion classification paradigm comprising blends of angry and happy faces while behavioral and electroencephalographic (event-related potentials) data were recorded. rBPD demonstrated a convergence in behavior towards HC in terms of responses and reaction times. They evaluated maximally ambiguous faces more positively and exhibited faster reaction times when classifying predominantly happy faces compared to cBPD. Group x facial emotion interaction effects were found in early electrophysiological processes with post hoc tests indicating differences between rBPD and cBPD but not between rBPD and HC. However, BPD-like impairments were still found in rBPD in later processing (P300). Our results suggest a reduction in negativity bias in rBPD on the behavioral level and a normalization of earlier stages of facial processing on the neural level, while alterations in later, more cognitive processing do not remit. Early processing may be more state-like, while later impairments may be more trait-like. Further research may need to focus on these stable components.

This may partly explain the observed sex differences in pain sensitivity, tolerance, and inhibitory control, and in the development of chronic pain. However, it is not known if these differences exist from birth. Cortical activity in response to a painful stimulus can be observed in the human neonatal brain, but this nociceptive activity continues to develop in the postnatal period and is qualitatively different from that of adults, partly due to the considerable cortical maturation during this time. This research aimed to investigate the effects of sex and prematurity on the magnitude and spatial distribution pattern of the long-latency nociceptive event-related potential (nERP) using electroencephalography (EEG). We measured the cortical response time-locked to a clinically required heel lance in 81 neonates born between 29 and 42 weeks gestational age (median postnatal age 4 days). The results show that heel lance results in a spatially widespread nERP response in the majority of newborns. Importantly, a widespread pattern is significantly more likely to occur in females, irrespective of gestational age at birth. This effect is not observed for the short latency somatosensory waveform in the same infants, indicating that it is selective for the nociceptive component of the response. These results suggest the early onset of a greater anatomical and functional connectivity reported in the adult female brain, and indicate the presence of pain-related sex differences from birth.

During the inter-ictsal period, however, migraineurs seem to function normally. It is puzzling, therefore, that event-related potentials of migraine patients often differ in the asymptomatic and inter-ictal period. Part of the electrophysiological dynamics demonstrated in the migraine cycle are attention related. In this pilot study we evaluated an easy-to-use new marker, the Brain Engagement Index (BEI), for attention monitoring during the migraine cycle. We sampled 12 migraine patients for 20 days within one calendar month. Each session consisted of subjects' reports of stress level and migraine-related symptoms, and a 5 min EEG recording, with a 2-electrode EEG device, during an auditory oddball task. The first minute of the EEG sample was analyzed. Repetitive samples were also obtained from 10 healthy controls. The brain engagement index increased significantly during the pre-ictal (p approximate to 0.001) and the ictal (p approximate to 0.020) periods compared with the inter-ictal period. No difference was observed between the pre-ictal and ictal periods. Control subjects demonstrated intermediate Brain Engagement Index values, that is, higher than inter-ictal, yet lower than pre-ictal. Our preliminary results demonstrate the potential advantage of the use of a simple EEG system for improved prediction of migraine attacks. Further study is required to evaluate the efficacy of the Brain Engagement Index in monitoring the migraine cycle and the possible effects of interventions.

The present study demonstrates how structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques can be used to refine descriptions of brain-behavior relationships in a sample of neurotypical children. We developed an exploratory latent variable model in which trait measures of maturation and attention are related to neural processing and task behaviors obtained during a cued Go/No-Go task. Model findings are compared to results of traditional analysis techniques such as bivariate correlations. The data suggest that more sophisticated statistical approaches are beneficial to accurately interpreting the nature of brain-behavior relationships.

Despite this, investigation into how reliable early visual ERPs and body-sensitive effects are over time has been overlooked. This study therefore aimed to assess the stability of early body-sensitive effects and visual P1, N1 and VPP responses. Participants were asked to identify pictures of their own bodies, other bodies and houses during an EEG test session that was completed at the same time, once a week, for four consecutive weeks. Results showed that amplitude and latency of early visual components and their associated body-sensitive effects were stable over the 4-week period. Furthermore, correlational analyses revealed that VPP component amplitude might be more reliable than VPP latency and specific electrode sites might be more robust indicators of body-sensitive cortical activity than others. These findings suggest that visual P1, N1 and VPP responses, alongside body-sensitive N1/VPP effects, are robust indications of neuronal activity. We conclude that these components are eligible to be considered as electrophysiological biomarkers relevant to body representation.

Alcohol Impairs N100 Response to Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Stimulation	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; INTERVAL CORTICAL INHIBITION; HIPPOCAMPAL PYRAMIDAL CELLS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; TMS-EEG; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; GABAERGIC AGONISTS; IN-VITRO; ETHANOL	Alcohol is thought to exert its effect by acting on gamma-aminobutyric (GABA) inhibitory neurotransmission. The N100, the negative peak on electroencephalography (EEG) that occurs approximately 100 ms following the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulse, is believed to represent GABAB receptor mediated neurotransmission. However, no studies have examined the effect of alcohol on the N100 response to TMS stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). In the present study, we aimed to explore the effect of alcohol on the DLPFC TMS-evoked N100 response. The study was a within-subject cross-over design study. Fifteen healthy alcohol drinkers were administered TMS to the DLPFC before (PreBev) and after consumption (PostBev) of an alcohol or placebo beverage. The amplitude of the N100 before and after beverage was compared for both the alcohol and placebo beverage. Alcohol produced a significant decrease in N100 amplitude (t = 4.316, df = 14, p = 0.001). The placebo beverage had no effect on the N100 amplitude (t = -1.856, df = 14, p = 0.085). Acute alcohol consumption produces a decrease in N100 amplitude to TMS stimulation of the DLPFC, suggesting a decrease in GABAB receptor mediated neurotransmission. Findings suggest that the N100 may represent a marker of alcohol's effects on inhibitory neurotransmission.

In particular, associations between childhood poverty and cognitive and neural aspects of CC have also been documented in recent years. Less evidence is available regarding the brain areas influence by cognitive intervention in children from poor homes. In the present study, we examined the impact of a computerized, cognitive training that was implemented at a kindergarten on inhibitory control performance by cognitive and EEG methods. Methods: Children were trained weekly for 8 weeks and tested before and after the intervention using EEG recordings during a Go/NoGo task performance. Children in the intervention group (n = 24; 18 girls, mean age 5.32 +/- 0.39 years) played games that tapped inhibitory control, working memory, and planning demands on a tablet, whereas those in the control group (n = 20; 7 girls, mean age 5.42 +/- 0.27 years) played Internet free games with the same schedule. Results: Electrophysiological measures related to performance of inhibitory control showed improvements only in the intervention group, and no differences were found in cognitive performance. Specifically, only the intervention group showed in increase in the frontal N2-effect; that is, there was larger differentiation between the amplitude of N2-NoGo and N2-Go in the post-test stage. Conclusions: These results show: (a) that the implemented intervention modulated the neural resources related to inhibitory control processes, and (b) it is possible to implement portable neural methodologies in school settings to enhance the evaluation of cognitive training interventions by adding an EEG component.

J	Siemann, J; Herrmann, M; Galashan, D				Siemann, Julia; Herrmann, Manfred; Galashan, Daniela			The effect of feature-based attention on flanker interference processing: An fMRI-constrained source analysis	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; NEURAL MECHANISMS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; VISUAL-ATTENTION; STRATEGIC CONTROL; PRIORITY SIGNALS; CONFLICT; TASK; COLOR; INTEGRATION	The present study examined whether feature-based cueing affects early or late stages of flanker conflict processing using EEG and fMRI. Feature cues either directed participants' attention to the upcoming colour of the target or were neutral. Validity-specific modulations during interference processing were investigated using the N200 event-related potential (ERP) component and BOLD signal differences. Additionally, both data sets were integrated using an fMRI-constrained source analysis. Finally, the results were compared with a previous study in which spatial instead of feature-based cueing was applied to an otherwise identical flanker task. Feature-based and spatial attention recruited a common fronto-parietal network during conflict processing. Irrespective of attention type (feature-based; spatial), this network responded to focussed attention (valid cueing) as well as context updating (invalid cueing), hinting at domain-general mechanisms. However, spatially and non-spatially directed attention also demonstrated domain-specific activation patterns for conflict processing that were observable in distinct EEG and fMRI data patterns as well as in the respective source analyses. Conflictspecific activity in visual brain regions was comparable between both attention types. We assume that the distinction between spatially and non-spatially directed attention types primarily applies to temporal differences (domain-specific dynamics) between signals originating in the same brain regions (domain-general localization).

J	Thomassen, S; Bendixen, A				Thomassen, Sabine; Bendixen, Alexandra			Assessing the background decomposition of a complex auditory scene with event-related brain potentials	HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article						Auditory scene analysis; Auditory stream segregation; Electroencephalography (EEG); Mismatch negativity (MMN); Perceptual organization; Attention	STREAM SEGREGATION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; PERCEPTUAL ORGANIZATION; NEURAL REPRESENTATIONS; SOUND SEQUENCES; TEMPORAL WINDOW; ATTENTION; INFORMATION; INTEGRATION; FREQUENCY	A listener who focusses on a sound source of interest must continuously integrate the sounds emitted by the attended source and ignore the sounds emitted by the remaining sources in the auditory scene. Little is known about how the ignored sound sources in the background are mentally represented after the source of interest has formed the perceptual foreground. This is due to a key methodological challenge: the background representation is by definition not overtly reportable. Here we developed a paradigm based on event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to assess the mental representation of background sounds. Participants listened to sequences of three repeatedly presented tones arranged in an ascending order (low, middle, high frequency). They were instructed to detect intensity deviants in one of the tones, creating the perceptual foreground. The remaining two background tones contained timing and location deviants. Those deviants were set up such that mismatch negativity (MMN) components would be elicited in distinct ways if the background was decomposed into two separate sound streams (background segregation) or if it was not further decomposed (background integration). Results provide MMN-based evidence for background segregation and integration in parallel. This suggests that mental representations of background integration and segregation can be concurrently available, and that collecting empirical evidence for only one of these background organization alternatives might lead to erroneous conclusions.

J	Sallard, E; Hartmann, L; Ptak, R; Spierer, L				Sallard, Etienne; Hartmann, Lea; Ptak, Radek; Spierer, Lucas			Spatiotemporal brain dynamics underlying attentional bias modifications	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						attentional bias modification; inhibitory control; ERP; source estimations	VISUAL SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DOT-PROBE TASK; SPATIAL ATTENTION; SINGLE-SESSION; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; INTRAPARIETAL SULCUS; MODIFICATION PROGRAM; INHIBITORY CONTROL; NEURAL MECHANISMS	Exaggerated attentional biases toward specific elements of the environment contribute to the maintenance of several psychiatric conditions, such as biases to threatening faces in social anxiety. Although recent literature indicates that attentional bias modification may constitute an effective approach for psychiatric remediation, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. We addressed this question by recording EEG in 24 healthy participants performing a modified dot-probe task in which pairs of neutral cues (colored shapes) were replaced by probe stimuli requiring a discrimination judgment. To induce an attentional bias toward or away from the cues, the probes were systematically presented either at the same or at the opposite position of a specific cue color. This paradigm enabled participants to spontaneously develop biases to initially unbiased, neutral cues, as measured by the response speed to the probe presented after the cues. Behavioral result indicated that the ABM procedure induced approach and avoidance biases. The influence of ABM on inhibitory control was assessed in a separated Go/NoGo task: changes in AB did not influence participants' capacity to inhibit their responses to the cues. Attentional bias modification was associated with a topographic modulation of event-related potentials already 50-84 ms following the onset of the cues. Statistical analyses of distributed electrical source estimations revealed that the development of attentional biases was associated with decreased activity in the left temporo-parieto-occipital junction. These findings suggest that attentional bias modification affects early sensory processing phases related to the extraction of information based on stimulus saliency.

Reduced dual-task gait speed is associated with visual Go/No-Go brain network activation in children and adolescents with concussion	BRAIN INJURY			English	Article						Locomotion; mild traumatic brain injury; electroencephalography; attention	BALANCE CONTROL; EXECUTIVE DYSFUNCTION; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; SINGLE-TASK; ATTENTION; INJURY; YOUNG; PERFORMANCE; STABILITY; RECOVERY	Objective: To investigate the association between dual-task gait performance and brain network activation (BNA) using an electroencephalography (EEG)-based Go/No-Go paradigm among children and adolescents with concussion. Methods: Participants with a concussion completed a visual Go/No-Go task with collection of electroencephalogram brain activity. Data were treated with BNA analysis, which involves an algorithmic approach to EEG-ERP activation quantification. Participants also completed a dual-task gait assessment. The relationship between dual-task gait speed and BNA was assessed using multiple linear regression models. Results: Participants (n=20, 13.9 +/- 2.3years of age, 50% female) were tested at a mean of 7.0 +/- 2.5days post-concussion and were symptomatic at the time of testing (post-concussion symptom scale=40.4 +/- 21.9). Slower dual-task average gait speed (mean=82.2 +/- 21.0cm/s) was significantly associated with lower relative time BNA scores (mean=39.6 +/- 25.8) during the No-Go task (=0.599, 95% CI=0.214, 0.985, p=0.005, R-2=0.405), while controlling for the effect of age and gender. Conclusion: Among children and adolescents with a concussion, slower dual-task gait speed was independently associated with lower BNA relative time scores during a visual Go/No-Go task. The relationship between abnormal gait behaviour and brain activation deficits may be reflective of disruption to multiple functional abilities after concussion.

Feeling but not seeing the hand: Occluded hand position reduces the hand proximity effect in ERPs	CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION			English	Article						Multisensory integration; Event related potentials; Electrophysiology; Vision; Proprioception; Hand proximity effect	SPATIAL ATTENTION; VISUAL SPACE; COMPONENT; VISION; BIAS; EEG	The hand proximity effect (nearby hands influence visual processing) reflects the integration of vision and proprioception for upcoming action; it is reduced when hand position is occluded. In an ERP study, we investigate whether hand proximity, without vision of the hand, accentuates the processing of stimuli requiring actions (targets) early (N1) and later (P3) in processing. In a go/no-go paradigm, participants viewed stimuli between two panels with hands placed near or far from stimuli. Occlusion of the hand eliminated near-hand target vs. non-target differentiation of the N1; amplification of near-hand target amplitudes emerged at the P3. Visual hand location appears necessary to draw visual attention to intended-action objects to integrate body and visual information early in processing. The integration of visual stimulus information and hand position from proprioception appears later in processing, indicating greater reliance on cognitive systems for discriminating the task-relevance of a stimulus.

GENeR	Mismatch negativity to predict subsequent awakening in deeply sedated critically ill patients	BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA			English	Article						coma; deep sedation; electroencephalography; event-related potentials; intensive care unit; neuroprognosis	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS; SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; CONFUSION ASSESSMENT METHOD; PROGNOSTIC VALUE; PROPOFOL SEDATION; OUTCOME PREDICTION; NEURAL RESPONSES; EEG CHANGES; DELIRIUM	Background: Mismatch negativity (MMN) is the neurophysiological correlate of cognitive integration of novel stimuli. Although MMN is a well-established predictor of awakening in non-sedated comatose patients, its prognostic value in deeply sedated critically ill patients remains unknown. The aim of this prospective, observational pilot study was to investigate the prognostic value of MMN for subsequent awakening in deeply sedated critically ill patients. Methods: MMN was recorded in 43 deeply sedated critically ill patients on Day 3 of ICU admission using a classical 'oddball' paradigm that delivers rare deviant sounds in a train of frequent standard sounds. Individual visual analyses and a group level analysis of recordings were performed. MMN amplitudes were then analysed according to the neurological status (awake vs not awake) at Day 28. Results: Median (inter-quartile range) Richmond Assessment Sedation Scale (RASS) at the time of recording was -5 (range, from -5 to -4.5). Visual detection of MMN revealed a poor inter-rater agreement [kappa=0.17, 95% confidence interval (0.07-0.26)]. On Day 28, 30 (70%) patients had regained consciousness while 13 (30%) had not. Quantitative group level analysis revealed a significantly greater MMN amplitude for patients who awakened compared with those who had not [mean (standard deviation) = -0.65 (1.4) vs 0.08 (0.17) mu V, respectively; P=0.003). Conclusions: MMN can be observed in deeply sedated critically ill patients and could help predict subsequent awakening. However, visual analysis alone is unreliable and should be systematically completed with individual level statistics.

J	Liu, P				Liu, Peng			Time-frequency analysis of event-related potentials associated with the origin of the motor interference effect from dangerous objects	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Motor interference effect; Dangerous objects; Danger evaluation; Go/NoGo task; Theta ERS; Alpha ERD	GO/NO-GO TASK; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; BAND OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; ERP COMPONENT; EEG ALPHA; THETA; DYNAMICS	Previous research has suggested that the motor interference effect of dangerous objects may originate from danger evaluations rather than direct response inhibition, as evidenced by a larger parietal P3 amplitude (which represents danger evaluations) under dangerous conditions than under safe conditions and an insignificant difference between dangerous and safe conditions in the frontal P3 component (which represents response inhibition). However, an alternative explanation exists for the null effect of the frontal P3 component. Specifically, this null effect may be attributed to cancellation between the theta and delta band oscillations, and only theta band oscillations represent response inhibition. To clarify this issue, the current study decomposed event-related potential data into different frequency bands using short-time Fourier transform. The results identified an insignificant difference of theta oscillations between dangerous and safe conditions in the mid-frontal area during a 200-500-ms time window. Instead, decreased alpha oscillations were identified in the dangerous compared with the safe condition in Go trials in the right parietal area during a 100-660-ms time window. Regression analyses further indicated that the alpha oscillations significantly contributed to the parietal P3 amplitude in the right parietal area. In summary, the results indicated that when an emergent dangerous object is encountered during the execution of prepared motor actions, an individual may tend to chiefly evaluate the potential dangerousness rather than directly suppress the prepared motor actions toward the dangerous object.

However, sometimes, cognitive flexibility can be needed to reuse recently abandoned mental sets. Therefore, cognitive flexibility can in certain cases be useful to reinstate some form of rigid, repetitive behavior characterizing OCD. We test the counterintuitive hypothesis that under such circumstances, cognitive flexibility is better in OCD patients than controls. MethodsWe examined N=20 adolescent OCD patients and N=22 controls in a backward inhibition (BI) paradigm. This was combined with event-related potential (ERP) recordings and source localization. The BI effect describes the cost of overcoming the inhibition of a recently abandoned mental set that is relevant again. Therefore, a strong BI effect is disadvantageous for cognitive flexibility. ResultsCompared to controls, OCD patients revealed a smaller backward inhibition effect. The EEG data revealed larger P1 amplitudes in backward inhibition trials in the OCD group, which was due to activation differences in the inferior frontal gyrus (BA47). The severity of clinical symptoms predicted these neurophysiological modulations. The power of the observed effects was about 95%. ConclusionsThe study shows that cognitive flexibility can be better in OCD than controls. This may be the case insituations where superior abilities in the reactivation of repeating mental sets and difficulties to process new ones coincide. This may be accomplished by intensified inhibitory control mechanisms. The results challenge the view on OCD, since OCD is not generally associated with cognitive inflexibility.

The paper proposes a simple feature extraction technique to detect the N400 signal from the captured electroencephalographic waveform and an Interval type-2 Fuzzy Classifier is then designed to classify the learning levels using the extracted features. The paper also proposes a way to detect the early Alzheimer and schizophrenic patients using an event-related potential named N400. Here it is shown that the repetition effect of the N400 signal is different for the Alzheimer patients and healthy person. An N400 peak is noticed for both the Alzheimer patients and the healthy person but the amplitude of the curve is different for two different cases. The other aspect of this present work reveals that the increased latency of N400 signal can help us to detect a schizophrenic patient.

It is of highly relevance for an independent everyday life, especially in older adults; however, there is ample evidence that prospective memory declines with increasing age. Because most studies have used neutral stimuli, it is still an open question how emotional factors influence age-related differences in prospective remembering. The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of emotional material on prospective memory encoding, monitoring, maintaining, and retrieval in younger and older adults using behavioral and electrophysiological measures. We tested 24 younger adults (M = 26.4 years) and 20 older adults (M = 68.1 years) using a picture one-back task as ongoing activity with an embedded prospective memory instruction. The experimental task consisted of three sessions. In each session, participants had to encode series of images that represented the prospective memory cues for the consecutive block. The images were either of pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral valence. The pictures used in the ongoing task were likewise of pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral valence. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to assess the neural correlates of intention encoding, maintenance, and self-initiated retrieval. We did not find age differences between younger and older adults on the behavioral level. However, the ERP results revealed an interesting pattern that suggested for both age groups elevated attentional processing of emotional cues during encoding indicated by an elevated LPP for the emotional cues. Additionally, younger adults showed increased activity for unpleasant cues. During the maintenance phase, both age groups engaged in strategic monitoring especially for pleasant cues, which led to enhanced sustained positivity. During retrieval, older adults showed increased activity of ERP components related to cue detection and retrieval mainly for pleasant cues indicating enhanced relevance for those cues. In conclusion, emotional material may influence prospective remembering in older adults differently than in younger adults by supporting a mixture of top-down and bottom-up controlled processing. The results demonstrated a negativity bias in younger adults and a positivity bias in older adults.

In this study, we investigated single-source and multi-source scalar beamformers with respect to their performances in localizing and reconstructing source activity for simulated and real EEG data. We compared a new multi-source search approach (multi-step iterative approach; MIA) to our previous multi-source search approach (single-step iterative approach; SIA) and a single-source search approach (single-step peak approach; SPA). In order to compare performances across these beamformer approaches, we manipulated various simulated source parameters, such as the amount of signal-to-noise ratio (0.1-0.9), inter-source correlations (0.3-0.9), number of simultaneously active sources (2-8), and source locations. Results showed that localization performance followed the order of MIA > SIA > SPA regardless of the number of sources, source correlations, and single-to-noise ratios. In addition, SIA and MIA were significantly better than SPA at localizing four or more sources. Moreover, MIA was better than SIA and SPA at identifying the true source locations when signal characteristics were at their poorest. Source waveform reconstructions were similar between MIA and SIA but were significantly better than that for SPA. A similar trend was also found when applying these beamformer approaches to a real EEG dataset. Based on our findings, we conclude that multi-source beamformers (MIA and SIA) are an improvement over single-source beamformers for localizing EEG. Importantly, our new search method, MIA, had better localization performance, localization precision, and source waveform reconstruction as compared to SIA or SPA. We therefore recommend its use for improved source localization and waveform reconstruction of event-related potentials.

Individuals with aggressive tendencies display deficits in effortful control, particularly in affectively charged situations. However, not all individuals with poor effortful control are aggressive. This study uses event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded from a large sample (n = 75 undergraduates) to decompose the chronology of neural mechanisms underlying the ability to effortfully-control behavior, and then explores whether deficits in these cognitive functions might then lead to aggressive behavior. This study investigated which ERPs moderate the effortful control-aggression association. We examined three successive ERP components, the P2, N2, and P3, which have been associated with attentional orienting, response conflict, and working memory updating, for stimuli that required effortful control. N2 amplitudes were larger for trials requiring a switch from a preplanned action strategy than trials where a preplanned action strategy was followed. Furthermore, results indicated that N2 activation, but not P2 or P3 activation, moderated the relationship between effortful control and aggression. Our results suggest that small (less negative) N2s moderate the association between effortful control and aggression. These effects were present only in negative contexts, and only for high-conflict trials. Results suggest that individual differences in neural processing efficiency contributes to the execution of effortfully controlled behavior and avoidance of aggression.

Designing a BCI Stimulus Presentation Paradigm Using a Performance-Based Approach	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES HANDBOOK: TECHNOLOGICAL AND THEORETICAL ADVANCES			English	Article; Book Chapter							P300; ERROR	Stimulus-driven brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), such as the P300 speller, rely on eliciting and detecting event-related potentials (ERPs) that are embedded in noisy electroencephalography data. However, these BCIs are currently limited by their relatively slow spelling speeds due to repetitive data measurements to increase the signal-to-noise ratios of the elicited ERPs for improved selection accuracy. In addition, psycho-physiological factors such as refractory effects limit the ability to elicit a strong ERP response with every target stimulus event presentation. The stimulus presentation pattern encodes information about an intended message a user wishes to communicate. The role of the BCI is to translate the user's attention-modulated responses to the stimulus events into a selection that conveys the user's intent. Consequently, a BCI can be approached from an information-theoretic perspective in order to determine how best to reliably encode information to be robust to noisy channel transmission errors. In this chapter, we present a principled approach to design the stimulus presentation paradigm for the P300 speller that exploits an information-theoretic approach to maximize the information content that is presented to the user. We use a probabilistic performance prediction method to evaluate and compare the performances of different stimulus presentation configurations during the design optimization process. We select a final configuration that maximizes BCI performance while minimizing refractory effects. We present results with online BCI use, which demonstrate significant performance improvements with our performance-based stimulus presentation paradigm compared to the conventional method of stimulus presentation.

In order to manipulate the cognitive resources, 20 subjects were asked to memorize a 20-digit number in 20s. Then, stimuli of products with appearance and performance information were displayed randomly. Subjects need to decide whether to buy, while the Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. The stimuli were divided into four conditions based on the consistency of appearance and performance (condition 1: more attractive and superior performance; condition 2: more attractive and inferior performance; condition 3: less attractive and superior performance; condition 4: less attractive and inferior performance). Results showed that conditions 1 and 2 had higher purchase rate than other two conditions, but the difference between conditions 1 and 2 was not significant. Although both conditions 2 and 3 have conflicting information, condition 3 evoked the highest amplitude of conflict-related N270 than other conditions in the prefrontal regions. Aesthetics-related P2 were also elicited among posterior-parietal regions in all configurations, but the P2 amplitude triggered by condition 2 was significantly larger than other conditions. The findings indicated that consumers need to call more cognitive resources to integrate several pieces of product information when product appearance conflicts with its performance. When their cognitive resources were limited, they tended to use automatic, affective processes over thoughtful, cognitive ones which leaded to a high purchase rate, a smaller N270 and a larger P2 for the more attractive but inferior performance products. Hence, P2 and N270 may be useful neural endogenous indicators to reflect the process of handling conflicts in consumer decision.

Little is known about such cortical variations in semantic priming tasks where target words are matched with preceding sensory object cues. Here, two visually presented target words ("pear" and "lilac") were repeatedly cued by corresponding odors or pictures, and the participants were to indicate matching or nonmatching combinations. Data were split in behaviorally "fast" versus "slow" trials. We hypothesized that slow trials would be associated with higher prestimulus alpha activity and reduced ERP amplitudes, and that response-time differences between odor-cued and picture-cued trials would be especially large in slow behavioral trials. Results confirmed that slow trials showed increased alpha-band activity prior to word target onset, as well as amplitude decreases in the sensory P1 and semantic N400 components. However, no interactions between cue-modality and processing speed were observed. Instead, odor-cue integration responses were uniquely delayed on incongruent trials, a novel behavioral effect that was not observed in EEG measures. The results show that semantic integration speed is reflected in cortical activity before and during stimulus processing. Behavioral interactions with cue modality did not correspond to observed cortical activity changes, perhaps because olfactory circuits are not readily observed in scalp-recorded EEG. We conclude that combining behavioral speed variability and cortical EEG measures is useful in understanding the fluctuating nature of cognitive processing sequences.

These artifacts are usually addressed in a preprocessing phase that attempts to remove them or minimize their impact. This paper offers a set of useful techniques for this purpose: robust detrending, robust rereferencing, outlier detection, data interpolation (inpainting), step removal, and filter ringing artifact removal. These techniques provide a less wasteful alternative to discarding corrupted trials or channels, and they are relatively immune to artifacts that disrupt alternative approaches such as filtering. Robust detrending allows slow drifts and common mode signals to be factored out while avoiding the deleterious effects of glitches. Robust rereferencing reduces the impact of artifacts on the reference. Inpainting allows corrupt data to be interpolated from intact parts based on the correlation structure estimated over the intact parts. Outlier detection allows the corrupt parts to be identified. Step removal fixes the high-amplitude flux jump artifacts that are common with some MEG systems. Ringing removal allows the ringing response of the antialiasing filter to glitches (steps, pulses) to be suppressed. The performance of the methods is illustrated and evaluated using synthetic data and data from real EEG and MEG systems. These methods, which are mainly automatic and require little tuning, can greatly improve the quality of the data.

A new insight into sentence comprehension: The impact of word associations in sentence processing as shown by invasive EEG recording	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Invasive EEG; Sentence processing; Word association; N400; P600	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; SPATIOTEMPORAL STAGES; LEXICAL ASSOCIATION; FIELD POTENTIALS; ANGULAR GYRUS; LEVEL CONTEXT; N400	The effect of word association on sentence processing is still a matter of debate. Some studies observe no effect while others found a dependency on sentence congruity or an independent effect. In an attempt to separate the effects of sentence congruity and word association in the spatio-temporal domain, we jointly recorded scalp- and invasive-EEG (iEEG). The latter provides highly localized spatial (unlike scalp-EEG) and high temporal (unlike fMRI) resolutions. We recorded scalp- and iEEG in three patients with refractory epilepsy. The stimuli consisted of 280 sentences with crossed factors of sentence congruity and within sentence word-association. We mapped semantic retrieval processes involved in sentence comprehension onto the left temporal cortex and both hippocampi, and showed for the first time that certain localized regions participate in the processing of word association in sentence context. Furthermore, simultaneous recording of scalp- and iEEG gave us a direct overview of signal change due to its propagation across the head tissues.

J	Zhao, CT; Wang, YP				Zhao, Chengtian; Wang, Yuping			The distinct roles of insular subareas in recognition memory: a stereo-electroencephalography study	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						insular cortex; recognition memory; stereo-electroencephalography	COMPARATIVE CYTOARCHITECTONIC ANALYSIS; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTION PATTERNS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; DECISION-MAKING; BRAIN NETWORKS; FMRI; AWARENESS; CIRCUITRY; MONKEY	Previous studies have reported that the insular cortex is involved in recognition memory, but it remains unclear which subarea of the insular cortex serves this function. To address this question, we examined 14 drug-resistant focal epilepsy patients implanted with stereotactic electrodes in the insular cortex. All participants performed a delayed match-to-sample task. Event-related potentials and spectrograms from each insular subarea were analyzed when the participants were exposed to identical (match condition) and different (mismatch condition) stimuli. Each of the insular subareas had a significantly different event-related potential within the investigated interval of recognition memory under both match and mismatch conditions. Moreover, we observed that most of contacts in the left anterior insula had a stronger high-gamma response under the mismatch condition than the match condition, whereas most of contacts in the right insula had a stronger high-gamma response under the match condition than the mismatch condition. Thus, distinct roles for each insular subarea in recognition memory were found in this study. The right insula appears to subserve recognition memory by focusing on processing identical information, whereas the left anterior insula seems to subserve conflict monitoring by focusing on processing different information.

Distress Intolerance Modulation of Neurophysiological Markers of Cognitive Control During a Complex Go/No-Go Task	JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						distress intolerance; response inhibition; N2; P3; cognitive control	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY-DISORDER; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; SUBSTANCE-ABUSE TREATMENT; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; ANXIETY SENSITIVITY; WORKING-MEMORY	Distress intolerance (DI), a trait-like individual difference reflective of the inability to endure aversive affective states, is relevant to multiple forms of psychopathology, but its relations to theoretically relevant neurobiological systems have received little attention. Altered cognitive control-related neurobiology has been theorized to underlie individual differences in DI, but little empirical work has been conducted. To test this hypothesis, baseline data from a large community sample with elevated high levels of emotional psychopathology and comorbidity was utilized (N = 256). Participants completed a complex go/no-go task while EEG was recorded, and P2, N2, and P3 amplitudes were measured. Based upon prior findings on the relations between these components and response inhibition, a core cognitive control function, we hypothesized that DI would predict reduced no-go N2 and P3 amplitude while controlling for current anxious/depressive symptom severity (i.e., negative affect). Peak amplitudes from the raw data and principal components analysis were used to quantify amplitude of ERP components. Partially consistent with predictions, high DI was independently associated with reduced no-go N2 peak amplitude in the raw ERP data, and was significantly related to a frontal positivity factor in the N2 time window across no-go and go trials. Contrary to predictions, no relations between DI and the P3 were found. Overall, results support the theorized relevance of cognitive control-linked neurobiology to individual differences in tolerance of distress over and above distress severity itself, and suggest specific relations between DI and alterations in early controlled attention/conflict-monitoring but not response inhibition or response inhibition-related sequelae.

Informative feature extraction and accurate classification of EEG patterns are considerably challenging because of the poor signal-to-noise ratio caused by volume conduction effects, interferences from various noises, and intrinsic signal nonstationarity. In this chapter, we provide a tutorial of applying Bayesian learning-based algorithms to EEG feature optimization and classification in BCI applications. The algorithm principles of Bayesian learning are detailedly explained in the aspects of prior designing, posterior inference, and hyperparameter estimation. With two representative examples based on event-related potential and sensorimotor rhythm BCI paradigms, we further introduce the usage of Bayesian learning-based algorithms for EEG analysis. Extensive experimental comparisons are carried out among different competing algorithms to validate the effectiveness of Bayesian learning in BCI applications. A discussion is provided on various extensions of Bayesian learning for exploring more complex but potentially important properties of EEG, toward improved performance of BCI systems.

The aim of this study was to identify neural dynamics related to the ability to adapt to different cognitive control demands - a process that has been referred to as 'metacontrol.' A sample of N = 227 healthy subjects that was split in a 'high' and 'low adaptability' group based on the behavioral performance in a task with varying control demands. To examine the neurophysiological mechanisms, we combined event-related potential (ERP) recordings with source localization and machine learning approaches. The results show that individuals who are better at strategically adapting to different cognitive control demands benefit from automatizing their response processes in situations where little cognitive control is needed. On a neurophysiological level, neither perceptual/attentional selection processes nor conflict monitoring processes paralleled the behavioral data, although the latter showed a descriptive trend. Behavioral differences in metacontrol abilities were only significantly mirrored by the modulation of response-locked P3 amplitudes, which were accompanied by activation differences in insula (BA13) and middle frontal gyrus (BA9). The machine learning result corroborated this by identifying a predictive/classification feature near the peak of the response-locked P3, which arose from the anterior cingulate cortex (BA24; BA33). In short, we found that metacontrol is associated to the ability to manage response selection processes, especially the ability to effectively downregulate cognitive control under low cognitive control requirements, rather than the ability to upregulate cognitive control.

Orbitofrontal Lesion Alters Brain Dynamics of Emotion-Attention and Emotion-Cognitive Control Interaction in Humans	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention; cognitive control; executive function; emotion; EEG; ERP; orbitofrontal cortex; human studies	CONCUSSION SYMPTOMS QUESTIONNAIRE; ANTERIOR THALAMIC NUCLEI; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; STIMULI COMPETE; HEAD-INJURY; CORTEX; MODULATION; CONFLICT; CAPTURE	Patients with lesion to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) experience challenges in emotional control and emotion-guided behaviors. The OFC is known to participate in executive functions and attentional control of emotion and our previous research suggests OFC lesion alters the balance between voluntary and involuntary attention and cognitive control within the context of emotion. To better understand how OFC lesion affects the dynamics and interaction of these functions, we studied EEG and performance of 12 patients with lesion to the OFC and 11 control subjects with intact OFC in a Go/NoGo visual reaction time (RT) task with neutral targets and intervening threat-related emotional distractors (Executive RT Test). Event-related potentials (ERPs), specifically N2P3 peak-to-peak amplitude and the following late positive potential (LPP), were used to measure allocation of attention and cognitive control to emotional distractors. Task performance and Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functions-Adult version (BRIEF-A) scores were used to assess executive functions. As expected, the Control group showed increased N2P3 amplitude in the context of threat-related distractors, particularly over the right hemisphere, while LPP was not modulated by these distractors. In contrast, patients with OFC lesion showed no such impact of threat-related distractors on N2P3 amplitude but exhibited increased and prolonged left-lateralized impact of threat on LPP in the Go-condition. In NoGo-condition, the N2P3 amplitude was increased in both groups due to threat, but the impact was seen earlier, i.e., at the N2 peak in the OFC group and later at the P3 peak in Controls. The OFC group committed more errors in the Executive RT Test and reported more problems in BRIEF-A, thus both objective and subjective evidence for challenges in executive functions was obtained in patients with orbitofrontal lesion. Furthermore, the time-course of attention allocation and cognitive control towards task-irrelevant emotional stimuli was altered as evidenced by ERPs. We conclude that orbitofrontal lesion is associated with altered neural dynamics underlying the interaction of involuntary attention to emotion and cognitive control. These alterations in brain dynamics may underlie some of the challenges patients encounter in everyday life when emotional events interact with cognitive demands.

In this study, we propose the Global optimal constrained ICA (GocICA) algorithm for solving the conventional cICA problems. Due to the importance of movement related cortical potentials (MRCPs) for neurorehabilitation and developing a suitable mechanism for detection of movement intention, single-trial MRCP extraction is presented as an application of GocICA. Methods: In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed technique, two kinds of datasets including simulated and real EEG data have been utilized in this paper. The GocICA method has been implemented based on the most popular meta-heuristic optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Charged System Search (CSS) where the results have been compared with those of conventional cICA and two ICA-based methods (JADE and Infomax). Results: It was found that GocICA enhanced the extracted MRCP from multi-channel EEG better than both conventional cICA and ICA-based methods and also outperformed them in single-trial MRCP detection with higher true positive rates (TPRs) and lower false positive rates (FPRs). Moreover, CSS-cICA resulted in the greatest TPR (91.2232 +/- 3.4708) and the lowest FPR (8.7465 +/- 3.7705) for single-trial MRCP detection from real EEG data and the greatest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (39.2818) and the lowest mean square error (MSE) and individual performance index (IPI) (41.8230 and 0.0012, respectively) for singletrial MRCP extraction from simulated EEG data. Conclusions: These results confirm the superiority of GocICA with respect to conventional cICA that is due to the ability of meta-heuristic optimization algorithms to escape from local optimal point. As such, GocICA is a promising new algorithm for single-trial MRCP detection which can be used for detecting other types of event related cortical potentials (ERPs) such as P300 and also for EEG artifact removal.

We tested the hypothesis that DLPFC modulates word production of words specifically in a second language (L2) by measuring the effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (anodal-tDCS) over the DLPFC on picture naming and word translation and on event-related potentials (ERPs) and their sources. Twenty-six bilingual participants with "unbalanced" proficiency in two languages were given 20 min of 1.5 mA anodal or sham tDCS (double-blind stimulation design, counterbalanced stimulation order, 1-week intersession delay). The participants then performed the following tasks: verbal and non-verbal fluency during anodal-tDCS stimulation and first and second language (L1 and L2) picture naming and translation [ forward (L1 -> L2) and backward (L2 -> L1)] immediately after stimulation. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded during picture naming and translation. On the behavioral level, anodal-tDCS had an influence on non-verbal fluency but neither on verbal fluency, nor on picture naming and translation. EEG measures revealed significant interactions between Language and Stimulation on picture naming around 380 ms post-stimulus onset and Translation direction and Stimulation on translation around 530 ms post-stimulus onset. These effects suggest that L2 phonological retrieval and phoneme encoding are spatially and temporally segregated in the brain. We conclude that anodal-tDCS stimulation has an effect at a neural level on phonological processes and, critically, that DLPFC-mediated activation is a constraint on language production specifically in L2.

We collected 18 sets of EEG records; each set containing 150 events of stimulation. In this work we focus on feature extraction algorithms. Particularly, we highlight Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) as a method of feature extraction. Based on these latter, different classifiers were trained in order to associate a set of signals to a previously learned human answer, pertaining to two classes: semantically related, or not semantically related. The results of classification accuracy were evaluated comparing with other four methods of feature extraction, and using classification algorithms from five different families. In all cases, classification accuracy was benefited from using CSP instead of FDTW, LPC, PCA or ICA for feature extraction. Particularly with the combination CSP-Naive Bayes we obtained the best average precision of 84.63%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the causes of these co-occurring difficulties are not well understood. Perceptual processing atypicalities are also often reported in individuals with ASD, but how these relate to co-occurring emotional and behavioural problems remains unclear, and few studies have used objective measurement of perceptual processing. Methods: Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in response to both standard and deviant stimuli (which varied in pitch) in an auditory oddball paradigm in adolescents (mean age of 13.56 years, SD = 1.12, range = 11.40-15.70) with ASD (n = 43) with a wide range of IQ (mean IQ of 84.14, SD = 24.24, range 27-129). Response to deviant as compared to standard stimuli (as indexed by the mismatch negativity (MMN)) and response to repeated presentations of standard stimuli (habituation) were measured. Multivariate regression tested the association between neural indices of perceptual processing and co-occurring emotional and behavioural problems. Results: Greater sensitivity to changes in pitch in incoming auditory information (discrimination), as indexed by increased MMN amplitude, was associated with higher levels of parent-rated behaviour problems. MMN amplitude also showed a trend positive correlation with parent-rated sensory hyper-sensitivity. Conversely, greater habituation at the later N2 component was associated with higher levels of emotional problems. Upon more detailed analyses, this appeared to be driven by a selectively greater ERP response to the first (but not the second or third) standard stimuli that followed deviant stimuli. A similar pattern of association was found with other measures of anxiety. All results remained in covariation analyses controlling for age, sex and IQ, although the association between MMN amplitude and behaviour problems became non-significant when controlling for ASD severity. Conclusions: Findings suggest that alterations in mechanisms of perceptual processing and discrimination may be important for understanding co-occurring emotional and behavioural problems in young people with ASD.

It was employed to analyse abnormal event-related potentials of schizophrenics focused on P50 potentials of sensory gating, which is the most common paradigm currently used for analysing schizophrenia. The approach for analysing P50 sensory gating in schizophrenics is presented from twenty-seven schizophrenia patients and twenty healthy controls. The values calculated for the patients under the conditioning and testing stimuli were used to calculate the entropy complexity. Results demonstrate that the approach can be effectively used to analyse sensory gating deficits in patients with schizophrenia and that the algorithm can be satisfactorily be used for analysing electroencephalogram signals.

Discriminating scene categories from brain activity within 100 milliseconds	CORTEX			English	Article						EEG; Time course; Perception; Line drawings; Global; Visual cortex	PARAHIPPOCAMPAL PLACE AREA; HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; TIME-COURSE; PERCEPTION; REPRESENTATION; RECOGNITION; INFORMATION; TEXTURE; OBJECT; GIST	Humans have the ability to make sense of the world around them in only a single glance. This astonishing feat requires the visual system to extract information from our environment with remarkable speed. How quickly does this process unfold across time, and what visual information contributes to our understanding of the visual world? We address these questions by directly measuring the temporal dynamics of the perception of colour photographs and line drawings of scenes with electroencephalography (EEG) during a scene-memorization task. Within a fraction of a second, event-related potentials (ERPs) show dissociable response patterns for global scene properties of content (natural versus manmade) and layout (open versus closed). Subsequent detailed analyses of within-category versus between-category discriminations found significant dissociations of basic-level scene categories (e.g., forest; city) within the first 100 msec of perception. The similarity of this neural activity with feature-based discriminations suggests low-level image statistics may be foundational for this rapid categorization. Interestingly, our results also suggest that the structure preserved in line drawings may form a primary and necessary basis for visual processing, whereas surface information may further enhance category selectivity in later-stage processing. Critically, these findings provide evidence that the distinction of both basic-level categories and global properties of scenes from neural signals occurs within 100 msec. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the EEG is easily contaminated by artifacts of physiological origin, which can pollute the measured cortical activity and bias the interpretations of such data. This is especially relevant when recording EEG of stroke patients while they try to move their paretic limbs, since they generate more artifacts due to compensatory activity. In this paper, we study how physiological artifacts (i.e., eye movements, motion artifacts, muscle artifacts and compensatory movements with the other limb) can affect EEG activity of stroke patients. Data from 31 severely paralyzed stroke patients performing/attempting grasping movements with their healthy/paralyzed hand were analyzed offline. We estimated the cortical activation as the event-related desynchronization (ERD) of sensorimotor rhythms and used it to detect the movements with a pseudo-online simulated BMI. Automated state-of-the-art methods (linear regression to remove ocular contaminations and statistical thresholding to reject the other types of artifacts) were used to minimize the influence of artifacts. The effect of artifact reduction was quantified in terms of ERD and BMI performance. The results reveal a significant contamination affecting the EEG, being involuntary muscle activity the main source of artifacts. Artifact reduction helped extracting the oscillatory signatures of motor tasks, isolating relevant information from noise and revealing a more prominent ERD activity. Lower BMI performances were obtained when artifacts were eliminated from the training datasets. This suggests that artifacts produce an optimistic bias that improves theoretical accuracy but may result in a poor link between task-related oscillatory activity and BMI peripheral feedback.

One hypothesis is that individuals with ASD engage in piecemeal compared to holistic face processing strategies. To investigate the role of possible impairments in holistic face processing in individuals with autism, the current study investigated behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of face processing (P1/N170 and gamma-band activity) in adolescents with ASD and sex-, age-, and IQ-matched neurotypical controls. Methods: Participants were presented with upright and inverted Mooney stimuli; black and white low information faces that are only perceived as faces when processed holistically. Participants indicated behaviorally the detection of a face. EEG was collected time-locked to the presentation of the stimuli. Results: Adolescents with ASD perceived Mooney stimuli as faces suggesting ability to use holistic processing but displayed a lower face detection rate and slower response times. ERP components suggest slowed temporal processing of Mooney stimuli in the ASD compared to control group for P1 latency but no differences between groups for P1 amplitude and at the N170. Increases in gamma-band activity was similar during the perception of the Mooney images by group, but the ASD group showed prolonged temporal elevation in activity. Conclusion: Overall, our results suggest that adolescents with ASD were able to utilize holistic processing to perceive a face within the Mooney stimuli. Delays in early processing, marked by the P1, and elongated elevation in gamma activity indicate that the neural systems supporting holistic processing are slightly altered suggesting a less automatic and less efficient facial processing system.

This task is made more daunting by frequent perceptual discontinuities in the acoustic scene: talkers move in space and conversations switch from one speaker to another in a background of many other sources. The inherent dynamics of such switches directly impact our ability to sustain attention. Here we asked how discontinuity in talker voice affects the ability to focus auditory attention to sounds from a particular location as well as neural correlates of underlying processes. During electroencephalography recordings, listeners attended to a stream of spoken syllables from one direction while ignoring distracting syllables from a different talker from the opposite hemifield. On some trials, the talker switched locations in the middle of the streams, creating a discontinuity. This switch disrupted attentional modulation of cortical responses; specifically, event-related potentials evoked by syllables in the to-be-attended direction were suppressed and power in alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz) were reduced following the discontinuity. Importantly, at an individual level, the ability to maintain attention to a target stream and report its content, despite the discontinuity, correlates with the magnitude of the disruption of these cortical responses. These results have implications for understanding cortical mechanisms supporting attention. The changes in the cortical responses may serve as a predictor of how well individuals can communicate in complex acoustic scenes and may help in the development of assistive devices and interventions to aid clinical populations.

J	Wu, ZH				Wu, Zhenghua			Application of a reconstruction technique in detection of dominant SSVEP frequency	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP); Brain-computer interface (BCI); Reconstruction extraction (RE); Power spectrum (PS); Canonical correlation analysis (CCA)	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; VISUAL-EVOKED POTENTIALS; COMMUNICATION; BCIS; RECOGNITION; TOPOGRAPHY; COMPONENTS; RESPONSES; TASK	Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) have a number of specific properties such as an oscillating feature when compared to event-related potentials (ERPs). Based on this oscillating property, a short electroencephalogram (EEG) segment containing an SSVEP can be used to reconstruct a series of EEG segments where the SSVEP has the same initial phase but the phase of the background EEG varies randomly. When these reconstructed EEG segments are averaged, the background EEG is weakened, whereas the SSVEP is strengthened. Therefore, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the SSVEP in the averaged signal is significantly improved. This reconstruction technique is first proposed in this work, and the method of extracting SSVEPs based on this technique is referred to as the reconstruction extraction (RE) method. The RE, power spectrum (PS), and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) methods were applied to EEG segments that were 1s in length in order to detect SSVEPs. The results show that the detection accuracy of the RE method is similar to that of the CCA method, although it is higher than that of the PS method in situations where the SSVEP has low strength. However, in contrast to the CCA, the RE can be applied using only one signal electrode. This suggests that the RE method can be adopted in a real-time SSVEP-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We used electrophysiological measures to determine the speed of voluntary and visually guided shifts of attention. Participants shifted attention from a known benchmark object (T1) to a benchmark-defined target object (T2) in tasks where these shifts had to be controlled endogenously and tasks where they could be guided by visible stimulus attributes (target features or arrow cues). To track the speed of these attention shifts, we measured event-related potential (ERP) markers of attentional object selection (N2pc components). The N2pc to T1 emerged earlier than the N2pc to T2, confirming the presence of serial attention shifts. N2pc onset differences between T1 and T2 revealed that shifts guided by target features were triggered within 50 ms, whereas voluntary movements of attention took substantially longer (150 ms). Attention shifts signaled by arrow cues were initiated within about 100 ms. Results show that genuinely voluntary shifts of attention are slower than shifts that are guided by cues or target features, but can still be initiated more rapidly than has previously been assumed. They also demonstrate that EEG markers can track different types of serial attentional selection processes with high temporal precision. Public Significance Statement How fast can observers shift their attention between different objects in the visual field? Using brain activity measures, we show that fully voluntary attention shifts can be triggered rapidly, within approximately 150 ms. However, attention shifts are even faster when they can be guided by the properties of visual objects.

Indeed, the brain is one of the most sensitive organs to the detrimental effects of even low and intermediate IR doses. This represents a critical issue involving especially categories exposed to IR, such as workers of nuclear plants, or interventional medical and nurse staff. Therefore, it seems crucial to promptly recognize early signs of IR-induced brain abnormalities, in order to prevent and/or treat them appropriately The recording of event-related potentials (ERPs) is one of the most common neurophysiological methodologies to record and assess evoked brain activity. ERPs have been used for decades to assess perception, cognition, and emotions even in neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as in neuroscience and psychology. The aim of the present paper was to review the available literature data on the possible use of ERPs as possible marker of brain damage following IR exposure. Although further studies are needed, nevertheless the careful literature review seems to suggest the potentiality of ERPs recording as an easy and bloodless mean to detect early brain abnormalities following IR exposure.

B	Cecotti, H		Tanaka, T; Arvaneh, M		Cecotti, Hubert			Feedforward artificial neural networks for event-related potential detection	SIGNAL PROCESSING AND MACHINE LEARNING FOR BRAIN-MACHINE INTERFACES	IET Control Robotics and Sensors Series		English	Article; Book Chapter							CLASSIFICATION; MODEL; P300	The detection of brain responses at the single-trial level in the electroencephalogram (EEG) such as event-related potentials (ERPs) is a difficult problem that requires different processing steps to extract relevant discriminant features as the input signal is noisy and the brain responses can be different over time. In brain-computer interface, single-trial detection is primarily applied to distinguish the presence of large ERP components such as the P300. Because the characteristics of the P300 can depend on the parameters of the oddball paradigm, the type of stimuli, and as it can vary across subjects and over time during experiments, a reliable classifier must take into account this variability for the detection of the P300. While most of the signal and classification techniques for the detection of brain responses are based on linear algebra, different pattern recognition techniques such as convolutional neural network (CNN), as a type of deep learning technique, have shown some interest as they are able to process the signal after limited preprocessing. In this chapter, we propose to investigate the performance of different feedforward neural networks in relation of their architecture and in relation to how they are evaluated: a single system for each subject or a system for all the subjects. More particularly, we want to address the change of performance that can be observed between specifying a neural network to a subject, or by considering a neural network for a group of subjects, taking advantage of a larger number of trials from different subjects. The results support the conclusion that a CNN trained on different subjects can lead to an AUC above 0.9 by using an appropriate architecture using spatial filtering and shift invariant layers.

Using behavioral measures and EEG, we studied whether an own-age bias (OAB) also exists in voice memory. Young (19 - 26 years) and old (60-75 years) participants studied young (18-25 years) and old (60-77 years) unfamiliar voices from short sentences. Subsequently, they classified studied and novel voices as "old" (i.e. studied) or "new", from the same sentences. Recognition performance was higher in young compared to old participants, and for old compared to young voices, with no OAB. At the same time, we found evidence for higher distinctiveness of old compared to young voices, both in terms of acoustic measures and subjective ratings (independent of rater age). Analyses of event related brain potentials (ERPs) indicated more negative-going deflections (400-1000 ms) for old compared to young voices in young participants. In old participants, we observed a reversed OLD/NEW memory effect, with overall more positive amplitudes for novel compared to studied old (but not young) voices (400-1000 ms). Time frequency analyses revealed less beta power (16-26 Hz) for young compared to old voices at left anterior sites, and also reduced beta power for correctly recognized studied (compared to novel) voices at left posterior sites (300-900 ms). These findings could suggest an engagement of cortical areas during stimulus-specific recollection from about 300 ms, in a task that emphasized the analysis of individual acoustic features.

Shared spatiotemporal category representations in biological and artificial deep neural networks	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							OBJECT RECOGNITION; TIME-COURSE; DYNAMICS; TOP; FEEDFORWARD; MODELS; EEG	Visual scene category representations emerge very rapidly, yet the computational transformations that enable such invariant categorizations remain elusive. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) perform visual categorization at near human-level accuracy using a feedforward architecture, providing neuroscientists with the opportunity to assess one successful series of representational transformations that enable categorization in silico. The goal of the current study is to assess the extent to which sequential scene category representations built by a CNN map onto those built in the human brain as assessed by high-density, time-resolved event-related potentials (ERPs). We found correspondence both over time and across the scalp: earlier (0-200 ms) ERP activity was best explained by early CNN layers at all electrodes. Although later activity at most electrode sites corresponded to earlier CNN layers, activity in right occipito-temporal electrodes was best explained by the later, fully-connected layers of the CNN around 225 ms post-stimulus, along with similar patterns in frontal electrodes. Taken together, these results suggest that the emergence of scene category representations develop through a dynamic interplay between early activity over occipital electrodes as well as later activity over temporal and frontal electrodes.

We show that despite the initial severity, the cognitive outcome was ultimately very good but with a highly nonlinear time-course and prolonged loss of consciousness (more than 2months). Repeated clinical assessments and brain-imaging techniques (electroencephalography, event-related potential, (18)-Fluoro-Deoxy-Glucose-PET and magnetic resonance imaging) allowed us to monitor and anticipate this dynamic, providing relevant information to guide decision making in front of withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy discussions. This case illustrates the value of multimodal functional imaging in devastating brain injuries.

It Pays to Prepare: Human Motor Preparation Depends on the Relative Value of Potential Response Options	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG/ERP; action selection; motor planning; movement utility; CNV; lateralized readiness potential	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; MOVEMENT PREPARATION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; CORTICAL NETWORK; VARIATION CNV; REWARD; INFORMATION; DIRECTION; STRIATUM; FORCE	Alternative motor responses can be prepared in parallel. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to test whether the parallel preparation of alternative response options is modulated by their relative value. Participants performed a choice response task with three potential actions: isometric contraction of the left, the right, or both wrists. An imperative stimulus (IS) appeared after a warning cue, such that the initiation time of a required action was predictable, but the specific action was not. To encourage advanced preparation, the target was presented 200 ms prior to the IS, and only correct responses initiated within +/- 100 ms of the IS were rewarded. At baseline, all targets were equally rewarded and probable. Then, responses with one hand were made more valuable, either by increasing the probability that the left or right target would be required (Exp. 1; n = 31) or by increasing the reward magnitude of one target (Exp. 2, n = 36). We measured reaction times, movement vigor, and an EEG correlate of action preparation (value-based lateralized readiness potential) prior to target presentation. Participants responded earlier to more frequent and more highly rewarded targets, and movements to highly rewarded targets were more vigorous. The EEG was more negative over the hemisphere contralateral to the more repeated/rewarded hand, implying an increased neural preparation of more valuable actions. Thus, changing the value of alternative response options can lead to greater preparation of actions associated with more valuable outcomes. This preparation asymmetry likely contributes to behavioral biases that are typically observed toward repeated or rewarded targets. (C) 2018 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Signals derived from this relation can also be harnessed to control external devices for Brain Computer Interface (BCI) applications. While the classic event-related potential (ERP) is appropriate for isolated stimuli, more sophisticated "decoding" strategies are needed to address continuous stimuli such as speech, music or environmental sounds. Here we describe an approach based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) that finds the optimal transform to apply to both the stimulus and the response to reveal correlations between the two. Compared to prior methods based on forward or backward models for stimulus-response mapping, CCA finds significantly higher correlation scores, thus providing increased sensitivity to relatively small effects, and supports classifier schemes that yield higher classification scores. CCA strips the brain response of variance unrelated to the stimulus, and the stimulus representation of variance that does not affect the response, and thus improves observations of the relation between stimulus and response.

Hyperactivity and Hypermotivation Associated With Increased Striatal mGluR1 Signaling in a Shank2 Rat Model of Autism	FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						SHANK; Shank2; autism spectrum disorders; rat model; mGluR; motivation	METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; SPECTRUM DISORDER; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; REPETITIVE BEHAVIORS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; MOUSE MODELS; MICE; EXPRESSION; HIPPOCAMPUS; PERFORMANCE	Mutations in the SHANK family of genes have been consistently identified in genetic and genomic screens of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The functional overlap of SHANK with several other ASD-associated genes suggests synaptic dysfunction as a convergent mechanism of pathophysiology in ASD. Although many ASD-related mutations result in alterations to synaptic function, the nature of those dysfunctions and the consequential behavioral manifestations are highly variable when expressed in genetic mouse models. To investigate the phylogenetic conservation of phenotypes resultant of Shank2 loss-of-function in a translationally relevant animal model, we generated and characterized a novel transgenic rat with a targeted mutation of the Shank2 gene, enabling an evaluation of gene-associated phenotypes, the elucidation of complex behavioral phenotypes, and the characterization of potential translational biomarkers. The Shank2 loss-of-function mutation resulted in a notable phenotype of hyperactivity encompassing hypermotivation, increased locomotion, and repetitive behaviors. Mutant rats also expressed deficits in social behavior throughout development and in the acquisition of operant tasks. The hyperactive phenotype was associated with an upregulation of mGluR1 expression, increased dendritic branching, and enhanced long-term depression (LTD) in the striatum but opposing morphological and cellular alterations in the hippocampus (HP). Administration of the mGluR1 antagonist JNJ16259685 selectively normalized the expression of striatally mediated repetitive behaviors and physiology but had no effect on social deficits. Finally, Shank2 mutant animals also exhibited alterations in electroencephalography (EEG) spectral power and event-related potentials, which may serve as translatable EEG biomarkers of synaptopathic alterations. Our results show a novel hypermotivation phenotype that is unique to the rat model of Shank2 dysfunction, in addition to the traditional hyperactive and repetitive behaviors observed in mouse models. The hypermotivated and hyperactive phenotype is associated with striatal dysfunction, which should be explored further as a targetable mechanism for impairment in ASD.

Behavioral data, as well as event-related potentials (ERPs) and induced event-related oscillations (EROs) were analyzed. At the behavioral level, deprived participants showed speeded reaction times to new stimuli. Analyses of ERPs indicated that starting from 1000 ms the recognition of old objects elicited enhanced positive amplitudes only for the visually deprived group. Visual deprivation also influenced EROs. In this sense, we observed reduced power in the lower-1 alpha band for the processing of new compared to old stimuli between 500 and 750 ms. Overall, our data showed improved haptic recognition memory after a short period of visual deprivation. These effects were thought to reflect a compensatory mechanism that might have developed as an adaptive strategy for dealing with the environment when visual information is not available.

Electroencephalography was recorded from 21 Japanese participants (four men, 17 women) who were shown pictures of faces with one of three lengths of hair: long, medium length, or short. In addition, we used both fixed-size and variable-size blocks. In fixed-size blocks, the three types of stimuli were matched to have the same overall size; in variable-size blocks, long hair stimuli were the biggest, medium length hair stimuli were medium sized, and short hair stimuli were the smallest. We analyzed P1 latency and amplitude using two-way (6 x 2) repeated-measures analysis of variance over length of hair and electrode; N170 latency and amplitude were analyzed using three-way (6 x 2 x 2) repeated-measures analysis of variance over length of hair, hemisphere, and electrode. The latency of P1 to faces with short hair in variable-size blocks was significantly longer than that to the other five stimulus types (p < .01 for four of the other types; p = .083 for medium length hair in variable-size blocks). The latency of N170 to faces with long hair in variable-size blocks was significantly shorter than that to faces with medium length hair and short hair in variable-size blocks (p = .026 and p = .086, respectively). These results indicate that length of hair influenced P1 and N170 latency, supporting the notion that length of hair is a significant external facial feature. Because long hair attracted participants' attention, there was early perceptual processing of this feature. In contrast, because short hair did not attract attention, perceptual processing of this feature was late.

Rationale and Methods of the Study	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						intrauterine stress; fetal growth restriction; face processing; socio-cognitive development; mother-child interactions	FOR-GESTATIONAL-AGE; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PRETERM INFANTS; BIRTH-WEIGHT; FACE; CHILDREN; BEHAVIOR; NEURODEVELOPMENT; RECOGNITION; BORN	Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is defined as a fetal growth retardation, resulting in an estimated fetal weight less than the 10th centile for gestational age. IUGR developing brain is affected by the atypical fetal growth, presenting altered structure and connectivity and increased risk for neurodevelopmental impairments. Behaviorally, IUGR infants show reduced responsiveness and engagement with human faces during mother-child exchanges. The neural mechanisms of these patterns of interactions remain unexplored, as well as their potential role in shaping socio-cognitive trajectories of development. Aim of this research project will be to longitudinally investigate mother-infant interactions and infant's event-related potential (ERP) components of face processing (infant N170, P400, Negative central) in 4 and 9 months IUGR as potential early markers of expected atypical cognitive and behavioral outcomes observed at 12 months. Thirty IUGR participants will be recruited after receiving the in utero diagnosis (>28th gestational week). Thirty healthy infants will be enrolled as the control group. Maternal environment will be assessed via Emotional Availability Scales (EASs), with child responsiveness and maternal sensitivity as variables of interest. Infants' scalp-recorded cortical activity in response to social and non-social stimuli will be investigated using a high-density EEG system (EGI Geodesic system). Neurodevelopment will be measured at 12 months of child's life, using Bayley Scales for Infant Development (BSID), while the possible presence of emotional-behavioral problems will be rated via Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). We expect that being IUGR significantly affects cognitive and behavioral outcomes, through mediation effects of both infants' neural and behavioral capacity to respond to social stimuli. Indeed, we expect an altered response to social stimuli in IUGR infants, resulting in smaller ERP components amplitude in response to human faces compared to healthy matched peers. A significant association between neural response to social stimuli and infants' responsiveness to maternal stimulation during interactions is expected, with impoverished performances on the interactive domain in IUGR, compared to healthy peers. This study will enhance understanding on neural mechanisms underpinning the interactive patterns sustaining socio-cognitive development in IUGR and healthy infants. The study will help in clarifying the role of postnatal environment in buffering the vulnerability experienced by children delayed in their fetal growth.

However, electroencephalographic data is a mixture of neural activity from various brain locations and also external artifacts. This paper presents a novel method utilizing source level features computed based on maximum contrast beamformer. The estimated source activity has the maximum contrast between the power during the reference period and the period that event-related synchronization or desynchronization emerges. Moreover, this method utilizes the classification structure based on divide-and-conquer concept to identify four classes of motor imageries, including left hand, right hand, tongue, and foot. The experimental results demonstrate the improvement in classification accuracy by using the proposed method.

Acute administration of roflumilast enhances immediate recall of verbal word memory in healthy young adults	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Roflumilast; PDE4; cAMP; Memory; Verbal learning task	OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; COGNITION ENHANCEMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; N-OXIDE; PHOSPHODIESTERASE-4 INHIBITOR; TRYPTOPHAN DEPLETION; IMPROVES MEMORY; ROLIPRAM; HIPPOCAMPUS	The need for new and effective treatments for dementia remains indisputably high. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDE-Is) have proven efficacy as cognitive enhancers based on their positive effects in numerous preclinical studies. Especially the PDE4 subfamily is of interest due to its expression in the hippocampus, the key structure for memory formation. The current study investigates the memory enhancing effects of the clinically approved PDE4-I roflumilast in a test battery including the Verbal Learning Task (VLT) combined with electroencephalography (EEG) recording. This acute study was conducted according to a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 4-way crossover design. Three capsulated dosages of roflumilast HCl (Daxas) and a placebo were administered in four study periods. Administration occurred 1 h before testing to reach maximal plasma concentrations. Memory performance was assessed using a 30 word Verbal Learning Task. The number of words recalled both immediately and after 45 min and 24 h were included as outcome measures. EEG was recorded during the cognitive tasks on the first day. Different event-related potentials (ERPs) were considered with special emphasis on P600, as this peak has been related to word learning. Memory performance was significantly improved after acute administration of 100 mu g roflumilast. Specifically, immediate recall performance on the VLT increased 2-3 words, accompanied by an enhanced P600 peak during word presentation at the third learning trial. No side effects typical for PDE4-Is were reported for the lowest and effective dose of 100 mu g roflumilast. The current proof-of-concept study shows for the first time the potential of low-dose roflumilast administration as a memory enhancer in humans. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We performed electroencephalography in 54 Chinese and 49 Western adults while they performed a time estimation task in which response-accuracy feedback was either delivered pertaining to participants' own performance (non-social reference frame) or to the performance of a reference group (social reference frame). Trait interdependence and independence were assessed using a cultural orientations questionnaire. Applying a principal component approach, we observed divergent effects for the two cultural groups during feedback processing. In particular, Feedback-Related Negativity results indicated that non-social (vs social) reference feedback was more salient/motivating for Chinese participants, while Westerners showed the opposite pattern. The results suggest that Chinese individuals perceive a non-social context as more salient than a social comparison context, possibly due to their extensive experience of social comparisons in daily life. The reverse pattern was found in Western participants, for whom a social comparison context is less common and presumably more salient. The cultural differences in neural responses to social vs non-social feedback might be caused by culturally diverse cognitive traits, as well as by exposure to culturally defined behaviour on a systemic level-such as the education system.

A comparison between the neural correlates of laser and electric pain stimulation and their modulation by expectation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Expectation; Pain; Evoked potential; Laser; Electric	PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; A-DELTA-FIBERS; PLACEBO ANALGESIA; EVOKED POTENTIALS; RESPONSES; ANTICIPATION; NOCEBO; FMRI; EEG; LOCALIZATION	Background: Pain is modulated by expectation. Event-related potential (ERP) studies of the influence of expectation on pain typically utilise laser heat stimulation to provide a controllable nociceptive-specific stimulus. Painful electric stimulation has a number of practical advantages, but is less nociceptive-specific. We compared the modulation of electric versus laser-evoked pain by expectation, and their corresponding pain-evoked and anticipatory ERPs. New method: We developed understanding of recognised methods of laser and electric stimulation. We tested whether pain perception and neural activity induced by electric stimulation was modulated by expectation, whether this expectation elicited anticipatory neural correlates, and how these measures compared to those associated with laser stimulation by eliciting cue-evoked expectations of high and low pain in a within-participant design. Results: Despite sensory and affective differences between laser and electric pain, intensity ratings and pain-evoked potentials were modulated equivalently by expectation, though ERPs only correlated with pain ratings in the laser pain condition. Anticipatory correlates differentiated pain intensity expectation to laser but not electric pain. Comparison with existing method: Previous studies show that laser-evoked potentials are modulated by expectation. We extend this by showing electric pain-evoked potentials are equally modulated by expectation, within the same participants. We also show a difference between the pain types in anticipation. Conclusions: Though laser-evoked potentials express a stronger relationship with pain perception, both laser and electric stimulation may be used to study the modulation of pain-evoked potentials by expectation. Anticipatory-evoked potentials are elicited by both pain types, but they may reflect different processes. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Hird, E. J.; Jones, A. K.

The ultimate goal was to corroborate the role of cognitive mechanisms in event-related potential (ERP)-based BCI control in ALS patients. Furthermore, the possible differences in such attentional mechanisms between the two groups were investigated in order to unveil possible alterations associated with the ALS condition. Thirteen ALS patients and 13 healthy volunteers matched for age and years of education underwent a P3-speller BCI task and a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task. The RSVP task was performed by participants in order to screen their temporal pattern of attentional resource allocation, namely: (i) the temporal attentional filtering capacity (scored as T1%); and (ii) the capability to adequately update the attentive filter in the temporal dynamics of the attentional selection (scored as T2%). For the P3-speller BCI task, the online accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR) were obtained. Centroid Latency and Mean Amplitude of N200 and P300 were also obtained. No significant differences emerged between ALS patients and Controls with regards to online accuracy (p = 0.13). Differently, the performance in controlling the P3-speller expressed as ITR values (calculated offline) were compromised in ALS patients (p < 0.05), with a delay in the latency of P3 when processing BCI stimuli as compared with Control group (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the temporal aspect of attentional filtering which was related to BCI control (r = 0.51; p < 0.05) and to the P3 wave amplitude (r = 0.63; p < 0.05) was also altered in ALS patients (p = 0.01). These findings ground the knowledge required to develop sensible classes of BCI specifically designed by taking into account the influence of the cognitive characteristics of the possible candidates in need of a BCI system for communication.

Polymorphisms that affect GABA neurotransmission predict processing of aversive prediction errors in humans	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Prediction error; Classical conditioning; Electroencephalography; GABA; Polymorphism	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; RECEPTOR BETA(2) SUBUNIT; GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID; VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; DOPAMINE NEURONS; REWARD; EXTINCTION; ANXIETY; ERBB4; ASSOCIATION	Learning is one of our most adaptive abilities, allowing us to adjust our expectations about future events. Aberrant learning processes may underlie disorders such as anxiety, motivating the search for the neural mechanisms that underpin learning. Animal studies have shown that the neurotransmitter GABA is required for the computation of prediction errors, the mismatches between anticipated and experienced outcomes, which drive new learning. Given that evidence from human studies is lacking, we sought to determine whether these findings extend to humans. Here, in two samples of Caucasian individuals, we investigated whether genetically determined individual differences in GABA neurotransmission predict the P3 event-related potential, an EEG component known to reflect prediction error processing. Consistent with the results of animal studies, we show that a weighted genetic risk score computed from the number of GABRB2 rs1816072 A alleles (associated with increased expression of the GABAA receptor beta 2 subunit gene) and the number of ErbB4 rs7598440 T alleles (associated with increased GABA concentration) predicts optimal prediction error processing during aversive classical conditioning with both visual (Experiment 1, N = 90; p = .010) and auditory (Experiment 2; N = 92; p = .031) unconditioned stimuli. Our finding that optimal processing of aversive prediction errors is reduced in individuals genetically predisposed towards decreased GABA neurotransmission suggests a potential mechanism linking GABA and anxiety. Specifically, reduced GABA signalling via GABA(A) receptors could result in aberrant learning from aversive experiences and vulnerability to anxiety disorders.

J	Kalfaoglu, C; Stafford, T; Milne, E				Kalfaoglu, Cigir; Stafford, Tom; Milne, Elizabeth			Frontal Theta Band Oscillations Predict Error Correction and Posterror Slowing in Typing	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-HUMAN PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE			English	Article						theta; ERN; error awareness; hierarchical control; typing	BRAIN POTENTIALS; CINGULATE CORTEX; NEURAL SYSTEM; EEG DYNAMICS; PERFORMANCE; CONFLICT; MECHANISMS; TIME; AWARENESS; RECOGNITION	Performance errors are associated with robust behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) effects. However, there is a debate about the nature of the relationship between these effects and implicit versus explicit error awareness. Our aim was to study the relationship between error related electrophysiological effects, such as spectral perturbations in fronto-medial theta band oscillations (FMT), and error awareness in typing. Typing has an advantage as an experimental paradigm in that detected errors are quickly and habitually signaled by the participant using backspace, allowing separation of detected from undetected errors without interruption in behavior. Typing is thought to be controlled hierarchically via inner and outer loops, which rely on different sources for error detection. Touch-typist participants were asked to copy-type 100 sentences as EEG was recorded in the absence of visual feedback. Continuous EEG data were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA). Time-frequency and ERP analyses were applied to emergent independent components. The results show that single-trial FMT parameters and error related negativity (ERN) amplitude predict overt, adaptive posterror actions such as error correction via backspace; and, posterror slowing, reflecting implicit error awareness. In addition, we found that those uncorrected errors which were slowed down the most were also the ones associated with a high level of FMT activity. Our results as a whole show that FMT are related to neural mechanisms involved in explicit awareness of errors, and input from inner loop is sufficient for error correction in typing. Public Significance Statement We investigated the patterns of brain activity associated with errors and error-correction during skilled typing. This is interesting because it tests how theories of action and error-monitoring apply in a domain where actions are made extremely rapidly (up to 10 keys per second). Electroencephalography (EEG) allows us to identify signature changes which have previously been associated with error-related processes in the brain. We showed that 2 of these signature patterns, the "error related negativity" (ERN) and "fronto-medial theta band oscillations" (FMT), both predict whether a typist is likely to notice and correct an error they make, as well as predicting how much typing slows down after an uncorrected error. The results support the idea-which has been contested-that the ERN reflects our explicit recognition that we have made a mistake.

A central, yet not examined aspect to understand possible deficits in flexible behaviour in ASD relates (i) to the role of working memory and (ii) to neurophysiological mechanisms underlying behavioural modulations.Methods: We analysed behavioural and neurophysiological (EEG) correlates of cognitive flexibility using a task-switching paradigm with and without working memory load in adolescents with ASD and typically developing controls (TD).Results: Adolescents with ASD versus TD show similar performance in task switching with no memory load, indicating that pure' cognitive flexibility is not in deficit in adolescent ASD. However performance during task repetition decreases with increasing memory load. Neurophysiological data reflect the pattern of behavioural effects, showing modulations in P2 and P3 event-related potentials.Conclusions: Working memory demands affect repetitive behaviour while processes of cognitive flexibility are unaffected. Effects emerge due to deficits in preparatory attentional processes and deficits in task rule activation, organisation and implementation of task sets when repetitive behaviour is concerned. It may be speculated that the habitual response mode in ASD (i.e. repetitive behaviour) is particularly vulnerable to additional demands on executive control processes.

Methods: Twenty mTBI patients with mTBI and 20 healthy controls underwent the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and a cued continuous performance task (AX-CPT). Neuropsychological, behavioral, and electroencephalogram (EEG) data were collected and analyzed. Results: There were significant differences between the mTBI group and the control group in their MMSE total scores, attention, and calculation, but there were no significant differences in orientation, memory, recall, and verbal scores. There were significant differences between the mTBI group and the control group in hitting the number, reaction time, and the number of errors of omission, but there were no significant differences in the number of false errors. The amplitude of Go-N2 and Nogo-N2 was significantly smaller for the mTBI group than that for the control group. The amplitude of Go-P3 was significantly smaller for the mTBI group than that for the control group, but not for the amplitude of Nogo-P3. The Go-ERS were significantly less for the mTBI group than for the control group during the 0-200 ms after the stimulus onset. The Go-ERD and Nogo-ERD were significantly less for the mTBI group than for the control group during the 600-1,000 ms after the stimulus onset. The Go-ERS were significantly less for the mTBI group than for the control group during the 200-400ms after the stimulus onset. There were no significant differences in the Nogo-ERS and Nogo-ERD/ERS between the mTBI group and the control group. Conclusion: Patients with mTBI exhibited impairments in sustained attention and conflict monitoring, while response inhibition may have been spared.

This EEG study aimed to investigate whether aspects of phonetic perception are affected by the experience of tinnitus. We examined a sample of individuals with chronic, subjective tinnitus (n = 30, age range 30-50 yrs.), who underwent behavioural screening (standard tinnitus questionnaires) and comprehensive audiometric testing that covered peripheral and central hearing abilities (pure tone audiometry, suprathreshold audiometry (frequency selectivity and temporal compression), and speech in noise performance). In addition, participants performed a phoneme discrimination task embedded in an active oddball paradigm, while auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) were recorded. In particular, we aimed to investigate if reported speech difficulties in chronic tinnitus trace back to deficits in more elementary speech processes such as phonetic processing. Furthermore, we explored whether central hearing loss and tinnitus' psychometric profile may account for deficiencies in speech perception. The analysis of behavioural and audiometric data showed indications of mild to moderate symptoms of tinnitus distress when peripheral hearing loss was not in evidence. Nevertheless, tinnitus distress was negatively related to speech in noise performance which may be indicative of a lack of inhibitory competence. We further observed an effect of tinnitus distress on phoneme discrimination. More precisely, higher tinnitus distress was associated with higher accuracy and longer reaction times, while the effect on reaction times was mediated by the individual N2 ERP peak amplitudes. Our results suggest that tinnitus clearly interacts with the central auditory system in that responsiveness to salient input changes as a function of tinnitus-related distress, irrespective of peripheral hearing loss. Akin to individuals with higher psychological stress, persons with increased tinnitus-related distress demonstrate higher sensitivity during auditory processing. Taken together, we interpret our findings in light of a Bayesian approach (Sedley et al., 2016). According to this view, tinnitus distress-related factors (e.g., attention, stress) influence the excitability of the central auditory system and this, in turn, affects the sensory precision of inflowing auditory input, including spoken language.

This study investigates whether they also show differences in movement related cortical potentials (MRCP). Methods: SCI paraplegic patients with no CNP (n = 8), with CNP in their lower limbs (n = 8), and healthy control subjects (n = 10) took part in the study. EEG clustering involved independent component analysis, equivalent current dipole fitting, and Measure Projection to define cortical domains that have functional modularity during the motor imagery task. Results: Three domains were identified: limbic system, sensory-motor cortex and visual cortex. The MRCP difference between the groups of SCI with and without CNP was reflected in a domain located in the limbic system, while the difference between SCI patients and control subjects was in the sensorimotor domain. Differences in MRCP morphology between patients and healthy controls were visible for both paralysed and non paralysed limbs. Conclusion: SCI but not CNP affects the movement preparation, and both SCI and CNP affect sensory processes. Significance: Rehabilitation strategies of SCI patients based on MRCP should take into account the presence of CNP. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Spatial filters have been widely used to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of EEG for BCI classification problems, but their applications in BCI regression problems have been very limited. This paper proposes two common spatial pattern (CSP) filters for EEG-based regression problems in BCI, which are extended from the CSP filter for classification, by using fuzzy sets. Experimental results on EEG-based response speed estimation from a large-scale study, which collected 143 sessions of sustained-attention psychomotor vigilance task data from 17 subjects during a 5-month period, demonstrate that the two proposed spatial filters can significantly increase the EEG signal quality. When used in LASSO and k-nearest neighbors regression for user response speed estimation, the spatial filters can reduce the root-mean-square estimation error by 10.02-19.77%, and at the same time increase the correlation to the true response speed by 19.39-86.47%.

However, recent studies have convincingly demonstrated that nonsinusoidal oscillations produce serious biases in state of the art CFC metrics. Although most of studies treat nonsinusoidal waves as a nuisance or just ignore them, fortunately some scientists are starting to exploit their neurophysiological relevance opening new research vistas with critical implications.

The aim of the study was to neurophysiologically analyse the central emotion processing in children with DUI. Method: In 20 children with DUI (mean age 8.1 years, 55 % male) and 20 controls (mean age 9.1 years, 75 % male) visual event- related potentials (ERPs) were recorded after presenting emotionally valent (80 neutral, 40 positive, and 40 negative) pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) as an oddball- paradigm. All children received a full organic and psychiatric assessment. Results: Children with DUI did not differ signifi cantly from controls regarding responses to emotional pictures in the frontal, central, and parietal regions and in the time intervals 250- 450 ms, 450- 650 ms, and 650- 850 ms after stimulus onset. The patient group had more psychological symptoms and psychiatric comorbidities than the control group. Conclusions: EEG responses to emotional stimuli are not altered in children with DUI. Central emotion processing does not play a major role in DUI. Further research, including a larger sample size, a more homogeneous patient group (regarding subtype of DUI) or brain imaging techniques, could reveal more about the central processing in DUI.

In such a BCI paradigm, event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the alpha and beta bands extracted from EEG recorded over the primary sensorimotor area (SM1) is often used, since ERD has been suggested to be associated with an increase of corticospinal excitability. Recently, we demonstrated a novel online lock-in amplifier (LIA) algorithm to estimate the amplitude modulation of motor-related SM1 ERD. With this algorithm, the delay time, accuracy, and stability to estimate motor-related SM1 ERD were significantly improved compared with the conventional fast Fourier transformation (FFT) algorithm. These technical improvements to extract an ERD trace imply a potential advantage for a better trace of the excitatory status of the SM1 in a BCI context. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the precision of LIA-based ERD tracking for estimation of corticospinal excitability using a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigm.MethodsThe motor evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by single-pulse TMS over the primary motor cortex depending on the magnitudes of SM1 ERD (i.e., 35% and 70%) extracted by the online LIA or FFT algorithm were monitored during a motor imagery task of wrist extension in 17 healthy participants. Then, the peak-to-peak amplitudes of MEPs and their variabilities were assessed to investigate the precision of the algorithms.ResultsWe found greater MEP amplitude evoked by single-pulse TMS triggered by motor imagery-related alpha SM1 ERD than at rest. This enhancement was associated with the magnitude of ERD in both FFT and LIA algorithms. Moreover, we found that the variabilities of peak-to-peak MEP amplitudes at 35% and 70% ERDs calculated by the novel online LIA algorithm were smaller than those extracted using the conventional FFT algorithm.ConclusionsThe present study demonstrated that the calculation of motor imagery-related SM1 ERDs using the novel online LIA algorithm led to a more precise estimation of corticospinal excitability than when the ordinary FFT-based algorithm was used.

It is an integration of manpower, sensor, networks, intelligence, command and control solutions. This research work is intended to create a reference library on threat signature using cognitive technology which will enhance the intelligence for CIBMS to reduce the human effort using cognitive science through Brain Computer Interface (BCI) application. The system proposes to use an Electroencephalogram (EEG) cap to monitor the operators brain signals when operator see any abnormal activity across border area and then records the exact video frame when the observer detects a threat. The combination of cognitive algorithm and EEG filtering not only reduces false alarms, it also helps operators to detect signs of threats that would be overlooked, such as flying birds, swaying branches or non threat object according the action recognition. This research aims to suggest a better optimization technique on P300 brain signals and build an operational library of threat signature which can be used for future automated surveillance system with more accuracy.

A 21 electrode EEG signal was recorded in a 10-20 standard system from 50 healthy and ADHD adult subjects. After the basic pre-processing steps (band-pass and notch filtering, re-referencing and baseline rejection) Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to diminish the remaining EOG artifact. Then, event-related potentials were calculated using the time locked epochs of the cleaned signal. Afterwards, P300 morphological features such as peak amplitude and latency, were extracted and then the statistical process was carried out, to determine if the peak amplitudes and latencies have significant difference among healthy and ADHD subjects and in different inter-stimulus-intervals (ISIs). Our results show that as ISI gets longer, the difference in P300 latency between ADHD and healthy subjects gets bolder, statistical analysis and p-value confirm these results. Also, further statistic analysis is performed to figure out the effect of ISI variations in latency and peak amplitude of P300 in every subject; longer ISI leads to an increase in the latency of P300 in ADHD subjects.

Yet the extent to which early visual processing influences later processing in distributed face processing networks, and the top-down modulation of such bottom-up effects, remains unclear. We used simultaneous EEG-fMRI to investigate cortical activity that showed unique covariation with ERP components of face processing (C1, P1, N170, P3), while manipulating sustained attention and transient cognitive conflict employing an emotional face-word Stroop task. ERP markers of visual processing within 100 ms after stimulus onset showed covariation with brain activation in precuneous, posterior cingulate gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus and frontal operculum, and a left lateral parietal-occipital cluster, illustrating the impact of early stage processing on higherorder mechanisms. Crucially, this covariation depended on sustained attentional focus and was absent for incongruent trials, suggesting flexible top-down gating of bottom-up processing.

Some researchers considered the N170 to be independent of emotion, whereas a recent study has shown the opposite view. In the current study, electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings while responding to facial pictures with emotion were utilized to investigate whether the N170 was modulated by emotion. We found that there was a significant difference between ERP trials with positive and negative emotions of around 170 ms at the occipitotemporal electrodes (i.e., N170). Then, we further proposed the application of the single-trial N170 as a feature for the classification of facial emotion, which could avoid the fact that ERPs were obtained by averaging most of the time while ignoring the trial-to-trial variation. In order to find an optimal classifier for emotional classification with single-trial N170 as a feature, three types of classifiers, namely, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), L1-regularized logistic regression (L1LR), and support vector machine with radial basis function (RBF-SVM), were comparatively investigated. The results showed that the single-trial N170 could be used as a classification feature to successfully distinguish positive emotion from negative emotion. L1-regularized logistic regression classifiers showed a good generalization, whereas LDA showed a relatively poor generalization. Moreover, when compared with L1LR, the RBF-SVM required more time to optimize the parameters during the classification, which became an obstacle while applying it to the online operating system of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). The findings suggested that face-related N170 could be affected by facial expression and that the single-trial N170 could be a biomarker used to monitor the emotional states of subjects for the BCI domain.

To this end, we set up an ecological paradigm using the eye fixation-related potentials (EFRP) technique, in which participants freely moved their eyes to process short paragraphs, while their electroencephalography (EEG) activity was recorded in synchronization with their EM. A general linear model was used to estimate at best EFRP, taking account of the overlap between adjacent potentials, and more precisely with the potential elicited at text onset, as well as saccadic potentials. Our results showed that EM patterns were top-down modulated by different task demands. More interestingly, in both tasks, we observed slow-wave potentials that gradually increased across the first eye fixations. These slow waves were larger in the RD task than in the RM task, specifically over the left hemisphere. These results suggest that the decision-making process during reading in the RD task engendered a greater memory load in working memory than that generated in a classic reading task. The significance of these findings is discussed in the light of recent theories and models of working memory processing.

As AD affects brain regions implicated in both working memory and repetition effects, the neural basis of this discrepancy is poorly understood. We hypothesized that the posterior repetition effect could account for this discrepancy due to the milder effects of AD at visual cortex. Method: Participants with early AD, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy controls performed a working memory task with superimposed repetition effects while electroencephalography was collected to identify possible neural mechanisms of preserved repetition effects. Results: Participants with AD showed preserved behavioral repetition effects and a change in the posterior repetition effect.

One hypothesis is that low-probability prosodic or lexical content is perceived as prominent due to the surprisal and high information value associated with the stimulus. However, the existing behavioral studies have used stimulus manipulations that follow or violate typical linguistic patterns present in the listeners' native language, i.e., assuming that the listeners have already established a model for acceptable prosodic patterns in the language. In the present study, we investigated whether prosodic expectations and the resulting subjective impression of prominence is affected by brief statistical adaptation to suprasegmental acoustic features in speech, also in the case where the prosodic patterns do not necessarily follow language-typical marking for prominence. We first exposed listeners to five minutes of speech with uneven distributions of falling and rising fundamental frequency (F0) trajectories on sentence-final words, and then tested their judgments of prominence on a set of new utterances. The results show that the probability of the F0 trajectory affects the perception of prominence, a less frequent F0 trajectory making a word more prominent independently of the absolute direction of F0 change. In the second part of the study, we conducted EEG-measurements on a set of new subjects listening to similar utterances with predominantly rising or falling F0 on sentence-final words. Analysis of the resulting event-related potentials (ERP) reveals a significant difference in N200 and N400 ERP-component amplitudes between standard and deviant prosody, again independently of the F0 direction and the underlying lexical content. Since N400 has earlier been associated with semantic processing of stimuli, this suggests that listeners implicitly track probabilities at the suprasegmental level and that predictability of a prosodic pattern during a word has an impact to the semantic processing of the word. Overall, the study suggests that prosodic markers for prominence are at least partially driven by the statistical structure of recently perceived speech, and therefore prominence perception could be based on statistical learning mechanisms similar to those observed in early word learning, but in this case operating at the level of suprasegmental acoustic features.

The research was based on an experiment consisting of six intervals ensuring various cognitive load level of arithmetic tasks. The paper describes in details the analysis process including signal pre-processing with artifact correction, feature extraction and outlier detection. Statistical verification of EEG band differences, response time and error rate in intervals was realised. Statistical correlations were found between EEG features and response time, however, the correlation strength increased inside the groups of intervals of similar cognitive workload level. Evoked related potentials were also analysed and their results confirmed the statistical outcomes.

Yet, the neurophysiological and functional neuroanatomical structures associated with adverse effects of cognitive control are poorly understood. We used an extreme group approach to compare individuals who exhibit adverse effects of cognitive control to individuals who do not by combining event-related potentials (ERPs), source localization, time-frequency analysis and network analysis methods. While neurophysiological correlates of cognitive control (i.e. N2, N450, theta power and theta-mediated neuronal network efficiency) and task-set updating (P3) both reflect control demands and implicit information processing, differences in the degree of adverse cognitive control effects are associated with two independent neural mechanisms: Individuals, who show adverse behavioral effects of cognitive control, show reduced small-world properties and thus reduced efficiency in theta-modulated networks when they fail to effectively process implicit information. In contrast to this, individuals who do not display adverse control effects show enhanced task-set updating mechanism when effectively processing implicit information, which is reflected by the P3 ERP component and associated with the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ, BA 40) and medial frontal gyrus (MFG; BA 8). These findings suggest that implicit S-R contingencies, which benefit response selection without cognitive control, are always picked up', but may fail to be integrated with task representations to guide response selection. This provides evidence for a neurophysiological and functional neuroanatomical dual-process account of adverse cognitive control effects.

J	Schneider, D; Bonmassar, C; Hickey, C				Schneider, Daniel; Bonmassar, Claudia; Hickey, Clayton			Motivation and short-term memory in visual search: Attention's accelerator revisited	CORTEX			English	Article						Attention; Reward; Short-term memory; Long-term memory; CDA	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; WORKING-MEMORY; REWARD ASSOCIATIONS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; REPRESENTATIONS; COMPONENT; N2PC; EEG	A cue indicating the possibility of cash reward will cause participants to perform memory based visual search more efficiently. A recent study has suggested that this performance benefit might reflect the use of multiple memory systems: when needed, participants may maintain the to-be-remembered object in both long-term and short-term visual memory, with this redundancy benefitting target identification during search (Reinhart, McClenahan & Woodman, 2016). Here we test this compelling hypothesis. We had participants complete a memory-based visual search task involving a reward cue that either preceded presentation of the to-be-remembered target (pre-cue) or followed it (retro-cue). Following earlier work, we tracked memory representation using two components of the event-related potential (ERP): the contralateral delay activity (CDA), reflecting short-term visual memory, and the anterior P170, reflecting long-term storage. We additionally tracked attentional preparation and deployment in the contingent negative variation (CNV) and N2pc, respectively. Results show that only the reward pre-cue impacted our ERP indices of memory. However, both types of cue elicited a robust CNV, reflecting an influence on task preparation, both had equivalent impact on deployment of attention to the target, as indexed in the N2pc, and both had equivalent impact on visual search behavior. Reward prospect thus has an influence on memory-guided visual search, but this does not appear to be necessarily mediated by a change in the visual memory representations indexed by CDA. Our results demonstrate that the impact of motivation on search is not a simple product of improved memory for target templates. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Method: Thirty-two children were assigned to either the higher PA group (HP) (n = 16) or lower PA group (LP) (n = 16) based on their amount of PA as measured by an accelerometer. Working memory was measured by the delayed-matching test, with concurrent recordings of event-related potentials including the P3 and the positive slow wave (PSW) components. Results: Data analysis controlling for the effects of potential confounders found that the HP group had higher response accuracy in both task conditions relative to the LP group. For reaction times (RT), the HP group showed shorter RT than the LP group in the delayed condition. Furthermore, the HP group had similar P3 amplitudes across task conditions, whereas amplitudes in the delayed condition were smaller than that in the non-delayed condition in the LP group. In addition, the HP group also showed larger PSW amplitudes than the LP group. Supplementary partial correlations analysis indicated negative correlations between levels of PA with RT in both task conditions, and positive correlations with P3 amplitude and PSW amplitude in the delayed condition. Conclusions: Children with higher levels of PA, while controlling for individual differences in intelligence and fitness-related factors, have better working memory as assessed by both behavioral and neuroelectric measures.

In this manuscript, we consider factors that may affect the design of a hybrid brain- computer interface (BCI). We combine neural correlates of natural movements and interaction error-related potentials (ErrP) to perform a 3D reaching task, focusing on the impact that such factors have on the evoked ErrP signatures and in their classification. Approach. Users attempted to control a 3D virtual interface that simulated their own hand, to reach and grasp two different objects. Three factors of interest were modulated during the experimentation: (1) execution speed of the grasping, (2) type of grasping and (3) mental strategy (motor imagery or real motion) used to produce motor commands. Thirteen healthy subjects carried out the protocol. The peaks and latencies of the ErrP were analyzed for the different factors as well as the classification performance. Main results. ErrP are evoked for erroneous commands decoded from neural correlates of natural movements. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) analyses revealed that latency and magnitude of the most characteristic ErrP peaks were significantly influenced by the speed at which the grasping was executed, but not the type of grasp. This resulted in an greater accuracy of single-trial decoding of errors for fast movements (75.65%) compared to slow ones (68.99%). Significance. Understanding the effects of combining paradigms is a first step to design hybrid BCI that optimize decoding accuracy and can be deployed in motor substitution and neuro-rehabilitation applications.

However, no review has yet examined its role in depression by integrating conceptual and quantitative findings across functional MRI (fMRI) and EEG methodologies. The authors quantified these effects, with an emphasis on development. Method: A total of 38 fMRI and 12 EEG studies were entered into fMRI and EEG meta-analyses. fMRI studies primarily examined reward anticipation and reward feedback. These were analyzed using the activation likelihood estimation method. EEG studies involved mainly the feedback-related negativity (FRN) event-related potential, and these studies were analyzed using random-effects meta-analysis of the association between FRN and depression. Results: Analysis of fMRI studies revealed significantly reduced striatal activation in depressed compared with healthy individuals during reward feedback. When region-of-interest analyses were included, reduced activation was also observed in reward anticipation, an effect that was stronger in individuals under age 18. FRN was also significantly reduced in depression, with pronounced effects in individuals under age 18. In longitudinal studies, reduced striatal activation in fMRI and blunted FRN in EEG were found to precede the onset of depression in adolescents. Conclusions: Taken together, the findings show consistent neural aberrations during reward processing in depression, namely, reduced striatal signal during feedback and blunted FRN. These aberrations may underlie the pathogenesis of depression and have important implications for development of new treatments.

He was in a serious condition and had limited consciousness. Therefore, the doctor informed the patient's wife about the possibility of sudden death. The patient heard this information and remembered it, which was one of the main causes of the development of PTSD. On the basis of previous research amplitudes of P3 ERP, components elicited in the cued GO/NOGO tasks have been chosen as the candidate for PTSD neuromarkers. Case study: A 44-year-old patient had a major ischemic brain stroke while sizeable atherosclerotic plaque causing critical stenosis of the internal carotid artery in Angio-CT was discovered. The patient was urgently operated on using CEA. After the operation he had the opportunity to see the removed plaque which had been the cause of his stroke. Despite the positive postoperative recovery, half a year later, the patient began to complain of flashbacks, anxiety, trouble in falling and staying asleep, difficulty in concentration, a loss of interest. For the diagnosis of PTSD we used Checklist Specific for a stressor (PCL-S). Additionally we used Checklist according to the Diagnostic Statistical Manual-5 (DSM-5) classification, and the patient met the PTSD criteria. The cognitive profile of the patient was measured with the use of the Wechsler Memory Test - Ill (WMS-III). Subsequently, the patient participated in the cued GO/NOGO task (Kropotov, 2009) with a recording 19-channel EEG. The P3 GO and NOGO waves in this task were found to be significantly smaller at p<0.01 in comparison to a group of healthy control subjects of the same age (N=23) taken from the Human Brain Institute (HBI) normative database (httos://www.hbimed.com/) . The pattern of this neuromarker in our patient corresponds to the ERPs pattern found in PTSD patients. Conclusions: The ERPs in a GO/NOGO task can be used in the assessment of the functional brain changes induced by chronic PTSD.

Structural and physiological changes, such as hippocampal sclerosis, are often present in TLE patients. The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of intra-arterial infusion of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) in adults with medically refractory mesial TLE (MTLE) and unilateral hippocampal sclerosis (HS). We enrolled 20 patients who had been diagnosed with MTLE-HS and were refractory to medical treatment. All patients underwent a neurological evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging with hippocampal volumetry, video-electroencephalography (EEG) with ictal recording, and a neuropsychological test battery focusing on verbal and nonverbal memory domains. After bone marrow aspiration and subsequent cell preparation, the BMMC were infused by selective posterior cerebral artery catheterization. Patients were followed for 6months. Safety of the procedure, seizure frequency, neuropsychological evaluation, EEG variables, routine brain magnetic resonance imaging and hippocampal volumetry were considered measurements of outcome. Any serious intercurrent clinical event or adverse effects related to the procedure were reported. No additional lesions and no significant hippocampal volumetric changes were observed. EEG recordings showed a decrease in theta activity and spike density. At 6months, eight patients (40%) were seizure free. A significant increase in the memory scores over time was observed. The BMMC autologous transplant for the treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy is feasible and safe. The seizure control achieved in this novel study supports the therapeutic potential of stem cell transplants in MTLE-HS patients. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Using Mismatch Negativity to Investigate the Pathophysiology of Substance Use Disorders and Comorbid Psychosis	CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						substance use disorder; mismatch negativity; event-related potential; biomarker; psychosis	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY SENSORY MEMORY; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; ACUTE NICOTINE; CANNABIS USE; ABSTINENT ALCOHOLICS; SCHIZOPHRENIC-PATIENTS; 1ST-EPISODE PSYCHOSIS; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE	Substance use disorders (SUDs) have a devastating impact on society and place a heavy burden on health care systems. Given that alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use have the highest prevalence, further understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of these SUDs is crucial. Electroencephalography is an inexpensive, temporally superior, and translatable technique which enables investigation of the pathobiology of SUDs through the evaluation of various event-related potential components, including mismatch negativity (MMN). The goals of this review were to investigate the effects of acute and chronic alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use on MMN among nonpsychiatric populations and patients with comorbid psychosis. A literature search was performed using the database PubMed, and 36 articles met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. We found a pattern of attenuation of MMN amplitude among patients with alcoholism across acute and chronic alcohol use, and this dysregulation was not heritable. Reports were limited, and results were mixed on the effects of acute and chronic tobacco and cannabis use on MMN. Reports on comorbid SUDs and psychosis were even fewer, and also presented mixed findings. These preliminary results suggest that MMN deficits may be associated with SUDs, specifically alcohol use disorder, and serve as a possible biomarker for treating these common disorders.

Nevertheless, the link between the intricate cognitive activity of the biological brain and the learning scheme of ANNs is still unclear and under-explored. Therefore, in this study we aim to preliminarily examine the association between these two parts and provide some explanations and interpretations on the memory-related characteristics associated with neural network topologies and internal connections by modeling the EEG/ERP brain activities with echo state network (ESN)-like architecture. Vector autoregressive (VAR) is adopted for parameter training. The experimental results partially verify the role of network connection pattern and synaptic strength in the memory representation of ANNs.

First study is aimed at extraction of information from EEG to recognize which brain regions are active using spectral fingerprinting. It is based on forward and inverse modeling of electric potentials measured by sensors placed on the scalp, and computing power spectra from different brain locations. Reliable recognition of specific brain activity using EEG may lead to better diagnostic and therapeutic methods, and various new ways of building brain-computer interfaces. In the second study, infant EEG data collected at our BabyLAB were used to derive Event-Related Potentials (ERPs), in an oddball paradigm with two types of deviant stimuli (easy and hard) and one standard stimuli. Tensor decomposition of these signals, conforming to non-negative Canonical Polyadic decomposition (NCPD) model and non-negative Tucker decomposition (NTD), is used to characterize differences in processing these stimuli. Multi-domain temporal, spectral, time-frequency representation (TFR) and spatial information features are simultaneously analyzed for more reliable representation of the underlying source of brain activity. Results show right-side asymmetry for 5-frequency (Hz) theta band and may be due to the dynamical process of expectancy and surprise, corresponding to deviant detection reflected in the mismatch response.

J	Wahbeh, H; Sagher, A; Back, W; Pundhir, P; Travis, F				Wahbeh, Helane; Sagher, Amira; Back, Wallis; Pundhir, Pooja; Travis, Frederick			A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF TRANSCENDENT STATES ACROSS MEDITATION AND CONTEMPLATIVE TRADITIONS	EXPLORE-THE JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND HEALING			English	Review						transcendent states; meditation; contemplative traditions; psychophysiology	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; MYSTICAL EXPERIENCE; EEG ACTIVITY; MINDFULNESS; INCREASES; ATTENTION; PATTERNS; SUSPENSION; BOUNDARIES; PSILOCYBIN	Background: Across cultures and throughout history, transcendent states achieved through meditative practices have been reported. The practices to attain transcendent states vary from transcendental meditation to yoga to contemplative prayer, to other various forms of sitting meditation. While these transcendent states are ascribed many different terms, those who experience them describe a similar unitive, ineffable state of consciousness. Despite the common description, few studies have systematically examined transcendent states during meditation. Objectives: The objectives of this systematic review were to: 1) characterize studies evaluating transcendent states associated with meditation in any tradition; 2) qualitatively describe physiological and phenomenological outcomes collected during transcendent states and; 3) evaluate the quality of these studies using the Quality Assessment Tool. Methods: Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, AltHealthWatch, AMED, and the Institute of Noetic Science Meditation Library were searched for relevant papers in any language. Included studies required adult participants and the collection of outcomes before, during, or after a reported transcendent state associated with meditation. Results: Twenty-five studies with a total of 672 combined participants were included in the final review. Participants were mostly male (61%; average age 39 +/- 11 years) with 12.7 +/- 6.6 (median 12.6; range 2-40) average years of meditation practice. A variety of meditation traditions were represented: (Buddhist; Christian; Mixed (practitioners from multiple traditions); Vedic: Transcendental Meditation and Yoga). The mean quality score was 67 +/- 13 (100 highest score possible). Subjective phenomenology and the objective outcomes of electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography, electromyography, electrooculogram, event-related potentials, functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalography, respiration, and skin conductance and response were measured. Transcendent states were most consistently associated with slowed breathing, respiratory suspension, reduced muscle activity and EEG alpha blocking with external stimuli, and increased EEG alpha power, EEG coherence, and functional neural connectivity. The transcendent state is described as being in a state of relaxed wakefulness in a phenomenologically different space-time. Heterogeneity between studies precluded any formal meta-analysis and thus, conclusions about outcomes are qualitative and preliminary. Conclusions: Future research is warranted into transcendent states during meditation using more refined phenomenological tools and consistent methods and outcome evaluation.

Each partner is then seated in front of a screen in one of two adjacent rooms. These rooms are separated by a glass window through which participants communicate to maintain feelings of togetherness while being fitted with the EEG cap. After checking for adequate EEG signals, the glass is covered by a curtain to prevent visual communication. Then, partners must be silent but are instructed to try to feel in the presence of their partner during the entire experiment. Just before it starts, participants are told that each of them will be presented with one image at a time and that these images will occur at the same time for both of them on their own screen. They are also instructed that, for each trial, the simultaneous images will always be different. However, unbeknownst to them, trials are randomized: only half of them are consistent with this instruction and actually include two different images. These trials form the DSC, that is, the different-stimuli condition. The other half of the trials are inconsistent with the instruction. They include two identical images and form the ISC (identical-stimuli condition). After the experiment, participants are sorted into two groups: those who reported that they felt in the presence of their partner during the majority of the trials and those who reported they did not. The impact of the stimulus processing of the partner is found by subtracting the mean voltages of the ERPs of the ISC (inconsistent with the instructions) from the ERPs of the DSC (consistent with the instructions) in at least two time windows (TWs): firstly, in the 75 to 150 ms TW, where the absolute values of these subtractions are greater, especially at right frontal sites, in those who felt in the presence of their partner than in those who did not; secondly, in the LPP time window (i.e., from 650 to 950 ms post onset), where ERPs are significantly less positive in the DSC than in the ISC in those in whom the raw results of the early (75-150ms) subtractions are negative.

Other analytical approaches draw on bivariate methods which evaluate connectivity between two EEG channels. Despite the fact that spatial mapping of combined results of power and connectivity analyses may be used to study the dynamics of neuronal activation patterns, they are normally evaluated separately as different phenomena. Here we show the evaluation of dynamic changes in linear correlation after cognitive stimulation together with changes in power levels in the same channel pairs. Our results demonstrate the temporal evolution of synchronization patterns across the whole brain with a focus on the anatomical structure of the hippocampus. We observed a pattern of local and distant synchrony during cognitive processing, occurring 500 ms after stimulus onset in approximately 1% of all channel pairs. We hypothesize that evaluation of changes in connectivity, together with dynamic changes in power levels, can help identify dominant structures in the process of mental activity after a certain type of cognitive task. This can possibly lead to better understanding of synchronization processes at the neuronal and systemic level. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the involvement of subcortical regions is not well understood. Here we present simultaneous recordings of cortical and subcortical event-related potentials (ERPs) to different pure tones in patients undergoing surgery for deep brain stimulation (DBS). These patients had externalized electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), the ventrolateral posterior thalamus (VLp) or the globus pallidus internus (GPi). Subcortical and cortical ERPs were analyzed upon presentation of one frequent non-target stimulus and two infrequent stimuli, either being a target or a distractor stimulus. The results revealed that amplitudes of scalp-recorded P3 and subcortical late attention-modulated responses (AMR) were largest upon presentation of target stimuli compared with distractor stimuli. This suggests that thalamic and basal ganglia regions are sensitive to behaviorally relevant auditory events. Comparison of the subcortical structures showed that responses in VLp have shorter latency than in GPi and STN. Further, the subcortical responses in VLp and STN emerged significantly prior to the cortical P3 response. Our findings point to higher-order cognitive functions already at a subcortical level. Auditory events are categorized as behaviorally relevant in subcortical loops involving basal ganglia and thalamic regions. This label is then distributed to cortical regions by ascending projections.

However, most of the networks, even the event-related ones, are highly heterogeneous due to spurious interactions, which bring challenges to revealing the change patterns of interactive information in the complex dynamic process. In this paper, we propose a network entropy (NE) method to measure connectivity uncertainty of FCGB sequences to alleviate the spurious interaction problem in dynamic network analysis to realize associations with different events during a complex cognitive task. The proposed dynamic analysis approach calculated the adjacency matrices from ongoing electroencephalpgram (EEG) in a sliding time-window to form the FCGB sequences. The probability distribution of Shannon entropy was replaced by the connection sequence distribution to measure the uncertainty of FCGB constituting NE. Without averaging, we used time frequency transform of the NE of FCGB sequences to analyze the event-related changes in oscillatory activity in the single-trial traces during the complex cognitive process of driving. Finally, the results of a verification experiment showed that the NE of the FCGB sequences has a certain time-locked performance for different events related to driver fatigue in a prolonged driving task. The time errors between the extracted time of high-power NE and the recorded time of event occurrence were distributed within the range [-30 s, 30 s] and 90.1% of the time errors were distributed within the range [-10 s, 10 s]. The high correlation (r = 0.99997, p < 0.001) between the timing characteristics of the two types of signals indicates that the NE can reflect the actual dynamic interaction states of brain. Thus, the method may have potential implications for cognitive studies and for the detection of physiological states.

This research employed stacked autoencoders which is based on many autoencoders and a classifier that is regularly a Softmax. This deep structure, decrease the dimension of the data and eventually, the reduced features of the last autoencoder are passed to the Softmax classifier. Subsequently, the parameters of the network would be ameliorated through a fine-tuning phase. Chebyshev Type I, is employed for filtering the EEG signals and using them as an input to the deep neural network. Hyperparameters such as the number of neurons and layers are attained empirically. Therefore, the final structure of the proposed network is 420-210-100-50-20-10-2. To analyze the suggested structure, the second dataset of the third BCI Competition is employed. According to the results, this approach can willingly enhance the character recognition in the BCI speller systems. Thus, the best accuracy percentage according to this research, in an average manner, is 91.5% of both A and B subjects. Consequently, according to the achievements, this method can be comparable to the other state-of-the-art algorithms and, therefore, can improve the recognition rate in the BCI industry.

This has been taken as evidence for greater affect misattribution. However, no study so far has combined an experimental manipulation of the depth of prime processing with the benefits of ERPs. Forty-seven participants made like/dislike responses about Korean ideographs following 800-ms affective prime words while 64-channel EEG was recorded. In a randomized within-subject design, three levels of working-memory load were applied specifically during prime processing. Affective priming was significant for all loads and even tended to decrease over loads, although efficiency of the load manipulation was confirmed by reduced amplitudes of posterior attention-sensitive prime ERPs. Moreover, ERPs revealed greater explicit affective discrimination of the prime words as load increased, with strongest valence effects on central/centroparietal N400 and on the parietal/parietooccipital late positive complex under high load. This suggests that (a) participants by default tried to inhibit the processing of the prime's affect, and (b) inhibition more often failed under cognitive load, thus causing emotional breakthrough that resulted in a binding of affect to the prime and, hence, reduced affect misattribution to the target. As a correlate of affective priming in the target ERP, medial-frontal negativity, a well-established marker of (low) stimulus value, increased with increasing negative affect of the prime. Findings support implicit prime-target affect transfer as a major source of affective priming, but also point to the role of strategic top-down processes.

However, very little is known about the neural processes behind these phenomena (particularly in terms of their generality vs. specificity and their time-course). Here, we used the configural superiority effect as a way to define "emergence" and "emergent features" operationally, employing an approach that can isolate different emergent features and compare them on a common scale. By assessing well-established event related potentials in a HD-EEG system, we found that the critical processes behind configural superiority and superadditive Gestalt phenomena are present in the window between 100 and 200 ms after stimulus onset and that these effects seem to be driven by specific attentional selection mechanisms. Also, some emergent features seem to be differentially processed in different brain hemispheres. These results shed new light on the issues of the generality vs. specificity of the neural correlates of different Gestalt principles, the hemispheric asymmetries in the processing of hierarchical image structure and the role of the N1 ERP component in reflecting feature selective mechanisms.

Two separate but similar procedures were carried out: one using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the other using electroencephalography based source localization. In both experiments, sessions of passive viewing of neutral pictures were preceded by either a negative or positive mood induction. In response to neutral stimuli, we observed higher activation of visual areas after positive mood induction and lower activations in medial prefrontal and right frontotemporal regions after negative mood induction. We conclude that in relatively safe laboratory conditions, after being exposed to negative emotional content, automatic processes of affective control are recruited by the prefrontal cortex. This results in attenuation of processing of incoming stimuli, as the stimuli do not carry salient information with respect to bottom-up or top-down processes.

Mid-frontal theta activity is diminished during cognitive control in Parkinson's disease	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						EEG; Theta; Cognitive control; Parkinson's disease; Error	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EEG ALPHA; DOPAMINE; PERFORMANCE; OSCILLATIONS; HABITUATION; HUMANS; ONLINE	Mid-frontal theta activity underlies cognitive control. These 4-8 Hz rhythms are modulated by cortical dopamine and can be abnormal in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we investigated mid-frontal theta deficits in PD patients during a task explicitly involving cognitive control. We collected scalp EEG from high-performing PD patients and demographically matched controls during performance of a modified Simon reaction-time task. This task involves cognitive control to adjudicate response conflict and error-related adjustments. Task performance of PD patients was indistinguishable from controls, but PD patients had less mid-frontal theta modulations around cues and responses. Critically, PD patients had attenuated mid-frontal theta activity specifically associated with response conflict and post-error processing. These signals were unaffected by medication or motor scores. Post-error mid-frontal theta activity was correlated with disease duration. Classification of control vs. PD from these data resulted in a specificity of 69% and a sensitivity of 72%. These findings help define the scope of mid-frontal theta aberrations during cognitive control in PD, and may provide insight into the nature of PD related cognitive dysfunction.

J	Justen, C; Herbert, C				Justen, Christoph; Herbert, Cornelia			The spatio-temporal dynamics of deviance and target detection in the passive and active auditory oddball paradigm: a sLORETA study	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; Source localization; N1; Mismatch negativity; MMN; P3; Attention; Salience; Attention networks	LATERAL OCCIPITAL COMPLEX; RESOLUTION ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; MASS UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; INVOLUNTARY ATTENTION; CORTICAL GENERATORS; EXECUTIVE CONTROL	Background: Numerous studies have investigated the neural underpinnings of passive and active deviance and target detection in the well-known auditory oddball paradigm by means of event-related potentials (ERPs) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The present auditory oddball study investigates the spatio-temporal dynamics of passive versus active deviance and target detection by analyzing amplitude modulations of early and late ERPs while at the same time exploring the neural sources underling this modulation with standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA). Methods: A 64-channel EEG was recorded from twelve healthy right-handed participants while listening to'standards' and 'deviants' (500 vs. 1000 Hz pure tones) during a passive (block 1) and an active (block 2) listening condition. During passive listening, participants had to simply listen to the tones. During active listening they had to attend and press a key in response to the deviant tones. Results: Passive and active listening elicited an N1 component, a mismatch negativity (MMN) as difference potential (whose amplitudes were temporally overlapping with the N1) and a P3 component. N1/MMN and P3 amplitudes were significantly more pronounced for deviants as compared to standards during both listening conditions. Active listening augmented P3 modulation to deviants significantly compared to passive listening, whereas deviance detection as indexed by N1/MMN modulation was unaffected by the task. During passive listening, sLORETA contrasts (deviants >standards) revealed significant activations in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the lingual gyri bilaterally (N1/MMN) as well as in the left and right insulae (P3). During active listening, significant activations were found for the N1/MMN in the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and for the P3 in multiple cortical regions (e.g., precuneus). Discussion: The results provide evidence for the hypothesis that passive as well as active deviance and target detection elicit cortical activations in spatially distributed brain regions and neural networks including the ventral attention network (VAN), dorsal attention network (DAN) and salience network (SN). Based on the temporal activation of the neural sources underlying ERP modulations, a neurophysiological model of passive and active deviance and target detection is proposed which can be tested in future studies.

Memory is formed by the interaction of various brain functions at the item and task level. Revealing individual and combined effects of item-and task-related processes on retrieving episodic memory is an unsolved problem because of limitations in existing neuroimaging techniques. To investigate these issues, we analyze fast and slow optical signals measured from a custom-built continuous wave functional near-infrared spectroscopy (CW-fNIRS) system. Approach. In our work, we visually encode the words to the subjects and let them recall the words after a short rest. The hemodynamic responses evoked by the episodic memory are compared with those evoked by the semantic memory in retrieval blocks. In the fast optical signal, we compare the effects of old and new items (previously seen and not seen) to investigate the item-related process in episodic memory. The Kalman filter is simultaneously applied to slow and fast optical signals in different time windows. Main results. A significant task-related HbR decrease was observed in the episodic memory retrieval blocks. Mean amplitude and peak latency of a fast optical signal are dependent upon item types and reaction time, respectively. Moreover, task-related hemodynamic and item-related fast optical responses are correlated in the right prefrontal cortex. Significance. We demonstrate that episodic memory is retrieved from the right frontal area by a functional connectivity between the maintained mental state through retrieval and item-related transient activity. To the best of our knowledge, this demonstration of functional NIRS research is the first to examine the relationship between item-and task-related memory processes in the prefrontal area using single modality.

Determinants of neural responses to disparity in natural scenes	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						disparity; natural scenes; individual differences	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; IMAGE STATISTICS; DEPTH-PERCEPTION; SENSITIVITY; STEREOPSIS; TEXTURE; PHASE; STEREOACUITY; STEREOGRAMS	We studied disparity-evoked responses in natural scenes using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) in an event-related design. Thirty natural scenes that mainly included outdoor settings with trees and buildings were used. Twenty-four subjects viewed a series of trials composed of sequential two-alternative temporal forced-choice presentation of two different versions (two-dimensional [2D] vs. three-dimensional [3D]) of the same scene interleaved by a scrambled image with the same power spectrum. Scenes were viewed orthostereoscopically at 3 m through a pair of shutter glasses. After each trial, participants indicated with a key press which version of the scene was 3D. Performance on the discrimination was >90%. Participants who were more accurate also tended to respond faster; scenes that were reported more accurately as 3D also led to faster reaction times. We compared visual evoked potentials elicited by scrambled, 2D, and 3D scenes using reliable component analysis to reduce dimensionality. The disparity-evoked response to natural scene stimuli, measured from the difference potential between 2D and 3D scenes, comprised a sustained relative negativity in the dominant response component. The magnitude of the disparity-specific response was correlated with the observer's stereoacuity. Scenes with more homogeneous depth maps also tended to elicit large disparity-specific responses. Finally, the magnitude of the disparity-specific response was correlated with the magnitude of the differential response between scrambled and 2D scenes, suggesting that monocular higher-order scene statistics modulate disparity-specific responses.

The task co-representation account assumes that the joint Simon effect is the product of a vicarious representation of the co-actor's task. In contrast, recent studies show that even (non-human) event-producing objects could elicit a Simon effect in an individual go/no-go Simon task arguing in favor of the referential coding account. For the human-induced Simon effect, a modulation of the P300 component in Electroencephalography (EEG) is typically considered as a neural indicator of the joint Simon effect and task co-representation. Showing that the object-induced Simon effects also modulates the P300 would lead to a re-evaluation of the interpretation of the P300 in individual go/no-go and joint Simon task contexts. To do so, the present study conceptually replicated Experiment 1 from Dolk et al. (2013a) adding EEG recordings and an experimenter controlling the EEG computer to test whether a modulation of the P300 can also be elicited by adding a Japanese waving cat to the task context. Subjects performed an individual go/no-go Simon task with or without a cat placed next to them. Results show an overall Simon effect regardless of the cat's presence and no modulatory influence of the cat on the P300 (Experiment 1), even when conceivably interfering context factors are diminished (Experiment 2). These findings may suggest that the presence of a spatially aligned experimenter in the laboratory may produce an overall Simon effect overwriting a possible modulation of the Japanese waving cat.

The key component of our approach is to create a comprehensive 3-D EEG data structure including all trials and all participants maintaining the original order of recording. This allows straightforward access to subsets of the data based on any information available in a behavioral data structure matched with the EEG data (experimental conditions, but also performance indicators, such accuracy or RTs of single trials). In the present study we exploit this structure to compute linear mixed models (LMMs, using lmer in R) including random intercepts and slopes for items. This information can easily be read out from the matched behavioral data, whereas it might not be accessible in traditional ERP approaches without substantial effort. We further provide easily adaptable scripts for performing cluster-based permutation tests (as implemented in FieldTrip), as a more robust alternative to traditional omnibus ANOVAs. Our approach is particularly advantageous for data with parametric within-subject covariates (e.g., performance) and/or multiple complex stimuli (such as words, faces or objects) that vary in features affecting cognitive processes and ERPs (such as word frequency, salience or familiarity), which are sometimes hard to control experimentally or might themselves constitute variables of interest. The present dataset was recorded from 40 participants who performed a visual search task on previously unfamiliar objects, presented either visually intact or blurred. MATLAB as well as R scripts are provided that can be adapted to different datasets.

In the cognitive domain, proactive effects of conflicts have widely been studied; i.e. effects of conflicts in the n-1 trial on trial n. Yet, the neurophysiological processes and associated functional neuroanatomical structures underlying such proactive effects during emotional conflicts have not been investigated. This is done in the current study combining EEG recordings with signal decomposition methods and source localization approaches. We show that an emotional conflict in the n-1 trial differentially influences processing of positive and negative emotions in trial n, but not the processing of conflicts in trial n. The dual competition framework stresses the importance of dissociable 'perceptual' and 'response selection' or cognitive control levels for interactive effects of cognition and emotion. Only once these coding levels were isolated in the neurophysiological data, processes explaining the behavioral effects were detectable. The data show that there is not only a close correspondence between theoretical propositions of the dual competition framework and neurophysiological processes. Rather, processing levels conceptualized in the framework operate in overlapping time windows, but are implemented via distinct functional neuroanatomical structures; the precuneus (BA31) and the insula (BA13). It seems that decoding of information in the precuneus, as well as the integration of information during response selection in the insula is more difficult when confronted with angry facial emotions whenever cognitive control resources have been highly taxed by previous conflicts.

Previous reports have shown that when asked to memorize images, participants can recognize several thousands of visual objects in great details even with a single viewing of a few seconds per image. In this experiment, we tested recognition performance for natural scenes that participants saw for 20 ms only once (untrained group) or 22 times over many days (trained group) in an unrelated task. 400 images (200 previously viewed and 200 novel images) were flashed one at a time and participants were asked to lift their finger from a pad whenever they thought they had already seen the image (go/no-go paradigm). Compared to previous reports of excellent recognition performance with only single presentations of a few seconds, untrained participants were able to recognize only 64% of the 200 images they had seen few minutes before. On the other hand, trained participants, who had processed the flashed images (20 ms) several times, could correctly recognize 89% of them. EEG recordings confirmed these behavioral results. As early as 230 ms after stimulus onset, a significant event-related-potential (ERP) difference between familiar and new images was observed for the trained but not for the untrained group. These results show that briefly flashed unmasked scenes can be incidentally stored in long-term memory when repeated.

While these phenomena have been frequently investigated separately, studies involving both aspects and thus precisely investigating the postulated imbalance are rare. In this study, inhibition was investigated in an addiction-specific context and individual craving levels were also examined. MethodsThis study compared inhibition in alcohol-related and neutral contexts in patients with AUD and healthy controls, while also taking into account the individual amount of craving. All subjects performed a Go/NoGo task involving neutral and alcohol-related NoGo trials, while their brain activity was recorded using multichannel electroencephalography. The map strength and topography of the N2 and P3 components of the NoGo event-related potentials were compared between groups and contexts using whole-scalp randomization-based methods. The effects of interest were further investigated with sLORETA source analysis. ResultsFor the N2 component, the context by craving interaction was strong for map strength and map topography. The source analysis indicated that in subjects with high craving, alcohol-related context led to enhanced and prolonged activation in the posterior cingulate and premotor cortical areas. This interaction was specific for craving, but not for diagnostic classification. The amplitude of the P3 component was reduced in subjects with AUD, which replicated previous findings. ConclusionsIn subjects with strong craving, the conflict reflected in the NoGo-N2 was enhanced in the alcohol-related context. Such enhanced conflict probably makes the successful inhibition of the urge to drink in high-risk situations even more difficult for this subgroup of patients and should therefore be addressed in individualized treatment planning.

However, relatively little is known about how brain electrophysiological activities associated with target selection and distractor suppression are involved as they develop and become fully functional. The current study aimed to identify the neurophysiological bases of the development of covert spatial attention, focusing on electroencephalographic (EEG) markers of attentional selection (N2pc) and suppression (P-D). EEG data were collected from healthy young adults and typically developing children (9-15 years old) as they searched for a shape singleton target in either the absence or the presence of a salient-but-irrelevant color singleton distractor. The ERP results showed that a lateral shape target elicited a smaller N2pc in children compared with adults regardless of whether a distractor was present or not. Moreover, the target-elicited N2pc was always followed by a similar positivity in both age groups. Counterintuitively, a lateral salient-but-irrelevant distractor elicited a large P-D in children with low behavioral accuracy, whereas high-accuracy children exhibited a small and adult-like P-D. More importantly, we found no evidence for a correlation between the target-elicited N2pc and the distractor-elicited P-D in either age group. Our results provide neurophysiological evidence for the developmental differences between target selection and distractor suppression. Compared with adults, 9-15-year-old children deploy insufficient attentional selection resources to targets but use adult-like or even more attentional suppression resources to resist irrelevant distractors.

J	Fabi, S; Leuthold, H				Fabi, Sarah; Leuthold, Hartmut			Racial bias in empathy: Do we process dark- and fair-colored hands in pain differently? An EEG study	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Empathy; Pain; Racial bias; ERP; EEG oscillations; Information processing	MEASURING INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; IMPLICIT ASSOCIATION TEST; NEURAL RESPONSES; OTHERS PAIN; INTERGROUP RELATIONSHIPS; BETA-SYNCHRONIZATION; MOTOR CORTEX; BRAIN; RACE; INFORMATION	The aim of this study was to identify racial bias influences on empathic processing from early stimulus encoding, over categorization until late motor processing stages by comparing brain responses (electroencephalogram) to pictures of fair-and dark-colored hands in painful or neutral daily-life situations. Participants performed a pain judgment task and a skin color judgment task. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) substantiated former findings of automatic empathic influences on stimulus encoding, reflected by the early posterior negativity (EPN), and late controlled influences on the stimulus categorization, as reflected by the late posterior positivity (P3b). Concerning the racial bias in empathy (RBE) effect, more positive amplitudes in the 280-340 ms time window over frontocentral electrodes in the painful than the neutral condition for fair- but not dark-colored hands speak for an early influence of racial bias. This was further supported by correlations with empathic concern scores for fair- but not dark-colored stimuli. Additionally, P3b amplitude differences between fair- and dark-colored hands to painful stimuli increased with the implicit racial attitude of participants, suggesting that the categorization stage is not completely immune to racial bias. Regarding the motor processing stages, power change values in the upper beta-band (19-30 Hz) revealed for painful compared to neutral stimuli larger facilitation of sensorimotor activity before the response and larger inhibition after the response, independent of skin color. In conclusion, present findings speak for an influence of the RBE on early perceptual encoding but also on the late categorization stage that depends on the participant's implicit attitude towards racial outgroups.

Twenty-seven children (16 male, 11 female; mean age = 10.7 years) with CAPD and no symptoms of other developmental disorders, as well as 23 age-and sex-matched, typically developing children (TDC, 11 male, 13 female; mean age = 11.8 years) underwent examination of central auditory processes (CAPs) and QEEG evaluation consisting of two randomly presented blocks of "Eyes Open" (EO) or "Eyes Closed" (EC) recordings. Significant correlations between individual frequency band powers and CAP tests performance were found. The QEEG studies revealed that in CAPD relative to TDC there was no effect of decreased delta absolute power (1.5-4Hz) in EO compared to the EC condition. Furthermore, children with CAPD showed increased theta power (4-8Hz) in the frontal area, a tendency toward elevated theta power in EO block, and reduced low-frequency beta power (12-15Hz) in the bilateral occipital and the left temporo-occipital regions for both EO and EC conditions. Decreased middle-frequency beta power (15-18Hz) in children with CAPD was observed only in the EC block. The findings of the present study suggest that QEEG could be an adequate tool to discriminate children with CAPD from normally developing children. Correlation analysis shows relationship between the individual EEG resting frequency bands and the CAPs. Increased power of slow waves and decreased power of fast rhythms could indicate abnormal functioning (hypoarousal of the cortex and/or an immaturity) of brain areas not specialized in auditory information processing.

Listening in such situations is notoriously more difficult and more poorly encoded to long-term memory in older than in young adults (Tun, O'Kane, & Wingfield, 2002). Recent work by Payne, Rogers, Wingfield, and Sekuler (2017) in young adults demonstrated a neural correlate of auditory attention in the directed dichotic listening task (DDLT), where listeners attend to one ear while ignoring the other. Measured using electroencephalography, differences in alpha band power (8-14 Hz) between left and right hemisphere parietal regions mark the direction to which auditory attention is focused. Little prior research has been conducted on alpha power modulations in older adults, particularly with regard to auditory attention directed toward speech stimuli. In the current study, an older adult sample was administered the DDLT and delayed recognition procedures used by Payne et al. (2017). Compared to young adults, older adults showed reduced selective attention in the DDLT, evidenced by a higher rate of intrusions from the unattended ear. Moreover, older adults did not exhibit attention-related alpha modulation evidenced by young adults, nor did their event-related potentials (ERPs) to recognition probes differentiate between attended or unattended probes. Older adults' delayed recognition did not reveal a pattern of suppression of unattended items evidenced by young adults. These results serve as evidence for an age-related decline in selective auditory attention, potentially mediated by age-related decline in the ability to modulate alpha oscillations.

We tested this hypothesis at the neurophysiological level. Method: Dense array ERPs (event-related potentials) were obtained for 46 children with ADHD and 51 controls using the stop-signal task (SST). Early and late components were compared between groups. N2 and P3 components were localized with LAURA distributed linear inverse solution. Results: A success-related N1 modulation was only apparent in the ADHD group. N2 and P3 amplitudes were reduced in ADHD. During the successful inhibition N2, the ADHD group showed reduced activation in right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG), supplementary motor area (SMA), and right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), and during failed inhibition in the rIFG. During the successful inhibition P3, reduced activation was found in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and SMA. Conclusion: Impairments in the ventral attention network contribute to the psychopathology of ADHD and challenge the dominant view that ADHD is underpinned by impaired inhibitory control.

J	Wessel, JR				Wessel, Jan R.			Testing Multiple Psychological Processes for Common Neural Mechanisms Using EEG and Independent Component Analysis	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Independent component analysis; EEG; Common neural mechanisms; Blind source separation	BLIND SEPARATION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; ERROR; SYSTEM; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; TASK	Temporal independent component analysis (ICA) is applied to an electrophysiological signal mixture (such as an EEG recording) to disentangle the independent neural source signals-independent components-underlying said signal mixture. When applied to scalp EEG, ICA is most commonly used either as a pre-processing step (e.g., to isolate physiological processes from non-physiological artifacts), or as a data-reduction step (i.e., to focus on one specific neural process with increased signal-to-noise ratio). However, ICA can be used in an even more powerful way that fundamentally expands the inferential utility of scalp EEG. The core assumption of EEG-ICA-namely, that individual independent components represent separable neural processes-can be leveraged to derive the following inferential logic: If a specific independent component shows activity related to multiple psychological processes within the same dataset (e.g., elicited by different experimental events), it follows that those psychological processes involve a common, non-separable neural mechanism. As such, this logic allows testing a class of hypotheses that is beyond the reach of regular EEG analyses techniques, thereby crucially increasing the inferential utility of the EEG. In the current article, this logic will be referred to as the 'common independent process identification' (CIPI) approach. This article aims to provide a tutorial into the application of this powerful approach, targeted at researchers that have a basic understanding of standard EEG analysis. Furthermore, the article aims to exemplify the usage of CIPI by outlining recent studies that successfully applied this approach to test neural theories of mental functions.

Studies show that specific EEG signattu"es underpin the monitoring of observed erroneous actions (error-related negativity, error positivity, mid-frontal theta oscillations). However, the majority of studies on action observation used sequences of trials where erroneous actions were less frequent than correct actions. Therefore, it was not possible to disentangle whether the activation of the performance monitoring system was due to an error, as a violation of the intended goal, or to a surprise/novelty effect, associated with a rare and unexpected event. Combining EEG and immersive virtual reality (IVR-CAVE system), we recorded the neural signal of 25 young adults who observed, in first-person perspective, simple reach-to grasp actions performed by an avatar aiming for a glass. Importantly, the proportion of erroneous actions was higher than correct actions. Results showed that the observation of erroneous actions elicits the typical electrocortical signatures of error monitoring, and therefore the violation of the action goal is still perceived as a salient event. The observation of correct actions elicited stronger alpha suppression. This confirmed the role of the alpha-frequency band in the general orienting response to novel and infrequent stimuli. Our data provide novel evidence that an observed goal error (the action slip) triggers the activity of the performance-monitoring system even when erroneous actions, which are, typically, relevant events, occur more often than correct actions and thus are not salient because of their rarity. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Activation of the performance-monitoring system (PMS) is typically investigated when errors in a sequence are comparatively rare. However, whether the PMS is activated by errors per se or by their infrequency is not known. Combining EEG-virtual reality techniques, we found that observing frequent (70%) action errors performed by avatars elicits electrocortical error signatures suggesting that deviation from the prediction of how learned actions should correctly deploy, rather than its frequency, is coded in the PMS.

First, we aimed to evaluate whether short-duration affective states induced by negative and positive words can lead to increased error-monitoring activity relative to a neutral task condition. Second, we intended to determine whether such an enhancement is limited to words of specific valence or is a general response to arousing material. Third, we wanted to assess whether post-error brain activity is associated with incidental memory for negative and/or positive words. Participants performed an emotional stop-signal task that required response inhibition to negative, positive or neutral nouns while EEG was recorded. Immediately after the completion of the task, they were instructed to recall as many of the presented words as they could in an unexpected free recall test. We observed significantly greater brain activity in the error-positivity (Pe) time window in both negative and positive trials. The error-related negativity amplitudes were comparable in both the neutral and emotional arousing trials, regardless of their valence. Regarding behavior, increased processing of emotional words was reflected in better incidental recall. Importantly, the memory performance for negative words was positively correlated with the Pe amplitude, particularly in the negative condition. The source localization analysis revealed that the subsequent memory recall for negative words was associated with widespread bilateral brain activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and in the medial frontal gyrus, which was registered in the Pe time window during negative trials. The present study has several important conclusions. First, it indicates that the emotional enhancement of error monitoring, as reflected by the Pe amplitude, may be induced by stimuli with symbolic, ontogenetically learned emotional significance. Second, it indicates that the emotion-related enhancement of the Pe occurs across both negative and positive conditions, thus it is preferentially driven by the arousal content of an affective stimuli. Third, our findings suggest that enhanced error monitoring and facilitated recall of negative words may both reflect responsivity to negative events. More speculatively, they can also indicate that post-error activity of the medial prefrontal cortex may selectively support encoding for negative stimuli and contribute to their privileged access to memory.

While in some disciplines these innovations are commonplace leading to unique biomarker-guided experimental medicine trials, there are no such analogs in psychiatry. In this brief review, we will overview two unique biomarker-guided trial designs for future use in psychiatry: basket and umbrella trials. We will illustrate how such trials could be useful in psychiatry using schizophrenia as a candidate illness, the EEG measure mismatch negativity as the candidate biomarker, and cognitive impairment as the target disease dimension.

The cortical mechanisms involved in motor anticipation of palmar grasp movement and its association with post-stroke hand function remains unknown. Aims: To investigate the cognitive anticipation process during a palmar grasp task in subacute stroke survivors and to compare with healthy individuals. The association between cortical excitability and hand function was also explored. Methods: Twenty-five participants with hemiparesis within 1-6 months after first unilateral stroke were recruited. Twenty-five matched healthy individuals were recruited as control. Contingent negative variation (CNV) was measured using electroencephalography recordings (EEG). Event related potentials were elicited by cue triggered hand movement paradigm. CNV onset time and amplitude between pre-cue and before movement execution were recorded. Results: The differences in CNV onset time and peak amplitude were statistically significant between the subacute stroke and control groups, with patients showing earlier onset time with increased amplitudes. However, there was no statistically significant difference in CNV onset time and peak amplitude between lesioned and non-lesioned hemisphere in the subacute stroke group. Low to moderate linear associations were observed between cortical excitability and hand function. Conclusions: The earlier CNV onset time and higher peak amplitude observed in the subacute stroke group suggest increased brain computational demand during palmar grasp task. The lack of difference in CNV amplitude between the lesioned and non-lesioned hemisphere within the subacute stroke group may suggest that the non-lesioned hemisphere plays a role in the motor anticipatory process. The moderate correlations suggested that hand function may be associated with cortical processing of motor anticipation.

However, there is great interest in shifting the BCI trend toward applications aimed at healthy users. Although BCI operation depends on technological factors (i.e., EEG pattern classification algorithm) and human factors (i.e., how well the person can generate good quality EEG patterns), it is the latter that is least investigated. In order to control a motor imagery-based BCI, users need to learn to modulate their sensorimotor brain rhythms by practicing motor imagery using a classical training protocol with an abstract visual feedback. In this paper, we investigate a different BCI training protocol using a human-like android robot (Geminoid HI-2) to provide realistic visual feedback. The proposed training protocol addresses deficiencies of the classical approach and takes the advantage of body-abled user capabilities. Experimental results suggest that android feedback-based BCI training improves the modulation of sensorimotor rhythms during motor imagery task. Moreover, we discuss how the influence of body ownership transfer illusion toward the android might have an effect on the modulation of event-related desyn-chronization/synchronization activity.

Therefore, maintaining proper amount of cognitive workload is important to prevent unwanted errors caused by mental burden. This study aims 1) to compare the electrophysiological differences of the brain reacting on different amount of workload, and 2) to classify different workload. Ten healthy subjects were recruited for the study. Thirty-two channels was used to record electroencephalogram (EEG) while the participants were engaging to 1- and 3-back memory task. The results showed a significant difference of P300 latency in Pz electrode, where the source activation of right insular was decreased in right insular as the cognitive workload increased. Furthermore, the workload differences was able to distinguished with 5% error using only sensor-space features.

Existing models attribute this slowing to poor sensory processing, to attenuated rates of sensory evidence accumulation, or to increases in the amount of evidence required before committing to a decision (a higher decision threshold). However, studies have not isolated the effects of having more choices on sensory and decision-related processes from changes in task difficulty and divided attention. Here, we controlled task difficulty while independently manipulating the distribution of attention and the number of choices available to male and female human observers. We used EEG to measure steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) and a frontal late positive deflection (LPD), EEG markers of sensory and postsensory decision-related processes, respectively. We found that dividing attention decreased SSVEP and LPD amplitudes, consistent with dampened sensory responses and slower rates of evidence accumulation, respectively. In contrast, having more choices did not alter SSVEP amplitude and led to a larger LPD. These results suggest that having more options largely spares early sensory processing and slows down decision-making via a selective increase in decision thresholds.

Single Channel EEG Based Score Generation to Monitor the Severity and Progression of Mild Cognitive Impairment	2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRO/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (EIT)	International Conference on Electro Information Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)	MAY 03-05, 2018	Rochester, MI	IEEE				Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a preliminary stage of Dementia. MCI is determined by behavioral screening measures such as Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE). Therefore, monitoring the progression of MCI and predicting MoCA scores from objective physiological measures like the EEG is crucial as it will not only help to improve the mental healthcare of the aging population but also to reduce healthcare costs. In this study, we demonstrate a single channel EEG based MoCA score generation method, which is cost-effective and suitable for continuous patient monitoring in the longitudinal study. We collected scalp EEG data while subjects were stimulated with five auditory speech signals. We extracted 590 features from Event-Related Brain Potentials (ERPs), which included time and spectral domain characteristics of the response. The top 11 features, ranked by mutual information, were used for building regression models to generate MoCA scores of the subjects. Robustness of our model was tested using R-squared value, mean square error (MSE), residual's quantile plot, and cook's distance. The analysis shows R-squared=0.78 with MSE=1.63, and residual analysis suggests that the model is acceptable in terms of quantile plot, leverage, and Cook's distance. The outcomes indicate that single-channel based EEG can be used to estimate cognitive scores automatically for severity detection and progression monitoring, which will help us to efficaciously assess the mental health status of elderly people to improve the prognosis and rehabilitation of age related cognitive impairments.

P300 is among the most studied and robust electrophysiological components, but how different subcomponents of the P300 develop from childhood to adulthood and relate to structural properties of the cerebral cortex is not well understood. We investigated age-related differences in both early visual and P300 components, and how individual differences in these components are related to cortical structure in a cross-sectional sample of participants 8-19years (n=86). Participants completed a three-stimulus visual oddball task while high-density EEG was recorded. Cortical surface area and thickness were estimated from T1-weighted MRI. Group-level blind source separation of the EEG data identified two P300-like components, a fronto-central P300 and a parietal P300, as well as a component reflecting N1 and P2. Differences in activity across age were found for the parietal P300, N1 and P2, with the parietal P300 showing stronger activity for older participants, while N1 and P2 were stronger for younger participants. Stronger P300 components were positively associated with task performance, independently of age, while negative associations were found for P2 strength. Parietal P300 strength was age-independently associated with larger surface area in a region in left lateral inferior temporal cortex. We suggest that the age differences in component strength reflect development of attentional mechanisms, with increased brain responses to task-relevant stimuli representing an increasing ability to focus on relevant information and to respond accurately and efficiently.

Cortical excitability correlates with the event-related desynchronization during brain-computer interface control	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain state dependent brain stimulation; EEG; BCI; TMS; ERD; neurorehabilitation; motor evoked potentials	MOTOR IMAGERY; STROKE PATIENTS; EEG; REHABILITATION; NEUROPLASTICITY; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION; STIMULATION; RECOVERY; SYSTEM	Objective. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on motor control have been suggested as tools for stroke rehabilitation. Some initial successes have been achieved with this approach, however the mechanism by which they work is not yet fully understood. One possible part of this mechanism is a, previously suggested, relationship between the strength of the event-related desynchronization (ERD), a neural correlate of motor imagination and execution, and corticospinal excitability. Additionally, a key component of BCIs used in neurorehabilitation is the provision of visual feedback to positively reinforce attempts at motor control. However, the ability of visual feedback of the ERD to modulate the activity in the motor system has not been fully explored. Approach. We investigate these relationships via transcranial magnetic stimulation delivered at different moments in the ongoing ERD related to hand contraction and relaxation during BCI control of a visual feedback bar. Main results. We identify a significant relationship between ERD strength and corticospinal excitability, and find that our visual feedback does not affect corticospinal excitability. Significance. Our results imply that efforts to promote functional recovery in stroke by targeting increases in corticospinal excitability may be aided by accounting for the time course of the ERD.

However, the feedback delay attenuates the degree of motor learning and neural plasticity. New method: The present study aimed to shorten the delay time to estimate amplitude modulation of the motor-imagery-related alpha and beta SM1-ERD using a lock-in amplifier (LIA) algorithm. The delay time was evaluated by calculating the value of the maximal correlation coefficient (MCC) between the time series trace of ERDs extracted by the online LIA algorithm and those identified by an offline algorithm with the Hilbert transform (HT). Results: The MCC and delay values used to estimate the ERDs calculated by the LIA were 0.89 0.032 and 200+/-9.49 ms, respectively. Comparison with Existing Method(s): The delay time and MCC values were significantly improved compared with those calculated by the conventional fast Fourier transformation (FFT), continuous Wavelet transformation (CWT), and autoregressive (AR) algorithms. Moreover, the coefficients of variance of the delay time and MCC values across trials were significantly lower in the LIA compared with the FFT, CWT, and AR algorithms. Conclusions: These results indicate that the LIA improved the detection delay, accuracy, and stability for estimating amplitude modulation of motor-related SM1-ERD. This would be beneficial for BCI paradigms to facilitate neurorehabilitation in patients with motor deficits. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The impact of social exclusion on anticipatory attentional processing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Social exclusion; Event-related potential; Electroencephalography; Cyberball; P300	EMOTION REGULATION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; REJECTION SENSITIVITY; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; NEURAL RESPONSES; REWARD MAGNITUDE; BRAIN; OSTRACISM; ANXIETY; P300	The importance of understanding how we anticipate and prepare for social rejection is underscored by the mental and physical toll of continual social vigilance. In this study, we investigate the impact of social rejection on anticipatory attentional processes using the well-known Cyberball task, a paradigm in which participants engage in a game of catch with virtual avatars who after an initial period of fair-play (inclusion condition) then exclude the participant from the game (exclusion condition). The degree of anticipatory attention allocated by subjects towards the avatars was assessed by measuring P3b responses towards the avatars' preparatory actions (i.e. the phase preceding their exclusionary actions) using high density EEG. The results of the study show that relative to the inclusion, participants exhibit elevated levels of anticipatory attentional allocation towards the avatars during the exclusion block. This shift was however significantly moderated by participants' self-reported cognitive regulation tendencies. Participants with higher levels of self-reported cognitive reappraisal tendencies showed larger anticipatory P3b increases from the inclusion to exclusion block relative to participants with reduced levels of reappraisal tendencies. These results highlight the impact of social exclusion on anticipatory neural processing and the moderating role of cognitive reappraisal on these effects.

JOURNAL OF GAMBLING STUDIES			English	Article						Reward task; EEG; FRN; P300; Gambling	NEGATIVITY; MOVEMENT; PREVALENCE; POTENTIALS; MAGNITUDE; DOPAMINE; PEOPLE; CORTEX; P300; HAND	What if the brain's response to reward occurs even when there is no reward? Wouldn't that be a further concern for people prone to problem gambling and other forms of addiction, like those related to eating? Electroencephalography was employed to investigate this possibility using probabilistic feedback manipulations and measures of known event-related potentials (ERPs) related to reward processing. We tested the hypothesis-that reward-based ERPs would occur even in the absence of a tangible reward and when manipulations on expectation are implicit. The well-known P300 response potential was a key focus, and was assessed in non-gambling volunteer undergraduates on a task involving experimentally-manipulated probabilities of positive or negative feedback comprising three trial types-80, 50, or 20% positive feedback. A feedback stimulus (F1) followed a guess response between two possible outcomes (implicit win/loss), and then a second feedback stimulus (F2) was presented to confirm an alleged 'win' or 'loss' (explicit win/loss). Results revealed that amplitude of the P300 in F1-locked data (implicit manipulation) was larger (more positive) on average for feedback outcomes that were manipulated to be less likely than expected. The effect is pronounced after increased time on task (later trials), even though the majority of participants were not explicitly aware of our probability manipulations. For the explicit effects in F2-locked data, no meaningful or significant effects were observed. These findings point to the existence of proposed success-response mechanisms that operate not only explicitly but also with implicit manipulations that do not involve any direct indication of a win or loss, and are not associated with tangible rewards. Thus, there seems to be a non-explicit form of perception (we call 'implicit') associated with an internal experience of wins/losses (in the absence of actual rewards or losses) that can be measured in associated brain processes. The potential significance of these findings is discussed in terms of implications for problem gambling.	[Fielding, A.; Fu, Y.; Franz, E.

Electrophysiological approaches in the study of cognitive development outside the lab	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SINGLE-TRIAL; EEG; ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; ATTENTION; COMPONENT; ERP	The use of human neuroimaging technology provides knowledge about several emotional and cognitive processes at the neural level of organization. In particular, electroencephalographic (EEG) techniques allow researchers to explore high-temporal resolution of the neural activity that underlie the dynamics of cognitive processes. Although EEG research has been mostly applied in laboratory settings, recently a low-cost, portable EEG apparatus was released, which allows exploration of different emotional and cognitive processes during every-day activities. We compared a wide range of EEG measures using both a low-cost portable and a high-quality laboratory system. EEG recordings were done with both systems while participants performed an active task (Go/NoGo) and during their resting-state. Results showed similar waveforms in terms of morphology and amplitude of the ERPs, and comparable effects between conditions of the applied Go/NoGo paradigm. In addition, the contribution of each frequency to the entire EEG was not significantly different during resting-state, and fluctuations in amplitude of oscillations showed long-range temporal correlations. These results showed that low-cost, portable EEG technology can provide an alternative of enough quality for measuring brain activity outside a laboratory setting, which could contribute to the study of different populations in more ecological contexts.

Mismatch Negativity (MMN) is a change in the sensory event-related potential that occurs in response to deviation from an established pattern of stimulation. Patients with schizophrenia show a reduction in MMN that is positively associated with impaired cognition and poor functional outcome. This has led to interest in MMN as a potential clinical and pre-clinical biomarker of fundamental neural processes responsible for reduced functional outcome. To date, relatively few studies have sought to assess MMN in non-human primates or rodents. The validity of these studies will be reviewed using criteria used to identify true deviance detection based MMN responses in human subjects. Although MMN has been difficult to establish in pre-clinical models the weight of evidence suggests that non-human animals show true deviance based MMN. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The current study investigated the influence of two major modulating factors (emotional saliency, task difficulty) on behavioral and electrophysiological parameters underlying distractibility in ADHD. In addition, the attentional focus (indirect and direct processing of distractors) was examined. Thirty-six Action editor Kerstin Konrad adults with ADHD and 37 healthy controls completed two experimental tasks while electroencephalography (EEG) data was collected. Task 1 assessed indirect processing of emotional or neutral distractors during a perceptual judgment task with varying task difficulty. Task 2 measured direct processing of the emotional or neutral stimuli and required participants to rate the stimuli regarding valence and arousal. Results showed that adults with ADHD exhibited generally higher behavioral distractibility than healthy controls. Furthermore, the ADHD group exhibited an enhanced bottom-up processing [increased early posterior negativity (EPN) amplitudes] of distractors in trials with high task difficulty as well as enhanced top-down processing [increased late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes] in trials with low task difficulty. However, no group differences were evident in the neural processing of emotional content or between attentional focus conditions. These findings support the notion that distractibility in ADHD results from impairments to both top-down as well as bottom-up processes and underscore the importance of task difficulty as a modulating factor.

Unfortunately, the use of machine learning typically requires the collection of subject specific labelled data. This process is time-consuming and not productive from a user's point of view, as during calibration the user has to follow given instructions and cannot make own decisions. Only after calibration, the user is able to use the BCI freely. In this chapter, we describe how the supervised calibration process can be circumvented by unsupervised learning in which the decoder is trained while the user is utilising the system. We discuss three variations. First, expectation-maximisation (EM)-based training, which works wells empirically but can sometimes be unstable. Learning from label proportions (LLP)-based training, which is guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution, but learns more slowly. Third, a hybrid approach combining the stability of LLP with the speed of learning of EM in a highly efficient and effective approach that can readily replace supervised decoders for event-related potential BCI.

A distorted dyad (power chord) has a special role in heavy metal music due to its harmonics that create a major third interval, making it similar to amajor chord. We investigated how distortion affects cortical auditory processing of chords in musicians and nonmusicians. Electric guitar chords with or without distortion and with or without the interval of the major third (i.e., triads or dyads) were presented in an oddball design where one of them served as a repeating standard stimulus and others served as occasional deviants. This enabled the recording of event-related potentials (ERPs) of the electroencephalogram (EEG) related to deviance processing (the mismatch negativity MMN and the attention-related P3a component) in an ignore condition. MMN and P3a responses were elicited in most paradigms. Distorted chords in a non-distorted context only elicited early P3a responses. However, the power chord did not demonstrate a special role in the level of the ERPs. Earlier and larger MMN and P3a responses were elicited when distortion was modified compared to when only harmony (triad vs. dyad) was modified between standards and deviants. The MMN responses were largest when distortion and harmony deviated simultaneously. Musicians demonstrated larger P3a responses than nonmusicians. The results suggest mostly independent cortical auditory processing of distortion and harmony in Western individuals, and facilitated chord change processing in musicians compared to nonmusicians. While distortion has been used in heavy rock music for decades, this study is among the first ones to shed light on its cortical basis.

However, there is still no in-depth analysis of whether there are differences in the regulating effect of music with different characteristics on human psychology, which leads to the fact that current therapeutic schemes using the music to relieve tension are not targeted. In this context, this paper uses the method of EEG clinical trials to explore the role of differences in music rhythm and music mode in psychological regulation. By monitoring the variance of brainwaves of the subjects and the synchronic characteristics of brainwaves in different regions, the research proves that there are great differences in the psychological regulation effect of music with different characteristics: Compared to fast-rhythm music, the effect of slow-rhythm music in psychological regulation and relaxation is better. Compared with major music, the effect of minor music in psychological regulation and relaxation is better. The above conclusions can be well applied to the treatment of psychological disorder diseases such as anxiety disorder and depression, providing a reference for the targeted design of music therapeutic schemes.

Brain computer interface (BCI) is a combination of software and hardware communication protocols that allow brain to control external devices. Main purpose of BCI controlled external devices is to provide communication medium for disabled persons. Now these devices are considered as a new way to rehabilitate patients with impunities. There are certain potentials present in electroencephalogram(EEG) that correspond to specific event. Main issue is to detect such event related potentials online in such a low signal to noise ratio (SNR). In this paper we propose a method that will facilitate the concept of online processing by providing an efficient filtering implementation in a hardware friendly environment by switching to finite impulse response (FIR). Main focus of this research is to minimize latency and computational delay of preprocessing related to any BCI application. Four different finite impulse response (FIR) implementations along with large Laplacian filter are implemented in Xilinx System Generator. Efficiency of 25% is achieved in terms of reduced number of coefficients and multiplications which in turn reduce computational delays accordingly.

However, results on attentional modulation of ASSRs are inconclusive. The evaluation of large-scale effects of task-related modulation on ASSRs might give better estimation of the induced changes. The aim of the study was to test global field synchronization a reference-independent evaluation of the amount of phase-locking among all active regions at a given frequency during tasks differing in attentional demands to 40 Hz auditory stimulation. Twenty seven healthy young males participated in the EEG study with concurrent 40 Hz binaural click stimulation and three experimental tasks: 1) to count presented stimuli (focused attention); 2) to silently read a text (distraction); 3) to stay awake with closed eyes (resting). We showed that during auditory 40 Hz stimulation, the global field synchronization of the EEG increased as compared to the silent baseline period and the largest increase was observed when subjects counted stimuli or rested with closed eyes. Our results provide insights that depending on the method of assessment, the 40 Hz ASSR might be an indicator of both local and complex synchronization processes that are affected by the state (task performed or psychopathology) of the participants.

We have evaluated the effect of different oddball tasks in different time segments. We have also compared the brain FC between the resting state-task data and task-task data. The trials from oddball tasks were averaged to form grand-average event-related potential. Each epoch was divided into six segments with fixed time interval. Coherence was used to compute the pairwise connections between 10-20 electrodes and adjacency matrices were formed. The threshold of 0.9 was set to binarize the matrices and form undirected graphs. Graph parameters (node degree, network density, and betweenness centrality) were used to quantify the networks. Node degree within a brain lobe was summed to form a brain regional activation graph. Node betweenness centrality was used to study the dynamic changes of the hub nodes in different oddball tasks. Edge betweenness centrality was used to quantify the significant functional networks in different oddball tasks. Results show that 1) denser brain network was found in target with response (TR) case as compared with target with no response and no target no response cases especially over 3rd 4th and 5th time segments which are before and during P300 period. 2) Higher brain activity in terms of node degree is distributed over all brain regions for TR case than the other two cases. 3) It is also observed that the parietal node is significant for P300 response. 4) Interactions among parietal, central, and temporal regions are significant for motor response that is only observed for TR case. The present findings suggest that our methodology is able to identify differences in FC patterns elicited by different oddball tasks for different brain states in different time segments.

Considering the importance and the near-future development of noninvasive brain-machine interface (BMI) systems, this paper presents a comprehensive theoretical-experimental survey on the classification and evolutionary methods for BMI-based systems in which EEG signals are used. Approach. The paper is divided into two main parts. In the first part, a wide range of different types of the base and combinatorial classifiers including boosting and bagging classifiers and evolutionary algorithms are reviewed and investigated. In the second part, these classifiers and evolutionary algorithms are assessed and compared based on two types of relatively widely used BMI systems, sensory motor rhythm-BMI and event-related potentials-BMI. Moreover, in the second part, some of the improved evolutionary algorithms as well as bi-objective algorithms are experimentally assessed and compared. Main results. In this study two databases are used, and cross-validation accuracy (CVA) and stability to data volume (SDV) are considered as the evaluation criteria for the classifiers. According to the experimental results on both databases, regarding the base classifiers, linear discriminant analysis and support vector machines with respect to CVA evaluation metric, and naive Bayes with respect to SDV demonstrated the best performances. Among the combinatorial classifiers, four classifiers, Bagg-DT (bagging decision tree), LogitBoost, and GentleBoost with respect to CVA, and Bagging-LR (bagging logistic regression) and AdaBoost (adaptive boosting) with respect to SDV had the best performances. Finally, regarding the evolutionary algorithms, single-objective invasive weed optimization (IWO) and bi-objective nondominated sorting IWO algorithms demonstrated the best performances. Significance. We present a general survey on the base and the combinatorial classification methods for EEG signals (sensory motor rhythm and event-related potentials) as well as their optimization methods through the evolutionary algorithms. In addition, experimental and statistical significance tests are carried out to study the applicability and effectiveness of the reviewed methods.

Participants took a Raven's Progressive Matrices Test and performed on a mental rotation task presenting upright and rotated letter stimuli (60% 120 degrees or 180 degrees) in normal and mirror image requiring a response execution or inhibition depending on instructions. The performance results showed that the linear slope relating performance accuracy, but not speed, to the angular rotation of the stimuli was related to individual differences in fluid intelligence. For upright stimuli, P3 amplitude recorded at frontal and central areas was positively associated with fluid intelligence scores. The mental rotation process was related to a negative shift of the brain potential recorded over the parietal cortex. The linear function relating the amplitude of the rotation-related negativity to rotation angle was associated with fluid intelligence. The slope was more pronounced for high- relative to low-ability participants suggesting that the former flexibly adjust their expenditure of mental effort to the mental rotation demands while the latter ones are less proficient in doing so.

One measure of feedback processing, the feedback negativity (FN), is an ERP observed following the presentation of feedback. Findings detailing developmental changes in the FN have been mixed, possibly due to limitations in traditional ERP measurement methods. Recent work shows that both theta and delta frequency activity contribute to the FN; utilizing time-frequency methods to measure change in power and phase in these frequency bands may provide more accurate representation of feedback processing development in childhood and adolescence. We employ time-frequency power and intertrial phase synchrony measures, in addition to conventional time-domain ERP methods, to examine the development of feedback processing in the theta (4-7Hz) and delta (.1-3Hz) bands throughout adolescence. A sample of 54 female participants (8-17 years old) completed a gambling task while EEG was recorded. As expected, time-domain ERP amplitudes showed no association with age. In contrast, significant effects were observed for the time-frequency measures, with theta power decreasing with age and delta power increasing with age. For intertrial phase synchrony, delta synchrony increased with age, while age-related changes in theta synchrony differed for gains and losses. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of considering time-frequency dynamics when exploring how the processing of feedback develops through late childhood and adolescence. In particular, the role of delta band activity and theta synchrony appear central to understanding age-related changes in the neural response to feedback.	[Bowers, M. E.; Bernat, E. M.; Fox, N.

Findings from a recent study by Baumgarter et al. (this issue) add to this debate by providing a null replication of an influential study that reported that spatial attention can enhance feedforward information processing in human V1, as reflected in the amplitude of the C1 ERP component (Kelly, Gomez- Raminez, & Foxe, 2008). Here we discuss several factors, including analytic approach, experimental design, and motivational factors, that, once scientifically tested, may help resolve discrepancies in the current literature.

Although posterior asymmetries in the EEG, such as the contralateral delay activity (CDA), have been used to study the active storage of lateralized working memory representations, results on the relation of such asymmetric effects to retro-cue benefits remain inconclusive. We recorded EEG in a retro-cue working memory task with lateralized items and a continuous performance response. Following either a selective or neutral retro-cue, participants adjusted the orientation of a central memory probe to the cued item. Selective retro-cues elicited an early posterior contralateral negativity (PCN), anterior directing attention negativity (ADAN) and a later modulation of CDA indicating that active storage was concentrated on the cued information. By dividing all trials into three within-condition performance quantiles, we could further show that high working memory accuracy was associated with a sustained increase of the CDA effect following the retro-cue. These results suggest that focusing resources on the active storage of relevant representations is an important factor regarding retro-cue benefits in working memory tasks.

The ability to suppress tics has been proposed to ensure normal motor control in uncomplicated, adult patients. The aim of the present study was to characterize cortical processes of motor inhibition and performance monitoring using event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by a visual stop signal task. Methods: 15 TS patients and 15 matched healthy controls performed a stop signal task while multi-channel EEG were recorded. Results: The behavioral results revealed no significant differences in inhibitory capabilities between groups. The latency of the P3 was discriminative of inhibition success, with shorter latencies for successful inhibition in both groups. P3 amplitude was not altered by inhibition success, but significantly attenuated for TS patients. Furthermore, the amplitude of the error-related negativity (ERN) was elevated while the error positivity (PE) was diminished for TS patients. Conclusion: In the stop signal task performance is not altered in adult TS patients but ERPs related to motor inhibition and performance monitoring are altered suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms. Significance: The results support the hypothesis of compensatory cortical mechanisms to ensure sufficient motor performance. (C) 2018 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Mild Cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia may come along with the disease. New indicators are necessary for detecting patients that are likely to develop dementia. Electroencephalogram (EEG) Delta responses are one of the essential electrophysiological indicators that could show the cognitive decline. Many research in literature showed an increase of delta responses with the increased cognitive load. Furthermore, delta responses were decreased in MCI and Alzheimer disease in comparison to healthy controls during cognitive paradigms. There was no previous study that analyzed the delta responses in PD patients with cognitive deficits. The present study aims to fulfill this important gap. 32 patients with Parkinson's disease (12 of them were without any cognitive deficits, 10 of them were PD with MCI, and 10 of them were PD with dementia) and 16 healthy subjects were included in the study. Auditory simple stimuli and Auditory Oddball Paradigms were applied. The maximum amplitudes of each subject's delta response (0.5-3.5 Hz) in 0-600 ms were measured for each electrode and for each stimulation. There was a significant stimulation x group effect [F(df = 6; 88 = 3,21; p < 0.015; eta(2)(p) = 0.180], which showed that the difference between groups was specific to the stimulation. Patients with Parkinson's disease (including PD without cognitive deficit, PD with MCI, and PD with dementia) had reduced delta responses than healthy controls upon presentation of target stimulation (p < 0.05, for all comparisons). On the other hand, this was not the case for non-target and simple auditory stimulation. Furthermore, delta responses gradually decrease according to the cognitive impairment in patients with PD. Conclusion: The results of the present study showed that cognitive decline in PD could be represented with decreased event related delta responses during cognitive stimulations. Furthermore, the present study once more strengthens the hypothesis that decrease of delta oscillatory responses could be the candidate of a general electrophysiological indicator for cognitive impairment.

Stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) is known to affect evaluative priming in various sensory modalities. However, effects of SOA on odour priming of visual stimuli are not known. The present study aimed to analyse whether subjective and cortical activation changes during odour priming would vary as a function of SOA between odours and faces. Twenty-eight participants rated faces under pleasant, unpleasant, and no-odour conditions using visual analogue scales. In half of trials, faces appeared one-second after odour offset (SOA 1). In the other half of trials, faces appeared during the odour pulse (SOA 2). EEG was recorded continuously using a 128-channel system, and event-related potentials (ERPs) to face stimuli were evaluated using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Faces presented during unpleasant-odour stimulation were rated significantly less pleasant than the same faces presented one-second after offset of the unpleasant odour. Scalp-time clusters in the late-positive-potential (LPP) time-range showed an interaction between odour and SOA effects, whereby activation was stronger for faces presented simultaneously with the unpleasant odour, compared to the same faces presented after odour offset. Our results highlight stronger unpleasant odour priming with simultaneous, compared to delayed, odour-face presentation. Such effects were represented in both behavioural and neural data. A greater cortical and subjective response during simultaneous presentation of faces and unpleasant odour may have an adaptive role, allowing for a prompt and focused behavioural reaction to a concurrent stimulus if an aversive odour would signal danger, or unwanted social interaction.

However, while semantic effects are well-investigated, little is known about how emotional contents shape different planning stages during language production. In two experiments we investigated emotional language production using electrophysiological measures of brain activity during overt speaking. In event related brain potentials, negative emotional contents were associated with augmented amplitudes of the late positive potential (LPP) over centro-parietal regions. Furthermore, performance was more error-prone, and we observed emotion-induced variances in the loudness of speaking. These findings are taken to reflect evaluations of the intrinsic value and potential social relevance and appropriateness of the utterance during self-monitoring and subsequent adjustments of articulatory processes. The present study demonstrates intimate-and thus far largely undescribed-relations between emotion, social communicative factors and language production at different levels of speech planning and articulation.

Spectral Subtraction Denoising Preprocessing Block to Improve Slow Cortical Potential Based Brain-Computer Interface	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Slow cortical potential; Signal denoising; Wavelet shrinkage; Spectral subtraction	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; ARTIFACTS; REMOVAL	The measured electroencephalographic (EEG) signals used in brain-computer interface (BCI) are usually contaminated with several additive random and physiological noise components. Even though several preprocessing strategies were proposed in the literature to extract useful EEG signal components for further processing and analysis, their performance is yet to meet practical needs to boost BCI applications performance. Of particular interest among those methods are the ones addressing random noise suppression that could help enhance the performance of low-cost BCI systems/headsets. A preprocessing block for signal denoising of slow cortical potential (SCP) that provides efficient noise removal and better classification accuracy is presented. This method is a variant of the spectral subtraction signal denoising whereby the noise power spectrum is estimated and removed adaptively. This method is applied to each EEG channel separately thus providing a preprocessing block that could be integrated with the existing spatial/temporal preprocessing methods. The impact of this method on classification accuracy is studied and compared to the conventional wavelet shrinkage method. The proposed method is verified using experimental data from the BCI competition II data set whereby a performance boost was obtained with the new preprocessing block. The improvement was quantitatively assessed using mean square error and mean absolute error measures and was also shown to be statistically significant. Moreover, spectral subtraction denoising is shown to have less computational complexity than wavelet shrinkage based methods. The new preprocessing block for SCP-based BCI signals based on spectral subtraction provides significant improvement in performance when added and offers an adaptive yet less computationally expensive alternative to existing methods such as wavelet shrinkage based denoising method. Also, given its independent channel processing, it shows potential for seamless integration into conventional processing chain for different BCI applications.

J	Haaf, M; Leicht, G; Curic, S; Mulert, C				Haaf, Moritz; Leicht, Gregor; Curic, Stjepan; Mulert, Christoph			Glutamatergic Schizophrenia - Biomarkers and Pharmacological Interventions within the Ketamine Model	CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Review						EEG; fMRI; ketamine; MEG; NMDA-receptor; schizophrenia	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; RESTING-STATE FMRI; NMDA ANTAGONIST MODEL; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; INDUCED DISRUPTION; BRAIN-FUNCTION; NEURAL BASIS; SYMPTOMS; NICOTINE	Background: The observation that N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists such as ketamine transiently induce schizophrenia-like positive, negative and cognitive symptoms has led to a paradigm shift from dopaminergic to glutamatergic dysfunction in pharmacological models of schizophrenia. NMDAR hypofunction can explain many schizophrenia symptoms directly due to excitatory-to-inhibitory (E/I) imbalance, but also dopaminergic dysfunction itself. However, so far no new drug targeting the NMDAR has been successfully approved. In the search for possible biomarkers it is interesting that ketamine-induced psychopathological changes in healthy participants were accompanied by altered electro-(EEG), magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed/Medline and Web of Knowledge databases (January 2006 to July 2017) to identify EEG/MEG and fMRI studies of the ketamine model of schizophrenia with human subjects. The search strategy identified 209 citations of which 46 articles met specified eligibility criteria. Results: In EEG/MEG studies, ketamine induced changes of event-related potentials, such as the P300 potential and the mismatch negativity, similar to alterations observed in schizophrenia patients. In fMRI studies, alterations of activation were observed in different brain regions, most prominently within the anterior cingulate cortex and limbic structures as well as task-relevant brain regions. These alterations were accompanied by changes in functional connectivity, indicating a balance shift of the underlying brain networks. Pharmacological treatments did alter ketamine-induced changes in EEG/MEG and fMRI studies to different extents. Conclusion: This review highlights the potential applicability of the ketamine model for schizophrenia drug development by offering the possibility to assess the effect of pharmacological agents on schizophrenia-like symptoms and to find relevant neurophysiological and neuroimaging biomarkers.

Emotion-related cognitive functions are difficult to detect in patients with DOC using motor response-based clinical assessment scales such as the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) because DOC patients have motor impairments and are unable to provide sufficient motor responses for emotion-related communication. In this study, we proposed an EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system for emotion recognition in patients with DOC. Eight patients with DOC (5 VS and 3 MCS) and eight healthy controls participated in the BCI-based experiment. During the experiment, two movie clips flashed (appearing and disappearing) eight times with a random interstimulus interval between flashes to evoke P300 potentials. The subjects were instructed to focus on the crying or laughing movie clip and to count the flashes of the corresponding movie clip cued by instruction. The BCI system performed online P300 detection to determine which movie clip the patients responsed to and presented the result as feedback. Three of the eight patients and all eight healthy controls achieved online accuracies based on P300 detection that were significantly greater than chance level. P300 potentials were observed in the EEG signals from the three patients. These results indicated the three patients had abilities of emotion recognition and command following. Through spectral analysis, common spatial pattern (CSP) and differential entropy (DE) features in the delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands were employed to classify the EEG signals during the crying and laughing movie clips. Two patients and all eight healthy controls achieved offline accuracies significantly greater than chance levels in the spectral analysis. Furthermore, stable topographic distribution patterns of CSP and DE features were observed in both the healthy subjects and these two patients. Our results suggest that cognitive experiments may be conducted using BCI systems in patients with DOC despite the inability of such patients to provide sufficient behavioral responses.

Semantic Features Reveal Different Networks During Word Processing: An EEG Source Localization Study	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						high-density EEG; source localization; semantic category representation; single word processing; linear mixed effect model	TIME-COURSE; FUNCTIONAL MRI; NEURAL REPRESENTATION; CONCEPTUAL KNOWLEDGE; REGRESSION-ANALYSIS; EMOTIONAL VALENCE; ABSTRACT WORDS; ERP EVIDENCE; SINGLE-WORD; CONCRETE	The neural principles behind semantic category representation are still under debate. Dominant theories mostly focus on distinguishing concrete from abstract concepts but, in such theories, divisions into categories of concrete concepts are more developed than for their abstract counterparts. An encompassing theory on semantic category representation could be within reach when charting the semantic attributes that are capable of describing both concept types. A good candidate are the three semantic dimensions defined by Osgood (potency, valence, arousal). However, to show to what extent they affect semantic processing, specific neuroimaging tools are required. Electroencephalography (EEG) is on par with the temporal resolution of cognitive behavior and source reconstruction. Using high-density set-ups, it is able to yield a spatial resolution in the scale of millimeters, sufficient to identify anatomical brain parcellations that could differentially contribute to semantic category representation. Cognitive neuroscientists traditionally focus on scalp domain analysis and turn to source reconstruction when an effect in the scalp domain has been detected. Traditional methods will potentially miss out on the fine-grained effects of semantic features as they are possibly obscured by the mixing of source activity due to volume conduction. For this reason, we have developed a mass-univariate analysis in the source domain using a mixed linear effect model. Our analyses reveal distinct networks of sources for different semantic features that are active during different stages of lexico-semantic processing of single words. With our method we identified differences in the spatio-temporal activation patterns of abstract and concrete words, high and low potency words, high and low valence words, and high and low arousal words, and in this way shed light on how word categories are represented in the brain.

However, they encompass a diverse range of usages, from typical to atypical, according to the context and the interpersonal relationships in the specific situation. The most frequent particle,-ne, is typically used after addressee-oriented propositions for information sharing, while another frequent particle,-yo, is typically used after addresser-oriented propositions to elicit a sense of strength. This study sheds light on individual differences among native speakers in flexibly understanding such linguistic markers based on their mentalizing ability (i.e., the ability to infer the mental states of others). Two experiments employing electroencephalography (EEG) consistently showed enhanced early posterior negativities (EPN) for atypical SFP usage compared to typical usage, especially when understanding-ne compared to -yo, in both an SFP appropriateness judgment task and a content comprehension task. Importantly, the amplitude of the EPN for atypical usages of-ne was significantly higher in participants with lower mentalizing ability than in those with a higher mentalizing ability. This effect plausibly reflects low-ability mentalizers' stronger sense of strangeness toward atypical-ne usage. While high-ability mentalizers may aptly perceive others' attitudes via their various usages of-ne, low-ability mentalizers seem to adopt a more stereotypical understanding. These results attest to the greater degree of difficulty low-ability mentalizers have in establishing a smooth regulation of interpersonal distance during social encounters.

This makes it difficult to trace subtle differences that occur in mid-sentence position. We apply an analysis based on multivariate temporal response functions to uncover subtle mid-sentence effects. This approach is based on a per-stimulus estimate of the response of the neural system to speech input. Analyzing EEG signals predicted on the basis of the response functions might then bring to light condition specific differences in the filtered signals. We validate this approach by means of an analysis of EEG signals recorded with isolated word stimuli. Then, we apply the validated method to the analysis of the responses to the same words in the middle of meaningful sentences.

To better understand the underlying mechanisms of these presumed WM deficits, we compared adults with ADHD to their peers on behavioral and neural indices of WM. We used a visuospatial change detection task with distractors which was designed to assess the brain's ability to effectively filter out distractors from WM, in addition to testing for effects of WM load. Twenty-seven unmedicated adults with ADHD were compared to 27 matched peers on event-related potential (ERP) measures of WM, i.e., the contralateral delay activity (CDA). Despite severe impairments in everyday life functioning, findings showed no difference in deficits in behavioral tests of working memory for adults with ADHD compared to their peers. Interestingly, there were differences in neural activity between individuals with ADHD and their peers showing that the CDA of individuals with ADHD did not distinguish between high, distractor, and low memory load conditions. These data suggest, in the face of comparable behavioral performance, a difference in neural processing efficiency, wherein the brains of individuals with ADHD may not be as selective in the allocation of neural resources to perform a WM task.

Source-reconstruction of the sensorimotor network from resting-state macaque electrocorticography	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							SPONTANEOUS OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; CORTICAL CORRELATION STRUCTURE; LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; HUMAN BRAIN; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SUBDURAL STRIP; MOTOR CORTEX; TIME-SERIES; MEG; EEG	The discovery of hemodynamic (BOLD-fMRI) resting-state networks (RSNs) has brought about a fundamental shift in our thinking about the role of intrinsic brain activity. The electrophysiological underpinnings of RSNs remain largely elusive and it has been shown only recently that electric cortical rhythms are organized into the same RSNs as hemodynamic signals. Most electrophysiological studies into RSNs use magnetoencephalography (MEG) or scalp electroencephalography (EEG), which limits the spatial resolution with which electrophysiological RSNs can be observed. Due to their close proximity to the cortical surface, electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings can potentially provide a more detailed picture of the functional organization of resting-state cortical rhythms, albeit at the expense of spatial coverage. In this study we propose using source-space spatial independent component analysis (spatial ICA) for identifying generators of resting-state cortical rhythms as recorded with ECoG and for reconstructing their functional connectivity. Network structure is assessed by two kinds of connectivity measures: instantaneous correlations between band-limited amplitude envelopes and oscillatory phase-locking. By simulating rhythmic cortical generators, we find that the reconstruction of oscillatory phase-locking is more challenging than that of amplitude correlations, particularly for low signal-to-noise levels. Specifically, phase-lags can both be over-and underestimated, which troubles the interpretation of lag-based connectivity measures. We illustrate the methodology on somatosensory beta rhythms recorded from a macaque monkey using ECoG. The methodology decomposes the resting-state sensorimotor network into three cortical generators, distributed across primary somatosensory and primary and higher-order motor areas. The generators display significant and reproducible amplitude correlations and phase-locking values with non-zero lags. Our findings illustrate the level of spatial detail attainable with source-projected ECoG and motivates wider use of the methodology for studying resting-state as well as event-related cortical dynamics in macaque and human.

EEG captures affective touch: CT-optimal touch and neural oscillations	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Affective touch; CT fibers; EEG; Neural oscillations	UNMYELINATED TACTILE AFFERENTS; EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; FRONTAL-MIDLINE THETA; MASSAGE THERAPY; PLEASANT TOUCH; FREQUENCY; ALPHA; ATTENTION; BAND; RESPONSES	Tactile interactions are of developmental importance to social and emotional interactions across species. In beginning to understand the affective component of tactile stimulation, research has begun to elucidate the neural mechanisms that underscore slow, affective touch. Here, we extended this emerging body of work and examined whether affective touch (C tactile [CT]-optimal speed), as compared to nonaffective touch (non-CT-optimal speed) and no touch conditions, modulated EEG oscillations. We report an attenuation in alpha and beta activity to affective and nonaffective touch relative to the no touch condition. Further, we found an attenuation in theta activity specific to the affective, as compared to the nonaffective touch and no touch conditions. Similar to theta, we also observed an attenuation of beta oscillations during the affective touch condition, although only in parietal scalp sites. Decreased activity in theta and parietal-beta ranges may reflect attentional-emotional regulatory mechanisms; however, future work is needed to provide insight into the potential neural coupling between theta and beta and their specific role in encoding slow, tactile stimulation.

Exploring the advantages of multiband fMRI with simultaneous EEG to investigate coupling between gamma frequency neural activity and the BOLD response in humans	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						EEG-fMRI; gamma-BOLD coupling; gradient artefacts; heating; multiband fMRI; multislice fMRI; motor gamma oscillations; safety	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SINGLE-TRIAL ANALYSIS; ARTIFACT CORRECTION; GRADIENT ARTIFACT; RESTING-STATE; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; BAND SYNCHRONIZATION; MOTOR CORTEX; WHOLE-BRAIN	We established an optimal combination of EEG recording during sparse multiband (MB) fMRI that preserves high-resolution, whole-brain fMRI coverage while enabling broad-band EEG recordings which are uncorrupted by MRI gradient artefacts (GAs). We first determined the safety of simultaneous EEG recording during MB fMRI. Application of MB factor=4 produced <1 degrees C peak heating of electrode/hardware during 20min of GE-EPI data acquisition. However, higher SAR sequences require specific safety testing, with greater heating observed using PCASL with MB factor=4. Heating was greatest in the electrocardiogram channel, likely due to it possessing longest lead length. We investigated the effect of MB factor on the temporal signal-to-noise ratio for a range of GE-EPI sequences (varying MB factor and temporal interval between slice acquisitions). We found that, for our experimental purpose, the optimal acquisition was achieved with MB factor=3, 3mm isotropic voxels, and 33 slices providing whole head coverage. This sequence afforded a 2.25s duration quiet period (without GAs) in every 3s TR. Using this sequence, we demonstrated the ability to record gamma frequency (55-80Hz) EEG oscillations, in response to right index finger abduction, that are usually obscured by GAs during continuous fMRI data acquisition. In this novel application of EEG-MB fMRI to a motor task, we observed a positive correlation between gamma and BOLD responses in bilateral motor regions. These findings support and extend previous work regarding coupling between neural and hemodynamic measures of brain activity in humans and showcase the utility of EEG-MB fMRI for future investigations.

The goal of this two-generation family study was to delineate behavioral and electrocortical endophenotypes of social anxiety disorder related to social evaluation. Nine families of patients with social anxiety disorder (their spouse and children, and siblings of these patients with spouse and children) performed a social judgment paradigm in which they believed to be evaluated by peers. For each peer, participants indicated their expectation about the evaluative outcome, after which they received social acceptance or rejection feedback. Task behavior, as well as the feedback-related EEG brain potentials (N1, FRN, P3) and theta power were tested as candidate endophenotypes based on two criteria: co-segregation with social anxiety disorder within families and heritability. Results indicated that reaction time for indicating acceptance-expectations might be a candidate behavioral endophenotype of social anxiety disorder, possibly reflecting increased uncertainty or self-focused attention and vigilance during the social judgment paradigm. N1 in response to expected rejection feedback and P3 in response to acceptance feedback might be candidate electrocortical endophenotypes of social anxiety disorder, although the heritability analyses did not remain significant after correcting for multiple tests. Increased N1 possibly reflects hypervigilance to socially threatening stimuli, and increased P3 might reflect that positive feedback is more important for, and/or less expected by, participants with social anxiety disorder. Finally, increased feedback-related negativity and theta power in response to unexpected rejection feedback compared to the other conditions co-segregated with social anxiety disorder, but these EEG measures were not heritable. The candidate endophenotypes might play a new and promising role in future research on genetic mechanisms, early detection and/or prevention of social anxiety disorder.

Here, we investigated the effects of radiofrequency (RF) fields emitted by new-generation mobile technologies, specifically, Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and Long-Term Evolution (LTE), on intrinsic scalp EEG activity in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) and cognitive performance in the Stroop test. The study involved 60 healthy, young-adult university students (34 for UMTS and 26 for LTE) with double-blind administration of Real and Sham exposure in separate sessions. EEG was recorded before, during and after RF exposure, and Stroop performance was assessed before and after EEG recording. Both RF exposure types caused a notable decrease in the alpha power over the whole scalp that persisted even after the cessation of the exposure, whereas no effects were found on any aspects of performance in the Stroop test. The results imply that the brain networks underlying global alpha oscillations might require minor reconfiguration to adapt to the local biophysical changes caused by focal RF exposure mimicking MP use.

J	Tune, S; Wostmann, M; Obleser, J				Tune, Sarah; Woestmann, Malte; Obleser, Jonas			Probing the limits of alpha power lateralisation as a neural marker of selective attention in middle-aged and older listeners	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha oscillations; EEG; spatial attention; speech processing	DOWN SUPPRESSION DEFICIT; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; IN-NOISE PERCEPTION; HEARING-LOSS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; WORKING-MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; YOUNGER; ADULTS	In recent years, hemispheric lateralisation of alpha power has emerged as a neural mechanism thought to underpin spatial attention across sensory modalities. Yet, how healthy ageing, beginning in middle adulthood, impacts the modulation of lateralised alpha power supporting auditory attention remains poorly understood. In the current electroencephalography study, middle-aged and older adults (N=29; similar to 40-70years) performed a dichotic listening task that simulates a challenging, multitalker scenario. We examined the extent to which the modulation of 8-12Hz alpha power would serve as neural marker of listening success across age. With respect to the increase in interindividual variability with age, we examined an extensive battery of behavioural, perceptual and neural measures. Similar to findings on younger adults, middle-aged and older listeners' auditory spatial attention induced robust lateralisation of alpha power, which synchronised with the speech rate. Notably, the observed relationship between this alpha lateralisation and task performance did not co-vary with age. Instead, task performance was strongly related to an individual's attentional and working memory capacity. Multivariate analyses revealed a separation of neural and behavioural variables independent of age. Our results suggest that in age-varying samples as the present one, the lateralisation of alpha power is neither a sufficient nor necessary neural strategy for an individual's auditory spatial attention, as higher age might come with increased use of alternative, compensatory mechanisms. Our findings emphasise that explaining interindividual variability will be key to understanding the role of alpha oscillations in auditory attention in the ageing listener.

In addition, a difference in P1 amplitude change to a red background compared to its opponent color, green, has been found in schizophrenia-spectrum samples. The current study examined whether specific psychiatric symptoms that related to these P1 abnormalities in earlier studies would be replicated when using a broad transdiagnostic sample. The final sample consisted of 135 participants: 26 with bipolar disorders, 25 with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, 19 with unipolar depression, 62 with no current psychiatric disorder, and 3 with disorders in other categories. Low (8%) and high (64%) contrast check arrays were presented on gray, green, and red background conditions during electroencephalogram, while an eye tracker monitored visual fixation on the stimuli. Linear regressions across the entire sample (N=135) found that greater severity of both clinician-rated and self-reported delusions/magical thinking correlated with a reduced P1 amplitude on the low contrast gray (neutral) background condition. In addition, across the entire sample, higher self-reported constricted affect was associated with a larger decrease in P1 amplitude (averaged across contrast conditions) to the red, compared to green, background. All relationships remained statistically significant after covarying for diagnostic class, suggesting that they are relatively transdiagnostic in nature. These findings indicate that early visual processing abnormalities may be more directly related to specific transdiagnostic symptoms such as delusions and constricted affect rather than specific psychiatric diagnoses or broad symptom factor scales.

Brain state before a memory probe and associative retrieval in older adults	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						Source memory; Retrieval; EEG; Brain states; Anticipation; Individual differences	RECOGNITION MEMORY; AGE; PERFORMANCE; SHIFT	Older individuals' difficulty in remembering events from a particular time and place may be explained by changes in retrieval-related control processes. We investigated how aging affects neural activity leading up to a retrieval probe and how such activity relates to later performance. Electrical brain activity was recorded while healthy younger and older humans memorized visual word pairs consisting of an object word (e.g., doll) preceded by a location word (e.g., garden). Only object words were presented during the memory test, the task being to decide whether an object had been presented earlier and, if so, what location had been paired with it. Awarning signal before each test probe alerted to an upcoming object. A sustained negative-going event-related potential deflection preceded objects whose associated location could be remembered, especially in older individuals. The poorer an older individual's associative memory, the bigger was this deflection. Aging thus seems accompanied by changes in anticipatory brain states that relate to recollection. Such states may serve to mobilize control processes that aid the recovery of contextual details. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, we explored the associations among psychological variables and brain responses to the pictures of L'Aquila after the earthquake. Our final sample (N = 30 adults) comprised 15 survivors (M age = 31.40 years, SD = 9.42) and 15 controls (M age = 30.53 years, SD = 10.01). Participants' electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded during a visual task that included earthquake-related stimuli. Participants were assessed for posttraumatic and dissociation symptoms and event-related potential components, and low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) were analyzed. Compared to the control group, source localization in survivors indicated a lower intensity of the amygdala, hippocampal, parahippocampal, and temporopolar areas in response to visual stimuli concerning the earthquake, p < .001 to p < .0001. Results indicated a reduced limbic activation in response to visual stimuli that evoked the recall of earthquake in survivors. This finding suggests that survivors likely adopted a distancing strategy toward stimuli that may have elicited an emotional activation related to collective trauma.

P-300 and N-400 Induced Decoding of Learning-Skill of Driving Learners Using Type-2 Fuzzy Sets	2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUZZY SYSTEMS (FUZZ-IEEE)	IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)	JUL 08-13, 2018	Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL	IEEE		learning-skill detection; electroencephalography; general type-2 fuzzy set; event related potentials	LOGIC SYSTEMS; CLASSIFICATION; POTENTIALS	The paper aims at classifying the learning-skill of driving-learners by utilizing the acquired P300 and N400 event related potentials during the learning phase of a simulated car-driving task. A set of driving stimuli, including braking on sudden appearance of bumpers, steering control at the sharp bending points, and the like, are prepared to experimentally classify the learning skill of the subjects in three distinct classes: Low, Medium and High. The complexity in classifying the subjective learning-skill arises because of intra-and inter-session variations in brain signals due to temporal fluctuation in activation levels of the involved brain lobes. A novel z-slice based model of general type-2 fuzzy set is proposed to represent the intra- and inter-session variations by the footprint of uncertainty and their composite variations by z-slices at different values of a given feature. Further, a novel technique for z-slice based classifier is proposed to classify the learning-skill under intra-and inter-session uncertainty. The proposed classifier is found to outperform traditional and well-known type-2 classifiers for the present learning-skill classification task in driving. Experiments undertaken confirm the frontal and parietal theta (4-7 Hz) activation in discrete learning steps. The proposed research outcome may directly be utilized to certify driving learners with required learning skills.

Dimension reduction by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has often been recommended before ICA decomposition of EEG data, both to minimize the amount of required data and computation time. Here we compared ICA decompositions of fourteen 72-channel single subject EEG data sets obtained (i) after applying preliminary dimension reduction by PCA, (ii) after applying no such dimension reduction, or else (iii) applying PCA only. Reducing the data rank by PCA (even to remove only 1% of data variance) adversely affected both the numbers of dipolar independent components (ICs) and their stability under repeated decomposition. For example, decomposing a principal subspace retaining 95% of original data variance reduced the mean number of recovered 'dipolar' ICs from 30 to 10 per data set and reduced median IC stability from 90% to 76%. PCA rank reduction also decreased the numbers of near-equivalent ICs across subjects. For instance, decomposing a principal subspace retaining 95% of data variance reduced the number of subjects represented in an IC cluster accounting for frontal midline theta activity from 11 to 5. PCA rank reduction also increased uncertainty in the equivalent dipole positions and spectra of the IC brain effective sources. These results suggest that when applying ICA decomposition to EEG data, PCA rank reduction should best be avoided.

While there is ample evidence for integration of text and auditory speech, there are only a few studies on the orthographic equivalent of the McGurk effect. Here, we examined whether written text, like visual speech, can induce an illusory change in the perception of speech sounds on both the behavioural and neural levels. In a sound categorization task, we found that both text and visual speech changed the identity of speech sounds from an /aba/-/ada/ continuum, but the size of this audiovisual effect was considerably smaller for text than visual speech. To examine at which level in the information processing hierarchy these multisensory interactions occur, we recorded electroencephalography in an audiovisual mismatch negativity (MMN, a component of the event-related potential reflecting preattentive auditory change detection) paradigm in which deviant text or visual speech was used to induce an illusory change in a sequence of ambiguous sounds halfway between /aba/ and /ada/. We found that only deviant visual speech induced an MMN, but not deviant text, which induced a late P3-like positive potential. These results demonstrate that text has much weaker effects on sound processing than visual speech does, possibly because text has different biological roots than visual speech.

J	Chen, SQ; Jia, YJ; Woltering, S				Chen, Siqi; Jia, Yajun; Woltering, Steven			Neural differences of inhibitory control between adolescents with obesity and their peers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY			English	Article							GO/NOGO TASK; COGNITIVE-CONTROL; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; CHILDHOOD OBESITY; SELF-REGULATION; UNITED-STATES; CHILDREN; CONFLICT	Background/objective Inhibitory control, the ability to suppress prepotent responses and resist irrelevant stimuli, is thought to play a critical role in the manifestation and maintenance of obesity in adolescents. Adolescence is a unique developmental stage characterized by significant maturational changes in cortical structures (i.e., prefrontal cortex: PFC) that relate to inhibitory control processes. The current study investigated the behavioral and neurophysiological correlates of inhibitory control in adolescents with obesity. Subjects/methods We compared 18 normal-weight and 22 adolescents with obesity on performance and electro-encephalography (EEG)-based measures during a Go/NoGo task. We investigated N2 and P3 event-related potential (ERP) components. Results Adolescents with obesity showed lower accuracy compared to their normal-weight peers in NoGo trials where greater amounts of inhibitory control effort were required (p = 0.03). Adolescents with obesity had larger NoGo N2 amplitude relative to the Go N2 amplitude (p = 0.03), whereas this difference was not observed in the healthy weight sample. Furthermore, a lower self-efficacy of individual's ability to control eating behaviors in challenging situations (as measured by the Weight Efficacy Lifestyle-Short Form) directly correlated with larger NoGo N2 amplitudes for both obese (p = 0.03) and normal weight groups (p = 0.01). Conclusions These findings suggested that obesity in adolescence is associated with a decreased ability to modulate cognitive conflict during the inhibitory control processing. The individual differences in conflict monitoring during situations where greater amounts of inhibitory control effort were required might provide an explanation for overeating behaviors in obese adolescents.

While only recently experimental research is finding some support for this claim, there are also aspects of rhythm cognition that appear to be species-specific, such as the capability to perceive a regular pulse (or beat) in a varying rhythm. In the current study, using EEG, we adapted an auditory oddball paradigm that allows for disentangling the contributions of beat perception and isochrony to the temporal predictability of the stimulus. We presented two rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) with a rhythmic sequence in two versions: an isochronous version, that was acoustically accented such that it could induce a duple meter (like a march), and a jittered version using the same acoustically accented sequence but that was presented in a randomly timed fashion, as such disabling beat induction. The results reveal that monkeys are sensitive to the isochrony of the stimulus, but not its metrical structure. The MMN was influenced by the isochrony of the stimulus, resulting in a larger MMN in the isochronous as opposed to the jittered condition. However, the MMN for both monkeys showed no interaction between metrical position and isochrony. So, while the monkey brain appears to be sensitive to the isochrony of the stimulus, we find no evidence in support of beat perception. We discuss these results in the context of the gradual audiomotor evolution (GAE) hypothesis (Merchant and Honing, 2014) that suggests beat-based timing to be omnipresent in humans but only weakly so or absent in non-human primates.

Here, we describe the architecture of LANGA, an online game-based platform under development for L2 teaching and research, and present a demonstrative proof-of-concept study using the platform. LANGA is designed to be both an effective and engaging product from the consumer perspective, and a tool that can be used by researchers to easily implement, deploy and test different training modalities for L2 teaching. Furthermore, key features of LANGA include easy configuration of training via modular design; emphasis on gamified teaching methods; and the use of automated speech recognition to provide learners feedback on verbal production. A first prototype of LANGA was tested in a small-scale, proof-of-concept study. Changes in proficiency from pre- to post-training were measured using recall and recognition tests, while event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were used to assess changes in brain activity related to lexical access over the course of learning. The results provided initial validation of the platform: participants were able to learn a large proportion of the words taught, and retained the novel words in a two/weeks follow-up. Future directions on the development of the platform are discussed.	[Usai, Francesco; O'Neil, Kiera G.

In a previous study, this oddball effect was much reduced when stimulus-response (S-R) mappings were still undefined at stimulus presentation (being later provided by response prompts). This reduction may reflect P3b's dependence on transmitted information which might be any relevant information (informational value hypothesis) or, more specifically, information about how to respond (S-R link hypothesis). To distinguish between these two hypotheses and clarify their differences from classical stimulus evaluation hypothesis, we added a second dimension by presenting colored letters, with both colors and letters varying between a rare and a frequent alternative. Response prompts, presented half a second later, were, in different blocks, constant or variable across trials with respect to S-R mapping and with respect to the relevant dimension (color or letter). With partial information, when only one of these two factors is known at stimulus presentation (by being constant across trials), the hypotheses differ in their predictions. The oddball effect will be abolished according to S-R link hypothesis because knowledge of both factors is needed to determine the response, but will only be reduced according to informational value hypothesis and be fully maintained according to stimulus evaluation hypothesis. In fact, oddball effects only occurred with knowledge of both factors, i.e., if both the relevant dimension and its mapping to responses were constant across trials. These results confirm the preeminent role of knowledge about responses for eliciting P3.

To improve event-related desynchronization during motor imagery and obtain improved brain-computer interface classification accuracy, we introduce dynamic video guidance and complex motor tasks to the motor imagery paradigm. Methods: Eleven participants were included in the experiment; 64-channel electroencephalographic data were collected and analyzed during four motor imagery tasks with different guidance. Time-frequency analysis, spectral-time variation analysis, topographical distribution maps, and statistical analysis were utilized to analyze the event-related desynchronization patterns. Common spatial patterns were used to extract spatial pattern features and support vector machines were used to discriminate the offline classification accuracies in three bands (the alpha band, beta band, alpha and beta band) for comparison. Results: The experimental outcomes showed that complex motor imagery tasks coupled with dynamic video guidance induced significantly stronger event-related desynchronization than other paradigms, which use simple motor imagery tasks or static guidance. Similar results were obtained during analysis of the motor imagery brain-computer interface classification performance; namely, the highest average classification accuracy in complex and dynamic guidance was improved by approximately 14%, compared with static guidance. For individually specified paradigms, all participants obtained a classification accuracy that exceeded or was equal to 87.5%. Conclusions: This study provides an optional route to enhance the event-related desynchronization activities and classification accuracy of a motor imagery brain-computer interface through optimization of motor imagery tasks and instructive guidance.

While previous research showed that developmental dyslexia is associated with deficient letter-speech sound integration, these studies did not differentiate between subcomponents of literacy skills. In order to investigate whether deficient letter-speech sound integration is associated with deficits in reading and/or spelling, three groups of third graders were recruited: (1) children with combined deficits in reading and spelling (RSD, N = 10); (2) children with isolated spelling deficit (ISD, N = 17); and (3) typically developing children (TD, N = 21). We assessed the neural correlates (EEG) of letter-speech sound integration using a Stroop-like interference paradigm: participants had to decide whether two visually presented letters look identical. In case of non-identical letter pairs, conflict items were the same letter in lower and upper case (e.g., "T t"), while non-conflict items were different letters (e.g., "T k"). In terms of behavioral results, each of the three groups exhibited a comparable amount of conflict-related reaction time (RT) increase, which may be a sign for no general inhibitory deficits. Event-related potentials (ERPs), on the other hand, revealed group-based differences: the amplitudes of the centro-parietal conflict slow potential (cSP) were increased for conflicting items in typical readers as well as the ISD group. Preliminary results suggest that this effect was missing for children with RSD. The results suggest that deficits in automatized letter-speech sound associations are associated with reading deficit, but no impairment was observed in spelling deficit.

NEUROREPORT			English	Article						attention; curve tracing; electrophysiology; event-related potential; N2pc; SPCN; spotlight; zoom lens	OBJECT-BASED ATTENTION; VISUAL-ATTENTION; SPREAD; OPERATION; SHAPE	Curve tracing occurs when a line is followed covertly to accomplish a task, for example, to determine whether two landmarks are on the same line or not (could Highway 61 take Robert Johnson from New Orleans to St Louis?). Previous work suggests that attention either moves along the curve, momentarily activating local representations of the curve during this process, leaving little or no trace of this activation once attention has passed, or attention spreads along the curve, resulting in an activated state along the entire portion of the curve that was traced. We re-examined this issue using event-related potentials. Curves to be traced were presented briefly to encourage a rapid deployment of attention. The curves started on the vertical midline and passed into the left or right visual field and terminated either on the vertical midline or at a lateral position. We measured a posterior contralateral negativity (relative to the visual field of the traced curve) that offset more rapidly when the curve was traced back to the midline than when it remained lateral. The results suggest that attention travels along the curve like fire on a fuse, with activation returning to baseline once the flame has passed. Copyright (C) 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The N-40 is a fronto-central event-related potential, generated by the supplementary motor areas (SMAs) and a physiological index of response selection processes. The aim of the present study was to determine whether infraclinical effects of dopamine depletion on response selection processes could be evidenced via alterations of the N-40. We obtained a dopamine depletion in healthy volunteers with the acute phenylalanine and tyrosine depletion (APTD) method which consists in decreasing the availability of dopamine precursors. Subjects realized a Simon task in the APTD condition and in the control condition. When the stimulus was presented on the same side as the required response, the stimulus-response association was congruent and when the stimulus was presented on the opposite side of the required response, the stimulus-response association was incongruent. The N-40 was smaller for congruent associations than for incongruent associations. Moreover, the N-40 was sensitive to the level of dopaminergic activity with a decrease in APTD condition compared to control condition. This modulation of the N-40 by dopaminergic level could not be explained by a global decrease of cerebral electrogenesis, since negativities and positivities indexing the recruitment of the primary motor cortex (anatomically adjacent to the SMA) were unaffected by APTD. The specific sensitivity of N-40 to ATPD supports the model of Keeler et al. (Neuroscience 282:156-175, 2014) according to which the dopaminergic system is involved in response selection.

Such conflicts may be triggered by different kinds of distractor stimuli (e.g., priming and flanker stimuli), but it has remained largely unclear whether the functional and neurobiological underpinnings of both conflict types differ. We therefore investigated the functional relevance of the catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine, which have been shown to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in neuronal processing and should therefore modulate response conflicts. Methods: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study design, we examined the effect of methylphenidate (0.5 mg/kg) on both flanker-induced and priming-induced response conflicts in a group of n = 25 healthy young adults. We used EEG recordings to examine event-related potentials in combination with source localization analyses to identify the cognitive-neurophysiological subprocesses and functional neuroanatomical structures modulated by methylphenidate. Results: Compared with placebo, methylphenidate decreased flanker conflicts. This was matched by increased congruency effects in the fronto-central N2/P3 event-related potential complex and associated with modulations in the right inferior frontal gyrus. In contrast to this, methylphenidate did not modulate the size of prime-evoked conflicts. Conclusions: Our results suggest that catecholamine-driven increases in signal-to-noise ratio and neural gain control do not equally benefit differently evoked conflicts. This supports the hypothesis of an at least partly different neurobiological basis for flanker- and prime-evoked response conflicts. As the right inferior frontal gyrus plays an important role in inhibition, the catecholaminergic system may reduce flanker conflicts by supporting the inhibition of distracting information.

Perturbations in the regulation of electrophysiological signals, including high-frequency (gamma: 30-80 Hz and beta: 20-30 Hz) neuronal oscillations, are also associated with the disorder. This study investigated the influence of BDNF deficiency and NMDA receptor hypofunction on electrophysiological responses to brief acoustic stimuli. Adult BDNF heterozygote (BDNF+/-) and wild-type littermate C57Bl/ 6J mice were surgically implanted with EEG recording electrodes. All mice underwent EEG recording sessions to measure ongoing and auditory-evoked electrophysiological responses following treatment with MK-801 (0.3 mg/kg ip) or vehicle. Western blotting on post-mortem cortical tissue assessed parvalbumin and GAD67 expression -markers of interneurons which are involved in the generation of gamma oscillations. Compared with wild-type controls, BDNF+/-mice exhibited markedly dampened electrophysiological responses to auditory stimuli, including reductions in the amplitude of multiple components of the event-related potential and auditory-evoked oscillations, as well as reduced ongoing cortical gamma oscillations. MK-801 elevated ongoing gamma power but suppressed evoked gamma power, and this was observed equally across genotypes. BDNF+/-mice also displayed reductions in parvalbumin, but not GAD67 expression. We conclude that reduced BDNF expression leads to impairments in the generation of high-frequency neural oscillations, but this is not synergistic with NMDA receptor hypofunction. Reduced parvalbumin expression associated with BDNF haploinsufficiency may provide a molecular explanation for these electrophysiological deficits.

However, whether insomnia disorder (ID) impairs response inhibition has caused great controversy. Methods: Using the auditory stop-signal paradigm coupled with event-related potentials (ERPs), we carried out this study to examine whether individuals with ID presented response inhibition deficits and further investigated the neural mechanism correlated to these deficits. Twelve individuals with ID and 13 matched good sleepers (GSs) had participated in this study, and then they performed an auditory stop-signal task (SST) in the laboratory setting with high density EEG recordings. Results: The behavioral results revealed that compared to GSs, patients with ID presented significantly longer stop-signal reaction time (SSRT), suggesting the impairment of motor inhibition among insomniacs. Their reaction time in go trials, however, showed no significant between-group difference. Considering the electrophysiological correlate underlying the longer SSRT, we found reduced P3 amplitude in patients with insomnia in the successful stop trials, which might reflect their poor efficiency of response inhibition. Finally, when we performed exploratory analyses in the failed stop and go trials, patients with ID presented reduced Pe and N1 amplitude in the failed sop trials and go trials respectively. Discussion: Taken together, these findings indicate that individuals with ID would present response inhibition deficits. Moreover, the electrophysiological correlate underlying these deficits mainly revolves around the successful stop P3 component. The present study is the first to investigate the electrophysiological correlate underlying the impaired response inhibition among insomniacs.

Cortical Response to the Natural Speech Envelope Correlates with Neuroimaging Evidence of Cognition in Severe Brain Injury	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; MINIMALLY CONSCIOUS STATE; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; VEGETATIVE STATE; OWN NAME; NEURAL ENTRAINMENT; DISORDERS; COMA; AWARENESS	Recent studies identify severely brain-injured patients with limited or no behavioral responses who successfully perform functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or electroencephalogram (EEG) mental imagery tasks [1-5]. Such tasks are cognitively demanding [1]; accordingly, recent studies support that fMRI command following in brain-injured patients associates with preserved cerebral metabolism and preserved sleep-wake EEG [5, 6]. We investigated the use of an EEG response that tracks the natural speech envelope (NSE) of spoken language [7-22] in healthy controls and brain-injured patients (vegetative state to emergence from minimally conscious state). As audition is typically preserved after brain injury, auditory paradigms may be preferred in searching for covert cognitive function [23-25]. NSE measures are obtained by cross-correlating EEG with the NSE. We compared NSE latencies and amplitudes with and without consideration of fMRI assessments. NSE latencies showed significant and progressive delay across diagnostic categories. Patients who could carry out fMRI-based mental imagery tasks showed no statistically significant difference in NSE latencies relative to healthy controls; this subgroup included patients without behavioral command following. The NSE may stratify patients with severe brain injuries and identify those patients demonstrating "cognitive motor dissociation" (CMD) [26] who show only covert evidence of command following utilizing neuroimaging or electrophysiological methods that demand high levels of cognitive function. Thus, the NSE is a passive measure that may provide a useful screening tool to improve detection of covert cognition with fMRI or other methods and improve stratification of patients with disorders of consciousness in research studies.

A Neural Indicator of Response Competition in Preferential Choice	DECISION-WASHINGTON			English	Article						electroencephalography; event-related potential; lateralized readiness potential; decision-making		Contemporary theories of decision-making often seek to specify the emotional, motivational, and cognitive processes that underlie observable decision behaviors. This requires us as researchers to pursue more sophisticated means of empirically verifying hypothesized processes. To that end, we present 3 experiments that used the lateralized readiness potential (LRP) to establish a neurological basis for response competition in decisions involving subjective preferences. Affectively valenced pictures and monetary gambles were used as stimuli in binary decision tasks in Experiment 1 and 2, respectively. The results of Experiment 1 provide evidence that the LRP is capable of measuring preparatory motor activity underlying the dynamic accumulation of subjective preference in the premotor cortex. Neural signatures indicated there was more response competition when participants chose between more similar stimuli (affective valence) as indicated by the neural signatures. When choosing among gambles in Experiment 2, we again observed increased response competition when participants chose between more similar stimuli (risk). Experiment 3 served to reinforce the findings of Experiment 2 using a similar experimental setup with gamble stimuli counterbalanced based on a different metric for risk.

Structural and functional asymmetries are observed as early as the prenatal period suggesting genetically determined differences between both hemispheres. The corpus callosum is a large tract connecting mostly homologous areas; some have proposed that it might participate in an enhancement of the left-hemispheric advantage to process speech. To investigate its role in early development, we compared 13 3-4-month-old infants with an agenesis of the corpus callosum ("AgCC") with 18 typical infants using high-density electroencephalography in an auditory task. We recorded event-related potentials for speech stimuli (syllables and babbling noise), presented binaurally (same syllable in both ears), monaurally (babbling noise in one ear) and dichotically (syllable in one ear and babbling noise in the other ear). In response to these stimuli, both groups developed an anterior positivity synchronous with a posterior negativity, yet the topography significantly differed between groups likely due to the atypical gyration of the medial surface in AgCC. In particular, the anterior positivity was lateral in AgCC infants while it covered the midline in typical infants. We then measured the latencies of the main auditory response (P2 at this age) for the different conditions on the symmetrical left and right clusters. The main difference between groups was a similar to 60 ms delay in typical infants relative to AgCC, for the ipsilateral response (i.e. left hemisphere) to babbling noise presented in the left ear, whereas no difference was observed in the case of right-ear stimulation. We suggest that our results highlight an asymmetrical callosal connectivity favoring the right-to-left hemisphere direction in typical infants. This asymmetry, similar to recent descriptions in adults, might contribute to an enhancement of left lateralization for language processing beyond the initial cortical left-hemisphere advantage.

Considerable efforts have been made to elucidate the affected system neurophysiological mechanisms. But while it is well-known that developmental changes affect intra-individual variability, this potential bias has largely been neglected when investigating the neurophysiology underlying developmental differences between children and adults. We hypothesize that due to differences in intra-individual variability of neural processes between children and adults, reliable group differences will only be evident after accounting for intra-individual variability in neurophysiological processes. We, therefore, investigate response-inhibition processes as an important instance of executive control in children (between 10 and 14 years) and adults (between 20 and 29 years) and decompose EEG data on the basis of the latency and temporal variability. This was combined with source localization. Children showed more impulsive behavior than adults. Importantly, a reliable match between the neurophysiological and behavioral data could only be found when accounting for intra-individual variability in the EEG data. These decomposed data showed that children and adults use similar neurophysiological mechanisms at the response selection level to accomplish inhibitory control, but seem to engage different neuroanatomical structures to do so according to source localization results: In adults, these processes were related to the medial frontal cortex. In children, the same processes were reflected in a shift of the scalp topography and related to the superior parietal cortex. These shifts in neural networks were associated with lower effectiveness in exerting inhibitory control. However, these differences in the functional neuroanatomical architecture can only be seen when intra-individual variability is taken into account.

Recent research has indicated that intraclass correlation (ICC) is the best method for capturing maturation in auditory event-related potentials (AEPs) of school-age children. However, the sensitivity of the ICC approach in discerning AEP changes in children has not been consistently demonstrated and positive results have not been replicated. We attempted this replication and further explored whether AEP maturation estimated using the ICC approach predicts cognitive and linguistic abilities in addition to chronological age. We measured AEPs in response to simple tones in groups of 7-, 8-, 9- and 10-year olds with typical development (N=67) and used ICC to estimate the age equivalent of each child's AEP (AEP-age). Results indicated that ICC differentiated 7- to 8-year-old children from 9- to 10-year-old children and that AEP-age predicted both chronological age and significant, unique variance in language ability, but not in nonverbal IQ. Our findings support the view that auditory organization in children reflects both general developmental maturation and more specific development of language skills, and support the future use of AEP-age to identify and understand individual differences in brain maturation in typically developing and clinical populations.

We fitted DCMs to high-density EEG data from subjects performing a semantic picture matching task. The subjects are carriers of the PSEN1 mutation, which leads to early onset Alzheimer's disease, but at the time of EEG acquisition in 1999, these subjects were cognitively unimpaired. We asked 1) what is the optimal model architecture for explaining the event-related potentials in this population, 2) which connections are different between this Presymptomatic Carrier (PreC) group and a Non-Carrier (NonC) group performing the same task, and 3) which network connections are predictive of subsequent Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) trajectories. We found 1) a model with hierarchical rather than lateral connections between hemispheres to be optimal, 2) that a pathway from right inferotemporal cortex (IT) to left medial temporal lobe (MTL) was preferentially activated by incongruent items for subjects in the PreC group but not the NonC group, and 3) that increased effective connectivity among left MTL, right IT, and right MTL was predictive of subsequent MMSE scores.

However, the introduction of portable collection devices always means a descent in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG. Subject-independent brain-computer interface (BCI) avoids conventional calibration procedure for new users. However, whether subject-independent model can be used in cross-platform BCI has not been discussed so far. This paper transplanted the subject-independent model from a high-SNR platform to a lower one for recognition in P300-Speller. After comparing their EEG features elicited from diverse collection platforms, a model adjustment strategy was proposed to increase recognition accuracy. By model adjustment, the average accuracy was 85.00% in online spell experiments. The results indicate it is feasible for subject-independent model transplantation, especially after model adjustment strategy. It provides technology supported for further development of cross-platform BCI.

J	Zhang, ZF				Zhang, Zefen			A Cognitive Study of College Students' English Vocabulary Based on Electroencephalogram	NEUROQUANTOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); Vocabulary cognition; Cognitive Linguistics; Event-related Potential		In this study, a vocabulary cognition experiment is designed with cross-language startup paradigm from the cognitive perspective to analyze the time course of English vocabulary semantic accessibility of college students, the influence of words and speech information on English semantic accessibility, and the relationship between English learning and Chinese learning and their mutual influence on the cognitive process. The experiment uses event-related potential technology to record the sensory and cognitive processes of the brain online in a continuous and real time manner. The components of the scalp area are separated to determine the cortical areas activated by the mental activity, thus determining the internal nerve source of the explicit behavior. This study discusses English vocabulary learning from the perspective of cognitive linguistics, mainly to understand learners' cognitive characteristics and cognitive process of English vocabulary learning. In view of this phenomenon, it is proposed that learners should establish the cognitive schema of English vocabulary to form the semantic network of English vocabulary, overcome the negative transfer of mother tongue, and achieve vocabulary cognition through a great deal of English input and mastery of context knowledge. This study complements the research on vocabulary cognition of college students, and the results provide theoretical guidance for college students' English learning and language teaching.

Perceptual Surprise Improves Action Stopping by Nonselectively Suppressing Motor Activity via a Neural Mechanism for Motor Inhibition	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						corticospinal excitability; Go/NoGo task; motor evoked potentials; motor inhibition; stop-signal P3; surprise	RESPONSE-INHIBITION; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; MAGNETIC STIMULATION; UNEXPECTED EVENTS; SIGNAL; BRAIN; TASK; EEG; REFLECTS; DYNAMICS	Motor inhibition is a cognitive control ability that allows humans to stop actions rapidly even after initiation. Understanding and improving motor inhibition could benefit adaptive behavior in both health and disease. We recently found that presenting surprising, task-unrelated sounds when stopping is necessary improves the likelihood of successful stopping. In the current study, we investigated the neural underpinnings of this effect. Specifically, we tested whether surprise-related stopping improvements are due to a genuine increase in motor inhibition. In Experiment 1, we measured motor inhibition in primary motor cortex of male and female humans by quantifying corticospinal excitability (CSE) via transcranial magnetic stimulation and electromyography during a hybrid surprise-Go/NoGo task. Consistent with prior studies of motor inhibition, successful stopping was accompanied by nonselective suppression of CSE; that is, CSE was suppressed even in task-unrelated motor effectors. Importantly, unexpected sounds significantly increased this motor-system inhibition to a degree that was directly related to behavioral improvements in stopping. In Experiment 2, we then used scalp encephalography to investigate whether unexpected sounds increase motor-inhibition-related activity in the CNS. We used an independent stop-signal localizer task to identify a well characterized frontocentral low-frequency EEG-component that indexes motor inhibition. We then investigated the activity of this component in the surprise-Go/NoGo task. Consistent with Experiment 1, this signature of motor inhibition was indeed increased when NoGo signals were followed by unexpected sounds. Together, these experiments provide converging evidence suggesting that unexpected events improve motor inhibition by automatically triggering inhibitory control.

Human personality reflects spatio-temporal and time-frequency EEG structure	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; MENTAL PROCESSES; TASK-DIFFICULTY; SPEED; INTELLIGENCE; INFORMATION; PERFORMANCE; BRAIN; ALPHA	The reliable and objective assessment of intelligence and personality has been a topic of increasing interest of contemporary neuroscience and psychology. It is known that intelligence can be measured by estimating the mental speed or velocity of information processing. This is usually measured as a reaction time during elementary cognitive task processing, while personality is often assessed by means of questionnaires. On the other hand, human personality affects the way a subject accomplishes elementary cognitive tasks and, therefore, some personality features can define intelligence. It is expected that these features, as well as mental abilities in performing cognitive tasks are associated with the brain's electrical neural activity. Although several studies reported correlation between event-related potentials, mental ability and intelligence, there is a lack of information about time-frequency and spatio-temporal structures of neural activity which characterize this relation. In the present work, we analyzed human electroencephalograms (EEG) recorded during the performance of elementary cognitive tasks using the Schulte test, which is a paper-pencil based instrument for assessing elementary cognitive ability or mental speed. According to particular features found of the EEG structure, we divided the subjects into three groups. For subjects in each group, we applied the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF) to assess the their personality traits. We demonstrated that each group exhibited a different score on the personality scale, such as warmth, reasoning, emotional stability and dominance. Summing up, we found a link between EEG features, mental abilities and personality traits. The obtained results can be of great interest for testing human personality to create automatized intelligent programs which combine simple tests and EEG measurements for real estimation of human personality traits and mental abilities.

To investigate the underlying neurophysiology, the present study examined the relationship between resilience and the late positive potential (LPP) evoked by emotionally negative pictures. Fifty-four participants watched negative and neutral pictures passively while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded to assess LPP. Participants also completed the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) for assessment of their resilience levels. We found that resilience was negatively correlated with the LPP response to negative emotional pictures. Additionally, this negative correlation was mainly driven by optimism, one of the three composite factors that contribute to resilience. Our results showed a neurophysiological correlate for the effect of resilience on negative emotion, and suggested a predictive value of optimism in identifying individuals potentially sensitive to affective interruptions.

A neuromarketing experiment was peformed to establish whether brain event-related potentials (ERPs), elicited by destination photos, can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of tourist destination marketing content in movies. Two groups of participants viewed pictures from the cities of Bruges and Kyoto. Prior to viewing the pictures, one group saw an excerpt from the movie In Bruges, which positively depicts Bruges' main tourist attractions. The other group saw a movie excerpt that did not. feature Bruges (the Rum Diary). An early emotional response was osberved to the subsequently presented Bruges pictures for the In Bruges group only; no reliable between-group differences were found in ERPs to pictures from Kyoto. In conclusion, EEG-based neuromarketing is a valuable tool for evaluating the effectiveness of destination marketing, and popular movies can positively influence affective destination image.

However, as the set of electrodes that maximize BCI performance is paradigm-and subject dependent, selecting the optimal electrode set from the vast number of possible electrode subsets is challenging. In this work, an existing electrode selection algorithm based Mutual Information (MI) is extended with prior knowledge of the paradigm under investigation, and applied towards a P300-based BCI. The results show that the proposed algorithm is at par with the original MI electrode selection and outperforms a traditional greedy forward electrode selection approach, but requires significantly less time to converge.

Strikingly, 4 Hz stimuli were reported as brighter more than 80% of the time when compared to all other tested frequencies, even though all stimuli were equiluminant and of equal temporal length. Electroencephalography recordings showed that inter-trial phase coherence (ITC) of theta (4 Hz) was: (1) Significantly greater than alpha, contralateral to the flickering stimulus; (2) Enhanced by the presence of a second ipsilateral 4 Hz flickering stimulus; and (3) Uniquely lateralized, unlike the alpha band. Importantly, on trials with two identical stimuli (i.e. 4 Hz vs 4 Hz), the brightness discrimination judgment could be predicted by the hemispheric balance in the amount of 4 Hz ITC. We speculate that the theta rhythm plays a distinct information transfer role, where its ability to share information between hemispheres via entrainment promotes a better processing of visual information to inform a discrimination decision.

They can even change the meaning of the narrative through film editing. Many cuts are not consciously perceived, others are, just as we perceive or not the changes in real events. In this paper, we analyze the effects of cuts and different editing styles on 36 subjects, using electroencephalographic (EEG) techniques and the projection of stimuli with different audiovisual style of edition but the same narrative. Eyeblinks, event-related potentials (ERPs), EEG spectral power and disturbances, and the functional and effective connectivity before and after the cuts were analyzed. Cuts decreased blink frequency in the first second following them. Cuts also caused an increase of the alpha rhythm, with a cortical evolution from visual toward rostral areas. There were marked differences between a video-clip editing style, with greater activities evoked in visual areas, and the classic continuous style of editing, which presented greater activities in the frontal zones. This was reflected by differences in the theta rhythm between 200 and 400 ms, in visual and frontal zones, and can be connected to the different demands that each style of edition makes on working memory and conscious processing after cutting. Also, at the time of cuts, the causality between visual, somatosensory, and frontal networks is altered in any editing style. Our findings suggest that cuts affect media perception and chaotic and fast audiovisuals increase attentional scope but decrease conscious processing. (C) 2018 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this study was to assess and compare the behavioral and electrophysiological effects of both levodopa and subthalamic stimulation on emotional processing in Parkinson's disease. Operated patients (n =16) and matched healthy subjects performed an emotional Stroop task, in which the emotion expressed by a face must be recognized while ignoring an emotional distractive word and that includes a neutral control sub-task. Patients were tested in the four possible treatment conditions (off stim/off med; on stim/off med; off stim/on med; and on stim/on med). High-resolution electroencephalography was recorded while performing the task. Patients made significantly more mistakes in facial emotion recognition than healthy subjects (p < .005). Untreated patients performed worse in the emotional trials than in the control sub-task (p < .05). Fearful faces induced significantly slower reaction times than happy faces in patients (p = .0002), but not in the healthy subjects. The emotional Stroop effect with levodopa was significantly higher than with subthalamic stimulation when fearful faces were assessed (p = .0243). Conversely, treatments did not modulate the Stroop effect of the control sub-task. EEG demonstrated that, compared with the untreated state, levodopa but not subthalamic stimulation significantly increases the amplitude of the event-related potential N170 (p = .002 vs. p = .1, respectively), an electrophysiological biomarker of early aspects of facial processing. The activity of the N170 cortical sources within the right fusiform gyrus was increased by levodopa (p < .05) but not by stimulation. While levodopa normalizes the recognition of emotional facial expression and early EEG markers of emotional processing, subthalamic stimulation does not. Thus, operated patients require dopaminergic medication in addition to stimulation to treat emotional symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

Evaluating the feasibility of the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) to study temporal attention	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						attention; EEG; methods; SSVEP	ORIENTING ATTENTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; CUED SHIFTS; TIME-COURSE; MODULATION; EEG; PERFORMANCE; TASK; SUPPRESSION	Improvements in perceptual performance can be obtained when events in the environment are temporally predictableand temporal predictability improves attention and sensory processing. The amplitude of the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) has been shown to correlate with attention paid to a flickering stimulus even if the flickering stimulus is irrelevant for the task. However, to our knowledge, the validity of the SSVEP to study temporal attention has not been established. Therefore, we designed an SSVEP temporal attention task to evaluate whether the SSVEP and its temporal dynamics can be used to study temporal attention. We used a forced-choice perceptual detection task while presenting task-irrelevant visual flicker at alpha (10 Hz) and two surrounding frequencies (6 or 15 Hz). Temporal predictability was manipulated by having the interstimulus intervals (ISI) be constant or variable. Behavioral results replicated previous studies confirming the benefits of temporal expectations on performance for trials with constant ISI. EEG analyses revealed robust SSVEP amplitudes for all flicker frequencies, although a main effect of temporal expectations on SSVEP amplitude was not significant. Additional analyses revealed temporal predictability-related modulations of SSVEP amplitude at 10 Hz and its second harmonic (20 Hz). The effect of temporal predictability was also observed for the 6 Hz flicker, but not for 15 Hz for any ISI condition. These results provide some evidence for the feasibility of the SSVEP technique to study temporal attention for stimuli with flicker frequencies around the alpha band.

Cross-Modal Priming Effect of Rhythm on Visual Word Recognition and Its Relationships to Music Aptitude and Reading Achievement	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						implicit prosody; rhythm sensitivity; event related potentials; reading achievement; musical aptitude	EXPLAINS INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; LEXICAL STRESS; PHONOLOGICAL AWARENESS; PROSODIC SENSITIVITY; SPEECH PROSODY; LANGUAGE; ENGLISH; ENTRAINMENT; PERCEPTION; RESPONSES	Recent evidence suggests the existence of shared neural resources for rhythm processing in language and music. Such overlaps could be the basis of the facilitating effect of regular musical rhythm on spoken word processing previously reported for typical children and adults, as well as adults with Parkinson's disease and children with developmental language disorders. The present study builds upon these previous findings by examining whether non-linguistic rhythmic priming also influences visual word processing, and the extent to which such cross-modal priming effect of rhythm is related to individual differences in musical aptitude and reading skills. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded while participants listened to a rhythmic tone prime, followed by a visual target word with a stress pattern that either matched or mismatched the rhythmic structure of the auditory prime. Participants were also administered standardized assessments of musical aptitude and reading achievement. Event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by target words with a mismatching stress pattern showed an increased fronto-central negativity. Additionally, the size of the negative effect correlated with individual differences in musical rhythm aptitude and reading comprehension skills. Results support the existence of shared neurocognitive resources for linguistic and musical rhythm processing, and have important implications for the use of rhythm-based activities for reading interventions.

Many studies postulate that MCE increases inhibition, but ERP evidence is ambiguous due to significant differences across past procedures. Most importantly, exercise intensity, which modulates the relationship between acute exercise and cognitive processes, might have varied across past ERP studies. Additionally, previous procedures may not have sufficiently engaged the inhibition process during tasks. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of an acute exercise session on behavioral (accuracy, RT) and ERP (N2, P3b) indices of cognitive processes engaged in conflict resolution. Contrary to most previous studies, we determined ventilatory thresholds (VTD) in order to precisely control exercise metabolism. Moreover, to ensure engagement of inhibition we used a flanker task in a version eliciting strong conflict. 18 male adults underwent three testing sessions in a randomized and counterbalanced order: moderate-intensity continuous exercise (MCE), high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE), and seated rest condition. After each session participants performed the flanker task, during which EEG data was collected. Compared with the control condition, exercise between the first (VT1) and the second (VT2) ventilatory threshold (MCE), but not exercise that exceeded VT2 (HIIE), improved performance in the task and increased the N2 component, which is a neural marker of inhibition. The study shows that MCE might directly benefit inhibition and shows the need for more precise measures of exercise intensity in future studies.

Dissociable Decoding of Spatial Attention and Working Memory from EEG Oscillations and Sustained Potentials	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha; decoding; EEG; ERP; orientation; working memory	NEURAL MEASURES REVEAL; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; HIDDEN STATES; REPRESENTATIONS; MECHANISMS; CORTEX; MODULATIONS; INFORMATION	In human scalp EEG recordings, both sustained potentials and alpha-band oscillations are present during the delay period of working memory tasks and may therefore reflect the representation of information in working memory. However, these signals may instead reflect support mechanisms rather than the actual contents of memory. In particular, alpha-band oscillations have been tightly tied to spatial attention and may not reflect location-independent memory representations per se. To determine how sustained and oscillating EEG signals are related to attention and working memory, we attempted to decode which of 16 orientations was being held in working memory by human observers (both women and men). We found that sustained EEG activity could be used to decode the remembered orientation of a stimulus, even when the orientation of the stimulus varied independently of its location. Alpha-band oscillations also carried clear information about the location of the stimulus, but they provided little or no information about orientation independently of location. Thus, sustained potentials contain information about the object properties being maintained in working memory, consistent with previous evidence of a tight link between these potentials and working memory capacity. In contrast, alpha-band oscillations primarily carry location information, consistent with their link to spatial attention.

Acquired Sleep-Related Hypermotor Epilepsy with Disrupted White Matter Tracts Assessed by Multishell Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy; traumatic brain injury; magnetic resonance imaging; tractography; EEG; posttraumatic epilepsy	FRONTAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; PAROXYSMAL DYSTONIA; HUMAN BRAIN; IN-VIVO; SEIZURES; ORIGIN	Sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE) (previously frontal lobe epilepsy) is a rare seizure disorder commonly misdiagnosed or unrecognized, causing negative patient sequelae. While usually reported in familial studies, it is more commonly acquired. Diagnosis is a challenge due to its low incidence in comparison with the more common sleep disorders or psychogenic etiologies in the differential diagnosis. Diagnosis is scaled on degree of certainty based on described or clinically documented semiology, with video EEG as a helpful, but not necessary, adjunct. Current treatment is similar to other focal epilepsies. We studied a 36-year-old active duty male soldier who presented with 2 years of predominantly sleep related, abrupt, short, and anamnestic hyperkinetic movements with unstructured vocalizations. Prior workup included non-contributory video electroencephalograph (EEG) and polysomnography as well as normal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Treatments for presumed psychiatric and parasomnia disturbances were not effective in establishing diagnosis or relief. Evaluation at our tertiary, multidisciplinary care institution recorded events consistent with the diagnosis of clinical SHE. He was enrolled in an advanced multishell diffusion-weighted imaging MRI research study to evaluate white matter tracts, given his history of mild, repetitive, non-penetrating traumatic brain injury, not otherwise requiring hospitalization. Multishell diffusion MRI tractography found changes not previously described in the right frontal lobe white matter tracts. These changes were consistent with neurological localization and serve as a potential nidus for this patient's seizure disorder. Misdiagnosis of SHE can result in detrimental biopsychosocial sequelae of untreated epilepsy, unnecessary or harmful intervention, or the stigmata of a behavioral disorder. Further investigation into diagnosis and etiology of acquired SHE is needed. Assessment for white matter abnormalities can potentially provide information into pathogenesis of epilepsy disorders.

Here, we investigated the potential sleep-protective role of sleep spindles on noise-induced sleep alterations. Methods: Twenty-six young (19-33 years, 12 women) and 18 older (52-70 years, 9 women) healthy volunteers underwent a repeated measures polysomnographic 6-day laboratory study. Participants spent one noise-free baseline night, followed by four transportation noise-exposure nights (road traffic or railway noise; continuous or intermittent: average sound levels of 45 dB, maximum sound levels of 50-62 dB), and one noise-free recovery night. Sleep stages were scored manually and fast sleep spindle characteristics were quantified automatically using an individual band-pass filtering approach. Results: Nighttime exposure to transportation noise significantly increased sleep EEG arousal indices. Sleep structure and continuity were not differentially affected by noise exposure in individuals with a low versus a high spindle rate. Spindle rates showed an age-related decline along with more noise-induced sleep alterations. All-night spindle rates did not predict EEG arousal or awakening probability from single railway noise events. Spindle characteristics were affected in noise-exposure nights compared to noise-free nights: we observed a reduction of the spindle amplitude in both age groups and of the spindle rate in the older group. Conclusions: We have evidence that spindle rate is more likely to represent a trait phenomenon, which does not seem to play a sleepprotective role in nighttime transportation noise-induced sleep disruptions. However, the marked reduction in spindle amplitude is most likely a sensitive index for noise-induced sleep alterations. Statement of Significance Growing epidemiological evidence suggests various adverse health effects of long-term nighttime transportation noise exposure. In the EU, 7.9 million adults are estimated to experience sleep disturbances due to nighttime transportation noise exposure with additional community noise sources such as neighbor noise not even considered. Individuals differ greatly in sleep-related noise sensitivity. A better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie these differences could help to identify targets for intervention. This study in young and older healthy individuals indicated that sleep spindles, discussed in the literature for their potential sleep-protective function, do not significantly modify noiseinduced sleep alterations after controlling for age and may therefore not serve as a physiological marker of sleep-related noise sensitivity.

Interactive effects of an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist and a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist on mismatch negativity: Implications for schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Mismatch negativity; Electroencephalography; Schizophrenia; NMDAR hypofunction; Ketamine; Nicotine	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY SENSORY MEMORY; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; COGNITIVE DEFICITS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; GLUTAMATE RELEASE; KETAMINE; MMN; MODULATION; BRAIN	N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, including auditory processing abnormalities reflected by the mismatch negativity (MMN) event-related potential component. Evidence suggesting cognitive benefits from nicotine administration, together with the high rate of cigarette use in patients with schizophrenia, has stimulated interest in whether nicotine modulates NMDAR hypofunction. We examined the interactive effects of ketamine, an NMDAR antagonist that produces transient schizophrenia-like neurophysiological effects, and nicotine, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist, in 30 healthy volunteers to determine whether nicotine prevents or attenuates MMN abnormalities. Secondary analyses compared the profile of ketamine and schizophrenia effects on MMN using previously reported data from 24 schizophrenia patients (Hay et al. 2015). Healthy volunteers completed four test days, during which they received ketamine/placebo and nicotine/placebo in a double-blind, counterbalanced design. MMN to intensity, frequency, duration, and frequency + duration double deviant sounds was assessed each day. Ketamine decreased intensity, frequency, and double deviant MMN amplitudes, whereas nicotine increased intensity and double deviant MMN amplitudes. A ketamine x nicotine interaction indicated, however, that nicotine failed to attenuate the decrease in MMN associated with ketamine. Although the present dose of ketamine produced smaller decrements in MMN than those associated with schizophrenia, the profile of effects across deviant types did not differ between ketamine and schizophrenia. Results suggest that while ketamine and schizophrenia produce similar profiles of MMN effects across deviant types, nicotinic agonists may have limited potential to improve these putative NMDAR hypofunction-mediated impairments in schizophrenia.

Buz			The relationship between the sensory responses to ankle-joint loading and corticomotor excitability	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Sensorimotor integration; joint stability; neuromuscular control	FUNCTIONALLY UNSTABLE ANKLES; HOFFMANN REFLEX; HUMAN MICRONEUROGRAPHY; MUSCLE TONE; MODULATION; STIFFNESS; TASK; INSTABILITY; INHIBITION; SECONDARY	Purpose: Maintaining joint stability is dependent on the ability of the nervous system to sense and react to potentially injurious loads. In attempts to understand the neurophysiologic mechanisms underlying joint stability, this afferent and efferent activity has been quantified separately at the cortical, segmental and peripheral levels using various electrophysiologic techniques in vivo. However, no studies have attempted to quantify sensory and motor activation at multiple levels of the nervous system in a single subset, to understand potential adaptations for optimizing joint stability.Materials and Methods: Muscle spindle afferent activity and sensory cortex event-related desynchronization were quantified during ankle-joint loading; and motor excitability was assessed through transcranial magnetic stimulation and the Hoffmann reflex in a subset of 42 able-bodied individuals. Microneurography and electroencephalography were used to collect the muscle spindle afferent and sensory cortex activation, respectively, as joint load was applied using an ankle arthrometer. Separately, motor-evoked potentials were obtained from the tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) using transcranial magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex, and compared to the reflexive responses evoked via sciatic nerve electrical stimulation.Results: Correlation coefficients revealed significant correlations between the motor threshold of the soleus and early muscle spindle afferent activity (r = -0.494) and early cortical event-related desynchronization (r = 0.470), as well as tibialis anterior motor-evoked potential size and late muscle spindle afferent activity (r = 0.499).Conclusions: The results of this study highlight the nervous system's capability to offset motor output based on the volume of sensory input at the segmental and cortical levels.

As a direct test of this central hypothesis, we used electroencephalography to investigate whether local prediction error processing was less modulated by global context (i.e., global stimulus frequency) in ASD. METHODS: A group of 18 adults with ASD was compared with a group of 24 typically developed adults on a well-validated hierarchical auditory oddball task in which participants listened to short sequences of either five identical sounds (local standard) or four identical sounds and a fifth deviant sound (local deviant). The latter condition is known to generate the mismatch negativity (MMN) component, believed to reflect early sensory prediction error processing. Crucially, previous studies have shown that in blocks with a higher frequency of local deviant sequences, top-down expectations seem to attenuate the MMN. We predicted that this modulation by global context would be less pronounced in the ASD group. RESULTS: Both groups showed an MMN that was modulated by global context. However, this effect was smaller in the ASD group as compared with the typically developed group. In contrast, the P3b, as an electroencephalographic marker of conscious expectation processes, did not differ across groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that people with ASD are less flexible in modulating their local predictions (reflected in MMN), thereby confirming the central hypothesis of contemporary predictive coding accounts of ASD.

Neuroimaging and behavioural studies have established that impaired audiovisual integration of letters and speech sounds is a core deficit in individuals with developmental dyslexia. This longitudinal study aimed to identify neural and behavioural markers of audiovisual integration that are related to future reading fluency. We simulated the first step of reading acquisition by performing artificial-letter training with prereading children at risk for dyslexia. Multiple logistic regressions revealed that our training provides new precursors of reading fluency at the beginning of reading acquisition. In addition, an event-related potential around 400 ms and functional magnetic resonance imaging activation patterns in the left planum temporale to audiovisual correspondences improved cross-validated prediction of future poor readers. Finally, an exploratory analysis combining simultaneously acquired electroencephalography and hemodynamic data suggested that modulation of temporoparietal brain regions depended on future reading skills. The multimodal approach demonstrates neural adaptations to audiovisual integration in the developing brain that are related to reading outcome. Despite potential limitations arising from the restricted sample size, our results may have promising implications both for identifying poor-reading children and for monitoring early interventions.

The P300 - an Evoked Related Potential (ERP) - is induced for purpose by visual stimuli. The developed Brain-Computer Interface is made up by: (i) acquisition unit; (ii) processing unit and (iii) navigation unit. The acquisition unit is a wireless 32-channel EEG headset collecting data from 6 electrodes (parietal-cortex area). The processing unit is a dedicated mu PC performing stimuli delivery, data gathering, Machine Learning (ML), real-time hyper-dimensional classification leading to the user intention interpretation. The ML stage is based on a custom algorithm (t-RIDE) which trains the following classification stage on the user-tuned P300 reference features. The real-time classification performs a functional approach for time-domain features extraction, which reduce the amount of data to be analyzed. The Raspberry-based navigation unit actuates the received commands and support the wheelchair motion using peripheral sensors (USB camera for video processing, ultrasound sensors). Differently from related works, the proposed protocol for stimulation is aware of the environment. The experimental results, based on a dataset of 5 subjects, demonstrate that: (i) the implemented ML algorithm allows a complete P300 spatio-temporal characterization in 1.95 s using only 22 target brain visual stimuli (88 s/direction); (ii) the complete classification chain (from features extraction to validation) takes in the worst case only 19.65 ms +/- 10.1, allowing real-time control; (iii) the classification accuracy of the implemented BCI is 80.5 +/- 4.1% on single-trial.

Since perceiving meaningful patterns is to some extent already prevalent in the general population, the aim of the study was to investigate whether the propensity to experience meaningful patterns in co-occurring events and random stimuli may be associated with similar altered attentional processes in lateralized speech perception. Self-reported and behavioral indicators of the perception of meaningful patterns were assessed in non-clinical individuals, along with EEG auditory evoked potentials during the performance of an attention related lateralized speech perception task (Dichotic Listening Test). A greater propensity to perceive meaningful patterns was associated with higher Ni amplitudes of the evoked potentials to the onset of the dichotically presented consonant-vowel syllables, indicating enhanced automatic attention in early sensory processing. The study suggests that more basic mechanisms in how people associate events may play a greater role in the cognitive biases that are manifest in personality expressions such as positive schizotypy, rather than that positive schizotypy moderates these cognitive biases directly.

A few Event related potential (ERP) studies have noticed that sex differences occur in relatively early cognitive processing stages, but none of the study has viewed directional flow of information in the earlier stages as a function of complexity in men and women. This study investigated possible reasons for sex differences in visuospatial performance by flux of information underlying cortical functional connectivity. In the present study, earlier two stages were identified as a) perceptual encoding, identification, and discrimination of objects, kept under visuospatial attention allocation network (VSAN) and b) rotation ability involving spatial transformation strategy, assigned in mental rotation network (MRN). Participants underwent 3D mental rotation task with varying difficulty levels, simultaneously having electroencephalogram (EEG). It has been confirmed in behavioural outcome, as angular disparity increases, reaction and accuracy trades off. There were different activated electrodes in male and female participants for both networks. Advantage of spatial working memory was evident in men and reflected during performance. Also, VSAN showed that men utilised bottom-up attentional processes for more rotated views. MRN exhibited hemispheric lateralisation in the parietal cortex; men showed higher activation in right parietal cortex. This research work offers promising perspective to the study of cortical functional connectivity, in the terms of strength and direction, during sub-processes of MR. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, many researches show that the EEG of AD patients can be characterized by EEG slowing, enhanced complexity of the EEG signals, and EEG synchrony. In order to examine the neural synchrony at multi scales, and to find'a biomarker that help detecting AD in diagnosis, detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA) of EEG signals is applied in this paper. Several parameters, namely DCCA coefficients in the whole brain, DCCA coefficients at a specific scale, maximum DCCA coefficient over the span of all time scales and the corresponding scale of such coefficients, were extracted to examine the synchronization, respectively. The results show that DCCA coefficients have a trend of increase as scale increases, and decreases as electrode distance increases. Comparing DCCA coefficients in AD patients with healthy controls, a decrease of synchronization in the whole brain, and a bigger scale corresponding to maximum correlation is discovered in AD patients. The change of max-correlation scale may relate to the slowing of oscillatory activities. Linear combination of max DCCA coefficient and max-correlation scale reaches a classification accuracy of 90%. From the above results, it is reasonable to conclude that DCCA coefficient reveals the change of both oscillation and synchrony in AD, and thus is a powerful tool to differentiate AD patients from healthy elderly individuals.

However, brain responses associated with preparatory orienting of attention, with target noveltyandwith the detection of a match/mismatch between expected and actual targets (contextual updating), have not been explored in N+. Here in a study in healthy humans and brain-damaged patients of both sexes we demonstrate that frontal activity that reflects supramodal mechanisms of attentional orienting (Anterior Directing Attention Negativity, ADAN) is entirely spared in N+. In contrast, posterior responses that mark the early phases of cued orienting (Early Directing Attention Negativity, EDAN) and the setting up of sensory facilitation over the visual cortex (Late Directing Attention Positivity, LDAP) are suppressed in N+. This uncoupling is associated with damage of parietal-frontal white matter. N+ also exhibit exaggerated novelty reaction to targets in the right side of space and reduced novelty reaction for those in the left side (P3a) together with impaired contextual updating (P3b) in the left space. Finally, we highlight a drop in the amplitude and latency of the P1 that over the left hemisphere signals the early blocking of sensory processing in the right space when targets occur in the left one: this identifies a new electrophysiological marker of the rightward attentional bias in N+. The heterogeneous effects and spatial biases produced by localized brain damage on the different phases of attentional processing indicate relevant functional independence among their underlying neural mechanisms and improve the understanding of the spatial neglect syndrome.

ERPs to remember, forget, and uninformative cues in the encoding phase of item-method directed forgetting	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						directed forgetting; EEG/ERP; episodic memory; inhibition; ironic effects	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ATTENTIONAL WITHDRAWAL; INHIBITORY CONTROL; IRONIC PROCESSES; MEMORY; INSTRUCTION; COMPONENTS; DYNAMICS; PICTURES; IMPLICIT	In item-method directed forgetting, worse memory performance occurs for to-be-forgotten (TBF) than for to-be-remembered (TBR) items. However, recently TBF items have been found to be recognized more accurately than uninformative (UI) items not associated with any specific task. Here, we compare ERPs elicited by cues signaling the remember or the forget instruction with those elicited by uninformative cues. Participants were presented with a series of complex pictures, each followed by a symbolic TBR, TBF, or UI cue. On a yes-no recognition test, accuracy was higher for TBR than for both TBF and UI items. However, TBF items were recognized more accurately than UI items. ERPs elicited by the TBR cue were larger than ERPs elicited by both TBF and UI cues at the frontal P2, the late frontal negativity, and the late parietal positivity complex. This is consistent with more attention capture, selective rehearsal, and long-term memory encoding of TBR. In contrast, both TBF and UI cues induced a larger frontal N2 than TBR cues. Critically, TBF elicited a larger late right-frontal positivity than both UI and TBR cues and a larger late parietal positivity than UI cues. Moreover, the late right-frontal positivity was correlated with better recognition performance. It may therefore reflect processing orientation rather than inhibition per se. Results suggest that, when compared to UI cues, both TBR and TBF cues are processed actively. Distinct processing is seen at right frontal and centroparietal positive ERPs that may mediate better subsequent recognition of TBF than of UI items.

Impaired mismatch negativity to frequency deviants in individuals at ultra-high risk for psychosis, and preliminary evidence for further	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Event-related potential (ERP); Transition; Psychosis; Ultra high risk (UHR); Mismatch negativity (MMN)	CLINICAL HIGH-RISK; 1ST-EPISODE PSYCHOSIS; CHRONIC-SCHIZOPHRENIA; PREDICTING PSYCHOSIS; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; DISORDERS; DURATION; DEFICITS; ONSET; MMN	Background: There is evidence to suggest that people with established psychotic disorders show impairments in the mismatch negativity induced by a frequency-deviant sound (fMMN), and that these impairments worsen with the deterioration of psychotic symptoms. This study aimed to test whether individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis show pre-morbid impairments in fMMN, and if so, whether fMMN continues to deteriorate with transition to psychosis. Method: fMMN was recorded in a cohort of UHR individuals (n = 42) and compared to healthy controls (n = 29). Of the 27 UHR participants who returned for a second EEG session, six participants had transitioned to psychosis by 12-month follow-up (UHR-T) and were compared to the 21 participants who did not transition (UHR-NT). Results: fMMN amplitude was significantly reduced, relative to healthy controls, in the UHR cohort. Furthermore, UHR-T individuals showed a significant decrease in fMMN amplitude over the period from baseline to post-transition; this reduction was not observed in UHR-NT. Conclusions: These results suggest that fMMN is abnormal in UHR individuals, as has repeatedly been found previously in people with established psychotic disorders. The finding that fMMN impairment worsens with transition to psychosis is consistent with the staging model of psychosis; however, caution must be taken in interpreting these findings, given the extremely small sample size of the UHR-T group.

We tested a possibility to improve recognition of difficult sounds after their presentation during SWS and the correlation of recognition with electrophysiological parameters of brain activity in two groups of healthy volunteers. For the main group of subjects, after two consecutive sessions of recognizing one of the two deviant sounds in the oddball paradigm, we presented only one sound during the SWS in a different sequence. In the control group, we played the same sequence with a new deviant sound during the SWS. For the main group after daytime sleep, we observed a significant improvement in recognition of that sound, which was repeatedly presented during the SWS stage. This improvement was accompanied by an increase in the amplitude and a decrease in the latency of Mismatch Negativity (MMN) a component of the event related potential. The control group had no significant changes in the sounds' recognition and in the parameters of MMN after sleep. Our data indicate that targeted reactivation of auditory memory during SWS may contribute to better recognition of sounds, and this progress correlates with electrophysiological patterns of brain activity.

J	Chandran, KS; Perumalsamy, M				Chandran, Kalyana Sundaram; Perumalsamy, Marichamy			EEG Based Strategies for Human Gustation Classification Using Spartan6 FPGA	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Gustatory stimuli; IIR filter; SWT; BCI		Gustation is one of the five sensations and is responsible for the inhibition of electrical stimulation, thus reflecting in the overall cortical activity of the brain due to the electrical stimulation. The information processing of gustation are employed for disorder recognition such as Parkinson's disease, etc. and is a source of reimbursement for better clinical diagnosis. EEG signal of gustatory stimulus is preprocessed using IIR band pass filter to remove the artifacts due to noise. The advantage of using IIR filter is the requirement of lesser memory space and works faster than FIR filter. Extraction of features such as Short Time Fourier Transform and Fast Fourier Transform are frequency-domain analysis in which the signal is assumed to be stationary. An algorithm for feature extraction used in the proposed work is Stationary WaveletTransform (SWT) which provides time frequency representation. In time domain, the statistical features of the detailed coefficients are computed and a filtered EEG signal is decomposed using SWT. The statistical features computed here are the mean which is an average of the absolute value of the EEG signal, variance which uses the power of the EEG signal as a feature of the signal and power spectral density. The different gustatory stimuli of bitter, sour and sweet are classified based on the features extracted. Lastly, the feature extraction and preprocessing algorithms are implemented in Spartan6 FPGA kit. The proposed system possesses an advantage of increased computational speed and reduced area utilization compared to existing method.

J	Fitzgerald, K; Todd, J				Fitzgerald, Kaitlin; Todd, Juanita			Hierarchical timescales of statistical learning revealed by mismatch negativity to auditory pattern deviations	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Auditory processing; Perceptual learning; MMN; Event-related potentials; EEG	STIMULUS; SYSTEM; ERP; MMN; ATTENTION; CONTEXT; FMRI; TIME; BIAS	The amplitude of mismatch negativity (MMN) elicited following an unexpected sound reflects a pattern-violation signal that will increase with estimated precision. Precision is inversely related to environmental variance, and should be higher the longer that current regularities have been stable. However, MMN amplitude can be impacted by initial learning such that the relative probability of sounds when first encountered distorts the precision estimates later associated with those sounds. The present study tested the hypothesis that MMN to a pattern violation would be differentially sensitive to both local and global patterning within a sequence, depending on whether the sound was common or rare at sequence onset. Sound sequences consisted of two levels of nested regularity: (1) two tones alternated probabilities as the local standard (p = .875) and deviant (p = .125), and (2) these alternations occurred regularly across four blocks of 2.4 min (stable components) or twelve blocks of 0.8 min (unstable components). Sequences were delivered first in an unstable-stable ("increasing-stability") and next a stable-unstable ("decreasing-stability") structure, both inducing a violation to the regular block length at the transition between components. MMN to the tone initially heard as a common repeating standard when later heard as a deviant was not affected by stability of either local (tone probabilities) or global (block length) patterns, reaching equivalent amplitude in all components. In contrast, MMN amplitude to the tone initially heard as deviant was significantly impacted by both local and global pattern stability. MMN amplitude was larger in stable than unstable blocks only if they were heard first (decreasing-stability sequence), and was significantly smaller in both stable and unstable block types after a violation of regular block length. Results are interpreted as local MMN amplitude being "weighted down" by decreased precision in the global structure, but only for the first deviant encountered.

Although there is increasing evidence that the ERN can be shaped by environment and experience, no studies to date have examined this question in a clinical sample. In the current study, we examined the influence of combat exposure on the ERN using electroencephalogram (EEG) in a sample of military veterans with a high prevalence of psychopathology. Participants included sixty-seven U.S. military veterans from Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, and New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND). The degree of combat exposure was assessed using the Deployment Risk and Resilience Inventory-2 (DRRI-2) and Combat Exposure Scale (CES). A well-validated flanker task was used to elicit the ERN during continuous EEG recording. Results revealed that veterans who reported experiencing greater combat exposure exhibited a more enhanced ERN, even when adjusting for broad anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. The association between combat exposure and ERN was not moderated by PTSD symptom severity. The current study demonstrates that greater combat exposure is associated with a more enhanced ERN among OEF/OIF/OND veterans. This enhanced ERN may be one mechanism that places veterans at greater risk for developing psychiatric disorders following exposure to combat. Future longitudinal studies are needed to directly test whether the ERN mediates the relation between level of combat exposure and the development of internalizing disorders.

J	Chen, YM; Xu, J; Zhou, L; Zheng, Y				Chen, Youmei; Xu, Jing; Zhou, Li; Zheng, Ya			The time course of incentive processing in anticipatory and consummatory anhedonia	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						Anticipatory anhedonia; Consummatory anhedonia; Incentive processing; Event-related potential	REWARD ANTICIPATION; DECISION-MAKING; NEURAL RESPONSE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; POTENTIALS; FEEDBACK; DEPRESSION; DYNAMICS; DEFICITS; CONTEXT	Background: Anhedonia, the reduced capacity to experience pleasure, has long been regarded as a cardinal symptom in depression and schizophrenia. Recent evidence highlights that anhedonia is not a single construct but consists of an anticipatory component and a consummatory component, which is captured by the Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale (TEPS). The current event-related potential study examined the electrophysiological underpinnings of anticipatory and consummatory aspects of anhedonia as assessed by the TEPS in a non-clinical sample. Methods: EEG was recorded during both anticipatory and consummatory phases of incentive processing in an anticipatory-anhedonia (ANT) group, a consummatory-anhedonia (CON) group, and a control (CNT) group selected from a large sample based on their TEPS scores. Results: The ANT relative to the CON group exhibited a reduced cue-P3 during the anticipatory phase, a less positive feedback-related negativity (FRN) and a blunted feedback P3 (fb-P3) during the consummatory phase. Moreover, correlation results revealed a dissociation between anticipatory and consummatory anhedonia, which occurred in an unexpected way such that higher levels of anticipatory anhedonia were associated with reduced fb-P3 amplitudes whereas higher levels of consummatory anhedonia with enhanced cue-P3 and FRN amplitudes. Limitation: The sample size for each group was relatively small. Conclusions: Anticipatory and consummatory anhedonia as measured by the TEPS might be driven by abnormal motivational salience, which was represented by the cue-P3 during the anticipatory phase and the FRN and fb-P3 during the consummatory phase of incentive processing.

Efficient processing is thought to result in lower responses compared to less efficient processing. The efficiency of the processing is suggested to depend on the architecture of the visual system and the properties of the input image. In this study, neural responses were estimated using EEG across the categories of a set of five images of abstract artworks, a set of five photographs of natural images and a set of five computer-generated uncomfortable images. EEG responses to contrast-matched images were found to be lower for the set of five abstract artworks used in the study compared to the set of photographs of natural images, lending preliminary support for the idea that certain abstract artworks, for example the work of Pollock, may be processed efficiently.

Frontal cortical effects on feedback processing and reinforcement learning: Relation of EEG asymmetry with the feedback-related negativity and behavior	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						asymmetry; EEG; FRN; frontal cortex; learning	ACTION-BASED MODEL; CEREBRAL ASYMMETRY; BRAIN ASYMMETRY; PREFRONTAL ACTIVATION; BIOLOGICAL SUBSTRATE; WORKING-MEMORY; INHIBITION; RESPONSES; CORTEX; MOTIVATION	Reinforcement learning refers to the acquisition of approach or avoidance action tendencies through repeated reward/nonreward feedback. Although much research on reinforcement learning has focused on the striatum, the prefrontal cortex likely modulates this process. Given prior research demonstrating a consistent pattern of lateralized frontal cortical activity in affective responses and approach/avoidance tendencies in the EEG literature, we aimed to elucidate the role of frontal EEG asymmetry in reinforcement learning. Thirty-two participants completed a probabilistic selection task in which they learned to select some targets and avoid others though correct/incorrect feedback. EEG indices of frontal cortical asymmetry were computed from alpha power recorded at baseline and during task completion. We also examined the feedback-related negativity ERP component to assess feedback processing associated with activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Results revealed that greater right-lateralized frontal cortical activity during learning was associated with better avoidance learning, but neither left- nor right-sided asymmetry reliably related to approach learning. Results also suggested that left frontal activity may relate to reinforcement feedback processing, as indicated by the feedback-related negativity (FRN). These findings offer preliminary evidence regarding the role of frontal cortical activity in reinforcement learning while integrating classic and contemporary research on lateralized frontal cortical functions.

To better understand how the brain transitions from healthy to seizing on a local scale, we induced focal epileptiform activity in the visual cortex of five anesthetized cats with local application of the GABA A blocker picrotoxin while simultaneously recording local field potentials on a high-resolution electrocorticography array and laminar depth probes. Epileptiform activity appeared in the form of isolated events, revealing a consistent temporal pattern of ictogenesis across animals with interictal events consistently preceding the appearance of seizures. Based on the number of spikes per event, there was a natural separation between seizures and shorter interictal events. Two distinct spatial regions were seen: an epileptic focus that grew in size as activity progressed, and an inhibitory surround that exhibited a distinct relationship with the focus both on the surface and in the depth of the cortex. Epileptiform activity in the cortical laminae was seen concomitant with activity on the surface. Focus spikes appeared earlier on electrodes deeper in the cortex, suggesting that deep cortical layers may be integral to recruiting healthy tissue into the epileptic network and could be a promising target for interventional devices. Our study may inform more effective therapies to prevent seizure generation and spread in localization-related epilepsies. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We induced local epileptiform activity and recorded continuous, high-resolution local field potentials from the surface and depth of the visual cortex in anesthetized cats. Our results reveal a consistent pattern of ictogenesis, characterize the spatial spread of the epileptic focus and its relationship with the inhibitory surround, and show that focus activity within events appears earliest in deeper cortical layers. These findings have potential implications for the monitoring and treatment of refractory epilepsy.

Distress Intolerance Moderation of Neurophysiological Markers of Response Inhibition After Induced Stress: Relations With Cannabis Use Disorder	PSYCHOLOGY OF ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS			English	Article						cannabis use disorder; EEG; distress intolerance; response inhibition; stress induction	NATIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGIC SURVEY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MARIJUANA USE; COGNITIVE CONTROL; YOUNG-ADULTS; TOLERANCE; ALCOHOL; COMPONENTS; DEPENDENCE; ATTENTION	Cannabis use is prevalent but only a minority of regular users develop cannabis use disorder (CUD); thus, CUD risk identification among current cannabis users is vital for targeted intervention development. Existing data suggest that high distress intolerance (DI), an individual difference reflective of the ability to withstand negative affect, is linked to CUD, possibly via stress-elicited impairment of response inhibition but this has never been explicitly tested. Frequent cannabis users with high and low DI completed a go/no-go task during EEG recording before and after a laboratory stressor. Relations between DI, cannabis use-related problems, and behavioral as well as neurophysiological markers of response inhibition functioning were assessed. DI significantly moderated the effect of the stressor on the conflict-monitoring but not evaluative phase of response inhibition as measured by N2 and P3a amplitude, respectively. Unexpectedly, cannabis users with high DI demonstrated stressor-elicited enhancement rather than impairment of conflict-monitoring neural activity, which was related to faster reaction time (RT) and decreased past-month cannabis problems. Enhanced inhibition-related modulation of P3a amplitude was generally associated with increased cannabis problems regardless of acute stress. Results did not provide support for stress-elicited impairment in cognitive control as a mechanism linking high DI and CUD, though some support was found for the relevance of inhibition-related neural activity to CUD. Stress-elicited enhancement of conflict-monitoring neural activity during response inhibition may reflect an adaptive neural response among cannabis users with high DI that protects against CUD in this at-risk group.

Electrophysiological Correlates of Semantic Dissimilarity Reflect the Comprehension of Natural, Narrative Speech	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; COCKTAIL PARTY; CORTICAL ENTRAINMENT; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; AUDITORY-CORTEX; N400; REPRESENTATION; PERCEPTION; RESPONSES; COMPONENT	People routinely hear and understand speech at rates of 120-200 words per minute [1, 2]. Thus, speech comprehension must involve rapid, online neural mechanisms that process words' meanings in an approximately time-locked fashion. However, electrophysiological evidence for such time-locked processing has been lacking for continuous speech. Although valuable insights into semantic processing have been provided by the "N400 component'' of the event-related potential [3-6], this literature has been dominated by paradigms using incongruous words within specially constructed sentences, with less emphasis on natural, narrative speech comprehension. Building on the discovery that cortical activity "tracks'' the dynamics of running speech [7-9] and psycholinguistic work demonstrating [10-12] and modeling [13-15] how context impacts on word processing, we describe a new approach for deriving an electrophysiological correlate of natural speech comprehension. We used a computational model [16] to quantify the meaning carried by words based on how semantically dissimilar they were to their preceding context and then regressed this measure against electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded from subjects as they listened to narrative speech. This produced a prominent negativity at a time lag of 200-600 ms on centro-parietal EEG channels, characteristics common to the N400. Applying this approach to EEG datasets involving time-reversed speech, cocktail party attention, and audiovisual speech-in-noise demonstrated that this response was very sensitive to whether or not subjects understood the speech they heard. These findings demonstrate that, when successfully comprehending natural speech, the human brain responds to the contextual semantic content of each word in a relatively time-locked fashion.

However, its performance is still insufficient for practical use. In this study, we examine the impact that shortening the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) has on this auditory BCI. While very short SOA might improve its performance, sound perception and task performance become difficult, and event-related potentials (ERPs) may not be induced if the SOA is too short. Therefore, we carried out behavioral and EEG experiments to determine the optimal SOA. In the experiments, participants were instructed to direct attention to one of six virtual sounds (target direction). We used eight different SOA conditions: 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, and 1,100 ms. In the behavioral experiment, we recorded participant behavioral responses to target direction and evaluated recognition performance of the stimuli. In all SOA conditions, recognition accuracy was over 85%, indicating that participants could recognize the target stimuli correctly. Next, using a silent counting task in the EEG experiment, we found significant differences between target and non-target sound directions in all but the 200-ms SOA condition. When we calculated an identification accuracy using Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA), the SOA could be shortened by 400 ms without decreasing the identification accuracies. Thus, improvements in performance (evaluated by BCI utility) could be achieved. On average, higher BCI utilities were obtained in the 400 and 500-ms SOA conditions. Thus, auditory BCI performance can be optimized for both behavioral and neurophysiological responses by shortening the SOA.

Failure to reactivate salient episodic information during indirect and direct tests of memory retrieval	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Episodic memory; Reinstatement; Unconscious; Retrieval; EEG	COMPLEMENTARY-LEARNING-SYSTEMS; MULTIVOXEL PATTERN-ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; RECOGNITION MEMORY; FALSE MEMORIES; SENSORY SIGNATURE; NETWORK MODEL; ITEM MEMORY; RECOLLECTION	Several fMRI and EEG studies have demonstrated that successful episodic retrieval is accompanied by the reactivation of cortical regions that were active during encoding. These findings are consistent with influential models of episodic memory that posit that conscious retrieval (recollection) relies on hippocampally-mediated cortical reinstatement. Evidence of reactivation corresponding to episodic information that is beyond conscious awareness at the time of memory retrieval, however, is limited. A recent exception is from an EEG study by Wimber, Maa beta, Staudigl, Richardson-Klavehn, and Hanslmayr et al. (2009) in which words were encoded in the context of highly salient visual flicker entrainment and then presented at retrieval in the absence of any flicker. In that study, coherent (phase-locked) neural activity was observed at the corresponding entrained frequencies during retrieval, consistent with the notion that encoding representations were reactivated. Given the important implications of unconscious reactivation to past findings and the modeling literature, the current study set out to provide a direct replication of the previous study. Additionally, an attempt was made to extend such findings to intentional retrieval by acquiring EEG while subjects were explicitly asked to make memory judgments about the flicker frequency from encoding. Throughout a comprehensive set of analyses, the current study consistently failed to demonstrate evidence for unconscious reactivation, and instead provided support that test items were indistinguishable according to their prior encoding context. The findings thus establish an important boundary condition for the involvement of cortical reinstatement in episodic memory. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Musical genre-dependent behavioural and EEG signatures of action planning. A comparison between classical and jazz pianists	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Plasticity; Action planning; Specialised-musical training; Event-related potentials; Oscillations	ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; COGNITIVE CONTROL; MOTOR CORTICES; BAND ACTIVITY; MUSICIANS; CORTEX; IMPROVISATION; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK	It is well established that musical training induces sensorimotor plasticity. However, there are remarkable differences in how musicians train for proficient stage performance. The present EEG study outlines for the first time clear-cut neurobiological differences between classical and jazz musicians at high and low levels of action planning, revealing genre-specific cognitive strategies adopted in production. Pianists imitated chord progressions without sound that were manipulated in terms of harmony and context length to assess high-level planning of sequence-structure, and in terms of the manner of playing to assess low-level parameter specification of single acts. Jazz pianists revised incongruent harmonies faster as revealed by an earlier reprogramming negativity and beta power decrease, hence neutralising response costs, albeit at the expense of a higher number of manner errors. Classical pianists in turn experienced more conflict during incongruent harmony, as shown by theta power increase, but were more ready to implement the required manner of playing, as indicated by higher accuracy and beta power decrease. These findings demonstrate that specific demands and action focus of training lead to differential weighting of hierarchical action planning. This suggests different enduring markers impressed in the brain when a musician practices one or the other style.

Abnormalities found along the right fronto-temporal pathway between the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the auditory cortex (AC) are the likely neural mechanism responsible for amusia. To investigate the causal role of these regions during the detection of pitch deviants, we applied cathodal (inhibitory) transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over right frontal and right temporal regions during separate testing sessions. We recorded participants' electrical brain activity (EEG) before and after tDCS stimulation while they performed a pitch change detection task. Relative to a sham condition, there was a decrease in P3 amplitude after cathodal stimulation over both frontal and temporal regions compared to pre-stimulation baseline. This decrease was associated with small pitch deviations (6.25 cents), but not large pitch deviations (200 cents). Overall, this demonstrates that using tDCS to disrupt regions around the IFG and AC can induce temporary changes in evoked brain activity when processing pitch deviants. These electrophysiological changes are similar to those observed in amusia and provide causal support for the connection between P3 and fronto-temporal brain regions.

To this end, a literature review was compiled from different databases by running a descriptive data analysis according to the categories generated for this intention. It was noticed that electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) have begun to be used for this purpose with EEG as the most frequent. The procedure of potentials related to events is currently the most used for the deceit detection in the psycho-physiology field. No studies were found in Spanish speaking countries. The United States, China and England were identified as the main source of information in this field. Recent studies show an increase in understanding the brain processes produced at the time of deceiving. Nevertheless, these studies spark an ethical debate about the implications with respect to human freedom and self-incrimination.

Recent studies suggest that the ability of perspective-taking can be an integrative function of temporal and spatial information processing. We thus examined the independence and possible interaction of human perspective shifts and temporal perspective-taking by utilizing Japanese subsidiary verbs for giving, namely -ageru and -kureru. We manipulated human perspective shifts and temporal perspective-taking independently in experimental sentences by syntactically changing the subject and the object between the speaker and a third person, while we manipulated the tense to be past or non-past tense via sentence-final particles ru/ta (non-past/past). The EEG analyses via electrodes indicated the suppression of the beta band for human perspective shifts in sentences in non-past tense and the absence of such suppression in sentences in past tense. The analyses for the clusters of independent components indicated beta suppression for past tense against non-past tense in sentences without a human perspective shift. This response pattern suggests a close relationship between human perspective shifting and temporal perspective-taking. The beta suppression for the human perspective shift in our experiment can be understood as a replication of the previous EEG findings observed for perspective-taking in the presentation of visual images. The preceding findings and our result suggest that the ability or the function of perspective-taking is not specific to the modality. Furthermore, the generator of the beta suppression for past tense against non-past tense without human perspective shifting was localized in the precuneus, which is consistent with recent findings indicating that the precuneus is deeply involved in time perception.

This is done in a way that is accessible to readers whose main experience rather lies in other fields. While attempting to be as illustrative as possible, our exposition contains the mathematically precise formalism of the methods discussed. Readers not familiar with basic mathematical notions such as vectors and matrices should nevertheless not be discouraged, as they hopefully benefit from reading this tutorial even when skipping the technical parts. For the classification of event-related potentials, spatiotemporal features and classification with regularized linear discriminant analysis is discussed. Modulations of oscillatory brain activity are detected with common spatial pattern analysis and log(arithmized) band-power features. All of those methods are well comprehensible and easy to implement and show nevertheless competitive performance. The first two sections motivate the transition from univariate features, such as signal amplitude in a certain channel and at a certain latency toward multivariate features.

Children typically receive very little negative evidence, raising the question of how they come to understand the restrictions on grammatical constructions. Statistical learning theories propose stochastic patterns in the input contain sufficient clues. For example, if a verb is very common, but never observed in transitive constructions, this would indicate that transitive usage of that verb is illegal. Ambridge et al. (2008) have shown that in offline grammaticality judgements of intransitive verbs used in transitive constructions, low-frequency verbs elicit higher acceptability ratings than high-frequency verbs, as predicted if relative frequency is a cue during statistical learning. Here, we investigate if the same pattern also emerges in on-line processing of English sentences. EEG was recorded while healthy adults listened to sentences featuring transitive uses of semantically matched verb pairs of differing frequencies. We replicate the finding of higher acceptabilities of transitive uses of low- vs. high-frequency intransitive verbs. Event-Related Potentials indicate a similar result: early electrophysiological signals distinguish between misuse of high- vs low-frequency verbs. This indicates online processing shows a similar sensitivity to frequency as off-line judgements, consistent with a parser that reflects an original acquisition of grammatical constructions via statistical cues. However, the nature of the observed neural responses was not of the expected, or an easily interpretable, form, motivating further work into neural correlates of online processing of syntactic constructions.

Evidence concerning verbal and nonverbal coordination as predictors of therapeutic alliance and outcome in psychotherapy has been cumulating. These, along with others results in the field of social neuroscience, suggest that behavioural coordination may have neurophysiological correlates, which play a role in the regulatory process in psychotherapy. Here we introduce an observational paradigm and analytic method to assess the joint neurodynamic activity of patient and therapist. Additionally we report results from ongoing psychotherapy sessions. Our work highlights the involvement of brain activity in the psychotherapeutic process and provides novel insights on how psychotherapy works, in order to further the understanding of the embodied characteristic of the therapeutic interaction.

Time-varying multivariate autoregressive (tvMVAR) modeling has been proposed as a way to help quantify directed functional connectivity strengths with high temporal resolution. While several tvMVAR approaches are currently available, there is a lack of unbiased systematic comparative analyses of their performance and of their sensitivity to parameter choices. Here, we critically compare four recursive tvMVAR algorithms and assess their performance while systematically varying adaptation coefficients, model order, and signal sampling rate. We also compared two ways of exploiting repeated observations: single-trial modeling followed by averaging, and multi-trial modeling where one tvMVAR model is fitted across all trials. Results from numerical simulations and from benchmark EEG recordings showed that: i) across a broad range of model orders all algorithms correctly reproduced patterns of interactions; ii) signal downsampling degraded connectivity estimation accuracy for most algorithms, although in some cases downsampling was shown to reduce variability in the estimates by lowering the number of parameters in the model; iii) single-trial modeling followed by averaging showed optimal performance with larger adaptation coefficients than previously suggested, and showed slower adaptation speeds than multi-trial modeling. Overall, our findings identify strengths and weaknesses of existing tvMVAR approaches and provide practical recommendations for their application to modeling dynamic directed interactions from electrophysiological signals.

EEG was recorded from 128 sites in 38 Italian participants. While looking for rare animal words, participants read 240 sentences, half of which expressed notions congruent with gender stereotypes, and the other half did not (e.g., "Prepared the tomato sauce and then SHAVED", "The engineer stained HER SKIRT"). Event-related potentials (ERPs) were time-locked to critical words. Findings showed enhanced anterior N400 and occipito-parietal P600 responses to items that violated gender stereotypes, mostly in men. The swLORETA analysis applied to N400 potentials in response to incongruent phrases showed that the most activated areas during stereotype processing were the right medial temporal and medial frontal gyri, as well as the TPJ. The data hint at a gender difference in stereotyping, with men being more prejudicial especially when the depicted character is a male.

Bias in the processing of social participation in borderline personality disorder	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Borderline personality disorder; Social anxiety disorder; Social cognition; Social participation; Overinclusion; Event-related brain potentials	ACCEPTANCE; EXPECTANCY; EXCLUSION; INVENTORY; CYBERBALL; OSTRACISM; P3B	Background: Patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) feel ostracized even when they are included. This might be due to a biased processing of social participation in BPD. We examined whether patients with BPD also process social overinclusion in a biased manner, i.e., whether they feel ostracized even when the degree of social participation is increased. Methods: An EEG-compatible version of Cyberball was used to investigate the effects of inclusion and overinclusion (33% vs. 45% ball receipt) on perceived ostracism, need threat and P3 amplitude, an EEG indicator for expectancy violation. Twenty-nine patients with BPD, 28 patients with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and 28 healthy controls (HC) participated. Results: The P3 amplitude was enhanced for patients with BPD and SAD compared to HCs independent of condition. Both patient groups reported more perceived ostracism relative to HCs in the inclusion but not in the overinclusion condition. Only patients with BPD reported stronger need threat in both conditions. Conclusions: The EEG results imply that being socially included violates the expectations of patients with BPD, irrespective of the actual degree of social participation. However, when overincluded, patients with BPD no longer feel ostracized. Except for need threat, patients with SAD might show a comparable bias in the processing of social participation as patients with BPD.

ERP responses greater for faces in the temporal compared to the nasal visual field	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Faces; Emotions; Fear; Attention; N170; ERP; EEG; Superior colliculus; Retino-tectal pathway; Amygdala	SPATIAL ATTENTION; FACIAL EXPRESSION; FEARFUL FACES; ASYMMETRY; INHIBITION; AMYGDALA; N170; VISION; HUMANS; TIME	The distribution of retino-tectal projections is dissimilar depending on whether the receptors are situated in the nasal and temporal visual hemiretinas. Indeed, it has been claimed that the superior colliculus receives a greater proportion of its input from the temporal visual hemifield (nasal hemi-retina) relative to the nasal hemifield (temporal hemi-retina). In order to investigate whether these subcortical projections influence face processing, we investigated the early cortical ERP responses to faces and houses presented in the temporal and nasal retinas using monocular viewing. Neutral or fearful faces were presented concurrently with houses on either side of a central fixation cross, while participants were asked to discriminate changes in luminance at the center. Results showed that the lateralized N170, computed as the contralateral-ipsilateral electrode difference, was greater for faces appearing in the nasal relative to the temporal visual hemifield. This was due to a greater ipsilateral N170 for temporal relative to nasal presentations. By contrast, no difference was found across emotional expressions. The enhanced ERP response to faces appearing in the temporal visual field, suggests that the retinotectal pathway modulates cortical processing, most likely through activation of a colliculo-pulvino-amygdalar pathway, with subsequent back-projections from the amygdala to visual cortical regions. However, unattended facial expressions do not seem to modulate the response, at least at these angles of eccentricity.

We examined how visual predictive information influences syntactic processing, how musical or non-musical cues have different effects, and how they interact with sequential effects between trials, which could modulate with the strength of the sense of established tonality. The EEG was recorded from musicians who listened to chord sequences paired with one of four types of visual stimuli; two provided predictive information about the syntactic validity of the last chord through either musical notation of the whole sequence, or the word "regular" or "irregular," while the other two, empty musical staves or a blank screen, provided no information. Half of the sequences ended with the syntactically invalid Neapolitan sixth chord, while the other half ended with the Tonic chord. Clear ERAN was observed in frontocentral electrodes in all conditions. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the grand average response in the audio-only condition, to separate spatio-temporal dynamics of different scalp areas as principal components (PCs) and use them to extract auditory-related neural activities in the other visual-cue conditions. The first principal component (PC1) showed a symmetrical frontocentral topography, while the second (PC2) showed a right-lateralized frontal concentration. A source analysis confirmed the relative contribution of temporal sources to the former and a right frontal source to the latter. Cue predictability affected only the ERAN projected onto PC1, especially when the previous trial ended with the Tonic chord. The ERAN in PC2 was reduced in the trials following Neapolitan endings in general. However, the extent of this reduction differed between cue-styles, whereby it was nearly absent when musical notation was used, regardless of whether the staves were filled with notes or empty. The results suggest that the right frontal areas carry out the primary role in musical syntactic analysis and integration of the ongoing context, which produce schematic expectations that, together with the veridical expectation incorporated by the temporal areas, inform musical syntactic processing in musicians.

The visual-auditory evoked pathway is proposed and the sensory process is studied. To analyze the visual-auditory interactions, the kinesthetic motor imagery with the visual-auditory stimulus, visual stimulus and no stimulus are involved. The motor-related rhythm suppression is applied on quantitative evaluation. To explore the statistical sensory process, the causal relationships among the functional areas and the event-related potentials are investigated. The results have demonstrated the outstanding performances of the visual-auditory evoked motor imagery on the improvement of the mirror neuron system activation and the motor imagery ability. Besides, the abundant information interactions among functional areas and the positive impacts of the auditory stimulus in the motor and the visual areas have been revealed. The possibility that the sensory processes evoked by the visual-auditory interactions differ from the one elicited by kinesthetic motor imagery, has also been indicated. This study will promisingly offer an efficient way to motor rehabilitation, thus favorable for hemiparesis and partial paralysis patients.

Fifty subjects were presented more than a thousand spoken words during either a go/no go lexical decision task (Experiment 1) or a go/no go semantic categorisation task (Experiment 2) while EEG was collected. Linear mixed effects modelling was used to analyze the data. Effects of word frequency were found on the N400 and also as early as 100 ms in Experiment 1 but not Experiment 2. Phonological neighbourhood density produced an early effect around 250 ms and the typical N400 effect. Concreteness elicited effects in later epochs on the N400. Stimulus duration affected all epochs and its influence reflected changes in the timing of the ERP components. Overall the results support cascaded interactive models of spoken word recognition.

J	Grundy, JG; Bialystok, E				Grundy, John G.; Bialystok, Ellen			Monolinguals and bilinguals disengage attention differently following conflict and errors: Evidence from ERPs	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Bilingualism; Cognitive control; ERP; Bivalency effect; Post-conflict slowing; Errors	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; VISUAL LANGUAGE DISCRIMINATION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; EXECUTIVE CONTROL; RESPONSE CONFLICT; BRAIN POTENTIALS; DUAL MECHANISMS; TASK; ADVANTAGE; BIVALENCY	Monolingual and bilingual young adults performed a task-switching experiment while EEG was recorded to investigate how bilingualism affects cognitive control following conflict. Participants were given pure blocks composed of three intermixed tasks, each consisting of univalent trials in which they responded to one feature of the stimulus color, shape, or size. In the crucial conflict block, an irrelevant feature was added to one of the tasks, creating bivalent trials that included conflict. Behaviorally, all participants slowed responses to univalent trials that followed conflict, reflecting the post-conflict slowing effect. Electrophysiologically, monolinguals displayed longer-lasting post-conflict ERP effects and showed larger ERN amplitudes following responses than bilinguals, amplitudes that were associated with adjustments in response times. The interpretation is that bilinguals disengage attention following conflict from misleading stimuli or error responses more rapidly than do monolinguals.

Brain Responses at Encoding Predict Limited Verbal Memory Retrieval by Persons with Schizophrenia	ARCHIVES OF CLINICAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Psychopathology; Electroencephalography; Cognition; Memory; Episodic; Attention; Neurobehavioral manifestations; Schizophrenia	1ST-DEGREE BIOLOGICAL RELATIVES; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; CLINICAL-ASSESSMENT; EPISODIC MEMORY; TEMPORAL-LOBE; RECOLLECTION; RECOGNITION; STRATEGY; RISK; RELIABILITY	Objective: Special attention has been given to verbal memory deficits in schizophrenia because they are apparent in healthy biological relatives of affected individuals, indicating a link to genetic risk for the disorder. Despite a growing consensus that encoding abnormalities contribute to poor verbal memory in the disorder, few studies have directly examined how neural responses during encoding contribute to later memory performance. Method: We evaluated event-related potentials (ERPs) during encoding of verbal material by patients with schizophrenia, healthy first-degree biological relatives of patients, and healthy controls. The extent to which N1, N400, and anterior and parietal Late Positive Components (LPCs) explained encoding accuracy and later memory of material was investigated. Results: Encoding accuracy was associated with asymmetry in anterior LPCs toward right frontal brain regions and was most evident in relatives. N1 was abnormal at encoding in schizophrenia and differentially accounted for later memory performance. In controls better recall of verbal material was predicted by a larger early occipital (N1) encoding response; however, in patients with schizophrenia smaller N1 encoding responses were related to better recall. Interestingly, better recognition of verbal material across groups was also predicted by smaller N1 amplitudes during encoding of word stimuli. Conclusion: Separable patterns of electrophysiological response during encoding appear to differentially support recall and recognition of material from memory. Similar patterns of electrophysiological response across patient and relative groups suggest that those who carry genetic liability for schizophrenia share deviations in the neural activity related to encoding of material into episodic memory.

Alcohol hangover impacts learning and reward processing within the medial-frontal cortex	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						alcohol; alcoholism; EEG; ERP; FRN; reward positivity; reward processing	COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; NEURAL RESPONSE; ERRORS; CONSUMPTION; AGGRESSION; POSITIVITY; DEPRESSION; DOPAMINE; DYNAMICS; FEEDBACK	It is common knowledge that alcohol intoxication impairs motor coordination, judgment, and decision making. Indeed, an abundance of literature links intoxication to impaired cognitive control that leads to accidents and injury. A broadening body of research, however, suggests that the impact of alcohol may continue beyond the point of intoxication and into the period of alcohol hangover. Here, we examined differences in the amplitude of reward positivitya component of the human ERP associated with learningbetween control and hangover participants. During performance of a learnable gambling task, we found a reduction in the reward positivity during alcohol hangover. Additionally, participants experiencing alcohol hangover demonstrated reduced performance in the experimental task in comparison to their nonhangover counterparts. Our results suggest that the neural systems that underlie performance monitoring and reward-based learning are impaired during alcohol hangover.

Brain responses to auditory oddball task in children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes: Quantitative analysis and correlation with neuropsychological assessment scores	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						BCECTS epilepsy; Alpha event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS); Cognitive dysfunction; Neuropsychological testing	EVENT-RELATED-DESYNCHRONIZATION; COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS; EEG CHARACTERISTICS; POTENTIALS P300; MEMORY TASK; BECTS; SYNCHRONIZATION; PERFORMANCE; ATTENTION; IMPACT	Objective: Variable degrees of cognitive dysfunction have been reported in children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BCECTS). Our aim was to perform quantitative analyses of the brain responses to cognitive tasks using event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS) and correlating the results with the scores of neuropsychological tests in patients with BCECTS. Methods: This case control study included 30 patients with BCECTS and 20 controls. Clinical assessment, neuropsychological tests, the Positive wave at 300 msec (P300) parameters recording, and quantitative electro-encephalography (EEC) analysis were carried out for both groups. Alpha power ERD and ERS were measured in six different brain regions during an auditory oddball paradigm. Results: Children with epilepsy showed a statistically significant poorer performance in verbal intelligence quotient (IQ), performance IQ and total scale IQ and lower number of correct responses. Moreover, both groups showed diffuse alpha power attenuation in response to the target tones. After summation of the alpha power ERD over all brain regions to get the net diffuse ERD, the patients group showed a statistically significant smaller net alpha ERD compared with that of the control group (P = 0.001). No significant correlations between the alpha ERD percentage, recorded P300 parameters, and neuropsychological tests scores were found. Conclusions: Children with BCECTS have subtle cognitive dysfunction proved by significantly lower scores of verbal IQ and performance IQ subtests. The significantly smaller net diffuse alpha power ERD detected in children with epilepsy may be an electrophysiological indicator of disruptive brain activation in relation to cognitive attentional tasks; however, its correlation with neuropsychological tests was insignificant.

However, to date it is still debated whether this involvement is a crucial step of semantic processing or, on the contrary, it is dependent on the specific context or strategy adopted to solve a task at hand. The present electroencephalographic (EEG) study is aimed at investigating which brain circuits are engaged when processing written verbs. By aligning event related potentials (ERPs) both to the verb onset and to the motor response indexing the accomplishment of a semantic task of categorization, we were able to dissociate the relative stimulus-related and response-related cognitive components at play, respectively. EEG signal source reconstruction showed that while the recruitment of sensorimotor fronto-parietal circuits was time-locked with action verb onset, a left temporal-parietal circuit was time-locked to the task accomplishment. Crucially, by comparing the time course of both these bottom-up and top-down cognitive components, it appears that the frontal motor involvement precedes the task-related temporal-parietal activity. The present findings suggest that the recruitment of fronto-parietal sensorimotor circuits is independent of the specific strategy adopted to solve a semantic task and, given its temporal hierarchy, it may provide crucial information to brain circuits involved in the categorization task. Eventually, a discussion on how the present results may contribute to the clinical literature on patients affected by disorders specifically impairing the motor system is provided.

J	Yu, NN; Chen, Y; Wu, LL; Lu, HB				Yu, Nannan; Chen, Ying; Wu, Lingling; Lu, Hanbing			Single-Trial Evoked Potential Estimating Based on Sparse Coding under Impulsive Noise Environment	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							LATENCY CHANGE; BRAIN	Estimating single-trial evoked potentials (EPs) corrupted by the spontaneous electroencephalogram(EEG) can be regarded as signal denoising problem. Sparse coding has significant success in signal denoising and EPs have been proven to have strong sparsity over an appropriate dictionary. In sparse coding, the noise generally is considered to be a Gaussian random process. However, some studies have shown that the background noise in EPs may present an impulsive characteristic which is far from Gaussian but suitable to be modeled by the alpha-stable distribution (1 < alpha <= 2). Consequently, the performances of general sparse coding will degrade or even fail. In view of this, we present a new sparse coding algorithm using p-norm optimization in single-trial EPs estimating. The algorithm can track the underlying EPs corrupted by p-stable distribution noise, trial-by-trial, without the need to estimate the alpha value. Simulations and experiments on human visual evoked potentials and event-related potentials are carried out to examine the performance of the proposed approach. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in estimating single-trial EPs under impulsive noise environment.

L.; Zoeller, Aaron C.; Hennig, Juergen			Fluctuations of estradiol during women's menstrual cycle: Influences on reactivity towards erotic stimuli in the late positive potential	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						ERP; LPP; Menstrual cycle; Estradiol; Progesterone	NEGATIVE AFFECT; PROGESTERONE; PHASE; EMOTION; FEMALE; FACES; ASSOCIATION; MODULATION; ACTIVATION; ATTENTION	Background: While several studies examined the reactivity towards negative emotional stimuli across women's menstrual cycle, only few investigated responses to positive emotional cues in association with sexual hormones on a neural level. Therefore, the aim of the current EEG-experiment was to study the differential reactivity towards positive (erotic) words during the menstrual cycle (i.e. with fluctuations in the steroids estradiol and progesterone) in the late positive potential (LPP). Regarding reactivity towards erotic stimuli, the LPP is seen as the most relevant ERP-component, as more positive amplitudes in the LPP reflect larger incentive salience and higher arousal. The LPP towards erotic words was expected to be more pronounced during fertile phases of the menstrual cycle (around ovulation). Furthermore, associations with hormonal concentrations of estradiol and progesterone were investigated. Method: 19 young, free cycling women were tested in an Erotic Stroop paradigm during the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase in a balanced cross-over design, while electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Results: LPPs in reaction to erotic compared to neutral words were larger in every phase. During the follicular phase and ovulation, higher estradiol-concentrations were associated with more positive LPP-amplitudes towards erotic- than to neutral words.

Even though the spectro-temporal profile of these acoustic textures is highly dynamic, changes in their statistics are indicative of relevant changes in the environment. Here, we investigated the neural representation of change detection in natural textures in humans, and specifically addressed whether active task engagement is required for the neural representation of this change in statistics. Subjects listened to natural textures whose spectro-temporal statistics were modified at variable times by a variable amount. Subjects were instructed to either report the detection of changes (active) or to passively listen to the stimuli. A subset of passive subjects had performed the active task before (passive-aware vs passive-naive). Psychophysically, longer exposure to pre-change statistics was correlated with faster reaction times and better discrimination performance. EEG recordings revealed that the build-up rate and size of parieto-occipital (PO) potentials reflected change size and change time. Reduced effects were observed in the passive conditions. While P2 responses were comparable across conditions, slope and height of PO potentials scaled with task involvement. Neural source localization identified a parietal source as the main contributor of change-specific potentials, in addition to more limited contributions from auditory and frontal sources. In summary, the detection of statistical changes in natural acoustic textures is predominantly reflected in parietal locations both on the skull and source level. The scaling in magnitude across different levels of task involvement suggests a context-dependent degree of evidence integration.

In contrast, invasive methods-microelectrode recordings and electrocorticography (ECoG)-have recently measured broadband power elevation in field potentials (similar to 50-200 Hz) as a proxy for locally averaged spike rates. Here, we sought to detect and quantify stimulus-related broadband responses using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Extracranial measurements like MEG and EEG have multiple global noise sources and relatively low signal-to-noise ratios; moreover high frequency artifacts from eye movements can be confounded with stimulus design and mistaken for signals originating from brain activity. For these reasons, we developed an automated denoising technique that helps reveal the broadband signal of interest. Subjects viewed 12-Hz contrast-reversing patterns in the left, right, or bilateral visual field. Sensor time series were separated into evoked (12-Hz amplitude) and broadband components (60-150 Hz). In all subjects, denoised broadband responses were reliably measured in sensors over occipital cortex, even in trials without microsaccades. The broadband pattern was stimulus-dependent, with greater power contralateral to the stimulus. Because we obtain reliable broadband estimates with short experiments (similar to 20 minutes), and with sufficient signal-to-noise to distinguish responses to different stimuli, we conclude that MEG broadband signals, denoised with our method, offer a practical, non-invasive means for characterizing spike-rate-dependent neural activity for addressing scientific questions about human brain function.

Markov Model-Based Method to Analyse Time-Varying Networks in EEG Task-Related Data	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG/MEG dynamic connectivity; EEG/MEG time-varying networks; sparse-MVAR modeling; markov modeling; granger causality; effective connectivity	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEUROCOGNITIVE NETWORKS; RESTING-STATE; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; BRAIN NETWORKS; MEG; DYNAMICS; COGNITION; TUTORIAL; PRINCIPLES	The dynamic nature of functional brain networks is being increasingly recognized in cognitive neuroscience, and methods to analyse such time-varying networks in EEG/MEG data are required. In this work, we propose a pipeline to characterize time-varying networks in single-subject EEG task-related data and further, evaluate its validity on both simulated and experimental datasets. Pre-processing is done to remove channel-wise and trial-wise differences in activity. Functional networks are estimated from short non-overlapping time windows within each "trial," using a sparse-MVAR (Multi-Variate Auto-Regressive) model. Functional "states" are then identified by partitioning the entire space of functional networks into a small number of groups/symbols via k -means clustering.The multi-trial sequence of symbols is then described by a Markov Model (MM). We show validity of this pipeline on realistic electrode-level simulated EEG data, by demonstrating its ability to discriminate "trials" from two experimental conditions in a range of scenarios. We then apply it to experimental data from two individuals using a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) via a P300 oddball task. Using just the Markov Model parameters, we obtain statistically significant discrimination between target and non-target trials. The functional networks characterizing each 'state' were also highly similar between the two individuals. This work marks the first application of the Markov Model framework to infer time-varying networks from EEG/MEG data. Due to the pre-processing, results from the pipeline are orthogonal to those from conventional ERP averaging or a typical EEG microstate analysis. The results provide powerful proof-of-concept for a Markov model-based approach to analyzing the data, paving the way for its use to track rapid changes in interaction patterns as a task is being performed. MATLAB code for the entire pipeline has been made available.

In response, we present a factorial analysis of a multi-level oddball task - the local-global task - and we explore it when participants are sedated versus recovered. We found that the local and global levels in fact interact. This is of considerable current interest, since it has recently been argued that the MEEG response evoked by the global effect corresponds to a distinct processing mode that moves beyond predictive coding. This interaction suggests that the two processing modes are not distinct. Additionally, we observed that sedation modulates this interaction, suggesting that conscious awareness may not be completely restricted to a single (global) processing level.

Six physical stimulus modules were placed on the left arm of the participant to stimulate event-related potentials with time-domain characteristics. Six different commands could be exported by classifying the Electroencephalogram(EEG) signal, which could control the robot arm movement in the corresponding position. To test the practicality of our BCI system, 5 subjects took part in the experiment with their appropriate stimulation time, electrode channel and corresponding classifier parameters. In the online experiment, the average of classification accuracy was 84.7%, with an average information transfer rate at 12.2 bits/min. In the robot arm control experiment, all subjects could complete a reach-to-grasp task. The results show that the tactile BCI paradigm is feasible and practical for some multi-DOF control applications.

Mind Wandering and Task-Focused Attention: ERP Correlates	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CONTROL ABILITIES; NETWORK; BRAIN; INHIBITION; DISTRACTION; COMPONENTS; STIMULUS; REVEALS; SYSTEM; CORTEX	Previous studies looking at how Mind Wandering (MW) impacts performance in distinct Focused Attention (FA) systems, using the Attention Network Task (ANT), showed that the presence of pure MW thoughts did not impact the overall performance of ANT (alert, orienting and conflict) performance. However, it still remains unclear if the lack of interference of MW in the ANT, reported at the behavioral level, has a neurophysiological correspondence. We hypothesize that a distinct cortical processing may be required to meet attentional demands during MW. The objective of the present study was to test if, given similar levels of ANT performance, individuals predominantly focusing on MW or FA show distinct cortical processing. Thirty-three healthy participants underwent an EEG high-density acquisition while they were performing the ANT. MW was assessed following the ANT using an adapted version of the Resting State Questionnaire (ReSQ). The following ERP's were analyzed: pN1, pP1, P1, N1, pN, and P3. At the behavioral level, participants were slower and less accurate when responding to incongruent than to congruent targets (conflict effect), benefiting from the presentation of the double (alerting effect) and spatial (orienting effect) cues. Consistent with the behavioral data, ERP's waves were discriminative of distinct attentional effects. However, these results remained true irrespective of the MW condition, suggesting that MW imposed no additional cortical demand in alert, orienting, and conflict attention tasks.

The current study combined rTMS and EEG paradigms to examine the causal role of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in modulating visceral and behavioral responses to high calorie foods, and the mediational mechanisms underlying this relation. 28 right-handed female participants received both active and sham continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS; a rTMS variant used to decrease cortical activity) targeting the left dlPFC in a counterbalanced order. Prior to and following each stimulation session participants completed a flanker and food-cue presentation (high and low calorie food) task. Following cTBS participants had the opportunity to consume both high and low calorie foods during a taste test. Findings revealed a reliable effect of cTBS on food consumption, such that participants selectively ingested significantly more calories from appetitive calorie dense snack foods following active relative to sham cTBS; this effect did not translate to control (low calorie) food consumption. In addition, attenuation of dlPFC activity resulted in the significant increase in N2 amplitude and P3b latency to incongruent flanker trials, and the selective significant increase in the P3a amplitude to and P3a amplitude bias for high calorie food stimuli. Results from the parallel mediation analysis revealed that only the indirect effect of flanker task performance was significant; the indirect effects of stimulation induced changes in the P3 bias for high calorie foods, the urge to consume high calorie foods, and the general liking ratings for high calorie foods were not significant. These findings confirm the causal role of the left dlPFC in the modulation of calorie dense food consumption via inhibitory control capacity.

We applied an electroencephalogram-based approach to investigate how the rendering style of the users' hands affects behavioral and cognitive responses. To this end, we introduced prediction errors due to cognitive conflicts during a 3-D object selection task by manipulating the selection distance of the target object. The results showed that, for participants with high behavioral inhibition scores, the amplitude of the negative event-related potential at approximately 50-250 ms correlated with the realism of the virtual hands. Concurring with the uncanny valley theory, these findings suggest that the more realistic the representation of the user's hand is, the more sensitive the user becomes toward subtle errors, such as tracking inaccuracies.

Within a socioemotional setting, it is necessary to prioritize effectively the relevant emotional information over interfering irrelevant emotional information to orchestrate cognitive resources and achieve appropriate behavior. Currently, it is elusive whether and how different socioemotional stimulus dimensions modulate cognitive control and conflict resolution. Theoretical considerations suggest that interference effects are less detrimental when conflicting emotional information is presented within a "positive socioemotional setting" compared with a "negative socioemotional setting." Using event-related potentials (ERPs) and source localization methods, we examined the basic system neurophysiological mechanisms and functional neuroanatomical structures associated with interactive effects of different interfering facial, socioemotional stimulus dimensions on conflict resolution. We account for interactive effects of different interfering socioemotional stimulus dimensions on conflict resolution, i.e., we show how the socioemotional valence modulates cognitive control (conflict processing). The data show that conflicts are stronger and more difficult to resolve in a negative emotional task-relevant setting than in a positive emotional task-relevant setting, where incongruent information barely induced conflicts. The degree of emotional conflict critically depends on the contextual emotional valence (positive or negative) in which this conflict occurs. The neurophysiological data show that these modulations were only reflected by late-stage conflict resolution processes associated with the middle (MFG) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG). Attentional selection processes and early-stage conflict monitoring do not seem to be modulated by interactive effects of different interfering socioemotional stimulus dimensions on conflict resolution.

Subjects affected by MCI have a higher risk of developing dementia compared to the general population, and studies have found that olfactory deficits could be an indicator of whether such a conversion might happen. Following these assumptions, aim of this study was to investigate olfactory perception in MCI patients. We recruited 12 MCI subjects (mean age 70 +/- 6.7 years) through the Alzheimer Assessment Unit (UVA Unite) of ASL Lecce (Italy), and 12 healthy geriatric volunteers (HS) as the control group (mean age 64 +/- 6.0 years), all of whom were first evaluated via a panel of neuropsychological tests. Subjects were asked to perform an olfactory recognition task involving two scents: rose and eucalyptus, administrated in the context of an oddball task during EEG recordings. Olfactory event-related potential (OERP) components N1 and Late Positive Potential (LPC) were then analyzed as measures of the sensorial and perceptive aspects of the olfactory response, respectively. It was determined that, in the MCI group, both the N1 and LPC components were significantly different compared to those of the HS group during the execution of the oddball task. In particular, the N1 amplitude, was reduced, while the LPC amplitude was increased, indicating that a degree of perceptive compensation can occur when sensorial function is impaired. Further, a correlation analysis, involving OERP components and neuropsychological battery scores, indicated that impairment of olfactory perception may share common pathways with impairments of the spatial system and long-term memory processing.

However, the time course of this impact remains unclear. The present study examined how Christians process their own names, the name of their religious leader (i.e., Jesus), and a famous person's name (i.e., Yao Ming). Behavioral and EEG data were recorded while the participants performed a name-color judgment task for these three names. The behavioral data showed no significant differences in reaction time or accuracy among the names. However, the ERP data showed that the P200 and P300 amplitudes elicited by the self-name and religious leader name were larger than those elicited by the famous name. Furthermore, the self-name also elicited a larger P300 amplitude than the religious leader name did. These results suggested that both the self-name and the religious leader name were processed preferentially due to their important social value for the self as compared to a generally famous name. Importantly, the dissociation between the self-name and the religious leader name was observed at a high-order cognitive stage, which might be attributed to their different roles in one's self-concept.

Here we asked how basic units of visual information (spatial frequencies, or SF) contribute to this fundamental brain function. Human observers viewed initially blurry, unrecognizable natural object images presented at a fast 12 Hz rate and parametrically increasing in SF content over the course of 1 minute. By inserting highly variable natural face images as every 8th stimulus, we captured an objective neural index of face detection in participants' electroencephalogram (EEG) at exactly 1.5 Hz. This face-selective signal emerged over the right occipito-temporal cortex at < 5 cycles/image, suggesting that the brain can - at a single glance - discriminate vastly different faces from multiple unsegmented object categories using only very coarse visual information. Local features (e.g., eyes) are not yet discernable at this threshold, indicating that fast face detection critically relies on global facial configuration. Interestingly, the face-selective neural response continued to increase with additional higher SF content until saturation around > 50 cycles/image, potentially supporting higher-level recognition functions (e.g., facial identity recognition).

It is readily observed when emotional and neutral scenes are encoded and recalled together in a mixed list, but diminishes when these scenes are encoded separately in "pure" lists. We examined the hypothesis that this effect is due to differences in allocation of attention to neutral stimuli according to whether they are presented in mixed or pure lists, especially when encoding is intentional. Using picture stimuli that were controlled for semantic relatedness, our results contradicted this hypothesis. The amplitude of well-known electrophysiological markers of emotion-related attention-the early posterior negativity (EPN), the late positive potential (LPP), and the slow wave (SW)-was higher for emotional stimuli. Crucially, the emotional modulation of these ERPs was insensitive to list context, observed equally in pure and mixed lists. Although list context did not modulate neural markers of emotion-related attention, list context did modulate the effect of emotion on free recall. The apparent decoupling of the emotional effects on attention and memory, challenges existing hypotheses accounting for the emotional enhancement of memory. We close by discussing whether findings are more compatible with an alternative hypothesis, where the magnitude of emotional memory enhancement is, at least in part, a consequence of retrieval dynamics.

A number of studies suggested that the feedback-related negativity (FRN) component of an event-related potential, known to be associated with unexpected outcomes, encodes RPEs. While FRN was clearly shown to be sensitive to the probability of outcomes, the effect of outcome magnitude on FRN remains to be further clarified. In studies on the neural underpinnings of reward anticipation and outcome evaluation, a monetary incentive delay (MID) task proved to be particularly useful. We investigated whether feedback-locked FRN and cue-locked dN200 responses recorded during an auditory MID task were sensitive to the probability and magnitude of outcomes. The cue-locked dN200 is associated with the update of information about the magnitude of prospective outcomes. Overall, we showed that feedback-locked FRN was modulated by both the magnitude and the probability of outcomes during an auditory version of MID task, whereas no such effect was found for cue-locked dN200. Furthermore, the cue-locked dN200, which is associated with the update of information about the magnitude of prospective outcomes, correlated with the standard feedback-locked FRN, which is associated with a negative RPE. These results further expand our knowledge on the interplay between the processing of predictive cues that forecast future outcomes and the subsequent revision of these predictions during outcome delivery.

Although evidence that language modulates visual discrimination has been accumulating, little is known about the relation between language structure and consciousness. We employed electroencephalography and the attentional-blink paradigm, in which targets are often unnoticed. Native Greek speakers (N = 28), who distinguish categorically between light and dark shades of blue, showed boosted perception for this contrast compared with a verbally unmarked green contrast. Electrophysiological signatures of early visual processing predicted this behavioral advantage. German speakers (N = 29), who have only one category for light and dark shades of blue, showed no differences in perception between blue and green targets. The behavioral consequence of categorical perception was replicated with Russian speakers (N = 46), reproducing this novel finding. We conclude that linguistic enhancement of color contrasts provides targets with a head start in accessing visual consciousness. Our native language is thus one of the forces that determine what we consciously perceive.

However, their association remains incompletely understood. We investigated time-frequency and time-course effects in functional networks underlying the P300 and their involvement in reactive control. Electroencephalographic (EEG) data of three different age groups (30 young: 18-26 years, 30 mid-aged: 49-58 years, 30 elderly: 65-75 years) was measured while they performed a cued colour/thickness switching task. Neural data was analysed concerning the targets. To consider restart, mixing, and switching processes, the targets position after a cue (first or third target) as well as their context in the single-task (distractor cue) or the mixed-task block (switch- or repeat cue) was analysed. P300 EEG data was decomposed by means of group-independent component and time-frequency analyses focusing on theta and beta oscillations. RTs generally slowed down with age (main effect group), and effects were specifically strong in targets after a switching cue (larger Cohens d). Peaking at around 300 ms, we detected five functionally independent networks reflecting the multicomponent process underlying task-switching. These networks differed in terms of their topography (parietal and frontal), their involvement in task processes (switch-specific, mixing-, restart-, and single-task processes) and in terms of frequency effects. All were affected by age, as indicated by amplitude changes of the target-P300 and power reductions most consistently shown in beta oscillations. Most extensive age-related changes were observed in one parietal network sensitive to mixing and restart processes. Changes included a topography shift, P300 and beta amplitudes, and were ongoing in the elderly group.

Reliability and robustness of feedback-evoked brain-heart coupling after placebo, dopamine, and noradrenaline challenge	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cortico-cardiac coupling; Dopamine; Noradrenaline; FRN; P300; Heart period	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; NEUROVISCERAL INTEGRATION; CARDIOVASCULAR REACTIVITY; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; ORIENTING RESPONSE; AUTONOMIC ACTIVITY; REWARD MAGNITUDE; BLOOD-PRESSURE	External and internal performance feedback triggers not only neural but also cardiac modulations, suggesting communication between brain and heart during feedback processing. Using Cardio-Electroencephalographic Covariance Tracing (CECT), it has accordingly been shown that feedback-evoked centromedial single-trial EEG at the P300 latency intraindividually predicts subsequent changes in heart period - the so called N300H phenomenon. While previous findings suggest that the N300H depends on serotonin, its relationship to central dopamine and noradrenaline is currently unknown. Here, we tested (1) the psychometric properties of this CECT-based component and (2) its putative catecholaminergic mechanisms. N = 54 healthy male participants received either a alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist (yohimbine, 10 mg; n = 18), D-2-dopamine-receptor antagonist (sulpiride, 200 mg; n = 18), or a placebo (n = 18). Afterwards, they performed a gambling task with feedback after each trial, while EEG and ECG were recorded. Feedback successfully evoked a significant N300H both across all 54 participants and within each substance group. Importantly, we show that N300H can be reliably measured in a priori defined time windows with as few as 240 feedback trials and is relatively unaffected when removing extreme single-trial values. However, we could not find any significant substance effects on N300H magnitude as well as on univariate feedback-related measures (FRN, P300, heart period). Altogether, the N300H component proves as a robust and reliable marker of cortico-cardiac coupling evoked by feedback. Furthermore, these findings suggest a subordinate role of catecholamines (i.e., noradrenaline and dopamine) and sympathetic pathways in feedback-evoked brain-heart communication as measured with N300H.

EEG Source Imaging Indices of Cognitive Control Show Associations with Dopamine System Genes	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						EEG; Genetics; DRD4; COMT; ICA; Measure projection	CATECHOL-O-METHYLTRANSFERASE; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; MOLECULAR-GENETICS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; VAL(158)MET GENOTYPE; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS	Cognitive or executive control is a critical mental ability, an important marker of mental illness, and among the most heritable of neurocognitive traits. Two candidate genes, catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and DRD4, which both have a roles in the regulation of cortical dopamine, have been consistently associated with cognitive control. Here, we predicted that individuals with the COMT Met/Met allele would show improved response execution and inhibition as indexed by event-related potentials in a Go/NoGo task, while individuals with the DRD4 7-repeat allele would show impaired brain activity. We used independent component analysis (ICA) to separate brain source processes contributing to high-density EEG scalp signals recorded during the task. As expected, individuals with the DRD4 7-repeat polymorphism had reduced parietal P3 source and scalp responses to response (Go) compared to those without the 7-repeat. Contrary to our expectation, the COMT homozygous Met allele was associated with a smaller frontal P3 source and scalp response to response-inhibition (NoGo) stimuli, suggesting that while more dopamine in frontal cortical areas has advantages in some tasks, it may also compromise response inhibition function. An interaction effect emerged for P3 source responses to Go stimuli. These were reduced in those with both the 7-repeat DRD4 allele and either the COMT Val/Val or the Met/Met homozygous polymorphisms but not in those with the heterozygous Val/Met polymorphism. This epistatic interaction between DRD4 and COMT replicates findings that too little or too much dopamine impairs cognitive control. The anatomic and functional separated maximally independent cortical EEG sources proved more informative than scalp channel measures for genetic studies of brain function and thus better elucidate the complex mechanisms in psychiatric illness.

Due to non-stationary nature of EEG series in addition to the assumption that the high-frequency band is possibly associated with emotional activation, WC has been applied to five distinct frequency band activities (fba) (Delta: , Theta: , Alpha: , Beta: , Gamma: ) embedded in non-averaged single-trial EEG series mediated by convenient affective pictures from International Affective Picture System. Experimental data were collected from both healthy controls and patients, diagnosed with first-episode psychosis, through a 16-channel EEG cap. WC estimations, which are computed for eight electrode pairs (pre-frontal, anterio-frontal, central, parietal, occipital, posterio-frontal, anterio-temporal, posterio-temporal), in accordance with each specified fba and emotional state (pleasant, un-pleasant, neutral) have been classified by using Least Squares Support Vector Machines with tenfold cross-validation to distinguish controls from patients. Results show that the highest classification accuracies of 88.06, 86.39, 83.89% are obtained in Gamma with respect to neutral, un-pleasant, and pleasant stimuli, respectively. In each group (controls and patients), the largest WCs are observed at anterio-frontal and central lobes; however, controls generate the high WC in response to pleasant stimuli, whereas the patients generate the high WC in response to neutral stimuli in Gamma. In conclusion, fronto-central lobes are the most activated brain regions during emotional stimulation by means of inter-hemispheric correlation. Gamma is the most sensitive fba to visual affective pictures. Emotional dysfunctions are found to be characterized by decreased WC in pleasant state, increased WC in neutral state in Gamma.

Given that higher aggression levels are associated with worse behavioral inhibition and that athletes show better behavioral inhibition than non-athletes, it is unclear why contact athletes would exhibit higher aggression levels. Emotion, especially anger, is an important factor in the generation of aggressive behavior, and anger has been shown to affect behavioral inhibition. Thus, the present study examined the influence of anger on behavioral inhibition in contact athletes. An implicit emotional Go/No-go task was used that contained 50 anger-associated words and 50 neutral words as stimuli. Participants were asked to execute a key press depending on the explicit color of word and to ignore any (implicit) emotional information associated with the word. The results showed a significant interaction in performance accuracy on the No-go task between emotion (i.e., anger-associated words versus neutral words) and group (athlete versus non-athlete). The performance accuracy of the contact athletes on anger-associated stimuli was significantly lower than that for neutral stimuli. Evoked delta and theta oscillations were analyzed at the time windows 200-600 and 200-400 ms respectively in both groups. A time-frequency analysis indicated a significant interaction between group, emotion and task for both evoked delta and theta oscillations. Post hoc analyses showed that stronger evoked delta and theta oscillations were evoked during the presentation of anger-associated stimuli compared with neutral stimuli on the No-go task in athletes. By contrast, no other significant effect was found in the control group or between the control and athlete groups. These results indicate that time-frequency analysis can effectively distinguish conventional ERP components and that implicit anger significantly weakens behavioral inhibition in contact athletes but not in non-athletes.

Evaluating the impact of fast-fMRI on dynamic functional connectivity in an event-based paradigm	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; PULSE ARTIFACT; BRAIN; TIME; SYSTEM; BOLD; MRI	The human brain is known to contain several functional networks that interact dynamically. Therefore, it is desirable to analyze the temporal features of these networks by dynamic functional connectivity (dFC). A sliding window approach was used in an event-related fMRI (visual stimulation using checkerboards) to assess the impact of repetition time (TR) and window size on the temporal features of BOLD dFC. In addition, we also examined the spatial distribution of dFC and tested the feasibility of this approach for the analysis of interictal epileptiforme discharges. 15 healthy controls (visual stimulation paradigm) and three patients with epilepsy (EEG-fMRI) were measured with EPI-fMRI. We calculated the functional connectivity degree (FCD) by determining the total number of connections of a given voxel above a predefined threshold based on Pearson correlation. FCD could capture hemodynamic changes relative to stimulus onset in controls. A significant effect of TR and window size was observed on FCD estimates. At a conventional TR of 2.6 s, FCD values were marginal compared to FCD values using sub-seconds TRs achievable with multiband (MB) fMRI. Concerning window sizes, a specific maximum of FCD values (inverted u-shape behavior) was found for each TR, indicating a limit to the possible gain in FCD for increasing window size. In patients, a dynamic FCD change was found relative to the onset of epilepti-form EEG patterns, which was compatible with their clinical semiology. Our findings indicate that dynamic FCD transients are better detectable with sub-second TR than conventional TR. This approach was capable of capturing neuronal connectivity across various regions of the brain, indicating a potential to study the temporal characteristics of interictal epileptiform discharges and seizures in epilepsy patients or other brain diseases with brief events.

The functional significance of the N300 component	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Object identification; Context; Object-scene relations; N300; EEG	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SCENE CONTEXT; SEMANTIC INTEGRATION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; N400; RECOGNITION; LANGUAGE; IDENTIFICATION; COGNITION; DECISION	Objects in the real world typically appear within a broader context, having relationships with the environment. Do these relations between objects and the contexts in which they appear affect object identification? Previous findings of an N300 component evoked by scene-incongruent objects were taken as evidence for such an effect, since N300 is held to reflect object identification processes. Yet this conjuncture was never directly tested, and ignores differences between the fronto-central incongruency-evoked N300 and the typically bi-polar frontooccipital identification-related N300. Here, the possible influence of context on object identification was examined by manipulating both object-scene congruency and object identifiability. N300 effects were found both for incongruity and for identifiability, in line with previous studies. Critically, a comparison of divergence times of waveforms evoked by congruent/incongruent objects and waveforms evoked by unidentifiable objects showed that incongruent objects started to diverge from unidentifiable ones later than congruent objects did. This provides first direct evidence for the effect of scene context on object identification; arguably, rapidly extracted gist activates scene-congruent schemas which facilitate the identification of congruent objects in comparison to incongruent ones.

EEG recording blocks consisted of targets preceded by either randomized sequences of standards or by sequences including a predictive sequence signaling the occurrence of a target event. PD patients ("on" medication) and healthy controls performed two sessions: in the first the regularity of the predictive sequence was implicit, while in the second this regularity was made explicit. PD and control subjects showed shorter reaction times for predicted versus random targets across both the implicit and explicit sessions. Healthy controls showed a facilitation of the P3b latency for predicted targets (compared with random targets) in both the implicit and explicit sessions, while PD patients showed no significant P3b latency differences between the two target conditions across both sessions. In healthy controls the P3b amplitude of the last most-informative stimulus of the predictive sequence (n-1) was larger in the explicit compared to the implicit session, while this difference was absent in PD patients. Functional connectivity measures showed that during the explicit and implicit sessions detection of n-1 was associated with higher gamma values and weaker fronto-central-parietal connections, in the theta band, in PD compared to controls. The findings suggest that implicit and explicit processing of predictive contextual information is altered in PD patients and that this may be associated with functional connectivity abnormalities within top-down frontal networks.

In humans, these salient sensory events generate large electrocortical responses, which have been traditionally interpreted within the sensory domain. Here we describe a basic physiological mechanism coupling saliency-related cortical responses with motor output. In four experiments conducted on 70 healthy participants, we show that salient substartle sensory stimuli modulate isometric force exertion by human participants, and that this modulation is tightly coupled with electrocortical activity elicited by the same stimuli. We obtained four main results. First, the force modulation follows a complex triphasic pattern consisting of alternating decreases and increases of force, time-locked to stimulus onset. Second, this modulation occurs regardless of the sensory modality of the eliciting stimulus. Third, the magnitude of the force modulation is predicted by the amplitude of the electrocortical activity elicited by the same stimuli. Fourth, both neural and motor effects are not reflexive but depend on contextual factors. Together, these results indicate that sudden environmental stimuli have an immediate effect on motor processing, through a tight corticomuscular coupling. These observations suggest that saliency detection is not merely perceptive but reactive, preparing the animal for subsequent appropriate actions.

J	Rothmaler, K; Ivanova, G				Rothmaler, Katrin; Ivanova, Galina			The HEURECA method: Tracking multiple phase coupling dynamics on a single trial basis	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Spatiotemporal; Phase coupling; EEG; Synchrostate; Adaptive segmentation; Circular correlation; Multivariate; Single trial; Complex cognitive phenomena	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN SIGNALS; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNALS; SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; SEGMENTATION; COGNITION; STATES	Background: Although acquisition techniques have improved tremendously, the neuroscientific understanding of complex cognitive phenomena is still incomplete. One of the reasons for this shortcoming may be the lack of sophisticated signal processing methods. Complex cognitive phenomena usually involve various mental subprocesses whose temporal occurrence varies from trial to trial. Mostly, these mental subprocesses require large-scale integration processes between multiple brain areas that are most likely mediated by complex, non-linear phase coupling mechanisms. Consequently, a spatiotemporal analysis of complex, multivariate phase synchronization patterns on a single trial basis is necessary. New method: This paper introduces the HEURECA method (How to Evaluate and Uncover Recurring EEG Coupling Arrangements) that enables the dynamic detection of distinguishable multivariate functional connectivity states in the electroencephalogram. HEURECA adaptively divides a trial into segments of quasi-stable phase coupling topographies and assigns similar topographies to the same synchrostate cluster. Results: HEURECA is evaluated by means of simulated data. The results show that it reliably reconstructs a time series of recurring phase coupling topographies and successfully gathers them into clusters of interpretable neural synchrostates. The advantages and unique features of HEURECA are further illustrated by investigating the popular complex cognitive phenomenon insight. Comparison with existing methods: Unlike existing methods, HEURECA detects complex phase relationships between more than two signals and is applicable to single trials. Conclusions: Since HEURECA is applicable to all kinds of circular data, it not only provides new insights into insight, but also into a variety of other phenomena in neuroscience, physics or other scientific fields.

Immediate stimulus repetition abolishes stimulus expectation and surprise effects in fast periodic visual oddball designs	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Oddball design; Visual mismatch response; Repetition suppression; Stimulus expectation; EEG; Periodicity	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; DEVIANCE DETECTION; SUPPRESSION; ADAPTATION; MEMORY; PROBABILITY; CORTEX; PREDICTION; MECHANISMS	Oddball designs are widely used to investigate the sensitivity of the visual system to statistical regularities in sensory environments. However, the underlying mechanisms that give rise to visual mismatch responses remain unknown. Much research has focused on identifying separable, additive effects of stimulus repetition and stimulus appearance probability (expectation/surprise) but findings from non-oddball designs indicate that these effects also interact. We adapted the fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS) unfamiliar face identity oddball design (Liu-Shuang a al., 2014) to test for both additive and interactive effects of stimulus repetition and stimulus expectation. In two experiments, a given face identity was presented at a 6 Hz periodic rate; a different identity face (the oddball) appeared as every 7th image in the sequence (i.e., a 0.857 Hz). Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded during these stimulation sequences. In Experiment 1, we tested for surprise responses evoked by unexpected face image repetitions by replacing 10% of the commonly-presented oddball faces with exact repetitions of the base rate face identity image. In Experiment 2, immediately repeated or unrepeated face identity oddballs were presented in high and low presentation probability contexts (i.e., expected or surprising contexts), allowing assessment of expectation effects on responses to both repeated and unrepeated stimuli. Across both experiments objective (i.e., frequency-locked) visual mismatch responses driven by stimulus expectation were only found for oddball faces of a different identity to base rate faces (i.e., unrepeated identity oddballs). Our results show that immediate stimulus repetition (i.e., repetition suppression) can reduce or abolish expectation effects as indexed by EEG responses in visual oddball designs.

By combining a dual-choice task with a go/nogoparadigm focusing on the LRP and N200-effect, we could estimate the processing times and onsets of both types of face processing. The analyses of the LRP revealed that gender aspects were processed much earlier than attractiveness. Whereas gender was already analysed 243.9 ms post-stimulus onset, attractiveness came into play 58.6 ms later, i.e. after a post-stimulus onset delay of 302.5 ms. This resulting pattern was mirrored by the analyses of the N200-effect, an effect available mainly frontally which is supposed to correlate with the inhibition of inappropriate responses. Taking the onset of the N200 effect as an estimator for the moment at which information has been processed sufficiently for task decision, we could trace the N200 effect at 152.0 ms for go/nogo-decision on gender, while not as early as 206.7 ms on attractiveness. In sum, processing of facial attractiveness seems to be based on gender-specific aesthetic pre-processing, for instance via activating gender-specific attractiveness prototypes which show focused processing of certain facial aspects.

Methods: We analyzed electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings from 63 patients with focal epilepsy, and delineated the spatial-temporal dynamics of visually-elicited high-gamma70-110 Hz amplitudes on a standard brain template. We then clarified the neuronal events underlying visual evoked potential (VEP) components, by correlating with high-gamma amplitude measures. Results: The medial-occipital cortex initially revealed rapid neural activation followed by prolonged suppression, reflected by augmentation of high-gamma activity lasting up to 100 ms followed by attenuation lasting up to 1000 ms, respectively. With a number of covariate factors incorporated into a prediction model, the eccentricity representation independently predicted the magnitude of post-activation suppression, which was more intense in regions representing more parafoveal visual fields compared to those of more peripheral fields. The initial negative component on VEP was sharply contoured and co-occurred with early high-gamma augmentation, whose offset then co-occurred with a large positive VEP peak. A delayed negative VEP peak was blunt and co-occurred with prolonged high-gamma attenuation. Conclusions: Eccentricity-dependent gradient in neural suppression in the medial-occipital region may explain the functional difference between peripheral and parafoveal/ central vision. Early negative and positive VEP components may reflect neural activation, whereas a delayed negative VEP peak reflecting neural suppression.

However, the restoration of motor function following lesions of the corticospinal tract requires also the recruitment of additional neurons to increase the net corticospinal output. For this purpose, we investigated a novel protocol based on brain state-dependent paired associative stimulation. Motor imagery (MI)-related electroencephalography was recorded in healthy males and females for brain state-dependent control of both cortical and peripheral stimulation in a brain-machine interface environment. State-dependency was investigated with concurrent, delayed, and independent stimulation relative to the MI task. Specifically, sensorimotor event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the beta-band (16-22 Hz) triggered peripheral stimulation through passive hand opening by a robotic orthosis and transcranial magnetic stimulation to the respective cortical motor representation, either synchronously or subsequently. These MI-related paradigms were compared with paired cortical and peripheral input applied independent of the brain state. Cortical stimulation resulted in a significant increase in corticospinal excitability only when applied brain state-dependently and synchronously to peripheral input. These gains were resistant to a depotentiation task, revealed a nonlinear evolution of plasticity, and were mediated via the recruitment of additional corticospinal neurons rather than via synchronization of neuronal firing. Recruitment of additional corticospinal pathways may be achieved when cortical and peripheral inputs are applied concurrently, andduring beta-ERD. These findings resemble a gating mechanism and are potentially important for developing closed-loop brain stimulation for the treatment of hand paralysis following lesions of the corticospinal tract.

Brain-machine interfaces for rehabilitation in stroke: A review	NEUROREHABILITATION			English	Review						Brain-machine interfaces (BMI); stroke; rehabilitation; neuroplasticity; motor recovery	FUNCTIONAL ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; INDUCED MOVEMENT THERAPY; COMPUTER INTERFACE; MOTOR IMAGERY; ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SIGNALS; PROPORTIONAL RECOVERY; CORTICAL POTENTIALS; EEG; GAIT	BACKGROUND: Motor paralysis after stroke has devastating consequences for the patients, families and caregivers. Although therapies have improved in the recent years, traditional rehabilitation still fails in patients with severe paralysis. Brain-machine interfaces (BMI) have emerged as a promising tool to guide motor rehabilitation interventions as they can be applied to patients with no residual movement. OBJECTIVE: This paper reviews the efficiency of BMI technologies to facilitate neuroplasticity and motor recovery after stroke. METHODS: We provide an overview of the existing rehabilitation therapies for stroke, the rationale behind the use of BMIs for motor rehabilitation, the current state of the art and the results achieved so far with BMI-based interventions, as well as the future perspectives of neural-machine interfaces. RESULTS: Since the first pilot study by Buch and colleagues in 2008, several controlled clinical studies have been conducted, demonstrating the efficacy of BMIs to facilitate functional recovery in completely paralyzed stroke patients with noninvasive technologies such as the electroencephalogram (EEG). CONCLUSIONS: Despite encouraging results, motor rehabilitation based on BMIs is still in a preliminary stage, and further improvements are required to boost its efficacy. Invasive and hybrid approaches are promising and might set the stage for the next generation of stroke rehabilitation therapies.

EEG Multiscale Complexity in Schizophrenia During Picture Naming	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						schizophrenia; EEG; non-linear analysis; multiscale lempel-ziv complexity; naming task	LEMPEL-ZIV COMPLEXITY; FORMAL THOUGHT-DISORDER; SYNDROME SCALE PANSS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DIMENSIONAL COMPLEXITY; COGNITIVE TASKS; TIME-SERIES; OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; DYSFUNCTION	Introduction: Patients with schizophrenia show cognitive deficits that are evident both behaviourally and with EEG recordings. Recent studies have suggested that non-linear analyses of EEG might more adequately reflect the complex, irregular, non-stationary behavior of neural processes than more traditional ERP measures. Non-linear analyses have been mainly applied to EEGs from patients at rest, whereas differences in complexity might be more evident during task performance. Objective: We aimed to investigate changes in non-linear brain dynamics of patients with schizophrenia during cognitive processing. Method: 18 patients and 17 matched healthy controls were asked to name pictures. EEG data were collected at rest and while they were performing a naming task. EEGs were analyzed with the classical Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC) and with the Multiscale LZC. Electrodes were grouped in seven regions of interest (ROI). Results: As expected, controls had fewer naming errors than patients. Regarding EEG complexity, the interaction between Group, Task and ROI indicated that patients showed higher complexity values in right frontal regions only at rest, where no differences in complexity between patients and controls were found during the naming task. EEG complexity increased from rest to task in controls in left temporal-parietal regions, while no changes from rest to task were observed in patients. Finally, differences in complexity between patients and controls depended on the frequency bands: higher values of complexity in patients at rest were only observed in fast bands, indicating greater heterogeneity in patients in local dynamics of neuronal assemblies. Conclusion: Consistent with previous studies, schizophrenic patients showed higher complexity than controls in frontal regions at rest. Interestingly, we found different modulations of brain complexity during a simple cognitive task between patients and controls. These data can be interpreted as indicating schizophrenia-related failures to adapt brain functioning to the task, which is reflected in poorer behavioral performance. Highlights: - We measured classical and multiscale Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZCN and MLZC) of the EEG signal of patients with schizophrenia and controls at rest and while performing a cognitive task. - We found that patients and controls showed a different pattern of brain complexity depending on their cognitive state (at rest or under cognitive challenge). - Our results illustrate the value of the MLZC in the characterization of the pattern of brain complexity in schizophrenia on function of frequency bands. - Nonlinear methodologies of EEG analysis can help to characterize brain dysfunction in schizophrenia.

From an early age, children show a natural tendency to sort people into groups and discriminate among them. The computations guiding evaluation of third-party behaviors are complex, requiring integration of intent, consequences, and knowledge of group affiliation. This study examined how perceiving third-party morally laden behavior influences children's likelihood to exhibit or reduce group bias. Following a minimal group paradigm assignment, young children (4-7 years) performed a moral evaluation task where group affiliations and moral actions were systematically juxtaposed, so that they were exposed to disproportionately antisocial in-group and prosocial out-group scenarios. Electroencephalography was recorded, and group preference was assessed with a resource allocation game before and after the EEG session. Across all children, evaluations of others' moral actions arose from early and automatic processing (similar to 150 ms), followed by later interactive processing of affiliation and moral valence (similar to 500 ms). Importantly, individual differences in bias manifestation and attitude change were predicted by children's neural responses. Children with high baseline bias selectively exhibited a rapid detection (similar to 200 ms) of scenarios inconsistent with their bias (in-group harm and out-group help). Changes in bias corresponded to distinct patterns in longer latency neural processing. These new developmental neuroscience findings elucidate the multifaceted processing involved in moral evaluation of others' actions, their group affiliations, the nature of the integration of both into full judgments, and the relation of individual differences in neural responses to social decision-making in childhood.

Using a motor imagery-based BCI paradigm, we previously found a disinhibition within the primary motor cortex contralateral to the imagined movement, as evidenced by event-related desynchronization (ERD) of oscillatory cortical activity. Yet it is unclear whether this BCI approach does selectively facilitate corticomotor representations targeted by the imagery. To address this question, we used brain state-dependent transcranial magnetic stimulation while participants performed kinesthetic motor imagery of wrist movements with their right hand and received online visual feedback of the ERD. Single and paired-pulse magnetic stimulation were given to the left primary motor cortex at a low or high level of ERD to assess intracortical excitability. While intracortical facilitation showed no modulation by ERD, short-latency intracortical inhibition was reduced the higher the ERD. Intracortical disinhibition was only found in the agonist muscle targeted by motor imagery at high ERD level, but not in the antagonist muscle. Single pulse motor-evoked potential was also increased the higher the ERD. However, at high ERD level, this facilitatory effect on overall corticospinal excitability was not selective to the agonist muscle. Analogous results were found in two independent experiments, in which participants either performed kinesthetic motor imagery of wrist extension or flexion. Our results showed that motor imagery-based BCI can selectively disinhibit the corticomotor output to the agonist muscle, enabling effector-specific training in patients with motor paralysis.

Association of preterm birth with ADHD-like cognitive impairments and additional subtle impairments in attention and arousal malleability	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						ADHD; adolescents; arousal; cognitive impairments; EEG; preterm birth	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; REACTION-TIME VARIABILITY; DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; SKIN-CONDUCTANCE; BRAIN-FUNCTION; CHILDREN BORN; RISK-FACTORS; AGE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; METAANALYSIS	Background. Whilst preterm-born individuals have an increased risk of developing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and are reported to have ADHD-like attention and arousal impairments, direct group comparisons are scarce. Methods. We directly compared preterm-born adolescents (n = 186) to term-born adolescents with ADHD (n = 69), and term-born controls (n = 135), aged 11-23, on cognitive-performance, event-related potential and skin conductance level (SCL) measures associated with attention and arousal. The measures are from baseline and fast-incentive conditions of a four-choice reaction time task, previously shown to discriminate between the individuals with ADHD and controls. We aimed to establish whether preterm-born adolescents show: (a) identical cognitive-neurophysiological impairments to term-born adolescents with ADHD (b) possible additional impairments, and whether (c) the observed impairments correlate with ADHD symptom scores. Results. The preterm group, like the term-born ADHD group, showed increased mean reaction time (MRT) and reaction time variability (RTV) in the baseline condition, and attenuated contingent negative variation (CNV) amplitude (response preparation) in the fast-incentive condition. The preterm group, only, did not show significant within-group adjustments in P3 amplitude (attention allocation) and SCL (peripheral arousal). Dimensional analyses showed that ADHD symptoms scores correlated significantly with MRT, RTV and CNV amplitude only. Conclusions. We find impairments in cognition and brain function in preterm-born adolescents that are linked to increased ADHD symptoms, as well as further impairments, in lack of malleability in neurophysiological processes. Our findings indicate that such impairments extend at least to adolescence. Future studies should extend these investigations into adulthood.

J	Brydevall, M; Bennett, D; Murawski, C; Bode, S				Brydevall, Maja; Bennett, Daniel; Murawski, Carsten; Bode, Stefan			The neural encoding of information prediction errors during non-instrumental information seeking	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; REWARD PREDICTION; PREFERENCE; CHOICE; COMPONENT; DOPAMINE; REFLECTS	In a dynamic world, accurate beliefs about the environment are vital for survival, and individuals should therefore regularly seek out new information with which to update their beliefs. This aspect of behaviour is not well captured by standard theories of decision making, and the neural mechanisms of information seeking remain unclear. One recent theory posits that valuation of information results from representation of informative stimuli within canonical neural reward-processing circuits, even if that information lacks instrumental use. We investigated this question by recording EEG from twenty-three human participants performing a non-instrumental information-seeking task. In this task, participants could pay a monetary cost to receive advance information about the likelihood of receiving reward in a lottery at the end of each trial. Behavioural results showed that participants were willing to incur considerable monetary costs to acquire early but non-instrumental information. Analysis of the event-related potential elicited by informative cues revealed that the feedback-related negativity independently encoded both an information prediction error and a reward prediction error. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that information seeking results from processing of information within neural reward circuits, and suggests that information may represent a distinct dimension of valuation in decision making under uncertainty.

This technology still suffers from both low communication/high error rates. A P300 speller, named PolyMorph, which jointly introduces the selection matrix polymorphism (reducing the matrix size by removing useless symbols) and sentence-based predictions (which forecast words on the basis of language statistics) is presented. This is accomplished by using a custom dynamic knowledge-base, tailored to the subject lexicon, and updated in real time with the selections of the subject. The effectiveness of the presented speller is measured in vivo and in silico. The results suggest that the use of PolyMorph increases the number of spelt characters per time unit and reduces the error rate.

On the role of asymmetric frontal cortical activity in approach and withdrawal motivation: An updated review of the evidence	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						emotion; frontal asymmetry; motivation	ACTION-BASED MODEL; CURRENT STIMULATION INCREASES; PREFRONTAL BRAIN ASYMMETRY; TRAIT APPROACH MOTIVATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EEG ASYMMETRY; BEHAVIORAL-APPROACH; AFFECTIVE RESPONSES; APPETITIVE STIMULI; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES	We review conceptual arguments and research on the role of asymmetric frontal cortical activity in emotional and motivational processes. The current article organizes and reviews research on asymmetrical frontal cortical activity by focusing on research that has measured trait (baseline) frontal asymmetry and related it to other individual differences measures related to motivation (e.g., anger, bipolar disorder). The review also covers research that has measured state frontal asymmetry in response to situational manipulations of motivation and emotion and as an intervening variable in motivation-cognition interactions. This review concludes that much research supports the view that greater left than right frontal cortical activity is associated with greater positively or negatively valenced approach motivation. The view that greater right than left frontal cortical activity is associated with withdrawal motivation, although supported, has received less empirical attention. In addition to reviewing research on the emotive functions of asymmetric frontal cortical activity, the reviewed research illustrates the need to consider motivational direction as separate from affective valence in conceptual models of emotional space.

Modulation of reward in a live social context as revealed through interactive social neuroscience	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Autism spectrum disorder; EEG/ERP; reward; interactive social neuroscience	AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER; FUNCTIONING AUTISM; SEX-DIFFERENCES; FEEDBACK; NEGATIVITY; POTENTIALS; STIMULI; CORTEX; BRAIN; ANTICIPATION	Social neuroscience research investigating autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has yielded inconsistent findings, despite ASD being well-characterized by difficulties in social interaction and communication through behavioral observation. In particular, specific etiologies and functional and structural assays of the brain in autism have not been consistently identified. To date, most social neuroscience research has focused on a single person viewing static images. Research utilizing interactive social neuroscience featuring dual-brain recording offers great promise for the study of neurodevelopmental disabilities. Reward processing has been implicated in the pathology of ASD, yet mixed findings have brought uncertainty about the role reward processing deficits may play in ASD. The current study employed dual-brain EEG recording to examine reward processing during live interaction and its relation to autistic traits. Sixteen typically developing (TD) adults played a competitive treasure-hunt game against a computer and against a human partner. EEG results revealed enhanced neural sensitivity to reward outcome during live interaction with a human competitor. Further, individuals with higher levels of autistic traits demonstrated reduced sensitivity to reward outcome during live interaction. These findings provide novel insight into reward processing mechanisms associated with autistic traits, as well as support the necessary utility of interactive social neuroscience techniques to study developmental disorders.

Stimuli were strongly and weakly constraining sentences (as measured by cloze probability), which ended with the most expected word based on those constraints or an unexpected but plausible word. Community-dwelling adults with varying literacy skills listened to continuous speech while their EEG was recorded. Participants, regardless of literacy level, showed N400 effects yoked to the cloze probability of the targets, with larger N400 amplitudes for less expected than more expected words. However, literacy-related differences emerged in an earlier time window of 170-300 ms: higher literacy adults produced a reduced negativity for strongly predictable targets over anterior channels, similar to previously reported effects on the Phonological Mapping Negativity (PMN), whereas low-literacy adults did not. Collectively, these findings suggest that in auditory sentence processing literacy may not notably affect the incremental activation of semantic features, but that comprehenders with underdeveloped literacy skills may be less likely to engage predictive processing. Thus, basic mechanisms of comprehension may be recruited differently as a function of literacy development-even in spoken language.	[Ng, Shukhan; Payne, Brennan R.; Stine-Morrow, Elizabeth A.

Brainstem-cortical functional connectivity for speech is differentially challenged by noise and reverberation	HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article						Auditory scene analysis; Distributed source analysis; Event-related potentials (ERPs); Frequency-following response (FFR); Speech processing; Functional connectivity	FREQUENCY-FOLLOWING RESPONSES; CONCURRENT SOUND SEGREGATION; AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; BACKGROUND-NOISE; CATEGORICAL PERCEPTION; INTRACEREBRAL SOURCES; TRANSFER ENTROPY; HEARING; COMPLEX; EEG	Everyday speech perception is challenged by external acoustic interferences that hinder verbal communication. Here, we directly compared how different levels of the auditory system (brainstem vs. cortex) code speech and how their neural representations are affected by two acoustic stressors: noise and reverberation. We recorded multichannel (64 ch) brainstem frequency-following responses (FFRs) and cortical event-related potentials (ERPs) simultaneously in normal hearing individuals to speech sounds presented in mild and moderate levels of noise and reverb. We matched signal-to-noise and direct-to-reverberant ratios to equate the severity between classes of interference. Electrode recordings were parsed into source waveforms to assess the relative contribution of region-specific brain areas [i.e., brainstem (BS), primary auditory cortex (A1), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)]. Results showed that reverberation was less detrimental to (and in some cases facilitated) the neural encoding of speech compared to additive noise. Inter-regional correlations revealed associations between BS and A1 responses, suggesting subcortical speech representations influence higher auditory-cortical areas. Functional connectivity analyses further showed that directed signaling toward A1 in both feedforward cortico-collicular (BS -> A1) and feedback cortico-cortical (IFG -> A1) pathways were strong predictors of degraded speech perception and differentiated "good" vs. "poor" perceivers. Our findings demonstrate a functional interplay within the brain's speech network that depends on the form and severity of acoustic interference. We infer that in addition to the quality of neural representations within individual brain regions, listeners' success at the "cocktail party" is modulated based on how information is transferred among subcortical and cortical hubs of the auditory-linguistic network.

Studies differ on whether participants with developmental dyslexia are recruited based on reading skills only or reading as well as spelling skills. The current study contrasts the contribution of impaired reading and spelling to ERP correlates of print sensitivity, lexico-semantic access and sensitivity to orthographic regularities. Four groups of children were recruited: isolated reading deficit, isolated spelling deficit, combined reading and spelling deficit, and typically developing. Their neural correlates (EEG) of word, pseudohomophone, and pseudoword reading, as well as false font processing were compared. 1) All groups showed higher N1 amplitudes to letters than to false fonts. 2) Good spellers exhibited more negative N400 amplitudes for meaningless (pseudowords) than for meaningful stimuli (words and pseudohomophones). This effect was not observed in poor spellers. 3) Good readers showed sensitivity to orthographic regularities in a later time window (700-900 ms), whereas this was not the case for poor readers. 1) Print sensitivity is not affected by reading and/or spelling deficit in German-speaking 3rd graders. 2) Spelling deficits are associated with a reduced orthographic lexicon, 3) Reading deficits are associated with atypical use of sublexical information. As this effect was observed after lexico-semantic access, the results are discussed in terms of a possible orthographic reanalysis hypothesis.

Magnetoencephalography reveals an increased non-target P3a, but not target P3b, that is associated with high non-clinical psychosocial deficits	PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH-NEUROIMAGING			English	Article						Auditory oddball; P300; Autism; Schizotypy; Social Disorganisation	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SCHIZOTYPAL PERSONALITY; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; HIGH-RISK; 1ST-EPISODE PSYCHOSIS; ASPERGER-SYNDROME; WORKING-MEMORY; EEG-DATA; SCHIZOPHRENIA	Auditory processing deficits are frequently identified in autism and schizophrenia, and the two disorders have been shown to share psychosocial difficulties. This study used magnetoencephalography to investigate auditory processing differences for those with a high degree of a non-clinical autistic and schizotypal trait phenotype, Social Disorganisation (SD). Participants were 18 low (9 female) and 19 high (9 female) SD scorers (18-40 years) who completed a three-stimulus auditory oddball paradigm of speech sounds (standard: 100 ms 'o', deviant: 150 ms 'o', novel: 150 ms 'e'). Spatio-temporal cluster analysis revealed increased amplitude for the high SD group in a left (p = 0.006) and a right (p = 0.020) hemisphere cluster in response to the novel non-target. No cluster differences were found in response to the target deviant. These findings suggest that those with a high degree of the SD phenotype recruit more cortical resources when processing unattended, novel speech stimuli, which may lead to psychosocial deficits.

By integrating these two streams of research, the present study assessed the effect of two anaesthetic agents (i.e. propofol and midazolam) on audio-spatial feature binding. We also recorded the electrophysiological activity of the frontal channels. Using pharmacokinetic simulation, we determined the effect-site concentration (Ce) of the anaesthetics at loss of response to verbal command and eyelash reflex. We subsequently adjusted Ce to 75%, 50% and 25% of Ce-LOC to achieve deep, moderate and light sedation, respectively. Behavioural results showed that moderate sedation selectively disrupted feature binding. The frontal channels showed a P3 component (350-600ms peristimulus period) following the presentation of audio-spatial stimuli at baseline and under moderate and light sedations. Critically, the late event-related potential component (600-1000 ms) returned to the pre-activated level (0-350 ms) at baseline and under light sedation but was sustained under moderate sedation. We propose that audio-spatial feature binding may require the presence of a P3 component and its subsequent and sufficient decline, as under anaesthetic-induced moderate sedation the P3 component was sustained and featured binding was impaired.

Emotion processing in female youth: Testing the stability of the late positive potential	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						adolescents; emotion; ERPs	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; ELECTROCORTICAL REACTIVITY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; MIDDLE CHILDHOOD; ADOLESCENTS; INDIVIDUALS; PERFORMANCE; ACTIVATION; COGNITION	The Emotional Interrupt Task (EIT) has been used to probe emotion processing in healthy and clinical samples; however, research exploring the stability and reliability of behavioral measures and ERPs elicited from this task is limited. Establishing the psychometric properties of the EIT is critical, particularly as phenotypes and biological indicators may represent traitlike characteristics that underlie psychiatric illness. To address this gap, test-retest stability and internal consistency of behavioral indices and ERPs resulting from the EIT in healthy, female youth (n = 28) were examined. At baseline, participants were administered the EIT while high-density 128-channel EEG data were recorded to probe the late positive potential (LPP). One month later, participants were readministered the EIT. Four principal findings emerged. First, there is evidence of an interference effect at baseline, as participants showed a slower reaction time for unpleasant and pleasant images relative to neutral images, and test-retest of behavioral measures was relatively stable over time. Second, participants showed a potentiated LPP to unpleasant and pleasant images compared to neutral images, and these effects were stable over time. Moreover, in a test of the difference waves (unpleasant-neutral vs. pleasant-neutral), there was sustained positivity for unpleasant images. Third, behavioral measures and LPP demonstrated excellent internal consistency (odd/even correlations) across conditions. Fourth, highlighting important age-related differences in LPP activity, younger age was associated with larger LPP amplitudes across conditions. Overall, these findings suggest that the LPP following emotional images is a stable and reliable marker of emotion processing in healthy youth.

Especially in social anxiety, hypervigilance for threatening faces has been found repeatedly across behavioral paradigms, whose reliability however have been questioned recently. In this EEG study, we sought to determine whether the detection of threat (angry faces) is specifically enhanced in individuals with high (HSA) compared to low social anxiety (LSA). In a visual search paradigm, the N2pc component of the event-related brain potential was measured as an electrophysiological indicator of attentional selection. Twenty-one HSA and twenty-one LSA participants were investigated while searching for threatening or friendly targets within an array of neutral faces, or neutral targets within threatening or friendly distractors. Whereas no differences were found in reaction times, HSA showed significant higher detection rates for angry faces, whereas LSA showed a clear 'happiness bias'. HSA also showed enhanced N2pc amplitudes in response to emotional facial expressions (angry and happy), indicating a general attentional bias for emotional faces. Overall, the results show that social anxiety may be characterized not only by a spatial attentional bias for threatening faces, but for emotional faces in general. In addition, the results further demonstrate the utility of the N2pc component in capturing subtle attentional biases.

Alpha desynchronization/synchronization during working memory testing is compromised in acute mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)	PLOS ONE			English	Article							4TH INTERNATIONAL-CONFERENCE; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; CONSENSUS STATEMENT; SPORT HELD; EEG; CONCUSSION; ATTENTION; PHASE; PERFORMANCE; THETA	Diagnosing and monitoring recovery of patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is challenging because of the lack of objective, quantitative measures. Diagnosis is based on description of injuries often not witnessed, subtle neurocognitive symptoms, and neuropsychological testing. Since working memory (WM) is at the center of cognitive functions impaired in mTBI, this study was designed to define objective quantitative electroencephalographic (qEEG) measures of WM processing that may correlate with cognitive changes associated with acute mTBI. First-time mTBI patients and mild peripheral (limb) trauma controls without head injury were recruited from the emergency department. WM was assessed by a continuous performance task (N-back). EEG recordings were obtained during N-back testing on three occasions: within five days, two weeks, and one month after injury. Compared with controls, mTBI patients showed abnormal induced and evoked alpha activity including event-related desynchronization (ERD) and synchronization (ERS). For induced alpha power, TBI patients had excessive frontal ERD on their first and third visit. For evoked alpha, mTBI patients had lower parietal ERD/ERS at the second and third visits. These exploratory qEEG findings offer new and non-invasive candidate measures to characterize the evolution of injury over the first month, with potential to provide much-needed objective measures of brain dysfunction to diagnose and monitor the consequences of mTBI.

The P3a event-related potential, considered as the neurophysiological hallmark of novelty detection, has been shown to be reduced in Parkinson's disease (PD) and proposed as a sensitive measure for illness duration and severity. Our aim for this study was to explore for the first time whether impaired novelty detection could be observed through phase-and time-locked brain oscillatory activity at early PD. Twenty-seven patients with idiopathic PD at early stages (disease duration < 5 years and Hoehn and Yahr stage < 3) were included. A healthy control group (n = 24) was included as well. All participants performed an auditory involuntary attention task including frequent and deviant tones while a digital EEG was obtained. A neuropsychological battery was administered as well. Time-frequency representations of power and phase-locked oscillations and P3a amplitudes were compared between groups. We found a significant reduction of power and phase locking of slow oscillations (3-7 Hz) for deviant tones in the PD group compared to controls in the P3a time range (300-550 ms). Also, reduced modulation of late induced (not phase locked) alpha-beta oscillations (400-650 ms, 8-25 Hz) was observed in the PD group after deviant tones onset. The P3a amplitude was predicted by years of evolution in the PD group. Finally, while phase-locked slow oscillations were associated with task behavioral distraction effects, induced alpha-beta activity was related to cognitive flexibility performance. Our results show that novelty detection impairment can be identified in neurophysiological terms from very early stages of PD, and such impairment increases linearly as the disease progresses. Also, induced alpha-beta oscillations underlying novelty detection are related to executive functioning.

Tick-tock goes the croc: a high-density EEG study of risk-reactivity and binge-drinking	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						risk-taking; risk-reactivity; alcohol; binge-drinking; EEG; ERP	DECISION-MAKING; SENSATION SEEKING; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SOCIAL EXCLUSION; LATE ADOLESCENCE; ALCOHOL; STRESS; CUES; CONSEQUENCES; ATTENTION	Links between individual differences in risk processing and high-risk behaviors such as binge-drinking have long been the focus of active research. However, investigations in this area almost exclusively utilize decision-making focused paradigms. This emphasis makes it difficult to assess links between risk behaviors and raw risk reactivity independent of decision and feedback processes. A deeper understanding of this association has the potential to shed light on the role of risk reactivity in high-risk behavior susceptibility. To contribute toward this aim, this study utilizes a popular risk-taking game, the crocodile dentist, to assess links between individual differences in decision-free risk-reactivity and reported binge-drinking frequency levels. In this task, participants engage in a series of decision-free escalating risk responses. Risk-reactivity was assessed by measuring late positive potential responses toward risk-taking action initiation cues using high-density 256-Channel EEG. The results indicate that, after controlling for overall alcohol consumption frequency, higher rates of reported binge-drinking are associated with both increased general risk-taking responsivity and increased risk-reactivity escalation as a function of risk level. These findings highlight intriguing links between risk reactivity and binge-drinking frequency, making key contributions in the areas of risk-taking and affective science.

The aim of the present study was twofold: a) to assess for the first time the electrophysiological correlates of print processing in dyslexic adults in the under-investigated context of reading aloud tasks, acknowledged to be especially relevant to investigate phonological processes relatively to lexical decision; and b) to assess whether the electrophysiological specificities described in dyslexic readers in lexical decision correspond to a different neuronal network engaged in print processing. 21 dyslexic university students and matched controls performed a lexical decision task and a reading aloud task on words and pseudowords under EEG recording. In lexical decision, the pattern of results indicates the engagement of similar brain processes between the groups, but with a sub-efficient visual word form processing in dyslexia. In reading aloud, between group differences revealed completely different distributions of the electric field at scalp between the two groups after the N2 time window, suggesting alternative processing strategies in dyslexic readers. Those specificities seem to be related to their core phonological deficits. Crucially, the present results suggest that the nature of electrophysiological divergences in print processing in dyslexic readers vary according to the task: while lexical decision task appears to be well suited to assess divergences in lexical access, reading aloud tasks should also be used in ERP investigation as it allows a better insight into phonological processes and thus be better suited in the framework of the phonological deficit theory of dyslexia.

A Behavioral and ERP Study	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						reading; rapid automatized naming (RAN); ERP; children; French	PHONOLOGICAL AWARENESS; WORD RECOGNITION; TIME-COURSE; PHONEMIC AWARENESS; VISUAL COMPLEXITY; IMAGE VARIABILITY; LETTER PERCEPTION; LEXICAL ACCESS; NAME AGREEMENT; DUAL-ROUTE	Reading predictors evolve through age: phonological awareness is the best predictor of reading abilities at the beginning of reading acquisition while Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) becomes the best reading predictor in more experienced readers (around 9-10 years old). Those developmental changes in the relationship between RAN and reading have so far been explained in term of participants' age. However, it should be noted that in the previous experiments age always co-vary with participants reading level. It is thus not clear whether RAN-reading relationship is developmental in nature or related to the reading system itself. This study investigates whether the behavioral changes in the relationship between RAN and reading and their electrophysiological correlates are related to the chronological age or to the reading level of the participants. Thirty two French-speaking children aged 7-10 years took part to the experiment: they were divided into groups contrasted on age but with similar reading levels and the other way round. Participants performed two reading tasks and four RAN tasks. EEG/ERP was recorded during discrete letter and picture RAN. Behavioral results revealed that alphanumeric RAN is more sensitive to age variations than reading level differences. The inverse profile was revealed for picture RAN, which discriminate poor and good readers among typically developed children within the same age-group. ERPs of both letter and picture RAN differed across age groups whereas only for the picture RAN ERPs differed across reading levels. Taken together, these results suggest that picture RAN is a particularly good indicator of reading level variance independently of age.

To settle this dispute, the current study aims to examine the whole-range brain dynamics during word processing using (i) 2-D ERP-image analysis, (ii) independent component clustering and (iii) EEG source reconstruction methods. It was found that both ATL and SMR participated in the spoken word processing by means of recurrent interaction, and the visual and motor cortex exhibited specific activation patterns for noun and verb respectively. These results suggest a hierarchical organization of word semantics that combines a modal ATL and modal SMR to form a complete concept.

Despite numerous studies on translation mechanisms, the electrophysiological processes underlying translation with overt production remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated how behavioral response patterns and spatial-temporal brain dynamics differ in a translation compared to a control within language word-generation task. We also investigated how forward and backward translation differs on the behavioral and electrophysiological level. To address these questions, healthy late bilingual subjects performed a translation and a within-language control task while a 128-channel EEG was recorded. Behavioral data showed faster responses for translation compared to within-language word generation and faster responses for backward than forward translation. The ERP-analysis revealed stronger early ( < 200 ms) preparatory and attentional processes for between than within word generation. Later (424-630 ms) differences were characterized by distinct engagement of domain-general control networks, namely self-monitoring and lexical access interference. Language asymmetry effects occurred at a later stage (600 ms), reflecting differences in conceptual processing characterized by a larger involvement of areas implicated in attention, arousal and awareness for forward versus backward translation.

However, robust evidence for the human brain ability to automatically detect brief and subtle changes of facial expression remains limited. Here we built on a recently developed paradigm in human electrophysiology with full-blown expressions (Dzhelyova et al., 2017), to isolate and quantify a neural marker for the detection of brief and subtle changes of facial expression. Scalp electroencephalogram(EEG) was recorded from 18 participants during stimulation of a neutral face changing randomly in size at a rapid rate of 6 Hz. Brief changes of expression appeared every five stimulation cycle(i.e., at 1.2 Hz) and expression intensity increased parametrically every 20 s in 20% steps during sweep sequences of 100 s. A significant 1.2 Hz response emerged in the EEG spectrum already at 40% of facial expression-change intensity for most of the 5 emotions tested(anger, disgust, fear, happiness, or sadness in different sequences), and increased with intensity steps, predominantly over right occipito-temporal regions. Given the high signal-to-noise ratio of the approach, thresholds for automatic detection of brief changes of facial expression could be determined for every single individual brain. A time-domain analysis revealed three components, the two first increasing linearly with increasing intensity as early as 100 ms after a change of expression, suggesting gradual low-level image-change detection prior to visual coding of facial movements. In contrast, the third component showed abrupt sensitivity to increasing expression intensity beyond 300 ms post expression-change, suggesting categorical emotion perception. Overall, this characterization of the detection of subtle changes of facial expression and its temporal dynamics open promising tracks for precise assessment of social perception ability during development and in clinical populations.

Nociceptive stimuli also elicit insular gamma-band oscillations (GBOs), possibly preferential for thermonociception, which have been suggested to reflect the intensity of perceived pain. To shed light on the functional significance of these two responses, we investigated whether they would be modulated by stimulation intensity and temporal expectation - two factors contributing to stimulus saliency. Insular activity was recorded from 8 depth electrodes (41 contacts) implanted in the left insula of 6 patients investigated for epilepsy. Thermonociceptive, vibrotactile, and auditory stimuli were delivered using two intensities. To investigate the effects of temporal expectation, the stimuli were delivered in trains of three identical stimuli (S1-S2-S3) separated by a constant 1-s interval. Stimulation intensity affected intensity of perception, the magnitude of low-frequency LFPs, and the magnitude of nociceptive GBOs. Stimulus repetition did not affect perception. In contrast, both low-frequency LFPs and nociceptive GBOs showed a marked habituation of the responses to S2 and S3 as compared to S1 and, hence, a dissociation with intensity of perception. Most importantly, although insular nociceptive GBOs appear to be preferential for thermonociception, they cannot be considered as a correlate of perceived pain.

The application of reward learning in the real world: Changes in the reward positivity amplitude reflect learning in a medical education context	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							BRAIN POTENTIALS; FEEDBACK; PREDICTION; MAGNITUDE; DOPAMINE; TASK	Evidence ranging from behavioural adaptations to neurocognitive theories has made significant advances into our understanding of feedback-based learning. For instance, over the past twenty years research using electroencephalography has demonstrated that the amplitude of a component of the human event-related brain potential - the reward positivity - appears to change with learning in a manner predicted by reinforcement learning theory (Holroyd and Coles, 2002; Sutton and Barto, 1998). However, while the reward positivity (also known as the feedback related negativity) is well studied, whether the component reflects an underlying learning process or whether it is simply sensitive to feedback evaluation is still unclear. Here, we sought to provide support that the reward positivity is reflective of an underlying learning process and further we hoped to demonstrate this in a real-world medical education context. In the present study, students with no medical training viewed a series of patient cards that contained ten physiological readings relevant for diagnosing liver and biliary disease types, selected the most appropriate diagnostic classification, and received feedback as to whether their decisions were correct or incorrect. Our behavioural results revealed that our participants were able to learn to diagnose liver and biliary disease types. Importantly, we found that the amplitude of the reward positivity diminished in a concomitant manner with the aforementioned behavioural improvements. In sum, our data support theoretical predictions (e.g., Holroyd and Coles, 2002), suggest that the reward positivity is an index of a neural learning system, and further validate that this same system is involved in learning across a wide range of contexts.

Responding to emotional scenes: effects of response outcome and picture repetition on reaction times and the late positive potential	COGNITION & EMOTION			English	Article						Emotional pictures; EEG; LPP; approach and avoidance motivation; reaction times	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NEGATIVE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; NATURAL SCENES; FUNCTIONAL MRI; AROUSAL; PERCEPTION; STARTLE; SIZE	Processing the motivational relevance of a visual scene and reacting accordingly is crucial for survival. Previous work suggests the emotional content of naturalistic scenes affects response speed, such that unpleasant content slows responses whereas pleasant content accelerates responses. It is unclear whether these effects reflect motor-cognitive processes, such as attentional orienting, or vary with the function/outcome of the motor response itself. Four experiments manipulated participants' ability to terminate the picture (offset control) and, thereby, the response's function and motivational value. Attentive orienting was manipulated via picture repetition, which diminishes orienting. A total of N=81 participants completed versions of a go/no-go task, discriminating between distorted versus intact pictures drawn from six content categories varying in positive, negative, or neutral valence. While all participants responded faster with repetition, only participants without offset control exhibited slower responses to unpleasant and accelerated responses to pleasant content. Emotional engagement, measured by the late positive potential, was not modulated by attentional orienting (repetition), suggesting that the interaction between repetition and offset control is not due to altered emotional engagement. Together, results suggest that response time changes as a function of emotional content and sensitivity to attention orienting depends on the motivational function of the motor response.

MDMA and brain activity during neurocognitive performance: An overview of neuroimaging studies with abstinent 'Ecstasy' users	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Review						MDMA; Ecstasy; Memory; Cognition; fMRI; fNIRS; EEG; ERP; Neuroimaging; Serotonin; Neurotoxicity	AUDITORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; DIPOLE SOURCE ACTIVITY; HUMAN POLYDRUG USERS; 3,4-METHYLENEDIOXYMETHAMPHETAMINE MDMA; SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER; INTENSITY DEPENDENCE; WORKING-MEMORY; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; HIPPOCAMPAL DYSFUNCTION; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE	MDMA/Ecstasy has had a resurgence in popularity, with recent supplies comprising higher strength MDMA, potentially leading to increased drug-related harm. Neurocognitive problems have been widely reported in ecstasy users, equally some studies report null findings, and it remains unclear which factors underlie the development of neurocognitive impairments. This review covers the empirical research into brain activity during neurocognitive performance, using fMRI, fNIRS, and EEG. Our main conclusion is that chronic repeated use of recreational ecstasy can result in haemodynamic and electrophysiological changes that reflect recruitment of additional resources to perform cognitive tasks. Findings are consistent with serotonergic system changes, although whether this reflects neurotoxicity or neuroadaptation, cannot be answered from these data. There is a degree of heterogeneity in the methodologies and findings, limiting the strengths of current conclusions. Future research with functional neuroimaging paired with molecular imaging, genetics or pharmacological challenges of the serotonin system may help to decipher the link between serotonergic and cognitive changes in ecstasy users.

However, little is known about how the neural oscillation of LPFC functions during intertemporal choice, owing to the technical limitations of functional magnetic resonance imaging and event-related brain potential recordings. Electrocorticography (ECoG) is a novel neuroimaging technique that has high spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we used ECoG and projected the ECoG data onto individual brain spaces to investigate human intracranial cortex activity and how neural oscillations of the LPFC impact intertemporal choice. We found that neural activity of theta oscillation was significantly higher during impulsive decisions, while beta oscillation activity was significantly higher during non-impulsive ones. Our findings suggest a functional dissociation between cortical theta and beta oscillations during decision-making processes involved in intertemporal choice, and that decision outcomes may be determined by LPFC modulation, which involves neural oscillations at different frequencies.

In this, we treat electrocorticographic (ECoG) data as observables of a skew-product dynamical system and extract the patterns of the neural dynamics from the point of view of the operator-theoretic formulation of ergodic theory. We successfully extract time-separable frequencies without bandpass filtering. Second, we examine in more detail the frequency band most commonly associated with MMN - beta-band activity (13-20 Hz) and proceed to cross-validate our results with those obtained by Komatsu, Takaura, and Fuji (2015). Having ensured the compatibility and statistical significance of the results, we then examine the spatiotemporal dynamics, and we find that MMN is in part driven by a synchronization in brain response following a deviation in the auditory stimuli.

Methods: Auditory P1-N2 responses and ITPCs in the theta band (4-7 Hz) for pure tones and words were assessed with EEG data from 15 school-age children with autism and 16 age-matched typically developing (TD) controls. Results: The autism group showed enhanced PI and reduced N2 for both speech and nonspeech stimuli in comparison with the TD group. Group differences were also found with enhanced theta ITPC for PI followed by ITPC reduction for N2 in the autism group. The ITPC values were significant predictors of PI and N2 amplitudes in both groups. Conclusions: Abnormal trial-to-trial phase synchrony plays an important role in AEP atypicalities in children with autism. ITPC-driven enhancement as well as attenuation in different AEP components may coexist, depending on the stage of information processing. Significance: It is necessary to examine the time course of auditory evoked potentials and the corresponding inter-trial coherence of neural oscillatory activities to better understand hyper- and hypo- sensitive responses in autism, which has important implications for sensory based treatment.

J	Lio, G; Boulinguez, P				Lio, Guillaume; Boulinguez, Philippe			How Does Sensor-Space Group Blind Source Separation Face Inter-individual Neuroanatomical Variability? Insights from a Simulation Study Based on the PALS-B12 Atlas	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						EEG; Blind source separation; Multisubject analysis; Cortical morphology; Individual variability	APPROXIMATE JOINT DIAGONALIZATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HIGHER-ORDER STATISTICS; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; INDEPENDENT COMPONENTS; 2ND-ORDER STATISTICS; LOCALIZATION; INHIBITION; VALIDATION; ALGORITHMS	Because of volume conduction and inter-individual neuroanatomical variability, similar sources in different brains may lead to variable topographies. This represents a major limitation for sensor-space group level decomposition of electroencephalographic data, a technique which introduces potential biases when aggregating individual data. To which extent this impedes subsequent source separation and localization was quantified in the present study. To this end, several simulations using an atlas of human cerebral cortex that takes into account the variability of cortical morphology (Van Essen in NeuroImage 28:635-662, 2005) were performed. For each virtual subject (up to n = 160), the orientation and location of each single simulated dipole was randomly modified as a function of the variability of the cortical shape of a given point in the brain provided by the probabilistic atlas. The resulting activity was projected on the scalp, and topographical shifts were estimated. Then, different algorithms based on second order statistics (SOS) or higher order statistics were used to recover the simulated sources from sensor space information with group blind source separation (gBSS) procedures (based on UWSOBI or EFICA, respectively). As expected, the variability of orientation of the cortical surface across subjects was found to induce substantial variability in scalp potential maps, especially if the sources originate from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or the temporoparietal junction. These biases could be compensated for by increasing drastically the number of subjects included in the topographical analyses. By contrast, gBSS was found to be insensitive to inter-individual differences of neuroanatomy. Rather, the estimation of the spatial filters seems to be optimized for the population of interest. Thus, optimal performance of source separation and subsequent source localization did not require the inclusion of a large sample of subjects (n < 20), at least when applying SOS-based statistics that use source spectral diversity to identify and gather similar sources with variable location and orientation. The resulting conclusion that inter-individual neuroanatomical variability is not a major limitation to sensor-space gBSS methods provides boosting perspectives for this promising approach, especially for the detection and localization of task/population related neural sources.

Electrophysiological Correlates of Empathic Processing and Its Relation to Psychopathic Meanness	NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						psychopathic meanness; empathy; ERPs; mu suppression; social neuroscience	TRIARCHIC CONCEPTUALIZATION; MU SUPPRESSION; PAIN; MORALITY; VALIDITY; RELIABILITY; COMPONENTS; DEFICITS; VIOLENCE; TRAITS	Objective: A lack of empathy and the presence of predatory tendencies are considered key features of psychopathic meanness. Previous electrophysiological studies on empathy in relation to psychopathic traits have focused mainly on empathy for pain; therefore, little is known about the electrophysiological correlates of empathy in aggressive situations that are particularly relevant for psychopathic meanness. Method: We employed electroencephalography in a community sample (n = 70), the majority of whom had attained a higher level of education. All participants were screened for not having psychiatric conditions or criminal history. The P3 and late positive potential (LPP) event-related potentials and mu rhythm suppression were examined as indices of empathic processing during the observation of situations in which victims of aggression were depicted. Results: As predicted, it was found that persons with elevated levels of psychopathic meanness scored lower on trait empathy and assigned higher positive valence to the aggression scenes. It is interesting that those scoring higher on meanness also scored higher on empathy for the perpetrator. In addition, it was found that psychopathic meanness was negatively related to LPP amplitudes following pictures of aggressive situations. No significant associations were found between meanness and the P3 or between meanness and mu suppression. Conclusions: This study was the first to assess the electrophysiological signature of empathy during the processing of pictures depicting aggressive situations and the relationships with psychopathic meanness. The outcomes highlight the need for more integrative approaches to further study the complex pattern of relationships between empathy and psychopathic meanness. General Scientific Summary The current study advances the knowledge about the link between individual differences in psychopathic meanness and the processes involved in understanding mental states in others. More specifically, it sheds light on the neural mechanisms involved in empathy, especially empathy related to situations involving aggression, which is relevant for understanding antisocial behavior and psychopathic personality.

It has been identified as an important factor in the progression of cerebral damage associated with stroke or traumatic brain injury. We analysed local field potential signals during CSD in old and young rats to look for age-related differences. We compared CSDs elicited under physiological conditions (baseline), during ischaemia and during reperfusion. We applied short-time Fourier transform and a windowed implementation of multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis to follow the electrophysiological signature of CSD. Both in the time-dependent spectral profiles and in the multifractal spectrum width, CSDs appeared as transient dips, which we described on the basis of their duration, depression and recovery slope and degree of drop and rise. The most significant age-related difference we found was in the depression slope, which was significantly more negative in the beta band and less negative in the delta band of old animals. In several parameters, we observed an attenuation-regeneration pattern in reaction to ischaemia and reperfusion, which was absent in the old age group. The age-related deviation from the pattern took two forms: the rise parameter did not show any attenuation in ischaemic conditions for old animals, whilst the depression slope in most frequency bands remained attenuated during reperfusion and did not regenerate in this age group. Though the multifractal spectrum width proved to be a reliable indicator of events like CSDs or ischaemia onset, we failed to find any case where it would add extra detail to the information provided by the Fourier description.

Do musicians learn a fine sequential hand motor skill differently than non-musicians?	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BRAIN; EEG; POTENTIALS; EXECUTION; EXPERTISE; MOVEMENTS; SEQUENCES; NETWORK; ERP	Do professional musicians learn a fine sequential hand motor skill more efficiently than non-musicians? Is this also the case when they perform motor imagery, which implies that they only mentally simulate these movements? Musicians and non-musicians performed a Go/NoGo discrete sequence production (DSP) task, which allows to separate sequence-specific from a-specific learning effects. In this task five stimuli, to be memorized during a preparation interval, signaled a response sequence. In a practice phase, different response sequences had to be either executed, imagined, or inhibited, which was indicated by different response cues. In a test phase, responses were required to familiar (previously executed, imagined, or inhibited) and unfamiliar sequences. In both phases, response times and response accuracy were measured while the electroencephalogram (EEG) was only registered during the practice phase to compare activity between motor imagery, motor execution, and motor inhibition for both groups. Results in the practice phase revealed that musicians learned the response sequences faster and more accurately than non-musicians although no difference in initiation time was found. EEG analyses revealed similar lateralized activity during learning a motor skill for both groups. Our results from the test phase showed better sequence-a-specific learning effects (i.e., faster response times and increased accuracy) for musicians than for non-musicians. Moreover, we revealed that non-musicians benefit more from physical execution while learning a required motor sequence, whereas sequence-specific learning effects due to learning with motor imagery were very similar for musicians and non-musicians.

This interpretation requires conditioning to rely on an association between CS+ face identity and the occurrence of the aversive event (UCS). Here, we tested this requirement assuming that if an association between CS+face identity and UCS occurrence is established, CRs to originally conditioned face images should transfer to novel images of same-identity faces. Forty-eight participants underwent MultiCS conditioning with eight neutral faces as CSs and electric shock as UCS. Central, peripheral, evaluative, and behavioral CRs signaled successful emotional learning (as reported in Pastor et al., 2015). Behavioral and EEG responses of consecutive passive viewing showed enhanced reactions to novel angry and happy expressions of previously shocked CS + versus nonshocked CS - identities, indicating successful CR transfer within the dimension of face identity. Investigating the nature of CR transfer, EEG revealed an interaction of identity and expression information during face processing that followed emotional congruency (i.e., stronger reactions to congruent angry CS + and happy CS - vs. incongruent angry CS - and happy CS + compounds). While correlates of transfer appeared in late and midlatency time intervals, the congruency interaction became significant within the first 100 ms of face processing. Our results suggest conditioning to rely on an association of UCS occurrence with CS + identity and point to fast dynamic interrelations between identity and expression processing.

Disgust but not Health Anxiety Graphic Warning Labels Reduce Motivated Attention in Smokers: A Study of P300 and Late Positive Potential Responses	NICOTINE & TOBACCO RESEARCH			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SMOKING CUES; CIGARETTE SMOKERS; METAANALYSIS; DEPENDENCE; AVOIDANCE; MESSAGES; PICTURES; BIAS; REAPPRAISAL	Background: Graphic health warning labels (GHWLs) on tobacco products attempt to leverage avoidance-promoting emotions, such as anxiety and disgust, to encourage cessation. Prior studies have relied on self-report or attentional metrics that may not accurately illuminate GHWLs' ability to motivate change. This report evaluates the impact of disgust-and anxiety-based GHWLs on electroencephalograph (EEG) measures of motivated attention among two groups of smokers-those that report higher versus lower cigarette dependence. We hypothesized that both anxiety and disgust GHWLs would reduce appetitive attention, as indexed by lowered P300 (P3) and late positive potential (LPP) activations. Methods: Sixty-one smokers provided demographic and smoking history before completing an oddball paradigm consisting of three counterbalanced stimuli blocks. Each block (100 trials) contained a neutral, GHWL-anxiety, or GHWL-disgust frequent image and a smoking cue as the oddball image (20%). Oddball trials for each block were averaged, P3 and LPP were identified at midline electrode positions (Fz, Cz, and Pz), and mean amplitude was analyzed. Results: Separate mixed-model ANOVAs of P3 and LPP reactivity revealed disgust-focused GHWLs reduced motivated attentional processing. Conversely, the anxiety-focused GHWL appeared to increase the salience of the smoking cue (Fz only). Less-dependent smokers showed lower P3 reactivity than those with higher dependence at Fz, but greater P3 reactivity at Cz and Pz. Conclusion: These results extend prior work in demonstrating that disgust, but not anxiety-based GHWLs, may reduce EEG-assessed motivated attention to smoking cues. Disgust may thus represent a more fruitful target for public health cessation efforts. Implications: Most GHWL evaluations have focused on fear (or anxiety) elicitation rather than disgust, an emotion that may have a unique link to smoking, having evolved specifically to facilitate the avoidance of contaminants via oral incorporation. Analyses of P300 and LPP responses to GHWLs suggest that disgust-focused images interfere with the EEG-indexed attentional processing of smoking cues and do so better than health anxiety-focused messages. However, interaction effects at different electrode sites indicated that GHWLs have complex effects in more versus less-dependent smokers and that an understanding of how smoking cues and anti-smoking imagery become associated over time is needed to identify relevant targets for public health efforts.

Participants were presented with the classic S1-S2 paradigm task, where a warning stimulus (S1) acts as a cue for the appearance of an imperative stimulus (S2). A fast motor response was required upon S2 arrival. Inter-stimulus intervals (ISIS) of 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 s duration were presented in blocked fashion. Data was analysed using both EEG referenced to linked mastoids and the current source density (CSD) technique, which maximizes the cortical origin of the measured voltage. Mean late CNV (ICNV) amplitude was found to be significantly higher for fast reaction time (RT) trials when CSD data was split according to the median into 'fast' and 'slow' RT halves. Post-hoc comparisons showed that this RT effect was particularly strong for the 10 s condition. This may be explained by the lack of an ICNV component and thus of cortical negativity prior to S2 in the 10 s condition. Our results suggest that intervals of a duration between 7.5 and 10 s represent the upper boundary during which the 1CNV component can be elicited.

Design: Spectro-temporal processing skills were assessed using a psychoacoustic test battery. Speech-in-noise perception was measured using the Listening in Spatialised Noise - Sentences (LiSN-S) test and Cortical Auditory Evoked Potentials (CAEPs) recorded to the speech syllable/da/presented in quiet and in 8-talker babble noise at 0, 5, and 10dB signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Study sample: Ten professional musicians and 10 non-musicians participated in this study. Results: Musicians significantly outperformed non-musicians in the frequency discrimination task and low-cue condition of the LiSN-S test. Musicians' N1 amplitude showed no difference between 5dB and 0dB SNR conditions while non-musicians showed significantly lower N1 amplitude at 0dB SNR compared to 5dB SNR. Brain-behaviour correlation for musicians showed a significant association between CAEPs at 5dB SNR and the low-cue condition of the LiSN-S test at 30-70ms. Time-frequency analysis indicated musicians had significantly higher alpha power desynchronisation in the 0dB SNR condition indicating involvement of attention. Conclusions: Through the use of behavioural and electrophysiological data, the results provide converging evidence for improved speech recognition in noise in musicians.

J	Lemarechal, JD; George, N; David, O				Lemarechal, Jean-Didier; George, Nathalie; David, Olivier			Comparison of two integration methods for dynamic causal modeling of electrophysiological data	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						DCM; Neuronal model; Delay differential equations; Conduction delays	POTENTIALS; DELAY	Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) is a methodological approach to study effective connectivity among brain regions. Based on a set of observations and a biophysical model of brain interactions, DCM uses a Bayesian framework to estimate the posterior distribution of the free parameters of the model (e.g. modulation of connectivity) and infer architectural properties of the most plausible model (i.e. model selection). When modeling electrophysiological event-related responses, the estimation of the model relies on the integration of the system of delay differential equations (DDEs) that describe the dynamics of the system. In this technical note, we compared two numerical schemes for the integration of DDEs. The first, and standard, scheme approximates the DDEs (more precisely, the state of the system, with respect to conduction delays among brain regions) using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and solves it with a fixed step size. The second scheme uses a dedicated DDEs solver with adaptive step sizes to control error, making it theoretically more accurate. To highlight the effects of the approximation used by the first integration scheme in regard to parameter estimation and Bayesian model selection, we performed simulations of local field potentials using first, a simple model comprising 2 regions and second, a more complex model comprising 6 regions. In these simulations, the second integration scheme served as the standard to which the first one was compared. Then, the performances of the two integration schemes were directly compared by fitting a public mismatch negativity EEG dataset with different models. The simulations revealed that the use of the standard DCM integration scheme was acceptable for Bayesian model selection but underestimated the connectivity parameters and did not allow an accurate estimation of conduction delays. Fitting to empirical data showed that the models systematically obtained an increased accuracy when using the second integration scheme.

Compared to LEV, its affinity to the ligand is >10%-30% higher. Due to its more lipophilic characteristics, it might have a quicker penetration across the blood-brain barrier and potentially also a stronger anticonvulsant effect.Thus, we aimed to explore its usefulness in the treatment of status epilepticus (SE). We retrospectively assessed treatment response and adverse events in adjunctive treatment with intravenous BRV in patients with SE from January 2016 to July 2017 at our institution. Seven patients aged median 68years (range = 29-79) were treated with intravenous BRV. Three patients had SE with coma and four without. SE arose de novo in two patients; etiology was remote symptomatic in four patients and progressive symptomatic in one patient. The most frequent etiology was remote vascular in two patients. BRV was administered after median four antiepileptic drugs (range = 2-11). Time of treatment initiation ranged from 0.5hours to 105days (median = 10.5hours). Immediate clinical and electrophysiological improvement was observed in two patients (29%). Median loading dose was 100mg intravenously over 15minutes (range = 50-200mg), titrated up to a median dose of 100mg/d (range = 100-300). Median Glasgow Outcome Scale score was 3 (range = 3-5), with an improvement in 86% of patients compared to admission. We observed no adverse events regarding cardiorespiratory function. BRV might have potential as a novel antiepileptic drug in early stages of SE. Its potential may lie its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier more quickly than LEV and its favorable safety profile. Prospective studies for the use of BRV in SE are required.

Double ErrP Detection for Automatic Error Correction in an ERP-Based BCI Speller	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Double error-related potentials (ErrP); automatic error correction; brain-computer interface (BCI); P300 ERP; electroencephalogram (EEG); speller	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; POTENTIALS; COMMUNICATION; P300; PERFORMANCE; COMPONENTS; BOOSTS; TIME	Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a useful device for people with severe motor disabilities. However, due to its low speed and low reliability, BCI still has a very limited application in daily real-world tasks. This paper proposes a P300-based BCI speller combined with a double error-related potential (ErrP) detection to automatically correct erroneous decisions. This novel approach introduces a second error detection to infer whether wrong automatic correction also elicits a second ErrP. Thus, two single-trial responses, instead of one, contribute to the final selection, improving the reliability of error detection. Moreover, to increase error detection, the evoked potential detected as target by the P300 classifier is combined with the evoked error potential at a feature-level. Discriminable error and positive potentials (response to correct feedback) were clearly identified. The proposed approach was tested on nine healthy participants and one tetraplegic participant. The online average accuracy for the first and second ErrPs were 88.4% and 84.8%, respectively. With automatic correction, we achieved an improvement around 5% achieving 89.9% in spelling accuracy for an effective 2.92 symbols/min. The proposed approach revealed that double ErrP detection can improve the reliability and speed of BCI systems.

Numerous studies have indicated the relationship between the CAR and cognition. However, little is known about daily variation in the CAR and cognitive function in healthy adults. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the CAR predicted the response inhibition function on the same day in both behaviour and the dynamic time course of brain processing. The saliva samples of 47 healthy men were collected at three time points: immediately on awakening, 30 min and 45 min post-awakening in the morning. Participants performed a Go/NoGo task while electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded in the afternoon of the same day. The results showed that a greater CAR was associated with a stronger N2. In the sub-group of CAR responders (n = 33) the CAR was negatively related to the false alarm rate of NoGo-trials. Our findings suggested that the CAR was predictive of the function of response inhibition in both the earlier cognitive step (i.e., conflict monitoring) and the behavioural performance of response inhibition on the same day in healthy men.

Using a repeated-measures design, participants completed 3 BCI conditions: row/column (RCW), checkerboard (CBW), and gray-to-color (CBC). Based on previous studies, it is hypothesized that the CBC and CBW conditions will result in higher accuracy, information transfer rate, waveform amplitude, and user preference over the RCW condition. An offline dynamic stopping simulation will also increase information transfer rate. Higher mean accuracy was observed in the CBC condition (89.7%), followed by the CBW (84.3%) condition, and lowest in the RCW condition (78.7%); however, these differences did not reach statistical significance (P = .062). Eight of the eleven participants preferred the CBC and the remaining three preferred the CBW conditions. The offline dynamic stopping simulation significantly increased information transfer rate (P = .005) and decreased accuracy (P < .000). The findings of this study suggest that color stimuli provide a modest improvement in performance and that participants prefer color stimuli over monochromatic stimuli. Given these findings, BCI paradigms that use color stimuli should be considered for individuals who have ALS.

Reduced neural responses to vocal fear: a potential biomarker for callous-uncaring traits in early childhood	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR DISORDERS; UNEMOTIONAL TRAITS; CONDUCT PROBLEMS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; AMYGDALA RESPONSE; DEVELOPMENTAL PATHWAYS; RECOGNITION DEFICITS; PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS; CHILDREN; EXPRESSIONS	ObjectiveCallous-unemotional (CU) traits are characterized by a lack of guilt and empathy, and low responsiveness to distress and fear in others. Children with CU traits are at-risk for engaging in early and persistent conduct problems. Individuals showing CU traits have been shown to have reduced neural responses to others' distress (e.g., fear). However, the neural components of distress responses in children with CU traits have not been investigated in early childhood. In the current study, we examined neural responses that underlie the processing of emotionally valenced vocal stimuli using the event-related potential technique in a group of preschoolers. Method: Participants between 2 and 5 years old took part in an auditory oddball task containing English-based pseudowords spoken with either a fearful, happy, or a neutral prosody while electroencephalography data were collected. The mismatch negativity (MMN) component, an index of the automatic detection of deviant stimuli within a series of stimuli, was examined in association with two dimensions of CU traits (i.e., callousness-uncaring and unemotional dimensions) reported by primary caregivers. Results: Findings suggest that the callousness-uncaring dimension of CU traits in early childhood is associated with reduced responses to fearful vocal stimuli. Conclusions: Reduced neural responses to vocal fear could be a biomarker for callous-uncaring traits in early childhood. These findings are relevant for clinicians and researchers attempting to identify risk factors for early callous-uncaring traits.

The current event-related potential study examined whether the experience of choice by which individuals exercise control is modulated by reward probability during reward anticipation stage as indexed by the stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN). Thirty participants performed a cued gambling task during which choices could be made either by themselves (a choice condition) or by a computer (a no-choice condition) with three levels of reward probability (low, medium, and high) while their EEG was recording. As expected, the participants perceived higher control during the choice compared to no-choice condition. Correspondingly, the SPN was enhanced in the choice condition than the no-choice condition. Critically, the SPN choice effect was present when reward probability was high and medium, but was diminished when reward probability was low. These findings suggest that the perceived control as exercised by choice is associated with reward anticipation, which may be sensitive to the fundamental properties of reward.

Systems with such capabilities are generally referred to as cognitive cockpits. This article provides a description of the potential that is carried by such systems, especially in terms of increasing flight safety. Additionally, a neuropsychological background of the problem is presented. Conducted research was focused mainly on the problem of discrimination between states of brain activity related to idle but focused anticipation of visual cue and reaction to it. Especially, a problem of selecting a proper classification algorithm for such problems is being examined. For that purpose an experiment involving 10 subjects was planned and conducted. Experimental electroencephalographic data was acquired using an Emotiv EPOC+ headset. Proposed methodology involved use of a popular method in biomedical signal processing, the Common Spatial Pattern, extraction of bandpower features, and an extensive test of different classification algorithms, such as Linear Discriminant Analysis, k-nearest neighbors, and Support Vector Machines with linear and radial basis function kernels, Random Forests, and Artificial Neural Networks.

J	Friedrich, J; Muckschel, M; Beste, C				Friedrich, Julia; Mueckschel, Moritz; Beste, Christian			Specific properties of the SI and SII somatosensory areas and their effects on motor control: a system neurophysiological study	BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION			English	Article						Somatosensory system; EEG; Source localization; Motor control; Neurophysiology	ITERATION DECOMPOSITION RIDE; INFERIOR FRONTAL-CORTEX; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; VIBRATORY STIMULI; COGNITIVE CONTROL; PARIETAL CORTEX; FMRI; ERP	Sensorimotor integration is essential for successful motor control and the somatosensory modality has been shown to have strong effects on the execution of motor plans. The primary (SI) and the secondary somatosensory (SII) cortices are known to differ in their neuroanatomical connections to prefrontal areas, as well as in their involvement to encode cognitive aspects of tactile processing. Here, we ask whether the area-specific processing architecture or the structural neuroanatomical connections with prefrontal areas determine the efficacy of sensorimotor integration processes for motor control. In a system neurophysiological study including EEG signal decomposition (i.e., residue iteration decomposition, RIDE) and source localization, we investigated this question using vibrotactile stimuli optimized for SI or SII processing. The behavioral data show that when being triggered via the SI area, inhibitory control of motor processes is stronger as when being triggered via the SII area. On a neurophysiological level, these effects were reflected in the C-cluster as a result of a temporal decomposition of EEG data, indicating that the sensory processes affecting motor inhibition modulate the response selection level. These modulations were associated with a stronger activation of the right inferior frontal gyrus extending to the right middle frontal gyrus as parts of a network known to be involved in inhibitory motor control when response inhibition is triggered over SI. In addition, areas important for sensorimotor integration like the postcentral gyrus and superior parietal cortex showed activation differences. The data suggest that connection patterns are more important for sensorimotor integration and control than the more restricted area-specific processing architecture.

For this purpose, electroencephalographic signals were acquired from ten subjects in different sessions. Sixty-one familiar and fifty-nine unfamiliar face stimuli were shown to the subjects in the experiments. Since channel responses are different for familiar and unfamiliar classes, the channels discriminating the classes were investigated. To do so, three distances and four similarity measures were employed to assess the most distant channel pairs between familiar and unfamiliar classes for a 1-s time duration; 0.6 s from the stimulus to 1.6 s in a channel selection process. It is experimentally observed that this time interval is maintaining the greatest distance between two categories. The electroencephalographic signals were classified using the determined channels and time interval to measure accuracy. The best classification accuracy was 81.30% and was obtained with the Pearson correlation as channel selection method. The most discriminative channel pairs were selected from prefrontal regions.

More specifically, we aimed at implementing a well-studied paradigm of attentional cueing through gaze (the so-called "joint attention" or "gaze cueing") in an HRI protocol involving the iCub robot. Similarly to documented results in gaze-cueing research, we found faster response times and enhanced event-related potentials of the EEG signal for discrimination of cued, relative to uncued, targets. These results are informative for the robotics community by showing that a humanoid robot with mechanistic eyes and human-like characteristics of the face is in fact capable of engaging a human in joint attention to a similar extent as another human would do. More generally, we propose that the methodology of combining neuroscience methods with an HRI protocol, contributes to understanding mechanisms of human social cognition in interactions with robots and to improving robot design, thanks to systematic and well-controlled experimentation tapping onto specific cognitive mechanisms of the human, such as joint attention.

Neural Processing of Congruent and Incongruent Audiovisual Speech in School-Age Children and Adults	LANGUAGE LEARNING			English	Article						audiovisual; speech; McGurk effect; development; EEG; neural processing	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; VISUAL SPEECH; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; INTERINDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; SEEING VOICES; PERCEPTION; INFANTS; MATURATION	Seeing articulatory gestures enhances speech perception. Perception of auditory speech can even be changed by incongruent visual gestures, which is known as the McGurk effect (e.g., dubbing a voice saying /mi/ onto a face articulating /ni/, observers often hear /ni/). In children, the McGurk effect is weaker than in adults, but no previous knowledge exists about the neural-level correlates of the McGurk effect in school-age children. Using brain event-related potentials, we investigated change detection responses to congruent and incongruent audiovisual speech in school-age children and adults. We used an oddball paradigm with a congruent audiovisual /mi/ as the standard stimulus and a congruent audiovisual /ni/ or McGurk A/mi/V/ni/ as the deviant stimulus. In adults, a similar change detection response was elicited by both deviant stimuli. In children, change detection responses differed between the congruent and the McGurk stimulus. This reflects a maturational difference in the influence of visual stimuli on auditory processing.

Uncanny valley as a window into predictive processing in the social brain	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Uncanny valley; Predictive processing; N400; Action perception; Social neuroscience	HUMAN REALISM; COMPONENT	Uncanny valley refers to humans' negative reaction to almost-but-not-quite-human agents. Theoretical work proposes prediction violation as an explanation for uncanny valley but no empirical work has directly tested it. Here, we provide evidence that supports this theory using event-related brain potential recordings from the human scalp. Human subjects were presented images and videos of three agents as EEG was recorded: a real human, a mechanical robot, and a realistic robot in between. The real human and the mechanical robot had congruent appearance and motion whereas the realistic robot had incongruent appearance and motion. We hypothesize that the appearance of the agent would provide a context to predict her movement, and accordingly the perception of the realistic robot would elicit an N400 effect indicating the violation of predictions, whereas the human and the mechanical robot would not. Our data confirmed this hypothesis suggesting that uncanny valley could be explained by violation of one's predictions about human norms when encountered with realistic but artificial human forms. Importantly, our results implicate that the mechanisms underlying perception of other individuals in our environment are predictive in nature.

These retroactive processes are particularly inherent to the processing of auditory information that is especially transient over time and thus, requires us to continuously maintain, attend to, and integrate information in working memory. Using EEG recordings, the present study investigated the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying selective spatial attention in a retroactive as opposed to a perceptual auditory search task. Two kinds of sound stimuli were employed: a horizontal sound array consisting of two natural sounds presented simultaneously in the left and right hemispace and a central single target sound. The target sound was provided either after (retroactive search) or before the presentation of the sound array (perceptual search). In both search conditions, participants completed a sound localization and a sound detection task, indicating the position (left or right) or the presence versus absence (yes or no) of a particular target sound. Analyses revealed a lateralization of alpha power oscillations (8-12 Hz) over parieto-occipital scalp in both perceptual and retroactive sound localization tasks, but not in respective sound detection tasks, suggesting auditory alpha lateralization to be restricted to spatially specific task demands. The observed asymmetric modulations of alpha power in sound localization are consistent with analogous findings from the visual domain, supporting the supramodal role of alpha oscillations in the deployment of spatial attention. Hence, we conclude that auditory alpha lateralization is a higher-order attention mechanism that operates in perceptual and mnemonic space reflecting the access to a spatially-specific, supramodal response template.

While these findings accord with theoretical models, the precise temporal, oscillatory and network dynamics as well as the interplay between the NAcc and ANT in successfully retrieving information from long-term memory are largely unknown. We addressed this issue by recording intracranial electroencephalography in human epilepsy patients from the NAcc (n = 5) and ANT (n = 4) during an old/new recognition test. Our findings demonstrate that differences in event-related potentials between correctly classified old (i.e., studied) and new (i.e., unstudied) images emerged in the NAcc and ANT already between 200 and 600 ms after stimulus onset. Moreover, time frequency analyses revealed theta (4-8 Hz) power decreases for old compared to new items in the NAcc and the opposite effect in the ANT. Importantly, Granger causality analyses revealed a directional communication from ANT to NAcc suggesting that entrainment from ANT drives successful memory retrieval. Together, our findings show evidence for the notion that the NAcc and ANT receive memory signals, and that theta oscillations may serve as a mechanism to bind these distributed neural assemblies.

Differential effects of non-dual and focused attention meditations on the formation of automatic perceptual habits in expert practitioners	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Attention; Auditory oddball; EEG; Gamma; Mindfulness; Predictive coding	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; AUDITORY ATTENTION; TERM-MEMORY; EEG; ERP; OSCILLATIONS; PREDICTION; RESPONSES	Non-dual meditation aims to undo maladaptive cognitive and affective patterns by recognizing their constructed and transient nature. We previously found high-amplitude spontaneous gamma (25-40 Hz) oscillatory activity during such practice. Nonetheless, it is unclear how this meditation state differs from other practices, in terms of perceptual information processing. Here, we hypothesized that non-dual meditation can downregulate the automatic formation of perceptual habits. To investigate this hypothesis, we recorded EEG from expert Buddhist meditation practitioners and matched novices to measure two components of the auditory evoked response: the Mismatch Negativity (MMN) and the Late Frontal Negativity (LFN), a potential observed at a latency sensitive to attentional engagement to the auditory environment, during the practices of Open Presence (OP) and Focused Attention (FA), as well as during a control state, in the context of a passive oddball paradigm. We found an increase in gamma oscillatory power during both meditation states in expert practitioners and an interaction between states and groups in the amplitude of the MMN. A further investigation identified the specific interplay between the MMN and the LFN as a possible marker to differentiate the two meditation states as a function of expertise. In experts, the MMN increased during FA, compared to OP, while the opposite pattern was observed at the LFN latency. We propose that the state of OP in experts is characterized by increased sensory monitoring and reduced perceptual inferences compared to FA. This study represents a first attempt to describe the impact of non-dual meditation states on the regulation of automatic brain predictive processes.

Cybersickness is a set of discomforts and commonly triggered by VR exposure. It has symptoms similar to motion sickness, such as dizziness, nausea, and disorientation etc. Although cybersickness has been studied for decades, populations with neurological disabilities, such as MS, have remained minimally studied. Cybersickness could have negative impact on effectiveness of VR-based rehabilitation systems and limit the accessibility of VR for persons with disabilities. MS can disrupt communication between neurons (signal carrying nerve cells) from different areas of the brain. Cybersickness also can affect brain signals, for example, frequency powers may change due to cybersickness. This study investigates the combination of MS and cybersickness in terms of brain signals. To investigate the effect of cybersickness on participants' brain signals, electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded before, during and after exposure to a cybersickness-provoking VR driving simulation. The EEG data suggests that in response to cybersickness-provoking VR exposure, participants with MS have mostly shown similar changes in brain activity with different magnitudes than participants without MS. Also, for at least one scalp location we have found completely opposite brain signals in MS-Group when compared to Non-MS-Group. Difference in magnitude or completely different trend in brain signals can imply that cybersickness affects persons with MS differently than persons without MS and may be different cybersickness reduction techniques are required for different populations.

J	Kumar, GRK; Reddy, MR				Kumar, G. R. Kiran; Reddy, M. Ramasubba			Periodic component analysis as a spatial filter for SSVEP-based brain-computer interface	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP); Electroencephalogram (EEG); Periodic component analysis (pi CA); Canonical correlation analysis (CCA); Brain-computer interface (BCI)	CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; HIGH-PASS FILTERS; INCORRECT CONCLUSIONS; FREQUENCY RECOGNITION; BCI; COGNITION; LANGUAGE; DESIGN; ERP	Background: Traditional spatial filters used for steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) extraction such as minimum energy combination (MEC) require the estimation of the background electroencephalogram (EEG) noise components. Even though this leads to improved performance in low signal to noise ratio (SNR) conditions, it makes such algorithms slow compared to the standard detection methods like canonical correlation analysis (CCA) due to the additional computational cost. New method: In this paper, Periodic component analysis (pi CA) is presented as an alternative spatial filtering approach to extract the SSVEP component effectively without involving extensive modelling of the noise. The pi CA can separate out components corresponding to a given frequency of interest from the background electroencephalogram (EEG) by capturing the temporal information and does not generalize SSVEP based on rigid templates. Results: Data from ten test subjects were used to evaluate the proposed method and the results demonstrate that the periodic component analysis acts as a reliable spatial filter for SSVEP extraction. Statistical tests were performed to validate the results. Comparison with existing methods: The experimental results show that pi CA provides significant improvement in accuracy compared to standard CCA and MEC in low SNR conditions. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that pi CA provides better detection accuracy compared to CCA and on par with that of MEC at a lower computational cost. Hence pi CA is a reliable and efficient alternative detection algorithm for SSVEP based brain-computer interface (BCI).	[Kumar, G. R. Kiran; Reddy, M.

A promising method to improve WM is physical or cognitive training. The present randomized controlled study is aimed at evaluating the effects of different training methods on WM. A sample of 141 healthy older adults (mean age 70 years) was assigned to one of four groups: physical training, cognitive training, a social control group, and a no-contact control group. The participants trained for four months. Before and after the training, n-back task during an EEG recording was applied. The results show that cognitive training enhanced the target detection rate in the 2-back task. This was corroborated by an increased number of repeated digits in the backward digit-span test but not in other memory tests. The improvement of WM was supported by an increased P3a prior to a correct target and an increased P3b both in nontarget and target trials. No ERP effects in the physical and no-contact control groups were found, while a reduction of P3a and P3b was found in the social control group. Thus, cognitive training enhances frontal and parietal processing related to the maintenance of a stored stimulus for subsequent matching with an upcoming stimulus and increases allocation of cognitive resources. These results indicate that multidomain cognitive training may increase WM capacity and neuronal activity in older age.

The late positive potential and subjective arousal ratings evoked by negative images vary as a function of oxytocin receptor genotype SNP rs53576	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						electroencephalography; late positive potential; oxytocin; oxytocin receptor gene; SNP rs53576	GENE OXTR; BRAIN; POLYMORPHISM; REACTIVITY; ERP	In the central nervous system the neuropeptide oxytocin mediates a range of behaviors related primarily to emotionality. One factor that influences oxytocinergic communication in the human brain and correlates with emotional behaviors is the single nucleotide polymorphism rs53576 on the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR). For example, variations in this OXTR genotype are related to parental, altruistic, and other prosocial behaviors. Electroencephalographic waveforms of visually evoked response potentials recorded at the midline parietal electrode site display a prominent component putatively involved with attention allocation called the late positive potential. The magnitude of the late positive potential was found to be significantly higher in homozygous G allele individuals compared with A allele carriers when viewing negative emotionally charged images. Inversely, A allele carriers rated these negative images as more arousing, when measured by the Self-Assessment Manikin rating scale. These data suggest that OXTR functioning contributes to visual processing and subjective experience of negative stimuli.

Emerging models have postulated that predictive mechanisms require synchronous firing of neural networks, but to date, this relationship has been investigated primarily through oscillatory activity in narrow frequency bands. A recently-developed measure proposed to reflect broadband neural activity - and thereby synchronous neuronal firing - is 1/f neural noise extracted from EEG spectral power. Previous research has indicated that this measure of 1/f neural noise changes across the lifespan, and these neural changes predict age-related behavioral impairments in visual working memory. Using a cross-sectional sample of young and older adults, we examined age-related changes in 1/f neural noise and whether this measure predicted ERP correlates of successful lexical prediction during discourse comprehension. 1/f neural noise across two different language tasks revealed high within-subject correlations, indicating that this measure can provide a reliable index of individualized patterns of neural activation. In addition to age, 1/f noise was a significant predictor of N400 effects of successful lexical prediction; however, noise did not mediate age-related declines in other ERP effects. We discuss broader implications of these findings for theories of predictive processing, as well as potential applications of 1/f noise across research populations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

J	Daliri, A; Max, L				Daliri, Ayoub; Max, Ludo			Stuttering adults' lack of pre-speech auditory modulation normalizes when speaking with delayed auditory feedback	CORTEX			English	Article						Stuttering; Auditory modulation; Speech planning; Event-related potentials	LANGUAGE PATHWAYS; INTERNAL-MODELS; DORSAL; ACQUISITION; SUPPRESSION; INTEGRATION; PREDICTION; RESPONSES; COMPONENT; FLUENCY	Auditory modulation during speech movement planning is limited in adults who stutter (AWS), but the functional relevance of the phenomenon itself remains unknown. We investigated for AWS and adults who do not stutter (AWNS) (a) a potential relationship between pre-speech auditory modulation and auditory feedback contributions to speech motor learning and (b) the effect on pre-speech auditory modulation of real-time versus delayed auditory feedback. Experiment I used a sensorimotor adaptation paradigm to estimate auditory-motor speech learning. Using acoustic speech recordings, we quantified subjects' formant frequency adjustments across trials when continually exposed to formant-shifted auditory feedback. In Experiment II, we used electroencephalography to determine the same subjects' extent of pre-speech auditory modulation (reductions in auditory evoked potential N1 amplitude) when probe tones were delivered prior to speaking versus not speaking. To manipulate subjects' ability to monitor real-time feedback, we included speaking conditions with non-altered auditory feedback (NAF) and delayed auditory feedback (DAP). Experiment I showed that auditory-motor learning was limited for AWS versus AWNS, and the extent of learning was negatively correlated with stuttering frequency. Experiment II yielded several key findings: (a) our prior finding of limited pre-speech auditory modulation in AWS was replicated; (b) DAF caused a decrease in auditory modulation for most AWNS but an increase for most AWS; and (c) for AWS, the amount of auditory modulation when speaking with DAF was positively correlated with stuttering frequency. Lastly, AWNS showed no correlation between pre-speech auditory modulation (Experiment II) and extent of auditory-motor learning (Experiment I) whereas AWS showed a negative correlation between these measures. Thus, findings suggest that AWS show deficits in both pre-speech auditory modulation and auditory-motor learning; however, limited pre-speech modulation is not directly related to limited auditory-motor adaptation; and in AWS, DAF paradoxically tends to normalize their otherwise limited pre-speech auditory modulation.

Combining attentional resources from both of those sources exerts qualitatively large effects on manual performance. Here we tested how combined attention was represented in sensory processing, as reflected by the P1 component and associated activity in the alpha band. We measured performance and recorded EEG while participants' attention was engaged in an automated, endogenous, and combined (i.e., automated and endogenous) manner. Behavioral results replicated past reports with reliable effects of isolated automated and endogenous attention, as well as their qualitatively unique combined effect. ERP analyses indicated expected increases in P1 amplitude for validly relative to invalidly cued targets in automated and endogenous conditions. However, in the combined case, the P1 difference between validly relative to invalidly cued targets decreased. Analyses of target-locked alpha-band further revealed that this condition was associated with an increased synchrony in the alpha frequency for invalidly cued targets. This suggests that the large performance benefit observed when attentional systems combine is partly driven by suppressed processing of unexpected targets, dovetailing with the notion that in addition to increasing sensory gain of attended targets, attention may also modulate complex behavior by increasing suppression of unattended ones.

Despite increasing recognition of the clinical heterogeneity of RTT and its variants (e.g Classical, Hanefeld and PSV(Preserved Speech Variant)), the link between causative mutations and observed clinical phenotypes remains unclear. Quantitative analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings may further elucidate important differences between the different clinical and genetic forms of RTT. Methods: Using a large cohort (n = 42) of RTT patients, we analysed the electrophysiological profiles of RTT variants (genetic and clinical) in addition to epilepsy status (no epilepsy/treatment-responsive epilepsy/treatment-resistant epilepsy). The distribution of spectral power and inter-electrode coherence measures were derived from continuous resting-state EEG recordings. Results: RTT genetic variants (MeCP2/CDLK5) were characterised by significant differences in network architecture on comparing first principal components of inter-electrode coherence across all frequency bands (p < 0.0001). Greater coherence in occipital and temporal pairs were seen in MeCP2 vs CDLK5 variants, the main drivers in between group differences. Similarly, clinical phenotypes (Classical RTT/Hanefeld/PSV) demonstrated significant differences in network architecture (p < 0.0001). Right tempero-parietal connectivity was found to differ between groups (p = 0.04), with greatest coherence in the Classical RTT phenotype. PSV demonstrated a significant difference in left-sided parieto-occipital coherence (p = 0.026). Whilst overall power decreased over time, there were no difference in asymmetry and inter-electrode coherence profiles over time. There was a significant difference in asymmetry in the overall power spectra between epilepsy groups (p = 0.04) in addition to occipital asymmetry across all frequency bands. Significant differences in network architecture were also seen across epilepsy groups (p = 0.044). Conclusions: Genetic and clinical variants of RTT are characterised by discrete patterns of inter-electrode coherence and network architecture which remain stable over time. Further, hemispheric distribution of spectral power and measures of network dysfunction are associated with epilepsy status and treatment responsiveness. These findings support the role of discrete EEG profiles as non-invasive biomarkers in RTT and its genetic/clinical variants.

To further study the potential association, we applied a novel technique, the non-invasive transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS), which is speculated to increase noradrenaline levels. Using a within-subject cross-over design, 20 healthy participants received continuous tVNS and sham stimulation on two consecutive days (stimulation counterbalanced across participants) while performing a visual oddball task. During stimulation, oval non-targets (standard), normal-head (easy) and rotated-head (difficult) targets, as well as novel stimuli (scenes) were presented. As an indirect marker of noradrenergic activation we also collected salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) before and after stimulation. Results showed larger P3b amplitudes for target, relative to standard stimuli, irrespective of stimulation condition. Exploratory post hoc analyses, however, revealed that, in comparison to standard stimuli, easy (but not difficult) targets produced larger P3b (but not P3a) amplitudes during active tVNS, compared to sham stimulation. For sAA levels, although main analyses did not show differential effects of stimulation, direct testing revealed that tVNS (but not sham stimulation) increased sAA levels after stimulation. Additionally, larger differences between tVNS and sham stimulation in P3b magnitudes for easy targets were associated with larger increase in sAA levels after tVNS, but not after sham stimulation. Despite preliminary evidence for a modulatory influence of tVNS on the P3b, which may be partly mediated by activation of the noradrenergic system, additional research in this field is clearly warranted. Future studies need to clarify whether tVNS also facilitates other processes, such as learning and memory, and whether tVNS can be used as therapeutic tool.

As the standard assumption of independent and identically distributed samples does not hold for such data, two important problems are to accurately estimate group-level effect sizes, and to obtain powerful statistical tests against group-level null hypotheses. A common approach is to summarize subject-level data by a single quantity per subject, which is often the mean or the difference between class means, and treat these as samples in a group-level t-test. This "naive" approach is, however, suboptimal in terms of statistical power, as it ignores information about the intra-subject variance. To address this issue, we review several approaches to deal with nested data, with a focus on methods that are easy to implement. With what we call the sufficient-summary-statistic approach, we highlight a computationally efficient technique that can improve statistical power by taking into account within-subject variances, and we provide step-by-step instructions on how to apply this approach to a number of frequently-used measures of effect size. The properties of the reviewed approaches and the potential benefits over a group-level t-test are quantitatively assessed on simulated data and demonstrated on EEG data from a simulated-driving experiment.

Neurophysiology underlying influence of stimulus reliability on audiovisual integration	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha oscillations; audiovisual asynchrony; audiovisual integration; event-related potentials	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; SIMULTANEITY JUDGMENTS; TEMPORAL-ORDER; INFORMATION; SYNCHRONY	We tested the predictions of the dynamic reweighting model (DRM) of audiovisual (AV) speech integration, which posits that spectrotemporally reliable (informative) AV speech stimuli induce a reweighting of processing from low-level to high-level auditory networks. This reweighting decreases sensitivity to acoustic onsets and in turn increases tolerance to AV onset asynchronies (AVOA). EEG was recorded while subjects watched videos of a speaker uttering trisyllabic nonwords that varied in spectrotemporal reliability and asynchrony of the visual and auditory inputs. Subjects judged the stimuli as in-sync or out-ofsync. Results showed that subjects exhibited greater AVOA tolerance for non-blurred than blurred visual speech and for less than more degraded acoustic speech. Increased AVOA tolerance was reflected in reduced amplitude of the P1-P2 auditory evoked potentials, a neurophysiological indication of reduced sensitivity to acoustic onsets and successful AV integration. There was also sustained visual alpha band (8-14 Hz) suppression (desynchronization) following acoustic speech onsets for nonblurred vs. blurred visual speech, consistent with continuous engagement of the visual system as the speech unfolds. The current findings suggest that increased spectrotemporal reliability of acoustic and visual speech promotes robust AV integration, partly by suppressing sensitivity to acoustic onsets, in support of the DRM's reweighting mechanism. Increased visual signal reliability also sustains the engagement of the visual system with the auditory system to maintain alignment of information across modalities.

Humans have evolved a system that effectively and automatically converts sound sensory inputs into emotions. Although different emotional responses to sounds with different frequency characteristics are empirically recognized, there is a paucity of studies addressing different emotional responses to these sounds and the underlying neural mechanisms. In this study, we examined effects of pure tone (PT) and white noise (WN) inputs at ordinary loudness levels on emotional responses. We found that WN stimuli produced more aversive responses than PT stimuli. This difference was endorsed by larger late posterior positivity (LPP). In a source localization study, we found increased neural activity in the parietal lobe prior to LPP. These findings show that WN stimuli produce aversive perceptions compared with PT stimuli, at typical loudness levels. In addition, different emotional responses were processed in a similar manner as visual stimulations, as reflected by increased LPP activation. Various emotional effects of WN and PT stimuli, at ordinary loudness levels, could expand our understanding of adverse effects of noise as well as favorable effects associated with music.

Functionally separated networks for self-paced and externally-cued motor execution in Parkinson's disease: Evidence from deep brain recordings in humans	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							HUMAN SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; BASAL GANGLIA; PATHOLOGICAL SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; BETA OSCILLATIONS; STIMULATION; MOVEMENT; CIRCUITS; ORGANIZATION; PARALLEL	Spatially segregated cortico-basal ganglia networks have been proposed for the control of goal-directed and habitual behavior. In Parkinson's disease, selective loss of dopaminergic neurons regulating sensorimotor (habitual) behavior might therefore predominantly cause deficits in habitual motor control, whereas control of goal-directed movement is relatively preserved. Following this hypothesis, we examined the electrophysiology of cortico-basal ganglia networks in Parkinson patients emulating habitual and goal-directed motor control during self-paced and externally-cued finger tapping, respectively, while simultaneously recording local field potentials in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and surface EEG. Only externally-cued movements induced a pro-kinetic event-related beta-desynchronization, whereas beta-oscillations were continuously suppressed during self-paced movements. Connectivity analysis revealed higher synchronicity (phase-locking value) between the STN and central electrodes during self-paced and higher STN to frontal phase-locking during externally-cued movements. Our data provide direct electrophysiological support for the existence of functionally segregated cortico-basal ganglia networks controlling motor behavior in Parkinson patients, and corroborate the assumption of Parkinson patients being shifted from habitual towards goal-directed behavior.

Independent studies evaluating its after-effects on nociceptive or non-nociceptive somatosensory responses have reported comparable effects suggesting that tsDCS impairs axonal conduction of both the spino-thalamic and the medial lemniscus tracts. The present study aimed to better understand how tsDCS affects, in humans, the spinal transmission of nociceptive and nonnociceptive somatosensory inputs. We compared the after-effects of anodal low-thoracic, anodal cervical and sham tsDCS on the perception and brain responses elicited by laser stimuli selectively activating Ao-thermonociceptors of the spinothalamic system and vibrotactile stimuli selectively activating low-threshold A(3-mechanoreceptors of the lemniscal system, delivered to the hands and feet. Low-thoracic tsDCS selectively and significantly affected the LEP-N2 wave elicited by nociceptive stimulation of the lower limbs, without affecting the LEP-N2 wave elicited by nociceptive stimulation of the upper limbs, and without affecting the SEP-N2 wave elicited by vibrotactile stimulation of either limb. This selective and segmental effect indicates that the neuromodulatory after-effects of tsDCS cannot be explained by anodal blockade of axonal conduction and, instead, are most probably due to a segmental effect on the synaptic efficacy of the local processing and/or transmission of nociceptive inputs in the dorsal horn.

Furthermore, people rapidly incorporate stimuli into their self-representation even if these stimuli do not have an intrinsic relation to self. In the present study, we investigated the time course of the processes involved in preferential processing of self-related information. In two EEG experiments three unfamiliar faces were identified with verbal labels as either the participant, a friend, or a stranger. Afterwards, participants judged whether two stimuli presented in succession (ISI = 1500ms) matched. In experiment 1, faces were followed by verbal labels and in experiment 2, labels were followed by faces. Both experiments showed the same pattern of behavioral and electrophysiological results. If the first stimulus (face or label) was associated with self, reaction times were faster and the late frontal positivity following the first stimulus was more pronounced. The self-association of the second stimulus (label or face) did not affect response times. However, the central-parietal P3 following presentation of the second stimulus was more pronounced when the second stimulus was preceded by self-related first stimulus. These results indicate that even unfamiliar faces that are associated to self can activate a self-representation.

Especially in complex situations, distraction due to secondary stimuli can impair driving performance. The inhibition of distractors or inadequate prepotent responses to irrelevant stimuli requires cognitive control, which is assumed to be reduced with increasing age. The present EEG study investigated the effects of secondary acoustic and visual stimuli on driving performance of younger and older car drivers in a driving simulator task. The participants had to respond to brake lights of a preceding car under different distraction conditions and with varying task difficulties. Overall, the anticipation of high demanding tasks affected braking response behavior in young and especially in older adults, who showed reduced cognitive control to task-relevant braking stimuli, as reflected by a smaller P3b. In a more easy (perception only) task, simultaneously presented acoustic stimuli accelerated braking response times (RTs) in young and older adults, which was associated with a pronounced P2. In contrast, secondary visual stimuli increased braking RTs in older adults, associated with a reduced P3b. In a more difficult (discrimination) task, braking response behavior was impaired by the presence of secondary acoustic and visual stimuli in young and older drivers. Braking RT increased (and the P3b decreased), especially when the responses to the secondary stimuli had to be suppressed. This negative effect was more pronounced with visual secondary stimuli, and especially so in the older group. In sum, the results suggest an impaired resistance to distractor interference and a reduced inhibition of prepotent responses in older drivers. This was most pronounced when the processing of task-relevant and irrelevant stimuli engage the same mental resources, for example, by sharing the same stimulus modality.

Masked and unmasked error-related potentials during continuous control and feedback	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						interaction error-related potential; asynchronous classification; continuous control; continuous feedback; brain-computer interface; EEG; jittered feedback	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; ERP COMPONENTS; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; SINGLE; BCI; NEGATIVITY; TUTORIAL	The detection of error-related potentials (ErrPs) in tasks with discrete feedback is well established in the brain-computer interface (BCI) field. However, the decoding of ErrPs in tasks with continuous feedback is still in its early stages. Objective. We developed a task in which subjects have continuous control of a cursor's position by means of a joystick. The cursor's position was shown to the participants in two different modalities of continuous feedback: normal and jittered. The jittered feedback was created to mimic the instability that could exist if participants controlled the trajectory directly with brain signals. Approach. This paper studies the electroencephalographic (EEG)-measurable signatures caused by a loss of control over the cursor's trajectory, causing a target miss. Main results. In both feedback modalities, time-locked potentials revealed the typical frontal-central components of errorrelated potentials. Errors occurring during the jittered feedback (masked errors) were delayed in comparison to errors occurring during normal feedback (unmasked errors). Masked errors displayed lower peak amplitudes than unmasked errors. Time-locked classification analysis allowed a good distinction between correct and error classes (average Cohen-kappa = 0.803, average TPR = 81.8% and average TNR = 96.4%). Time-locked classification analysis between masked error and unmasked error classes revealed results at chance level (average Cohen-kappa = 0.189, average TPR = 60.9% and average TNR = 58.3%). Afterwards, we performed asynchronous detection of ErrPs, combining both masked and unmasked trials. The asynchronous detection of ErrPs in a simulated online scenario resulted in an average TNR of 84.0% and in an average TPR of 64.9%. Significance. The time-locked classification results suggest that the masked and unmasked errors were indistinguishable in terms of classification. The asynchronous classification results suggest that the feedback modality did not hinder the asynchronous detection of ErrPs.

Repetition suppression (RS), a learning phenomenon in which stimulus repetitions result in diminished brain activity, has been found to be impaired in FXS. Alterations in RS have been associated with behavioural problems in FXS; however, relations between RS and intellectual functioning have not yet been elucidated. Methods: EEG was recorded in 14 FXS participants and 25 neurotypical controls during an auditory habituation paradigm using repeatedly presented pseudowords. Non-phased locked signal energy was compared across presentations and between groups using linear mixed models (LMMs) in order to investigate RS effects across repetitions and brain areas and a possible relation to non-verbal IQ (NVIQ) in FXS. In addition, we explored group differences according to NVIQ and we probed the feasibility of training a support vector machine to predict cognitive functioning levels across FXS participants based on single-trial RS features. Results: LMM analyses showed that repetition effects differ between groups (FXS vs. controls) as well as with respect to NVIQ in FXS. When exploring group differences in RS patterns, we found that neurotypical controls revealed the expected pattern of RS between the first and second presentations of a pseudoword. More importantly, while FXS participants in the <= 42 NVIQ group showed no RS, the > 42 NVIQ group showed a delayed RS response after several presentations. Concordantly, single-trial estimates of repetition effects over the first four repetitions provided the highest decoding accuracies in the classification between the FXS participant groups. Conclusion: Electrophysiological measures of repetition effects provide a non-invasive and unbiased measure of brain responses sensitive to cognitive functioning levels, which may be useful for clinical trials in FXS.

In the proposed method, the design problem is constructed in least squares (LS) sense of phase response error in frequency domain for both APE. Fractional derivative (FD) is incorporated as constraint in the design procedure, which improved the approximation of the designed phase response with desired phase response. Exploration of suitable value of ED (u) and its point of evaluation known as reference frequency (omega(o)) is computationally expensive task when searched using conventional search approach. Therefore, heuristic optimization methods known as constraint factor particle swarm optimization (CF-PSO) has been deployed for the task such that the objective function constructed as sum of maximum phase errors of both APFs must minimized Experiment revels that 8th order FD is an appropriate order for the design of a lowpass filter (LPF).

While many systems have been proposed which utilize the P300 response elicited through an oddball task, these systems struggle to classify user responses with accuracies comparable to many visual stimulus based systems. In this study, we model the tactile ERP generation as label noise and develop a novel BCI paradigm for binary communication designed to minimize label confusion. The classification model is based on a modified Gaussian mixture and trained using expectation maximization (EM). Finally, we show after testing on multiple subjects that this approach yields cross-validated accuracies for all users which are significantly above chance and suggests that such an approach is robust and reliable for a variety of binary communication-based applications.

At the enterprise level, material motivation and spiritual motivation often become the main motivation means to employees. In this paper, we mainly use the ERP theory in neuromanagement to study the neural mechanism of internal material motivation and external spiritual motivation to destroy intrinsic motivation effect through stopwatch key experiment. The research shows that internal material motivation is not always able to play a positive role in promoting, and sometimes it may destroy the original intrinsic motivation, which is not conducive to the continuous effect of motivation, while external spiritual motivation can often enhance the motivation management mechanism of enterprises. Based on the achievements of this research, we think that the leaders of enterprises need to flexibly apply two kinds of motivation measures in the motivation management mechanism of enterprises, so as to fully play the positive effect of motivation.

These treatments also ameliorate executive dysfunctions in AD(H)D. However, the mechanisms underlying effects of MPH and NF on executive functions in AD(H)D (e.g. the ability to inhibit prepotent responses) are far from understood. It is particularly unclear whether these interventions affect similar or dissociable neural mechanisms and associated functional neuroanatomical structures. This, however, is important when aiming to further improve these treatments. We compared the neurophysiological mechanisms of MPH and theta/beta NF treatments on inhibitory control on the basis of EEG recordings and source localization analyses. The data show that MPH and theta/beta NF both increase the ability to inhibit pre-potent responses to a similar extent. However, the data suggest that MPH and NF target different neurophysiological mechanisms, especially when it comes to functional neuroanatomical structures associated with these effects. Both treatments seem to affect neurophysiological correlates of a 'braking function' in medial frontal areas. However, in case of the NF intervention, inferior parietal areas are also involved. This likely reflects the updating and stabilisation of efficient internal representations in order to initiate appropriate actions. No effects were seen in correlates of perceptual and attentional selection processes. Notably, reliable effects were only obtained after accounting for intra-individual variability in the neurophysiological data, which may also explain the diversity of findings in studies on treatment effects in AD(H)D, especially concerning neurofeedback.

The signature of undetected change: an exploratory electrotomographic investigation of gradual change blindness	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						change blindness; EEG; electrotomography; time-frequency; visual perception	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; WORKING-MEMORY; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; VISUAL-SEARCH; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; INTRAPARIETAL SULCUS	Neuroimaging-based investigations of change blindness, a phenomenon in which seemingly obvious changes in visual scenes fail to be detected. have significantly advanced our understanding of visual awareness. The vast majority of prior investigations, however, utilize paradigms involving visual disruptions (e.g.. intervening blank screens, saccadic movements, "mudsplashes"), making it difficult to isolate neural responses toward visual changes cleanly. To address this issue in this present study, high-density EEG data (256 channel) were collected from 25 participants using a paradigm in which visual changes were progressively introduced into detailed real-world scenes without the use of visual disruption. Oscillatory activity associated with undetected changes was contrasted with activity linked to their absence using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA). Although an insufficient number of detections were present to allow for analysis of actual change detection, increased beta-2 activity in the right inferior parietal lobule (rIPL), a region repeatedly associated with change blindness in disruption paradigms, followed by increased theta activity in the right superior temporal gyros (rSTG) was noted in undetected visual change responses relative to the absence of change. We propose the rIPL beta-2 activity to be associated with orienting attention toward visual changes. with the subsequent rise in rSTG theta activity being potentially linked with updating preconscious perceptual memory representations. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study represents the first neuroimaging-based investigation of gradual change blindness, a visual phenomenon that has significant potential to shed light on the processes underlying visual detection and conscious perception. The use of gradual change materials is reflective of real-world visual phenomena and allows for cleaner isolation of signals associated with the neural registration of change relative to the use of abrupt change transients.

Clinical and resting state eyes-closed electroencephalographic (rsEEG) rhythms from 40 ADMCI, 29 CKDMCI, and 45 cognitively normal elderly Nold) subjects were available in a national archive. Age, gender, and education were matched in the three groups, and Mini-Mental State Evaluation (MMSE) score was paired in the ADMCI and CKDMCI groups. Delta (<4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha 1 (8-10.5 Hz), alpha 2 (10.5-13 Hz), beta 1 (13-20 Hz), beta 2 (20-30 Hz), and gamma (30-40 Hz) cortical sources were estimated by eLORETA freeware and classified across individuals by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCC). Compared with Nold group, posterior alpha 1 source activities were more reduced in ADMCI than CKDMCI group. In contrast, widespread delta source activities were greater in CKDMCI than ADMCI group. These source activities correlated with the MMSE score and correctly classified between Nold and all MCI individuals (AUROCC = 0.8-0.85) and between ADMCI and CKDMCI subjects (AUROCC = 0.75). These results suggest that early AD affects cortical neural synchronization at alpha frequencies underpinning brain arousal and low vigilance in the quiet wakefulness. In contrast, CKD may principally affect cortical neural synchronization at the delta frequencies. Future prospective cross-validation studies will have to test these candidate rsEEG markers for clinical applications and drug discovery.

Modulation of Cognitive and Emotional Control in Age-Related Mild-to-Moderate Hearing Loss	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						ERPs; aging; hearing loss; cognitive conflict; emotional conflict; affective modulation; executive control	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; OLDER-ADULTS; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; STROOP INTERFERENCE; RESOLVE CONFLICT; BRAIN POTENTIALS; FACE RECOGNITION; FLANKER TASK	Progressive hearing loss is a common phenomenon in healthy aging and may affect the perception of emotions expressed in speech. Elderly with mild to moderate hearing loss often rate emotional expressions as less emotional and display reduced activity in emotion-sensitive brain areas (e.g., amygdala). However, it is not clear how hearing loss affects cognitive and emotional control mechanisms engaged in multimodal speech processing. In previous work we showed that negative, task-relevant and -irrelevant emotion modulates the two types of control in younger and older adults without hearing loss. To further explore how reduced hearing capacity affects emotional and cognitive control, we tested whether moderate hearing loss (>30 dB) at frequencies relevant for speech impacts cognitive and emotional control. We tested two groups of older adults with hearing loss (HL; N = 21; mean age = 70.5) and without hearing loss (NH; N = 21; mean age = 68.4). In two EEG experiments participants observed multimodal video clips and either categorized pronounced vowels (cognitive conflict) or their emotions (emotional conflict). Importantly, the facial expressions were either matched or mismatched with the corresponding vocalizations. In both conflict tasks, we found that negative stimuli modulated behavioral conflict processing in the NH but not the HL group, while the HL group performed at chance level in the emotional conflict task. Further, we found that the amplitude difference between congruent and incongruent stimuli was larger in negative relative to neutral N100 responses across tasks and groups. Lastly, in the emotional conflict task, neutral stimuli elicited a smaller N200 response than emotional stimuli primarily in the HL group. Consequently, age-related hearing loss not only affects the processing of emotional acoustic cues but also alters the behavioral benefits of emotional stimuli on cognitive and emotional control, despite preserved early neural responses. The resulting difficulties in the multimodal integration of incongruent emotional stimuli may lead to problems in processing complex social information (irony, sarcasm) and impact emotion processing in the limbic network. This could be related to social isolation and depression observed in the elderly with age-related hearing loss.

Predictability's aftermath: Downstream consequences of word predictability as revealed by repetition effects	CORTEX			English	Article						Word predictability; Repetition; Alpha power; Sentence comprehension	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; CONSCIOUS RECOLLECTION; SENTENTIAL CONSTRAINT; CUED-RECALL; CONTEXT; PREDICTION; ALPHA; THETA	Stimulus processing in language and beyond is shaped by context, with predictability having a particularly well-attested influence on the rapid processes that unfold during the presentation of a word. But does predictability also have downstream consequences for the quality of the constructed representations? On the one hand, the ease of processing predictable words might free up time or cognitive resources, allowing for relatively thorough processing of the input. On the other hand, predictability might allow the system to run in a top-down "verification mode", at the expense of thorough stimulus processing. This electroencephalogram (EEG) study manipulated word predictability, which reduced N400 amplitude and inter-trial phase clustering (ITPC), and then probed the fate of the (un)predictable words in memory by presenting them again. More thorough processing of predictable words should increase repetition effects, whereas less thorough processing should decrease them. Repetition was reflected in N400 decreases, late positive complex (LPC) enhancements, and late alpha/beta band power decreases. Critically, prior predictability tended to reduce the repetition effect on the N400, suggesting less priming, and eliminated the repetition effect on the LPC, suggesting a lack of episodic recollection. These findings converge on a top-down verification account, on which the brain processes more predictable input less thoroughly. More generally, the results demonstrate that predictability has multifaceted downstream consequences beyond processing in the moment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, existing biometric systems are with controversy: once divulged, they are compromised forever - no one can grow a new fingerprint or iris. This work explores a truly cancelable brain-based biometric system for mobile platforms (e.g., smart headwear). Specifically, we present a new psychophysiological protocol via non-volitional brain response for trustworthy mobile authentication, with an application example of smart headwear. Particularly, we address the following research challenges in mobile biometrics with a theoretical and empirical combined manner: (1) how to generate reliable brain responses with sophisticated visual stimuli; (2) how to acquire the distinct brain response and analyze unique features in the mobile platform; (3) how to reset and change brain biometrics when the current biometric credential is divulged. To evaluate the proposed solution, we conducted a pilot study and achieved an f-score accuracy of 95.46% and equal error rate (EER) of 2.503%, thereby demonstrating the potential feasibility of neurofeedback based biometrics for smart headwear. Furthermore, we perform the cancelability study and the longitudinal study, respectively, to show the effectiveness and usability of our new proposed mobile biometric system. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first in-depth research study on truly cancelable brain biometrics for secure mobile authentication.

This study explored the possibility of determining a person's recognition of other individuals by analyzing the steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) triggered by visual oscillations of familiar and unfamiliar faces. In our study, 23 adult (10 men) participants gave subjective familiarity ratings (in a 7-point Likert scale) of > 300 celebrities' and strangers' faces. For each participant, ten familiar and ten unfamiliar faces were selected based on his/her ratings. The selected faces were presented at 6 Hz while the participants performed a 'color change detection task orthogonal to the attributes of faces. The task was designed to maintain participants' visual attention towards the faces throughout the stimulus oscillations. Any difference between conditions would indicate modulation of visual attention by face familiarity. Results showed that the 12-Hz event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs in decibel) at parietal-occipital electrodes were significantly lower when viewing familiar faces compared to unfamiliar faces. In individual level analysis, 18 out of 23 (78%) participants had significantly lower 12-Hz ERSPs at left parietal-occipital ROI in familiar face than unfamiliar face trials. This is the first study to demonstrate that SSVEPs triggered by stimulus oscillations can reveal people's recognition of faces with only 20 trials per condition and 10-s for each trial.

A growing body of evidence suggests that food cue exposure activates conditioned appetitive physiological and psychological responses that may override current metabolic needs and existing eating goals, such as the desire to maintain a healthy diet. This conditioned response results in unhealthy dietary choices and is a contributing factor in the current obesity epidemic. Prime based obesity prevention measures such as health warnings at point-of-sale or on product packaging may have the potential to counteract the influence of the obesogenic environment at the crucial moment when people make food purchasing or consumption decisions. Existing research into the efficacy of these intervention strategies has predominantly employed self-report and population level measures, and little evidence exists to support the contention that these measures counteract food cue reactivity at the time of decision making. Using a dietary self-control priming paradigm, we demonstrated that brief exposure to food product health warnings enhanced dietary self-control. Further, we analysed electroencephalographic correlates of selective attention and food cue evoked craving (N1, P3, LPP) to show that health warning exposure reduced the automatic appetitive response towards palatable food cues. These findings contribute to existing evidence that exogenous information can successfully prime latent goals, and substantiate the notion that food product health warnings may provide a new avenue through which to curb excessive energy intake and reduce rising obesity rates.

J	Wessel, JR				Wessel, Jan R.			Prepotent motor activity and inhibitory control demands in different variants of the go/no-go paradigm	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						ERPs; go; no-go; inhibitory control; P300; stop-signal task	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS; BLIND SEPARATION; BRAIN ACTIVATION; CONFLICT; TASK; COMPONENT; ALCOHOLICS; ALGORITHM	Inhibitory control enables humans to stop prepotent motor activity, and is commonly studied using go/no-go or stop-signal tasks. In stop-signal tasks, prepotent motor activity is elicited by delaying stop signals relative to go signals. In go/no-go tasks, however, trials include only one signalgo or no-go. Hence, prepotent motor activity has to be ensured differentlyfor example, by using rare no-go trials and short trial durations. However, a literature survey shows that approximate to 40% of studies use equiprobable go/no-go trials and approximate to 20% use long stimulus-stimulus intervals (> 4 s). It is unclear whether such slow-paced, equiprobable go/no-go tasks elicit prepotent motor activity and probe inhibitory control. We recorded EEG during four go/no-go tasks, varying in no-go probability and trial duration. We quantified prepotent motor activity on successfully inhibited no-go trials using the lateralized readiness potential. Only fast-paced go/no-go tasks with rare no-go trials reliably evoked such activity. We then used a stop-signal task and independent component analysis to isolate an established neural signature of inhibitory control, and investigated this signature's activity across the go/no-go tasks. Across tasks, increased prepotent motor activity on individual no-go trials was accompanied by greater frontocentral P3 amplitudes, confirming it as an index of inhibition. Crucially, this inhibition-related activity showed a 75% reduction in slow-paced, equiprobable go/no-go tasks compared to fast-paced, rare no-go versions. Therefore, since many common go/no-go task configurations do not reliably evoke prepotent motor activity, their inhibitory requirements are greatly reduced. This has major implications for the usage of go/no-go tasks in psychological experiments.

Maturation of the frontal cortex and its integration into widely distributed brain networks may result in diminishing distractibility with the transition into young adulthood. The aim of this study was to investigate maturational changes of brain activity during novelty processing. We hypothesized that during adolescence, timing and task-relevant modulation of frontal cortex network activity elicited by novelty processing improves, concurrently with increasing cognitive control abilities. A visual novelty oddball task was utilized in combination with EEG measurements to investigate brain maturation between 8-28 years of age (n = 84). Developmental changes of the frontal N2-P3a complex and concurrent theta oscillations (4-7 Hz) elicited by rare and unexpected novel stimuli were analyzed using regression models. N2 amplitude decreased, P3a amplitude increased, and latency of both components decreased with age. Pre-stimulus amplitude of theta oscillations decreased, while inter-trial consistency, task-related amplitude modulation and inter-site connectivity of frontal theta oscillations increased with age. Targets, intertwined in a stimulus train with regular non-targets and novels, were detected faster with increasing age. These results indicate that neural processing of novel stimuli became faster and the neural activation pattern more precise in timing and amplitude modulation. Better inter-site connectivity further implicates that frontal brain maturation leads to global neural reorganization and better integration of frontal brain activity within widely distributed brain networks. Faster target detection indicated that these maturational changes in neural activation during novelty processing may result in diminished distractibility and increased cognitive control to pursue the task.

Low-Frequency Oscillatory Correlates of Auditory Predictive Processing in Cortical-Subcortical Networks: A MEG-Study	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							GRANGER CAUSALITY ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; THETA OSCILLATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EEG-DATA; HIPPOCAMPAL; NOVELTY	Emerging evidence supports the role of neural oscillations as a mechanism for predictive information processing across large-scale networks. However, the oscillatory signatures underlying auditory mismatch detection and information flow between brain regions remain unclear. To address this issue, we examined the contribution of oscillatory activity at theta/alpha-bands (4-8/8-13 Hz) and assessed directed connectivity in magnetoencephalographic data while 17 human participants were presented with sound sequences containing predictable repetitions and order manipulations that elicited prediction-error responses. We characterized the spectro-temporal properties of neural generators using a minimum-norm approach and assessed directed connectivity using Granger Causality analysis. Mismatching sequences elicited increased theta power and phase-locking in auditory, hippocampal and prefrontal cortices, suggesting that theta-band oscillations underlie prediction-error generation in cortical-subcortical networks. Furthermore, enhanced feedforward theta/alpha-band connectivity was observed in auditory-prefrontal networks during mismatching sequences, while increased feedback connectivity in the alpha-band was observed between hippocampus and auditory regions during predictable sounds. Our findings highlight the involvement of hippocampal theta/alpha-band oscillations towards auditory prediction-error generation and suggest a spectral dissociation between inter-areal feedforward vs. feedback signalling, thus providing novel insights into the oscillatory mechanisms underlying auditory predictive processing.

The hippocampal sharp wave-ripple in memory retrieval for immediate use and consolidation	NATURE REVIEWS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; COMPLEMENTARY LEARNING-SYSTEMS; CELL ASSEMBLY PATTERNS; SPONTANEOUS EEG SPIKES; CA1 PYRAMIDAL CELLS; RETROGRADE-AMNESIA; SPATIAL MEMORY; PLACE CELLS; EPISODIC MEMORY	Various cognitive functions have long been known to require the hippocampus. Recently, progress has been made in identifying the hippocampal neural activity patterns that implement these functions. One such pattern is the sharp wave-ripple (SWR), an event associated with highly synchronous neural firing in the hippocampus and modulation of neural activity in distributed brain regions. Hippocampal spiking during SWRs can represent past or potential future experience, and SWR-related interventions can alter subsequent memory performance. These findings and others suggest that SWRs support both memory consolidation and memory retrieval for processes such as decision-making. In addition, studies have identified distinct types of SWR based on representational content, behavioural state and physiological features. These various findings regarding SWRs suggest that different SWR types correspond to different cognitive functions, such as retrieval and consolidation. Here, we introduce another possibility-that a single SWR may support more than one cognitive function. Taking into account classic psychological theories and recent molecular results that suggest that retrieval and consolidation share mechanisms, we propose that the SWR mediates the retrieval of stored representations that can be utilized immediately by downstream circuits in decision-making, planning, recollection and/or imagination while simultaneously initiating memory consolidation processes.

Rewarding images do not invoke the reward positivity: They inflate it	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DOPAMINE NEURONS ENCODE; PREDICTION ERROR; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; FRONTAL THETA; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; ANTERIOR CINGULATE	Increasing evidence suggests that the reward positivity conforms to an axiomatic reward prediction error that is, it closely follows the rule-like encoding of surprising reinforcers. However, a major limitation in these EEG studies is the over-reliance on a single class of secondary rewards like points or money, constraining dimensionality and limiting generalizability. In the current suite of studies we address this limitation by leveraging different classes of rewards outcomes, specifically emotionally pleasant pictures. Over a series of three experiments, participants were able to choose idiosyncratically preferred pictures as rewards. During the first two experiments, participants were rewarded with either high or low points or high or low preferred pictures. The reward positivity was modulated by points, but not by pictures (regardless of preference), which instead evoked enhanced N2 amplitudes. In a third study that paired high/low points and preferred/non-preferred pictures, the point-induced reward positivity was inflated by the presence of a preferred picture. In line with past research stating the reward positivity is primarily sensitive to positive reward prediction error, this report finds that it is also influenced by a liking dimension, which possibly acts as an affective state to frame the motivational aspect of extrinsic rewards.

This technology has been tested in paralysed patients, such as those with cervical spinal cord injuries or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but it has not been tested systematically in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), which is a severe type of muscular dystrophy due to the loss of dystrophin and is often accompanied by progressive muscle weakness and wasting. Here, we investigated the efficacy of a P300-based BCI for patients with DMD. Eight bedridden patients with DMD and eight age-and gender-matched able-bodied controls were instructed to input hiragana characters. We used a region-based, two-step P300-based BCI with green/blue flicker stimuli. EEG data were recorded, and a linear discriminant analysis distinguished the target from other non-targets. The mean online accuracy of inputted characters (accuracy for the two-step procedure) was 71.6% for patients with DMD and 80.6% for controls, with no significant difference between the patients and controls. The P300-based BCI was operated successfully by individuals with DMD in an advanced stage and these findings suggest that this technology may be beneficial for patients with this disease.

As accumulating evidence shows, music can promote auditory and language development in infancy and early childhood. It may even help to support auditory and language skills in infants whose development is compromised by heritable conditions, like the reading deficit dyslexia, or by environmental factors, such as premature birth. For example, infants born to dyslexic parents can have atypical brain responses to speech sounds and subsequent challenges in language development. Children born very preterm, in turn, have an increased likelihood of sensory, cognitive, and motor deficits. To ameliorate these deficits, we have developed early interventions focusing on music. Preliminary results of our ongoing longitudinal studies suggest that music making and parental singing promote infants' early language development and auditory neural processing. Together with previous findings in the field, the present studies highlight the role of active, social music making in supporting auditory and language development in at-risk children and infants. Once completed, the studies will illuminate both risk and protective factors in development and offer a comprehensive model of understanding the promises of music activities in promoting positive developmental outcomes during the first years of life.

The Internet provides massive information that can be accessed quickly via hyperlinks, but the information is typically fragmentary and concrete rather than integrative. According to construal level theory, the processing of this concrete and fragmentary information, should reduce attentional scope. Two experiments were conducted to test this hypothesis. In Experiment 1, three groups of participants were asked to shop online, read magazines or have a rest respectively, and a divided attention Navon-letter task was employed to measure the attentional scope before and after the assigned activity. It was found that the difference between reaction times in response to local vs. global targets was decreased only after Internet use, while there was no decrease in either the reading or resting group. In Experiment 2, the same procedure was used, and EEG/ERP methods were used to record both behavioral response and neural activity. Results showed that before the assigned activity, there was no significant difference in N2 amplitude in response to local vs. global targets in any of the three groups; during the activity, the lower-alpha activity induced by Internet use was significantly lower than that induced by reading or resting; after the activity, correspondingly, a more negative N2 wave was induced by the global than local targets only in the Internet group, while there were no significant differences in the other groups. Consistent with construal level theory, the results suggest that when surfing the Internet, attentional scope is reduced, and this effect might continue after Internet activity.

The activity of such detectors is reflected by the N1 ERP. Interestingly, certain acoustic transitions show an asymmetric N1 elicitation pattern: whereas first-order transitions (e.g., a change from a segment of constant frequency to a frequency glide [c-to-g change]) elicit N1, higher-order transitions (e.g., glide-to-constant [g-to-c] changes) do not. Consensus attributes this asymmetry to the absence of any available sensory mechanism that is able to rapidly detect higher-order changes. In contrast, our study provides compelling evidence for such a mechanism. We collected electrophysiological and behavioral data in a transient-detection paradigm. In each condition, a random (50%-50%) sequence of two types of tones occurred, which did or did not contain a transition (e.g., c-to-g and constant stimuli or g-to-c and glide tones). Additionally, the rate of pitch change of the glide varied (i.e., 10 vs. 40 semitones per second) in order to increase the number of responding neural assemblies. The rate manipulation modulated transient ERPs and behavioral detection performance for g-to-c transitions much stronger than for c-to-g transitions. The topographic and tomographic analyses suggest that the N1 response to c-to-g and also to g-to-c transitions emerged from the superior temporal gyrus. This strongly supports a sensory mechanism that allows the fast detection of higher-order changes.

Planning versus comprehension in turn-taking: Fast responders show reduced anticipatory processing of the question	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Turn-taking; EEG; N400; Language comprehension; Language production; Prediction	BRAIN; TASK; CONVERSATION; INTERFERENCE; OSCILLATIONS; PREDICTION; SIGNATURES; OVERLAP; MEG	Rapid response latencies in conversation suggest that responders start planning before the ongoing turn is finished. Indeed, an earlier EEG study suggests that listeners start planning their responses to questions as soon as they can (Bogels et al., 2015a). The present study aimed to (1) replicate this early planning effect and (2) investigate whether such early response planning incurs a cost on participants' concurrent comprehension of the ongoing turn. During the experiment participants answered questions from a confederate partner. To address aim (1), the questions were designed such that response planning could start either early or late in the turn. Our results largely replicate Bogels et al. (2015a), showing a large positive ERP effect and an oscillatory alpha/beta reduction right after participants could have first started planning their verbal response, again suggesting an early start of response planning. To address aim (2), the confederate's questions also contained either an expected word or an unexpected one to elicit a differential N400 effect, either before or after the start of response planning. We hypothesized an attenuated N400 effect after response planning had started. In contrast, the N400 effects before and after planning did not differ. There was, however, a positive correlation between participants' response time and their N400 effect size after planning had started; quick responders showed a smaller N400 effect, suggesting reduced attention to comprehension and possibly reduced anticipatory processing. We conclude that early response planning can indeed impact comprehension processing.

Previously, we have reported the left hippocampal volume increase and theta-gamma coupling (TGC) enhancement associated with working memory improvement following rTMS in depression. This study was aimed to examine whether there is a structure-function relationship in hippocampal neuroplasticity induced by prefrontal rTMS. Thirty-one patients with major depression underwent longitudinal MRI scans and resting-state EEG recordings with the 10-20 system using averaged ear-lobes reference, following 10 sessions of high-frequency rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Pearson's correlation analyses were applied for the longitudinal changes among the left and right hippocampal volumes as measured by manual volumetry, theta and gamma spectral powers, and TGC as measured by resting-state EEG. The analyses demonstrated that the left hippocampus volume increases correlated with TGC increases at the left central area (r = 0.576, p = 0.001, N = 31), whereas no significant correlations were observed among changes of right hippocampal volume, right central TGC, bilateral gamma or theta powers. These finding suggests structure-function relationship in rTMS-induced neuroplastic changes mediated through the hippocampus and prefrontal network at the stimulated side. Therefore, high-frequency prefrontal rTMS may exert its cognitive effect through the hippocampal structural-functional neuroplasticity.

J	Popov, S; Bastiaanse, R				Popov, Srdan; Bastiaanse, Roelien			Processes underpinning gender and number disagreement in Dutch: An ERP study	JOURNAL OF NEUROLINGUISTICS			English	Article						Gender; Number; Disagreement; P600; LAN	BRAIN POTENTIALS; GRAMMATICAL GENDER; AGREEMENT; SENTENCES; SPANISH; EXPECTANCY; VIOLATIONS; REANALYSIS; SEMANTICS; SYNTAX	In the current experiment, participants read word-by-word sentences containing gender (adjective-noun) and number (article-noun) disagreement in Dutch while EEG was recorded. Number and gender disagreement were expected to elicit different responses due to several reasons. Firstly, gender is a lexical feature whose value (e.g., masculine or feminine) is stored in the lexicon, whereas number value is assigned depending on conceptual knowledge (numerosity). Also, Dutch marks number but not gender on the noun. Finally, due to the morphological nature of number, number disagreement provides more repair options than gender disagreement, thereby increasing the processing load. Both gender and number disagreement elicited a P600, but no LAN. The P600 effect was larger for number than gender disagreement in the late P600 stage. Since the observed effect was in the late P600 stage, we suggest that the most salient difference between the two types of disagreement lies in the increased repair complexity for number disagreement compared to gender disagreement.

All eye movements were triggered by the offset of a central fixation light emitting diode (LED) and the onset of a lateral LED at various depths in an otherwise fully darkened room. Our analyses revealed that three source pairs, two located in the frontal lobe-the frontal eye fields (FEF) and an anterior frontal area-, and one located within the occipital cortex, can account for 99.2% of the observed ERPs. Overall, the comparison between source activities revealed the largest activity in the occipital cortex, while no difference in activity between FEF and the anterior frontal area was obtained. For all sources, increased activity was observed for combined vergences, especially combined convergences, relative to saccades. Behavioral results revealed that onset latencies were longest for combined convergences, intermediate for combined divergences, and the shortest for saccades. Together, these findings fit within a perspective in which both occipital and frontal areas play an important role in retinal disparity detection. In the case of saccades and combined divergences stimulus-locked activity was larger than response-locked activity, while no difference between stimulus-and response-locked activity was observed for combined convergences. These findings seem to imply that the electrophysiological activity preceding exogenous eye movements consists of a sensory-related part that is under cortical control, while subcortical structures may be held responsible for final execution.

While previous neurophysiological research investigated cognitive and motor performance separately, findings that combine both are rare. To get a deeper understanding of the influence of motor demands as well as the difficulty of a simultaneously performed cognitive task, we investigated 20 healthy individuals. Participants performed two cognitive tasks with different levels of difficulty while sitting or standing on one leg. In addition to behavioral data, we recorded the electroencephalogram from 26Ag/AgCl scalp electrodes. The critical time windows, predefined by visual inspection, yielded an early (200-300 ms, P2) and a subsequent positivity (350-500 ms, P3). Statistical analysis of the early time window registered a motor x cognition interaction. Resolution of this interaction revealed an effect of the cognitive task in the one-legged stance motor condition, with a more pronounced positivity for the difficult task. No significant differences between cognitive tasks emerged for the simple motor condition. The time-window between 350 and 500 ms registered main effects of the motor task and a trend for the cognitive task. While the influence of cognitive task difficulty (in the P3) is in accordance with previous studies, the motor task effect is specific to one legged stance (cf. no effects for running in previous research). The motor-cognition interaction found in the P2 indicates that the more difficult motor task (one-legged stance) facilitates cognitive task performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The goal of the current study was to explore the relationship between interoception and emotion face recognition in healthy adolescents. The heartbeat perception task was used to assess interoceptive accuracy(IAC) and participants were asked to recognize different facial expressions. EEG activity was recorded, providing data for the P100, the N170 and the P300 ERP components. Results indicated high sensitivity to negative affect, as well as low accuracy in the recognition of fear and sadness among adolescents high in IAC, reflected by amplitude modulations in the N170 and the P300. The interpretation of these results focus on the intensity experienced in negative facial emotions, modified by IAC, as well as on emotional valence and arousal. These findings emphasize the dynamic integration of body and mind for shaping emotion recognition in adolescence.

Disentangling the interaction of sex differences and hemispheric specialization for face processing - Evidence from ERPs	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Face processing; N170; Sex differences; Interhemispheric cooperation; Laterality; EEG	FUNCTIONAL CEREBRAL ASYMMETRIES; BILATERAL REDUNDANCY GAIN; MENSTRUAL-CYCLE; INTERHEMISPHERIC INTERACTION; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; HUMAN BRAIN; RECOGNITION; CORTEX	Recent studies on face processing and its hemispheric lateralization suggest that inconsistencies in earlier findings might be partially explained by sex differences, as findings from event-related potential studies indicated a more asymmetric functioning of the visual cortex during face encoding in men, whereas women seemed to display a more bilateral activation pattern. The aim of this study was to further investigate the role of sex differences in hemispheric specialization during face recognition. Fifty-four healthy participants ( 27 females and 27 males) engaged in a familiarity decision task in which famous and unfamiliar faces were presented in a lateralized tachistoscopic fashion with unilateral und bilateral presentation modes and measurement of eventrelated potentials and behavioral responses. Results showed a clear N170 component for males and females in all experimental conditions. No hemispheric differences of the N170 were observed in the bilateral condition and both groups showed larger right-hemispheric than left-hemispheric N170 amplitudes in the left visual field condition. In the right visual field condition, however, only female participants showed significantly larger left-hemispheric compared to right-hemispheric N170 amplitudes, whereas male participants did not show such a modulation. The effect corresponds to a greater responsivity of left-hemispheric processes underlying the N170 component in female participants. Further analyses revealed N170 differences in the left and right hemisphere for females only, when stimuli were presented unilaterally. In contrast, this modulation of N170 amplitudes was only observed in the left hemisphere in males. The results suggest a stronger hemispheric lateralization in men than in women during face processing.

However, this task has recently been associated with poor reliability and conflicting results. To resolve these discrepancies, we tested the underlying assumption of the dot-probe taskthat fast probe responses index heightened cue selectionusing an electrophysiological measure of selective attention. Specifically, we used a reverse correlation approach in combination with frequency-tagged steady-state visual potentials (ssVEPs). Twenty-one participants completed a modified dot-probe task in which each member of a pair of lateralized face cues, varying in emotional expression (angry-angry, neutral-angry, neutral-neutral), flickered at one of two frequencies (15 or 20 Hz), to evoke ssVEPs. One cue was then replaced by a response probe, and participants indicated the probe orientation (0 degrees or 90 degrees). We analyzed the ssVEP evoked by the cues as a function of response speed to the subsequent probe (i.e., a reverse correlation analysis). Electrophysiological measures of cue processing varied with probe hemifield location: Faster responses to left probes were associated with weak amplification of the preceding left cue, apparent only in a median split analysis. By contrast, faster responses to right probes were systematically and parametrically predicted by diminished visuocortical selection of the preceding right cue. Together, these findings highlight the poor validity of the dot-probe task, in terms of quantifying intrinsic, nondirected attentive selection irrespective of probe/cue location.

The results of proposed method are compared with recursive least square and other evolutionary algorithms. The performance of these algorithms is evaluated in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), mean square error (MSE), maximum error (ME) mean, standard deviation (SD) and correlation factor (r). The noise attenuation capability is tested on EMG signal contaminated with power line and ECG noise at different SNR levels. A comparative study of various techniques reveals that the performance of BR-ABC algorithm is better in noisy environment. Our simulation results show that the ANC filter using BR-ABC technique provides 15 dB improvement in output average SNR, 63 and 83% reduction in MSE and ME, respectively as compared to ANC filter based on PSO technique. Further, the ANC filter designed using BR-ABC technique enhances the correlation between output and pure EMG signal.

Those experiments compared VSTM performance for simultaneously and sequentially presented stimuli. However, there is still controversy about whether the bandwidth for consolidation is determined by the type of information. To further investigate this issue, here we measured electroencephalography while participants attempted to consolidate 1, 2 or 4 simultaneously presented colors (Experiment 1) or orientations (Experiment 2) under limited presentation times. We used the contralateral delay activity (CDA) as an electrophysiological marker of the number of items that were consolidated. For colored stimuli, the CDA amplitude increased between set-size 1 and 2 but did not further increase for set size 4. By contrast, for orientation, the CDA amplitude remained at the set size 1 amplitude as set size increased to 2 or 4 items. Furthermore, in a long exposure duration (300 ms) condition that did not limit the consolidation process, the CDA amplitude pattern indicated that VSTM capacity is limited to about 3 colored items and about 2 orientation items in our paradigm. Thus, the CDA effects observed in the short presentation time was not limited by VSTM storage, but rather by consolidation. These results are consistent with our previous behavioral research and suggest that the bandwidth of VSTM consolidation is determined by the stimulus feature.

The present study aims to assess whether such modulations occurs also in auditory modality. In order to investigate auditory sensory modulations, we compared a passive listening condition with two conditions in which attention was internally oriented as a part of a task; a visual imagery condition and an inner speech condition. EEG signal was recorded from 20 participants while they were exposed to auditory probes during these three conditions. ERP results showed no differences in N1 auditory response comparing the three conditions reflecting maintenance of evoked electrophysiological reactivity for auditory modality. Nonetheless, time-frequency analyses showed that gamma and theta power in frontal regions was higher for passive listening than for internal attentional conditions. Specifically, the reduced amplitude in early gamma and theta band during both inward attention conditions may reflect reduced conscious attention of the current auditory stimulation. Finally, different pattern of beta band activity was observed only during visual imagery which can reflect cross-modal integration between visual and auditory modalities and it can distinguish this form of mental imagery from the inner speech. Taken together, these results showed that attentional suppression mechanisms in auditory modality are different from visual modality during mental imagery processes. Our results about oscillatory activity also confirm the important role of gamma oscillations in auditory processing and the differential neural dynamics underlying the visual and auditory/verbal imagery.

J	Connell, AM; Danzo, S; Dawson, G				Connell, Arin M.; Danzo, Sarah; Dawson, Glen			Effects of depression and past-year binge drinking on cognitive control processes during a flanker task in college-aged adults	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE			English	Article						Alcohol; attention; binge drinking; cognition; depression; EEG; ERP; flanker task	ALCOHOL-CONSUMPTION; FOLLOW-UP; MAJOR DEPRESSION; COMPONENT; P300; CONSEQUENCES; CONFLICT; DYNAMICS; PATTERN; DEFICIT	Background: Recent but largely separate literatures have examined neurocognitive alterations related to both depression and binge drinking, suggesting similar patterns of impairments in attention control and decisional processes. However, depression and problematic alcohol use tend to co-occur, and few studies have examined whether cognitive processing effects of depression and binge drinking are independent or interacting. Objective: The current study examined joint effects of depressive symptoms and past-year binge drinking on cognitive processing (measured via EEG assessment). Methods: University students aged 18 and over (N=46; 63.4% female) were recruited based on self-reported depressive symptoms and also provided reports of alcohol use (51% reported significant depression; 46% reported at-least one past-year binge-drinking episode). Participants completed a computerized flanker task, assessing cognitive control processes. Forty-one participants providing useable data were included in analyses. Results: Past-year binge drinking was associated with slower and more accurate behavioral responding. The interaction of binge-drinking and depressive symptoms was related to the magnitude of early attentional components (N1 and N2), with individuals reporting high depressive symptoms and a history of binge-drinking exhibiting attenuated early attentional engagement (e.g., less negative N1) coupled with enhanced attention control processing (e.g., more negative N2). Depressive symptoms also predicted a lack of discriminated P3 amplitudes on congruent versus incongruent trials. Conclusion. The data suggest that depression and binge drinking in the past-year jointly interact to predict early attentional processing, with the pattern of responding consistent with a compensatory response process. Results highlight the importance of future work on binge-drinking accounting for co-occurring depression.

In this paper, an oddball paradigm with two types of frequency-deviant stimulus (standard stimuli were pure tones of 1000 Hz; small deviant stimuli were pure tones of 1050 Hz; large deviant stimuli were pure tones of 1200 Hz) was applied to elicit mismatch negativity (MMN) in 30 patients with DOCs diagnosed using the JFK Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R). The results showed that the peak amplitudes of MMN elicited by both large and small deviant stimuli were significantly different from baseline. In terms of the spatial properties of MMN, a significant interaction effect between conditions (small and large deviant stimuli) and electrode nodes was centered at the frontocentral area. Furthermore, correlation coefficients were calculated between MMN amplitudes and CRS-R scores for each electrode among all participants to generate topographic maps. Meanwhile, a significant negative correlation between the MMN amplitudes elicited by large deviant stimuli and the CRS-R scores was also found at the frontocentral area. In consequence, our results combine the above spatial properties of MMN in patients with DOCs, and provide a more precise location (frontocentral area) at which to evaluate the correlation between clinical electrophysiological assessment and the level of consciousness.

Previous studies revealed that the space-orientated feature-based filtering (target and distractors in distinct locations) was impaired in PD patients. However, the object-orientated feature-based filtering (target and distractor information pertaining to one object) ability in PD patients remains unclear. In this study, we examined the object-orientated feature-based filtering ability of 14 PD patients and 14 healthy controls in a change detection task under EEG monitoring. Participants were asked to remember the colors of two different objects while ignoring their shapes. Critically, the irrelevant feature could be changed in the probe. A failure in complete feature-based filtering would lead to an "irrelevant-change distracting effect," where the change of the irrelevant feature would impair the performance of the target feature, and lead to an enhanced anterior N2. We found that the distracting effect was larger in PD patients than in the control group in terms of d'; however, the N2 amplitude evoked by the irrelevant change was smaller in PD patients than in the control group. These results suggested that the object-orientated feature-based filtering ability was impaired in PD, which might derive from the deficit of their executive control.

J	Curcio, G				Curcio, Giuseppe			Exposure to Mobile Phone-Emitted Electromagnetic Fields and Human Attention: No Evidence of a Causal Relationship	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review						radiofrequency; cognitive effects; behavior; brain functions; GSM; UMTS	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; SHORT-TERM; SLEEP EEG; CELLULAR TELEPHONES; CONCURRENT CAFFEINE; PERFORMANCE; RADIATION; GSM; UMTS	In the past 20 years of research regarding effects of mobile phone-derived electromagnetic fields (EMFs) on human cognition, attention has been one of the first and most extensively investigated functions. Different domains investigated covered selective, sustained, and divided attention. Here, the most relevant studies on this topic have been reviewed and discussed. A total of 43 studies are reported and summarized: of these, 31 indicated a total absence of statistically significant difference between real and sham signal, 9 showed a partial improvement of attentional performance (mainly increase in speed of performance and/or improvement of accuracy) as a function of real exposure, while the remaining 3 showed inconsistent results (i.e., increased speed in some tasks and slowing in others) or even a worsening in performance (reduced speed and/or deteriorated accuracy). These results are independent of the specific attentional domain investigated. This scenario allows to conclude that there is a substantial lack of evidence about a negative influence of non-ionizing radiations on attention functioning. Nonetheless, published literature is very heterogeneous under the point of view of methodology (type of signal, exposure time, blinding), dosimetry (accurate evaluation of specific absorption rate-SAR or emitted power), and statistical analyses, making arduous a conclusive generalization to everyday life. Some remarks and suggestions regarding future research are proposed.

Food addiction is associated with impaired performance monitoring	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Performance monitoring; Error processing; Eating; Food addiction; Event-related potential; ERN	BRAIN ACTIVITY; IMPULSIVENESS; AWARENESS; OBESITY; CORTEX; ERRORS	Currently, there is an ongoing debate about whether it is possible to be addicted to food. There are several indications pointing in this direction, but research is scarce. Up to this date it is not exactly known whether this "food addiction" shares common neurocognitive deficits observed in the more classical types of addictions such as substance use disorders (SUDs). One commonly observed finding in SUD patients is that there is an impaired cognitive control. One of the essential components of cognitive control is performance monitoring. In the present study it is studied whether persons with "food addiction" have impaired error monitoring. For this purpose the performance monitoring of persons meeting the criteria for "food addiction" (n=34) according to the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) were compared with a control group (n = 34) while performing an Eriksen flanker task and EEG measurement. Both electrophysiological (ERN and Pe component) and behavioral measures were compared between the two groups. The present study indicates that the "food addicted" persons have reduced ERN and Pe waves. In addition, the "food addiction" group demonstrates a higher number of errors on the flanker task. In general, the results provide indications that persons with a "food addiction" display impaired performance monitoring. These findings provide an indication that food addiction, similar to other addictions, is characterized by impaired cognitive control. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Franken, Ingmar H.

Cognitive control ability mediates prediction costs in monolinguals and bilinguals	COGNITION			English	Article						Prediction; Cognitive control; Bilingualism; Verbal fluency; Language regulation	SPOKEN SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; LANGUAGE LEXICAL ACTIVATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; EXECUTIVE CONTROL; WORD RECOGNITION; VERBAL FLUENCY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; SEMANTIC MEMORY	In this study, we examined the role that cognitive control and language regulation ability play in mediating readers' susceptibility to prediction error costs when reading in the native language (L1) or a second language (L2). Twenty-four English monolinguals (Experiment 1) and 28 Chinese-English bilinguals (Experiment 2) read sentences in English while their EEG was recorded. The sentences varied in the predictability of an upcoming expected word and in whether that prediction was confirmed. Monolinguals showed sensitivity to sentence contexts in which expectations were not met (i.e., when unexpected words were encountered) in the form of a late, frontally-distributed positivity, but for bilinguals this effect was more complex. For both groups, performance on the prediction task was modulated by individual differences on the AX-CPT, a measure of inhibitory control. However, the bilinguals' reading performance in the L2 was affected not only by inhibitory control, but also by their performance on an L1 verbal fluency task that indexed language regulation and production capability, related to their language dominance and immersion context. Bilinguals with better regulation of the L1 generated a larger frontal positivity in response to unexpected words in the L2, an effect that was attenuated by inhibitory control ability. In contrast, bilinguals with lower regulatory ability generated a larger, late negativity, which was also mediated by control. These findings suggest that the ability to regulate the native language when immersed in a second language environment can influence mechanisms underlying the prediction process when reading in the L2. In addition, cognitive control ability, specifically inhibitory control, appears to mediate the difficulty readers incur when predictions are disconfirmed, not only in the native language, but also for proficient bilinguals reading in the L2. We argue that the mechanisms engaged during prediction in the L1 and L2 are fundamentally the same, and that what differs for bilinguals are the additional demands imposed by their language experience and language use.

Good to be stressed? Improved response inhibition and error processing after acute stress in young and older men	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Response inhibition; Error processing; Stress; Aging; ERP; Go/No-Go	ERP COMPONENTS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; CORTISOL RESPONSES; COGNITIVE CONTROL; SEX-DIFFERENCES; HEALTHY-MEN	While aging and stress are both known to affect cognitive functions, little is known on whether and how age modulates stress effects on executive functions and their neural correlates. The current study investigated the effect of acute stress on response inhibition and error processing and their underlying cortical processes in younger and older healthy men, using EEG. Forty-nine participants (30 young) were stressed with the Trier Social Stress Test (16 young, 9 older) or underwent a friendly control procedure (14 young, 10 older) and subsequently performed a Go/No-Go task with two levels of task difficulty while performance (reaction time, error rate), stimulus-locked (N2, P3) and response-locked (Ne, Pe) ERPs were measured. Previous results on age-related cognitive deficits were replicated, with slower responses and reduced and delayed N2 and P3 components, as well as reduced Ne and Pe components in older participants. Independent of age, acute stress improved response inhibition, reflected in higher accuracy for compatible trials and enhanced inhibition-related components (N2, P3 and N2d, P3d of the difference waves No-Go minus Go), and improved error processing, reflected in enhanced error-related components (Ne, Pe and Ne_d, Pe_d of the difference waves error minus correct trial). Our findings indicate that acute stress leads to a reallocation of cognitive resources, strengthening inhibition and error processing in young and older healthy men to a similar degree. Neural generators of the analyzed ERPs are mainly part of the salience network, which is upregulated immediately after stress. This offers an explanation as to why response inhibition, in contrast to other executive functions, improves after acute stress.

In this method, different variants of PSO have been exhaustively tested, and the time varying coefficients-PSO (TVC-PSO) is used to formulate a new hybrid technique for better exploitation and exploration, which is further modified by sorting and replacement mechanism of Scout Bee from ABC algorithm. For designing IIR filter, an objective function is constructed that satisfies the absolute error including peak ripples in passband and stopband regions in frequency domain, while stability of designed filter is confirmed by exploiting the lattice form structure during iterative computation that also reduces computation complexity. Several attributes such as passband error , stopband error , and stopband attenuation are used to measure the performance of proposed algorithm. The simulation results presented in this paper evidence that this technique can be effectively used for designing digital IIR filter with higher filter taps, and low quantization effect for fixed number of bits.

Improved grasshopper optimization algorithm using opposition-based learning	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Grasshopper optimization algorithm; Opposition-based learning; Benchmark functions; Engineering problems optimization	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; MOTH-FLAME OPTIMIZATION; ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION; DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; HARMONY SEARCH; OPTIMAL-DESIGN; EEG/ERP	This paper proposes an improved version of the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) based on the opposition-based learning (OBL) strategy called OBLGOA for solving benchmark optimization functions and engineering problems. The proposed OBLGOA algorithm consists of two stages: the first stage generates an initial population and its opposite using the OBL strategy; and the second stage uses the OBL as an additional phase to update the GOA population in each iteration. However, the OBL is applied to only half of the solutions to reduce the time complexity. To investigate the performance of the proposed OBLGOA, six sets of experiment series are performed, and they include twenty-three benchmark functions and four engineering problems. The experiments revealed that the results of the proposed algorithm were superior to those of ten well-known algorithms in this domain. Eventually, the obtained results proved that the OBLGOA algorithm can provide competitive results for optimization engineering problems compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.

LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Reading; EEG; masked priming; lexical access; task-differences	VISUAL WORD RECOGNITION; BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; SPREADING ACTIVATION; TIME-COURSE; DECISION; TASK; PERCEPTION; FREQUENCY; POTENTIALS; PARADIGM	Humans have an almost unbounded ability to adapt their behaviour to perform different tasks. In the laboratory, this flexibility is sometimes viewed as a nuisance factor that prevents access to the underlying cognitive mechanisms of interest. For example, in order to study automatic lexical processing, psycholinguists have used masked priming or evoked potentials. However, the pattern of masked priming can be radically altered by changing the task. In lexical decision, priming is observed for words but not for nonwords, yet in a same-different matching task, priming is observed for same responses but not for different responses, regardless of whether the target is a word or a nonword [Norris & Kinoshita, 2008. Perception as evidence accumulation and Bayesian inference: Insights from masked priming. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 137(3), 434-55. doi:10.1037/a0012799]. Here we show that evoked potentials are equally sensitive to the nature of required decision, with the neural activity normally associated with lexical processing being seen for both words and nonwords on same trials, and for neither on different trials.

It contains useful information about mitral valve and it can be used to diagnose mitral valve diseases by doctors. However, biomedical signal might be contaminated with noise or disruptive interference. In literature, different approaches have been introduced to remove the noise or interference from biomedical signal, but adaptive filtering is most popular technique for noise filtering. Therefore, a novel adaptive noise cancellation techniques based FIR digital filter was proposed using artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) and it is employed for the noise reduction on noisy mitral valve Doppler signal. So, the meaningful data about mitral valve was saved to diagnose mitral valve diseases using denoising approach. Then, this novel approach was compared with the other methods suggested in literature such as recursive least square (RLS) algorithm or discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Also, to demonstrate the efficiency, different digital filter order and noise cases were used suggested in literature.

Many studies reported poor language ability in children with BECTS compared with healthy control children. To elucidate the harmful effects of BECTS on language cognition, we studied the magnetoencephalographic activity elicited by an auditory language comprehension task. Methods: The participants (N = 20) included 10 children diagnosed with BECTS (aged 10.8 +/- 2.8 years) and 10 age-matched healthy children (control) (aged 10.6 +/- 1.6 years). Cognitive function was assessed using general intellectual function and language ability. In patients with BECTS, we reviewed the clinical course and electroencephalogram (EEG) findings. We recorded the cortical responses elicited by an auditory language comprehension task using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We compared those results between groups and analyzed the correlation with cognitive scores and frequency of spikes. Results: The full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-4th edition was significantly reduced in the group with BELTS (96.4 +/- 123) compared with the control group (110.0 +/- 7.4). In half of the group with BECTS, the auditory comprehension score fell below the age-standard level. In the group with BECTS, the cortical activation during the task showed reduced intensity in language-associated areas such as the bilateral primary auditory cortex, left superior and mid-temporal areas, and inferior frontal area compared with those in the control group. In addition, the cortical activation in the left superior temporal area was negatively correlated with spike frequency and positively correlated with FSIQin the group with BECTS. Conversely, the right inferior frontal and mid-temporal areas had increased the activations in the group with BECIS. From the time frequency analysis, low gamma band event-related desynchronization was reduced in the group with BEM. Conclusion: Epileptic spikes negatively influenced responsiveness to the auditory language comprehension task in the language-associated cortices. These findings suggest that epileptic spikes could have a negative impact on the functional activity in rolandic areas and become a reason to change the functional development of the language network.

However, it is not clear how many representations can be effectively cued and which neural mechanisms provide the protection from distractors. To address these questions, we manipulated the number of attended items by means of a retro-cue (one, two, or three items) and presented a distractor display during the retention of information in working memory. Analyses of the raw error and a mixture model revealed that a general performance benefit was only present when one item was retro-cued. Nevertheless, a protection of the item representations against subsequent interference occurred also after a two-item cue. ERPs revealed a modulation of the posterior negative slow wave following the retro-cues, reflecting the applied working memory resources dependent on the number of attended representations. Further, the distractor information was encoded into working memory only when the number of attended items was not changed by the retro-cues (neutral and three-item conditions), reflected by a P3b following the distractor display. These results suggest that more than one item can be effectively protected from perceptual interference. We propose that the protective effect of selective attention within working memory is based on both a reduction of the number of focused representations and the attentional refreshing of item context and features.

The influence of the global/local probability effect on the neural processing of cues and targets.

Four behavioral measures (response times, correct/incorrect anticipations, and incorrect responses), three pre-target ERPs (visual P1/N1 and Contingent Negative Variation (CNV)), and six post-target ERPs (auditory N1, P2, Processing Negativity (PN), P3a, P3b and Late Slow Positivity (LSP)) were considered. Four types of trial-sequences (Valid Valid, Invalid-Valid, Invalid-Invalid, Valid-Invalid) and three types of trial-blocks, with different validity/invalidity proportions (50%, 68%, and 86% of valid trials), were employed. Present data replicate previous reports on the validity sequence effects on ERPs (local probability): (i) higher CNV on trials preceded by valid trials; (ii) higher PN on valid trials preceded by invalid trials compared to valid trials preceded by valid trials; and (iii) higher P3a/P3b and LSP on invalid trials preceded by valid trials compared to invalid trials preceded by invalid trials. In summary, local probability showed more effects modulating the brain responses than global probability and/or their interaction. Among a number of other hypotheses, the functional systems theory would account for the ability of the previous trial to modify processing in the current trial.

Callousness and Affective Face Processing in Adults: Behavioral and Brain-Potential Indicators	PERSONALITY DISORDERS-THEORY RESEARCH AND TREATMENT			English	Article						callousness; psychopathy; face processing; EEG	UNEMOTIONAL TRAITS; TRIARCHIC CONCEPTUALIZATION; DEVELOPMENTAL ORIGINS; ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR; FEARFUL EXPRESSIONS; BRIEF FORM; PSYCHOPATHY; PERSONALITY; DEFICITS; RECOGNITION	The investigation of callous-unemotional (CU) traits has been central to contemporary research on child behavior problems, and served as the impetus for inclusion of a specifier for conduct disorder in the latest edition of the official psychiatric diagnostic system. Here, we report results from 2 studies that evaluated the construct validity of callousness as assessed in adults, by testing for affiliated deficits in behavioral and neural processing of fearful faces, as have been shown in youthful samples. We hypothesized that scores on an established measure of callousness would predict reduced recognition accuracy and diminished electocortical reactivity for fearful faces in adult participants. In Study 1, 66 undergraduate participants performed an emotion recognition task in which they viewed affective faces of different types and indicated the emotion expressed by each. In Study 2, electrocortical data were collected from 254 adult twins during viewing of fearful and neutral face stimuli, and scored for event-related response components. Analyses of Study 1 data revealed that higher callousness was associated with decreased recognition accuracy for fearful faces specifically. In Study 2, callousness was associated with reduced amplitude of both N170 and P200 responses to fearful faces. Current findings demonstrate for the first time that callousness in adults is associated with both behavioral and physiological deficits in the processing of fearful faces. These findings support the validity of the CU construct with adults and highlight the possibility of a multidomain measurement framework for continued study of this important clinical construct.

J	Razoki, B				Razoki, Bashar			Neurofeedback versus psychostimulants in the treatment of children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a systematic review	NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT			English	Review						ADHD; EEG; biofeedback; theta/beta training; methylphenidate; randomized trials	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; STIMULANT MEDICATION; MULTIMODAL TREATMENT; ADHD; METAANALYSIS; METHYLPHENIDATE; DIAGNOSIS	This systematic review aimed to evaluate the efficacy of neurofeedback (NF) compared to stimulant medication in treating children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Included in this review are eight randomized controlled trials that compared an NF condition, either alone or combined with medication, to a medication condition, which was mainly methylphenidate. Outcome measures included behavioral assessments by parents and teachers, self-reports, neurocognitive measures, electroencephalogram power spectra and event-related potentials. When only trials are considered that include probably blinded ratings or those that are sham-NF or semi-active controlled or those that employed optimally titration procedures, the findings do not support theta/beta NF as a standalone treatment for children or adolescents with ADHD. Nevertheless, an additive treatment effect of NF was observed on top of stimulants and theta/beta NF was able to decrease medication dosages, and both results were maintained at 6-month follow-up. This review concludes that the present role of NF in treating children diagnosed with ADHD should be considered as complementary in a multimodal treatment approach, individualized to the needs of the child, and may be considered a viable alternative to stimulants for a specific group of patients. Particularly patients with the following characteristics may benefit from NF treatment: low responders to medication, intolerable side effects due to medication, higher baseline theta power spectra and possibly having no comorbid psychiatric disorders. Future research should prioritize the identification of markers that differentiate responders from nonresponders to NF treatment, the potential of NF to decrease stimulant dosage, the standardization of NF treatment protocols and the identification of the most favorable neurophysiological treatment targets.

Familiarity and repetition may increase the liking of a piece of music, thus inducing positive emotions. Neuroimaging studies have focused on identifying the brain regions involved in the processing of familiar and unfamiliar musical stimuli. However, the use of different modalities and experimental designs has led to discrepant results and it is not clear which areas of the brain are most reliably engaged when listening to familiar and unfamiliar musical excerpts. In the present study, we conducted a systematic review from three databases (Medline, PsychoINFO, and Embase) using the keywords (recognition OR familiar OR familiarity OR exposure effect OR repetition) AND (music OR song) AND (brain OR brains OR neuroimaging OR functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging OR Position Emission Tomography OR Electroencephalography OR Event Related Potential OR Magnetoencephalography). Of the 704 titles identified, 23 neuroimaging studies met our inclusion criteria for the systematic review. After removing studies providing insufficient information or contrasts, 11 studies (involving 212 participants) qualified for the meta-analysis using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach. Our results did not find significant peak activations consistently across included studies. Using a less conservative approach (p < 0.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons) we found that the left superior frontal gyrus, the ventral lateral (VL) nucleus of the left thalamus, and the left medial surface of the superior frontal gyrus had the highest likelihood of being activated by familiar music. On the other hand, the left insula, and the right anterior cingulate cortex had the highest likelihood of being activated by unfamiliar music. We had expected limbic structures as top clusters when listening to familiar music. But, instead, music familiarity had a motor pattern of activation. This could reflect an audio-motor synchronization to the rhythm which is more engaging for familiar tunes, and/or a sing-along response in one's mind, anticipating melodic, harmonic progressions, rhythms, timbres, and lyric events in the familiar songs. These data provide evidence for the need for larger neuroimaging studies to understand the neural correlates of music familiarity.

J	Ehi, Y; Ozlece, HK				Ehi, Yusuf; Ozlece, Hatice Kose			Electrophysiological assessment of the concentration and attention in patient with nasal polyposis	ASIA PACIFIC ALLERGY			English	Article						Nasal polyp; Nasal obstruction; Cognitive impairment; P300	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP-APNEA; CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS; DIFFERENTIAL-DIAGNOSIS; P300; P3-COMPONENT; PROGRESSION; DEPRESSION; PREDICT	Background: Nasal polyposis is a chronic disease presenting with nasal obstruction as the most frequent complaint. It has been documented that nasal polyposis results in deterioration of quality of life and disturbances of sleep. However, remarkable consequences of nasal polyposis such as psychological and cognitive outcomes are relatively poorly studied. Objective: The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether there is an impairment of concentration and attention in nasal polyposis patients due to hypoxia caused by nasal obstruction. Methods: This cross-sectional, case-control study was carried out on 30 male patients with nasal polyps and 30 healthy subjects serving as controls. Participant ages were 41.6 +/- 10.2 years in the nasal polyps group and 41.3 +/- 6.2 in the control group. All participants underwent systemic, neurological, and otorhinolaryngological examinations together with routine hematological and biochemical tests. Patients with nasal polyposis had bilateral complete obstruction of nasal cavity. P300 component of electroencephalography-derived event related potentials were used to monitor concentration and attention. Nasal polyposis and control groups were compared in terms of amplitude and latency of P300. Results: There were significant differences between control and nasal polyposis groups in terms of latency of P300 (p < 0.001). Nasal polyposis patient latencies in P300 were longer than controls (345.8 +/- 16.6 msec, 309.3 +/- 16.6 msec, respectively). However, there were no significant differences between control and nasal polyposis groups in terms of amplitude of P300 (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Results of the current study indicate that hypoxia due to complete nasal obstruction may result in impairment of attention and concentration in nasal polyposis patients. Assessment of patients with P300 latency subcomponent can be a useful diagnostic tool to detect cognitive and psychological consequences.

Evidence from behavioral and ERP data	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Negation; Inhibition; Stop signal; ERPs; Brain sources	ACTION-RELATED SENTENCES; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; FRONTAL THETA; LANGUAGE; BRAIN; COMPREHENSION; MODEL; ACCESSIBILITY; INTERFERENCE	Embodiment theories claim that language meaning involves sensory-motor simulation processes in the brain. A challenge for these theories, however, is to explain how abstract words, such as negations, are processed. In this article, we test the hypothesis that understanding sentential negation (e.g., You will not cut the bread) reuses the neural circuitry of response inhibition. Participants read manual action sentences with either affirmative or negative polarity, embedded in a Stop-Signal paradigm, while their EEG was recorded. The results showed that the inhibition-related N1 and P3 components were enhanced by successful inhibition. Most important, the early N1 amplitude was also modulated by sentence polarity, producing the largest values for successful inhibitions in the context of negative sentences, whereas no polarity effect was found for failing inhibition or go trials. The estimated neural sources for N1 effects revealed activations in the right inferior frontal gyrus, a typical inhibition-related area. Also, the estimated stop-signal reaction time was larger in trials with negative sentences. These results provide strong evidence that action-related negative sentences consume neural resources of response inhibition, resulting in less efficient processing in the Stop-Signal task.

We hypothesized that both stimulation frequencies have the same modulation effect, in accordance with clinical data showing a reduction in auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) after LF and HF temporal rTMS in patients with schizophrenia. With 30 right-handed healthy volunteer participants enrolled in a crossover trial, we analyzed LLAEPs before and after LF- and HF-rTMS of the left temporal cortex. While we observed no changes in latencies, we did observe a similar inhibitory action of both rTMS frequencies on LLAEP amplitudes. Analysis of surface potential maps and cortical generators revealed some differences regarding auditory processes: HF-rTMS produced earlier, more diffuse, and more right-lateralized effects than LF-rTMS. Beyond a local impact, rTMS exerted a remote modulation influence on the frontal cortex that might be involved in attentional processes. This association could explain the therapeutic effect of temporal HF-rTMS on AVH.

Steven			Scene complexity modulates degree of feedback activity during object detection in natural scenes	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							FIGURE-GROUND SEGREGATION; EARLY VISUAL-CORTEX; CORTICAL REPRESENTATION; GANGLIA PATHWAYS; DECISION-MAKING; TIME-COURSE; FEEDFORWARD; CATEGORIZATION; ORGANIZATION; INFORMATION	Selective brain responses to objects arise within a few hundreds of milliseconds of neural processing, suggesting that visual object recognition is mediated by rapid feed-forward activations. Yet disruption of neural responses in early visual cortex beyond feed-forward processing stages affects object recognition performance. Here, we unite these discrepant findings by reporting that object recognition involves enhanced feedback activity (recurrent processing within early visual cortex) when target objects are embedded in natural scenes that are characterized by high complexity. Human participants performed an animal target detection task on natural scenes with low, medium or high complexity as determined by a computational model of low-level contrast statistics. Three converging lines of evidence indicate that feedback was selectively enhanced for high complexity scenes. First, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity in early visual cortex (V1) was enhanced for target objects in scenes with high, but not low or medium complexity. Second, event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked by target objects were selectively enhanced at feedback stages of visual processing (from similar to 220 ms onwards) for high complexity scenes only. Third, behavioral performance for high complexity scenes deteriorated when participants were pressed for time and thus less able to incorporate the feedback activity. Modeling of the reaction time distributions using drift diffusion revealed that object information accumulated more slowly for high complexity scenes, with evidence accumulation being coupled to trial-to-trial variation in the EEG feedback response. Together, these results suggest that while feed-forward activity may suffice to recognize isolated objects, the brain employs recurrent processing more adaptively in naturalistic settings, using minimal feedback for simple scenes and increasing feedback for complex scenes.

Inherent auditory skills rather than formal music training shape the neural encoding of speech	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						EEG; experience-dependent plasticity; auditory event-related brain potentials; frequency-following responses; nature vs. nurture	SPECTROTEMPORAL RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; BRAIN-STEM; PLASTICITY; PERCEPTION; NOISE; MUSICIANSHIP; ENHANCEMENT; EDUCATION; BEHAVIOR; CORTEX	Musical training is associated with a myriad of neuroplastic changes in the brain, including more robust and efficient neural processing of clean and degraded speech signals at brainstem and cortical levels. These assumptions stem largely from cross-sectional studies between musicians and nonmusicians which cannot address whether training itself is sufficient to induce physiological changes or whether preexisting superiority in auditory function before training predisposes individuals to pursue musical interests and appear to have similar neuroplastic benefits as musicians. Here, we recorded neuro-electric brain activity to clear and noise-degraded speech sounds in individuals without formal music training but who differed in their receptive musical perceptual abilities as assessed objectively via the Profile of Music Perception Skills. We found that listeners with naturally more adept listening skills ("musical sleepers") had enhanced frequency-following responses to speech that were also more resilient to the detrimental effects of noise, consistent with the increased fidelity of speech encoding and speech-in-noise benefits observed previously in highly trained musicians. Further comparisons between these musical sleepers and actual trained musicians suggested that experience provides an additional boost to the neural encoding and perception of speech. Collectively, our findings suggest that the auditory neuroplasticity of music engagement likely involves a layering of both preexisting (nature) and experience-driven (nurture) factors in complex sound processing. In the absence of formal training, individuals with intrinsically proficient auditory systems can exhibit musician-like auditory function that can be further shaped in an experience-dependent manner.

Single transcranial direct current stimulation in schizophrenia: Randomized, cross-over study of neurocognition, social cognition, ERPs, and side effects	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NONINVASIVE BRAIN-STIMULATION; IMPROVE COGNITION; AFFECTIVE PROSODY; HEALTHY-SUBJECTS; TDCS; MATRICS; DEFICITS; BATTERY; HALLUCINATIONS; RECOGNITION	Over the last decades, the treatment of schizophrenia has shifted fundamentally from a focus on symptom reduction to a focus on recovery and improving aspects of functioning. In this study, we examined the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on social cognitive and nonsocial neurocognitive functions, as well as on electroencephalogram (EEG) measures, in individuals with schizophrenia. Thirty-seven individuals with schizophrenia were administered one of three different tDCS conditions (cathodal, anodal, and sham) per visit over the course of three visits, with approximately one week between each visit. Order of conditions was randomized and counterbalanced across subjects. For the active conditions, the electrode was placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with the reference electrode over right supraorbital cortex. Current intensity was 2 mA and was maintained for two 20-minute sessions, with a one hour break between the sessions. Assessments were conducted immediately following each session, in a counterbalanced order of administration. No systematic effects were found across the social and nonsocial cognitive domains, and no significant effects were detected on event-related potentials (ERPs). The very small effect sizes, further validated by post-hoc power analyses (large Critical Ns), demonstrated that these findings were not due to lack of statistical power. Except for mild local discomfort, no significant side effects were reported. Findings demonstrate the safety and ease of administration of this procedure, but suggest that a single dose of tDCS over these areas does not yield a therapeutic effect on cognition in schizophrenia.

However, recent theories propose that high-level human cognition is directly linked to basic, modal biological systems such as sensorimotor areas. Despite this influential representational debate very little is known regarding whether the mechanisms involved in sensorimotor control are also shared with higher-level cognitive processes, such as language comprehension. We investigated negation as a universal of human language, addressing two key questions: (a) Does negation result in a conflict-like representation? (b) Does negation trigger executive control adjustments in a similar manner as standard information processing conflicts do (e.g., Simon, Flanker)? Electrophysiological data indicated that phrases such as "not left/not right" result in initial activation of the to-be-negated information and subsequently the outcome of the negation process. More importantly, our findings also suggest that negation triggers conflict-related adjustments in information processing in line with traditional conflict tasks. Trial-by-trial conflict adaptation patterns in both behavioral and electrophysiological data indicated that negation processing dynamically changes depending on the current cognitive state. In summary, negation processing results in cognitive conflict, and dynamic influences of the cognitive state determine conflict resolution, that is, negation implementation.

Caffeine and carbohydrate ingestion have been shown to be able to reduce these negative effects of mental fatigue. Intake of these substances might however be less desirable in some situations (e.g., restricted caloric intake, Ramadan). Rinsing caffeine or glucose within the mouth has already been shown to improve exercise performance. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the effect of frequent caffeine-maltodextrin (CAF-MALT) mouth rinsing on mental fatigue induced by a prolonged cognitive task. Ten males (age 23 +/- 2 years, physical activity 7.3 +/- 4.3 h/week, low CAF users) performed two trials. Participants first completed a Flanker task (3 min), then performed a 90-min mentally fatiguing task (Stroop task), followed by another Flanker task. Before the start and after each 12.5% of the Stroop task (eight blocks), subjects received a CAF-MALT mouth rinse (MR: 0.3 g/25 ml CAF: 1.6g/25 ml MALT) or placebo (PLAC: 25 ml artificial saliva). Self-reported mental fatigue was lower in MR (p = 0.017) compared to PLAC. Normalized accuracy (accuracy first block = 100%) was higher in the last block of the Stroop in MR (p = 0.032) compared to PLAC. P2 amplitude in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) decreased over time only in PLAC (p = 0.017). Frequent mouth rinsing during a prolonged and demanding cognitive task reduces mental fatigue compared to mouth rinsing with artificial saliva.

Identification of Brain Activation Regions in Inductive Learning Based Scientific Creativity Test	2018 IEEE SYMPOSIUM SERIES ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (IEEE SSCI)			English	Proceedings Paper	8th IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI)	NOV 18-21, 2018	Bengaluru, INDIA	IEEE		Scientific creativity; Inductive learning; Type-2 fuzzy neural classifier; P300 and N400 brain signals	INFERENCE SYSTEM; TYPE-2; EEG; CLASSIFICATION	Scientific creativity refers to exploration of original scientific development/creation. Although there are evidences of research on artistic creativity, including painting, music etc., there is hardly any research outcome on the biological basis of scientific creativity. This paper attempts to provide the biological basis of scientific creativity by identifying the brain activation patterns during the mental progress of scientific creation. It explores the scope of inductive learning in the psychological process of scientific concept formation from the commonality of positive instances of inductive learning, and use the formed concept to solve unknown problem, preferable in a new domain. The learning of the subject is monitored he acquiring the N400 brain signal and the correct application of the concept learnt to the unknown problem is detected by P300 event related potential. To identify the brain lobes involved in the learning (and planning) phase, we first trained an interval type-2 fuzzy-neural classifier with known input instances collected from selected (literature-provided) brain lobes and classes defined by N400 (P300) response of the subject. We then test the classifier performance by submitting arbitrarily selected brain lobe patterns as input to the classifier. In case the classifier produces the right class for the given input instance then the arbitrarily selected brain region carries significance in the learning (planning) phases. We declare a brain region responsible for learning/planning and hence creativity, if repeated testing of the region yields favorable outcomes of the pre-trained classifier. Experiments undertaken on 60 pre-college students indicate that pre-frontal and frontal lobes are responsible for inductive learning and prefrontal, parietal and occipital lobes for planning/scientific creativity. We also validate the brain region activation by using e-LORETA software.

The sample included 4,242 individuals; 1,087 patients with psychosis, 822 unaffected first-degree relatives of patients, and 2,333 controls. Endophenotypes included the P300 event-related potential (N=515), lateral ventricular volume (N=798), and the cognitive measures block design (N=3,089), digit span (N=1,437), and the Ray Auditory Verbal Learning Task (N=2,406). Data were collected across 11 sites in Europe and Australia; all genotyping and genetic analyses were done at the same laboratory in the United Kingdom. We calculated polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder separately, and used linear regression to test whether polygenic scores influenced the endophenotypes. Results showed that higher polygenic scores for schizophrenia were associated with poorer performance on the block design task and explained 0.2% (p=0.009) of the variance. Associations in the same direction were found for bipolar disorder scores, but this was not statistically significant at the 1% level (p=0.02). The schizophrenia score explained 0.4% of variance in lateral ventricular volumes, the largest across all phenotypes examined, although this was not significant (p=0.063). None of the remaining associations reached significance after correction for multiple testing (with alpha at 1%). These results indicate that common genetic variants associated with schizophrenia predict performance in spatial visualization, providing additional evidence that this measure is an endophenotype for the disorder with shared genetic risk variants. The use of endophenotypes such as this will help to characterize the effects of common genetic variation in psychosis.

Neuroimaging studies have identified so far, several color-sensitive visual areas in the human brain, and the temporal dynamics of these activities have been separately investigated using the visual-evoked potentials (VEPs). In the present study, we combined electrophysiological and neuroimaging methods to determine a detailed spatiotemporal profile of chromatic VEP and to localize its neural generators. The accuracy of the present co-registration study was obtained by combining standard fMRI data with retinotopic and motion mapping data at the individual level. We found a sequence of occipito activities more complex than that typically reported for chromatic VEPs, including feed-forward and reentrant feedback. Results showed that chromatic human perception arises by the combined activity of at the least five parieto-occipital areas including V1, LOC, V8/VO, and the motion-sensitive dorsal region MT+. However, the contribution of V1 and V8/VO seems dominant because the re-entrant activity in these areas was present more than once (twice in V8/VO and thrice in V1). This feedforward and feedback chromatic processing appears delayed compared with the luminance processing. Associating VEPs and neuroimaging measures, we showed for the first time a complex spatiotemporal pattern of activity, confirming that chromatic stimuli produce intricate interactions of many different brain dorsal and ventral areas.

In a previous study (Proverbio et al., 2016) we investigated the McGurk effect in the Italian language and found out which visual and auditory inputs provided the most compelling illusory effects (e.g., bilabial phonemes presented acoustically and paired with non-labials, especially alveolar-nasal and velar-occlusive phonemes). In this study EEG was recorded from 128 scalp sites while participants observed a female and a male actor uttering 288 syllables selected on the basis of the previous investigation (lasting approximately 600 ms) and responded to rare targets (/re/, /ri/, /ro/,/ru/). In half of the cases the AV information was incongruent, except for targets that were always congruent. A pMMN (phonological Mismatch Negativity) to incongruent AV stimuli was identified 500 ms after voice onset time. This automatic response indexed the detection of an incongruity between the labial and phonetic information. SwLORETA (Low-Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography) analysis applied to the difference voltage incongruent-congruent in the same time window revealed that the strongest sources of this activity were the right superior temporal (STG) and superior frontal gyri, which supports their involvement in AV integration.

J	Yang, HT; Li, HY				Yang, Hongtao; Li, Haiyan			Trust Cognition of Entrepreneurs' Behavioral Consistency Modulates Investment Decisions of Venture Capitalists in Cooperation	ENTREPRENEURSHIP RESEARCH JOURNAL			English	Article						trust; investment decision; behavioral consistency; ERPs	BRAIN RESPONSES; OPPORTUNITY RECOGNITION; MORAL CHARACTER; NEURAL SYSTEMS; REWARD; PERCEPTIONS; FEEDBACK; ERP; TRUSTWORTHINESS; CONSEQUENCES	Previous studies have established that venture capitalists (VCs) adjust their investment decisions according to the economic outcome of their cooperation with entrepreneurs. However, investment decisions made by VCs are embedded in social interaction and influenced by information from third parties. Therefore, research studies on interpersonal trust in the disciplines of economics, psychology and neuroscience were integrated in this paper to explore how the trust cognition of VCs in entrepreneurs' behavior consistency affects their investment decision-making. First, behavioral consistency is the criterion used by VCs to assess the credibility of entrepreneurs. Second, a trust game was designed for VCs and entrepreneurs, during which EEG (electroencephalogram) of the VCs was recorded. Finally, a learning model was developed on each participant's behavior and showed the process of investment decision-making. The results indicated that investment decisions of VCs are significantly affected by trust cognition and rewards of cooperation, VCs investment decisions are guided by their trust cognition in the behavioral consistency of entrepreneurs and investment experiences have a significant impact on investment decisions when VCs are cooperating with entrepreneurs with a moderate level of behavioral consistency. One explanation for these findings may be a result of the fact that the neutral information is ambiguous and uncertain; thus, VCs preferred to rely on the outcome of cooperation to adjust their investment decisions.

Recent findings have shown that temporal orienting operates relatively early across development, suggesting that this attentional mechanism plays a core role for human cognition. However, the exact neurophysiological mechanisms allowing children to attune their attention over time are not well understood. In this study, we presented 8- to 12-year-old children with a temporal cueing task designed to test (1) whether anticipatory oscillatory dynamics predict children's behavioral performance on a trial-by-trial basis and (2) whether anticipatory oscillatory neural activity may be supported by cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling as previously shown in adults. Crucially, we found that, similar to what has been reported in adults, children's ongoing beta rhythm was strongly coupled with their theta rhythm and that the strength of this coupling distinguished validly cued temporal intervals, relative to neutral cued trials. In addition, in long trials, there was an inverse correlation between oscillatory beta power and children's trial-by-trial reaction, consistent with oscillatory beta power reflecting better response preparation. These findings provide the first experimental evidence that temporal attention in children operates by exploiting oscillatory mechanism.

Midfrontal theta transcranial alternating current stimulation modulates behavioural adjustment after error execution	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cognitive control; midfrontal theta; performance monitoring; post-error slowing; transcranial alternating current stimulation	MEDIAL-FRONTAL-CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; FLUID INTELLIGENCE; MIDLINE THETA; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; OSCILLATORY POTENTIALS; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; BRAIN POTENTIALS; ERP COMPONENTS	Cognitive control during conflict monitoring, error processing, and post-error adjustment appear to be associated with the occurrence of midfrontal theta (MFO). While this association is supported by correlational EEG studies, much less is known about the possible causal link between MFO; and error and conflict processing. In the present study, we aimed to explore the role of band-specific effects in modulating the error system during a conflict resolution. In turn, we delivered transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at different frequency bands (delta delta, theta theta, alpha alpha, beta beta, gamma gamma) and sham stimulation over the medial frontal cortex (MFC) in 36 healthy participants performing a modified version of the Flanker task. Task performance and reports about the sensations (e.g. visual flickering, cutaneous burning) induced by the different frequency bands, were also recorded. We found that online theta-tACS increased the response speed to congruent stimuli after error execution with respect to sham stimulation. Importantly, the accuracy following the errors did not decrease because of speed-accuracy trade off. Moreover, tACS evoked visual and somatosensory sensations were significantly stronger at alpha-tACS and beta-tACS compared to other frequencies. Our findings suggest that theta activity plays a causative role in modulating behavioural adjustments during perceptual choices in a stimulus-response conflict task.

Twenty-four participants performed a simple gambling task during which they could win or lose either a small (a low-risk condition) or a large (a high-risk condition) amount of points by either choosing freely between two doors (a choice condition) or accepting a computer-selected door (a no-choice condition) while their EEG was recorded. As expected, participants rated the high-risk condition as more risky than the low-risk condition and reported higher feelings of control for the choice versus no-choice condition. Regardless of the involvement of choice, risk processing in this task was associated with greater fb-P3 amplitudes. However, during the choice condition, risk processing was associated with a more negative SPN during the anticipatory phase and a more positive FRN during the consummatory phase, which was absent (the SPN) or reduced (the FRN) in the no-choice condition. These findings suggest that the modulation of risk processing by choice occurs during both the anticipatory phase and the consummatory phase, which may be driven by motivation salience imposed by control.

Game-based training of flexibility and attention improves task-switch performance: near and far transfer of cognitive training in an EEG study	PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH-PSYCHOLOGISCHE FORSCHUNG			English	Article							EXECUTIVE CONTROL; AGE-DIFFERENCES; MIXING COSTS; ERP; MEMORY; INTERFERENCE; NEGATIVITY; ERRORS	There is a demand for ways to enhance cognitive flexibility, as it can be a limiting factor for performance in daily life. Video game training has been linked to advantages in cognitive functioning, raising the question if training with video games can promote cognitive flexibility. In the current study, we investigated if game-based computerized cognitive training (GCCT) could enhance cognitive flexibility in a healthy young adult sample (N = 72), as measured by task-switch performance. Three GCCT schedules were contrasted, which targeted: (1) cognitive flexibility and task switching, (2) attention and working memory, or (3) an active control involving basic math games, in twenty 45-min sessions across 4-6 weeks. Performance on an alternating-runs task-switch paradigm during pretest and posttest sessions indicated greater overall reaction time improvements after both flexibility and attention training as compared to control, although not related to local switch cost. Flexibility training enhanced performance in the presence of distractor-related interference. In contrast, attention training was beneficial when low task difficulty undermined sustained selective attention. Furthermore, flexibility training improved response selection as indicated by a larger N2 amplitude after training as compared to control, and more efficient conflict monitoring as indicated by reduced Nc/CRN and larger Pe amplitude after training. These results provide tentative support for the efficacy of GCCT and suggest that an ideal training might include both task switching and attention components, with maximal task diversity both within and between training games.

The present study examined the effect of social context on behavioral and electrophysiological correlates of performance monitoring in healthy adult subjects and in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD). Participants performed two runs of a Go/NoGo flanker task in different social conditions: in the observation condition, they were observed by a confederate while performing the task, whereas there was no observation in the control condition. Behavioral data showed that accuracy and response times were not modulated by social observation and also did not systematically differ between groups. Post-error slowing was more pronounced in patients, independent of observation condition. ERN amplitudes were generally increased under social observation as compared to the control condition regardless of group (patients, controls). No effects of social context or group were found for PE, NoGo-N2, and NoGo-P3. Exploratory analysis revealed a late sustained parietal negativity to errors in patients as compared to controls. Taken together, the present findings emphasize the importance of social context for the processes underlying performance monitoring. However, the notion of altered error monitoring reflected in an altered ERN in SAD is not supported by our data.

Yet the extent to which the SPN is modulated by luminance-polarity and colour content is unknown. Here we examine how luminance-polarity distribution across the symmetry axis, grouping by luminance polarity, and the number of colours in the stimuli, modulate the SPN. Stimuli were dot patterns arranged either symmetrically or quasi-randomly. There were several arrangements: 'segregated'-symmetric dots were of one polarity and randomly-positioned dots were of the other; 'unsegregated'-symmetric dots were of both polarities in equal proportions; 'anti-symmetric'-dots were of opposite polarity across the symmetry axis; 'polarity-grouped anti-symmetric'-this is the same as anti-symmetric but with half the pattern of one polarity and the other half of opposite polarity; multi-colour symmetric patterns made of two, three to four colours. We found that the SPN is: (i) reduced by the amount of position-symmetry, (ii) sensitive to luminance-polarity mismatch across the symmetry axis, and (iii) not modulated by the number of colours in the stimuli. Our results show that the sustained nature of the SPN coincides with the late onset of a topographic microstate sensitive to symmetry. These findings emphasise the importance of not only position symmetry, but also luminance polarity matching across the symmetry axis.

However, cognitive abilities as well as speech perception decline with age, leading to the expenditure of effort during speech processing. This longitudinal study therefore investigated age-related differences in electrophysiological processes during speech discrimination and assessed the extent of enhancement to such cognitive auditory processes through repeated auditory exposure. For that purpose, accuracy and reaction time were compared between 13 older adults (62-76years) and 15 middle-aged (28-52years) controls in an active oddball paradigm which was administered at three consecutive measurement time points at an interval of 2wk, while EEG was recorded. As a standard stimulus, the nonsense syllable /a:?a/was used, while the nonsense syllable /a:sa/ and a morphing between /a:?a/ and /a:sa/ served as deviants. N2b and P3b ERP responses were evaluated as a function of age, deviant, and measurement time point using a data-driven topographical microstate analysis. From middle age to old age, age-related decline in attentive perception (as reflected in the N2b-related microstates) and in memory updating and attentional processes (as reflected in the P3b-related microstates) was found, as indicated by both lower neural responses and later onsets of the respective cortical networks, and in age-related changes in frontal activation during attentional stimulus processing. Importantly, N2b- and P3b-related microstates changed as a function of repeated stimulus exposure in both groups. This research therefore suggests that experience with auditory stimuli can support auditory neurocognitive processes in normal hearing adults into advanced age.

J	Jimenez, M; Grassini, S; Montoro, PR; Luna, D; Koivisto, M				Jimenez, Mikel; Grassini, Simone; Montoro, Pedro R.; Luna, Dolores; Koivisto, Mika			Neural correlates of visual awareness at stimulus low vs. high-levels of processing	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Awareness; Consciousness; Graded; EEG; ERP	CONSCIOUSNESS; PERCEPTION; THRESHOLD; P3	A crucial view in the graded vs. dichotomous debate on visual awareness proposes that its graded or dichotomous nature may depend on the depth of stimulus processing (or level of processing) associated to the experimental task. In the present study, we explored the behavioral patterns and neural correlates of different degrees of awareness associated to different depths (i.e. low vs. high) of stimulus processing. The low-level stimulus condition consisted of detecting the location of the target based on its brightness characteristics, whereas the high-level stimulus condition consisted of identifying which of four possible targets (numbers/letters) had appeared. Behavioral results showed that both subjective ratings of awareness and accuracy levels increased linearly as a function of awareness and independently of the level of stimulus processing. Additionally, the electrophysiological recordings revealed two correlates of visual awareness: enhanced posterior negativity in the N200 time window (VAN, visual awareness negativity) and enhanced positivity in the P3 time window (LP, late positivity). Interestingly, we found evidence of awareness levels modulating N200/VAN amplitudes in a graded manner only for the low-level task, whereas P3/LP amplitudes were modulated in a graded manner for both low and high-level tasks. The finding that the early posterior correlate of visual awareness (VAN at 150-250 ms) was sensitive to level of processing is consistent with task effects occurring in the visual cortex and supports the view that it is mediated by attention to task-relevant features. The amplitudes of P3/LP in both tasks correlate more directly with graded awareness and behavioral accuracy.

Anhedonia and emotional numbing in treatment-seeking veterans: behavioural and electrophysiological responses to reward	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTRAUMATOLOGY			English	Article						Veterans; anhedonia; emotional numbing; posttraumatic stress; EEG; ERP	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; PTSD SYMPTOMS; SENSITIVITY; MONETARY; MODEL; NEUROSCIENCE; DYNAMICS; TOOLBOX; SCALE	Background: Anhedonia is a common symptom following exposure to traumatic stress and a feature of the PTSD diagnosis. In depression research, anhedonia has been linked to deficits in reward functioning, reflected in behavioural and neural responses. Such deficits following exposure to trauma, however, are not well understood. Objective: The current study aims to estimate the associations between anhedonia, PTSD symptom-clusters and behavioural and electrophysiological responses to reward. Methods: Participants (N = 61) were recruited among Danish treatment-seeking veterans at the Department of Military Psychology in the Danish Defence. Before entering treatment, participants were screened with symptom measurement instruments and participated in a joint behavioural-electrophysiological experiment. The experimental paradigm consisted of a signal-detection task aimed at assessing reward-driven learning. Simultaneous electrophysiological-recordings were analysed to evaluate neural responses upon receiving reward, as indicated by the Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN) component. Result: Anhedonia as conceptualized in depression correlated with behavioural learning (r = -0.28, p =.032). Neither anhedonia nor behavioural learning correlated with FRN. However, the anhedonia symptom cluster of PTSD did correlate with FRN (r = 0.29, p =.023). Extending upon this in an exploratory analysis, the specific PTSD-symptom emotional numbing was found to correlate moderately with FRN (r = 0.38, p =.003). Conclusion: The present data suggest that anhedonia in trauma-exposed individuals is related to the anticipatory aspect of reward, whereas the neural consummatory reward response seems unlinked. Interestingly, emotional numbing in the same population is related to the consummatory phase of reward, correlating with the FRN response. This suggests that anhedonia and emotional numbing in response to trauma might pertain to different phases of reward processing.

J	Di Gregorio, F; Maier, ME; Steinhauser, M				Di Gregorio, Francesco; Maier, Martin E.; Steinhauser, Marco			Errors can elicit an error positivity in the absence of an error negativity: Evidence for independent systems of human error monitoring	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Error monitoring; Error awareness; Error positivity; Error-related negativity; Multivariate pattern analysis	FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; RESPONSE ACCURACY; ANTISACCADE TASK; ERP COMPONENTS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; EEG; PE; DISSOCIATION	Errors in human behavior elicit a cascade of brain activity related to performance monitoring and error detection. Whereas the early error-related negativity (Ne/ERN) has been assumed to reflect a fast mismatch or prediction error signal in the medial frontal cortex, the later error positivity (Pe) is viewed as a correlate of conscious error processing. A still open question is whether these components represent two independent systems of error monitoring that rely on different types of information to detect an error. Here, we investigated the prediction that the Ne/ERN but not the Pe requires a representation of the correct response to emerge. To this end, we created a condition in which no information about the correct response was available while error detection was still possible. We hypothesized that a Pe, but no Ne/ERN should be obtained in this case. Participants had to classify targets but ignore flankers that were always associated with an incorrect response. Targets but not flankers were masked with varying target-masking intervals. Crucially, on some trials no target at all was presented, thus preventing the representation of a correct response and the emergence of an Ne/ERN. However, because flankers were easily visible and responses to the flankers were always incorrect, detection of these flanker errors was still possible. In line with predictions of a multiple-systems account, we observed a robust Pe in the absence of an Ne/ERN for these errors. Moreover, this Pe relied on the same neural activity as that on trials with a visible target, as revealed by multivariate pattern analysis. These findings demonstrate that the mechanisms reflected by the two components use different types of information to detect errors, providing evidence for independent systems of human error monitoring.

Alpha-gamma phase amplitude coupling subserves information transfer during perceptual sequence learning	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article						Phase amplitude coupling; Sequence learning; Alpha power	PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; ERP GENERATOR PATTERNS; LAPLACIAN WAVE-FORMS; WORKING-MEMORY TASK; CORTICAL NETWORKS; GENERIC METHOD; BAND ACTIVITY; SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; OSCILLATIONS	Cross-frequency coupling is suggested to serve transfer of information between wide-spread neuronal assemblies and has been shown to underlie many cognitive functions including learning and memory. In previous work, we found that alpha (8-13 Hz) - gamma (30-48 Hz) phase amplitude coupling (alpha gamma PAC) is decreased during sequence learning in bilateral frontal cortex and right parietal cortex. We interpreted this to reflect decreased demands for visuo-motor mapping once the sequence has been encoded. In the present study, we put this hypothesis to the test by adding a "simple" condition to the standard serial reaction time task (SRTT) with minimal needs for visuo-motor mapping. The standard SRTT in our paradigm entailed a perceptual sequence allowing for implicit learning of a sequence of colors with randomly assigned motor responses. Sequence learning in this case was thus not associated with reduced demands for visuo-motor mapping. Analysis of oscillatory power revealed a learning-related alpha decrease pointing to a stronger recruitment of occipito-parietal areas when encoding the perceptual sequence. Replicating our previous findings but in contrast to our hypothesis, alpha gamma PAC was decreased in sequence compared to random trials over right frontal and parietal cortex. It also tended to be smaller compared to trials requiring a simple motor sequence. We additionally analyzed alpha gamma PAC in resting-state data of a separate cohort. PAC in electrodes over right parietal cortex was significantly stronger compared to sequence trials and tended to be higher compared to simple and random trials of the SRTT data. We suggest that alpha gamma PAC in right parietal cortex reflects a "default-mode" brain state, which gets perturbed to allow for encoding of visual regularities into memory.

J	Damsma, A; van der Mijn, R; van Rijn, H				Damsma, Atser; van der Mijn, Robbert; van Rijn, Hedderik			Neural markers of memory consolidation do not predict temporal estimates of encoded items	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Time perception; Working memory; Memory consolidation; P3	ATTENTIONAL BLINK; WORKING-MEMORY; P3 LATENCY; TIME; SUPPRESSION; PERCEPTION; MECHANISMS; COGNITION; LOCUS; TASK	In contrast to the paradigms used in most laboratory experiments on interval timing, everyday tasks often involve tracking multiple, concurrent intervals without an explicit starting signal. As these characteristics are problematic for most existing clock-based models of interval timing, here we explore an alternative notion that suggests that time perception and working memory encoding might be closely connected. In this integrative model, the consolidation of a new item in working memory initiates cortical oscillations that also signal the onset of a. time interval. The objective of this study was to test whether memory consolidation indeed acts as the starting signal of interval timing. Participants performed an attentional blink task in which they not only reported the targets, but also the estimated target onsets, allowing us to calculate estimated lag. In the attentional blink task, the second target (T2) in a rapid serial visual presentation is often not reported when it follows quickly after the first target (T1). However, if this fast T2 is reported, memory consolidation of T2 is presumably delayed. Consequently, if memory consolidation determines interval onset, we would expect a later estimated onset when consolidation is delayed. Furthermore, as the P3 ERP component is assumed to reflect memory consolidation, we expect that the estimated onsets and subjective lag are functions of the P3 latencies. The behavioral data show that the presumed delay in memory consolidation did not lead to later estimated onsets. In addition, the EEG results suggest that there was no relationship between P3 latency and subjective lag or estimated onset. Overall, our results suggest that there is no direct link between the encoding of items in working memory and sub-second interval timing of these items in the attentional blink task.

The ability to see has a decisive influence on the augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems available to the user. To better understand the initial impressions users have of AAC systems we asked naive healthy participants to compare two visual (a visual P300 brain-computer interface (BCI) and an eye-tracker) and two non-visual systems (an auditory and a tactile P300 BCI). Eleven healthy participants performed 20 selections in a five choice task with each system. The visual P300 BCI used face stimuli, the auditory P300 BCI used Japanese Hiragana syllables and the tactile P300 BCI used a stimulator on the small left finger, middle left finger, right thumb, middle right finger and small right finger. The eye-tracker required a dwell time of 3 s on the target for selection. We calculated accuracies and information-transfer rates (ITRs) for each control method using the selection time that yielded the highest ITR and an accuracy above 70% for each system. Accuracies of 88% were achieved with the visual P300 BCI (4.8 s selection time, 20.9 bits/min), of 70% with the auditory BCI (19.9 s, 3.3 bits/min), of 71% with the tactile BCI (18 s, 3.4 bits/min) and of 100% with the eye-tracker (5.1 s, 28.2 bits/min). Performance between eye-tracker and visual BCI correlated strongly, correlation between tactile and auditory BCI performance was lower. Our data showed no advantage for either non-visual system in terms of ITR but a lower correlation of performance which suggests that choosing the system which suits a particular user is of higher importance for non-visual systems than visual systems.

Teenagers with different genders have different patterns of cognitive activity, and consequently the brain structure and the characteristics of its activity with gender differences when watching a cartoon have provided a significant inspiration. Based on the results of gender difference, age difference, data of ERP and traceability, the investigation of the article has begun with the contrast of semantic information represented by the animation with the information of cognition degree of "animation-picture". It has come to conclusions as follows: 1) In the semantic exchange of an animation, the perception and judgement of the emotional relationship are more difficult than those of the context; 2) People with different genders have obvious cognitive differences, and hence the film editing, the field of shooting scale and the movement of camera will stimulate the visual areas in the brains of male and female with quite different active degrees. And also, the audiovisuals of a film might have a stimulating synergy to the brains of male and female; 3) In the transition of "animation-picture-semantics" , both of P300 and N400 will emerge, which explains that the judgement of the above two relations is realized through the spatial memory and the understanding of meanings; 4) On the basis of the mutuality and interaction between the emotion and the perception, the analysis tracking down the source has discovered that, the functional area of semantic comprehension is mainly located at the angular gyrus of inferior parietal lobule, that is, Area 39 and the back of gyrus frontalis inferior (Area 44 and 45), which are included within the scope of visual and motor speech areas.

We stratified participants by brain amyloid beta deposition on F-18-florbetapir PET (positive or negative) at baseline. All patients underwent baseline assessments of demographic, cognitive, and psychobehavioural, characteristics, APOE epsilon 4 allele carrier status, brain structure and function on MRI, brain glucose-metabolism on F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) PET, and event-related potentials on electroencephalo-grams (EEGs). Actigraphy and CSF investigations were optional. Participants were followed up with clinical, cognitive, and psychobehavioural assessments every 6 months, neuropsychological assessments, EEG, and actigraphy every 12 months, and MRI, and F-18-FDG and F-18-florbetapir PET every 24 months. We assessed associations of amyloid beta deposition status with test outcomes at baseline and 24 months, and with clinical status at 30 months. Progression to prodromal Alzheimer's disease was defined as an amnestic syndrome of the hippocampal type. Findings From May 25, 2013, to Jan 20, 2015, we enrolled 318 participants with a mean age of 76.0 years (SD 3.5). The mean baseline MMSE score was 28.67 (SD 0.96), and the mean level of education was high (score >6 [SD 2] on a scale of 1-8, where 1=infant school and 8=higher education). 88 (28%) of 318 participants showed amyloid beta deposition and the remainder did not. The amyloid beta subgroups did not differ for any psychobehavioural, cognitive, actigraphy, and structural and functional neuroimaging results after adjustment for age, sex, and level of education More participants positive for amyloid beta deposition had the APOE e4 allele (33 [38%] vs 29 [13%], p<0.0001). Amyloid beta(1-42) concentration in CSF significantly correlated with mean F-18-florbetapir uptake at baseline (r=-0.62, p<0.0001) and the ratio of amyloid beta(1-42) to amyloid beta(1-40) (r=-0.61, p<0.0001), and identified amyloid beta deposition status with high accuracy (mean area under the curve values 0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.98 and 0.84, 0.72-0.96, respectively). No difference was seen in MMSE (28.3 [SD 2.0] vs 28.9 [1.2], p=0.16) and Clinical Dementia Rating scores (0.06 [0.2] vs 0.05 [0.3]; p=0.79) at 30 months (n=274) between participants positive or negative for amyloid beta. Four participants (all positive for amyloid beta deposition at baseline) progressed to prodromal Alzheimer's disease. They were older than other participants positive for amyloid beta deposition at baseline (mean 80.2 years [SD 4.1] vs 76.8 years [SD 3.4]) and had greater F-18-florbetapir uptake at baseline (mean standard uptake value ratio 1.46 [SD 0.16] vs 1.02 [SD 0.20]), and more were carriers of the APOE e4 allele (three [75%] of four vs 33 [39%] of 83). They also had mild executive dysfunction at baseline (mean FCSRT free recall score 21.25 [SD 2.75] vs 29.08 [5.44] and Frontal Assessment Battery total score 13.25 [1.50] vs 16.05 [1.68]). Interpretation Brain beta-amyloidosis alone did not predict progression to prodromal Alzheimer's disease within 30 months. Longer follow-up is needed to establish whether this finding remains consistent.
