Using electroencephalography (EEG), we undertook a feasibility study on exploring event-related potential (ERP) patterns of the user's brain responses during haptic interaction within a VE. The interaction was flying a virtual drone along a curved transmission line to detect defects under the stimuli (e.g., force increase and/or vibrotactile cues). We found that there were variations in the peak amplitudes and latencies (as ERP patterns) of the responses at about 200 ms post the onset of the stimuli. The largest negative peak occurred during 200 similar to 400 ms after the onset in all vibration-related blocks. Moreover, the amplitudes and latencies of the peak were differentiable among the vibration-related blocks. These findings imply feasible decoding of the brain responses during haptic interaction within VEs.

Electrophysiology of obsessive compulsive disorder: A systematic review of the electroencephalographic literature	JOURNAL OF ANXIETY DISORDERS			English	Review						Obsessive-compulsive disorder; Quantitative electroencephalography; Frontal asymmetry; Event related potentials; Error related negativity	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; FRONTAL ALPHA ASYMMETRY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; QUANTITATIVE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; ENDOPHENOTYPE CONCEPT; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY	Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic disease that causes significant decline in the quality of life of those affected. Due to our limited understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of OCD, successful treatment remains elusive. Although many have studied the pathophysiology of OCD through electroencephalography (EEG), limited attempts have been made to synthesize and interpret their findings. To bridge this gap, we conducted a comprehensive literature review using Medline/PubMed and considered the 65 most relevant studies published before June 2018. The findings are categorised into quantitative EEG, sleep related EEG and event related potentials (ERPs). Increased frontal asymmetry, frontal slowing and an enhancement in the ERP known as error related negativity (ERN) were consistent findings in OCD. However, sleep EEG and other ERP (P3 and N2) findings were inconsistent. Additionally, we analysed the usefulness of ERN as a potential candidate endophenotype. We hypothesize that dysfunctional frontal circuitry and overactive performance monitoring are the major underlying impairments in OCD. Additionally, we conceptualized that defective fronto-striato-thalamic circuitry causing poor cerebral functional connectivity gives rise to the OCD behavioural manifestations. Finally, we have discussed transcranial magnetic stimulation and EEG (TMS-EEG) applications in future research to further our knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology of OCD.	[Perera, M.

Conventional wet electrodes are widely used in recording EEG signals, which are, however, limited by long-time skin preparation and the usage of a wet gel. To supplement the shortcomings of wet electrodes, we designed a novel dry-contact EEG electrode and a multichannel EEG cap. A platinum (Pt) nano porous layer was deposited on the head of the dry electrode to decrease the contact resistance and enhance the conductivity. The new electrodes were evaluated with electrophysiological tests and were compared with the standard wet electrodes. To evaluate the feasibility and applicability of our dry electrode, EEG measurements and event-related potential (ERP) tests were conducted using the dry electrode. For the resting-state EEG measurement, there were no significant differences between the dry electrode and the standard wet electrodes, with the relative errors of the EEG signals ranging from 0.8179 to 0.9677. For the ERP test, obvious P300 waves were acquired by dry electrodes, the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) results of the dry electrodes and wet electrodes in the P300 waves were less than 1 mu V and the correlations were more than 0.99. In conclusion, our newly developed dry EEG electrodes and multichannel cap were reliable in measuring EEG signals with a quick and convenient preparation and are promising for clinical applications.

In particular, little is known about the changes in the information processing of external stimuli in sedation. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes of event-related potential (ERP) in auditory passive oddball paradigm when the sedation was induced by sevoflurane inhalation. Electroencephalography (EEG) measurements were obtained for each subject using 32-channel EEG recording devices. Sevoflurane was administered at an initial concentration of 0.8 vol% to induce sedative state. Auditory stimulation based on the passive oddball paradigm was delivered to the subject via an earphone before and after sevoflurane administration. After ERP was extracted from the measured EEG, the topographic distribution of ERP, the temporal changes of ERP in each channel, and the statistical difference in ERP between awake and sedation were analyzed. In the awake state, P300 was observed at 320-360 ms latency, and P300 was concentrated in the frontal and central area. P300 amplitude was significantly decreased in sedation compared to awake. Sevoflurane-induced sedation caused a decrease in P300 amplitude. This result may reflect the weakening of the cognitive function governing attentional process and stimuli discrimination during sedation.

Method for spatial overlap estimation of electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging responses	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						fMRI; EEG; ERP; Joint independent component analysis (jICA); Auditory; Oddball; P300	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SIMULTANEOUS EEG-FMRI; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; BOLD SIGNAL; ERP; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS; SYSTEM	Background. Simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) measurements may represent activity from partially divergent neural sources, but this factor is seldom modeled in fMRI-EEG data integration. New method. This paper proposes an approach to estimate the spatial overlap between sources of activity measured simultaneously with fMRI and EEG. Following the extraction of task-related activity, the key steps include, 1) distributed source reconstruction of the task-related ERP activity (ERP source model), 2) transformation of fMRI activity to the ERP spatial scale by forward modelling of the scalp potential field distribution and backward source reconstruction (fMRI source simulation), and 3) optimization of fMRI and ERP thresholds to maximize spatial overlap without a priori constraints of coupling (overlap calculation). Results: FMRI and ERP responses were recorded simultaneously in 15 subjects performing an auditory oddball task. A high degree of spatial overlap between sources of fMRI and ERP responses (in 9 or more of 15 subjects) was found specifically within temporoparietal areas associated with the task. Areas of non-overlap in fMRI and ERP sources were relatively small and inconsistent across subjects. Comparison with existing method: The ERP and fMRI sources estimated with solely jICA overlapped in just 4 of 15 subjects, and strictly in the parietal cortex. Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the new fMRI-ERP spatial overlap estimation method provides greater spatiotemporal detail of the cortical dynamics than solely jICA. As such, we propose that it is a superior method for the integration of fMRI and EEG to study brain function.	[Heugel, N.; Liebenthal, E.; Beardsley, S.

The objective of this paper was to evaluate the performance of the consumer grade Emotiv Insight using a facial recognition event related potential (ERP) task. Good classification accuracy would enable the use of commercial systems such as the Insight to be used for reminiscence therapy. Methods: EEG was recorded with the Insight while obscure and famous facial stimuli were presented; participants confirmed recognition with a button press and oral confirmation. ERPs were averaged across five presentations of each facial stimuli to improve the signal to noise ratio. Classifiers were trained on one session, tested on another session, and the accuracy of each system was compared. Results: The Insight did produce ERPs typical of recognition memory however, it did not perform much better than chance. Event integration and artefacts were a significant problem. Conclusion: The Insight has practical advantages; however, the recording quality is not high enough to achieve adequate classification accuracy.

Because scalp EEG recordings are considered as spatially degraded signals, independent component analysis (ICA) is a widely used data-driven method for obtaining ERPs by decomposing EEG data. However, the accurate estimation of the differences in ERP components extracted by ICA with different references remains unclear. In this study, we first provided formal descriptions of the above reference methods (Cz, LM, AVG, and REST) and ICA decomposition in ERP and then investigated the influences of different reference techniques on simulation and real EEG datasets. The results revealed that (1) the reference method did not change the peak amplitudes and latencies of relative ERPs corresponding to some IC time courses; (2) there were non-negligible effects of different reference methods on both temporal ERPs and spatial topographies of some ICs; and (3) compared to Cz, LM, and AR, considering both the performances of temporal ERPs and spatial topographies, the REST reference had overall superiority. These findings provide a recommended choice of REST for ICA analysis at the trial level and contribute to empirical investigations regarding the use of reference methods in ERP domains with ICA analysis.

Neurophysiological Correlates of Concussion: Deep Learning for Clinical Assessment	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SPORT-RELATED CONCUSSION; LONG-TERM; NEURAL-NETWORKS; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; REDUCTION; COMPONENT; MISMATCH	Concussion has been shown to leave the afflicted with significant cognitive and neurobehavioural deficits. The persistence of these deficits and their link to neurophysiological indices of cognition, as measured by event-related potentials (ERP) using electroencephalography (EEG), remains restricted to population level analyses that limit their utility in the clinical setting. In the present paper, a convolutional neural network is extended to capitalize on characteristics specific to EEG/ERP data in order to assess for post-concussive effects. An aggregated measure of single-trial performance was able to classify accurately (85%) between 26 acutely to post-acutely concussed participants and 28 healthy controls in a stratified 10-fold cross-validation design. Additionally, the model was evaluated in a longitudinal subsample of the concussed group to indicate a dissociation between the progression of EEG/ERP and that of self-reported inventories. Concordant with a number of previous studies, symptomatology was found to be uncorrelated to EEG/ERP results as assessed with the proposed models. Our results form a first-step towards the clinical integration of neurophysiological results in concussion management and motivate a multi-site validation study for a concussion assessment tool in acute and post-acute cases.

The device, dubbed CochlEEG, benefits from a low-power design for long-term power autonomy and provides configurable gain and sampling rates to suit the needs of various EEG applications. CochlEEG features high sampling rates, up to 4 kHz, low-noise signal acquisitions, support for active electrodes, and a potential for Wi-Fi data transmission. Moreover, it is lightweight, pocket size, and affordable, which makes CochlEEG suitable for wearable and real-world applications. The efficiency of CochlEEG in EEG data acquisition is also investigated in this paper. Auditory steady-state responses acquisition results validate CochlEEG's capability in recording EEG with a signal quality comparable to commercial mobile or research EEG acquisition devices. Moreover, the results of an oddball paradigm experiment prove the capability of CochlEEG in recording event-related potentials and demonstrate its potential for brain-computer interface applications and electrophysiological research applications requiring higher temporal resolution.

These devices usually make use of event-related potential (ERP) component of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. BCIs have several applications, but perhaps the most important one is to communicate with the advance neuromuscular patients. P300 Speller is a method that was developed by making use of BCIs and ERPs to make it possible to communicate with a computer through EEG recordings. The sensitive nature of these signals makes it essential to make sure they have a high recovery rate once they have been compressed. Compressive sensing (CS) is a compression method which takes advantage of the potential sparsity of the signals and aims to reconstruct a signal from a smaller number of measurements that is specified by the Nyquist theorem. CS has been studied in various signal processing areas. Because of the low power consumption and the elapsed time for generating CS measurements, CS became as one of the most efficient compression methods. In this work, we study the applicability of CS and its recovery quality for ERP signals. We run the experiments based on random and deterministic sensing matrices and two different sparsifying bases. The simulation results show that the ERP signal is very suitable for CS compression up to 75% compression ratio (CR). For the recovery phase, we investigate the effects of the recently developed preprocessing approach called Kronecker-based technique. By using Kronecker-based technique in recovery, we could recover the original signal with high accuracy up to 30 dB.

Improved understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying BCI training will facilitate optimisation of BCIs. The current study examined the neural mechanisms related to training for electroencephalography (EEG)-based communication with an auditory event-related potential (ERP) BCI. Neural mechanisms of training in 10 healthy volunteers were assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an auditory ERP-based BCI task before (t1) and after (t5) three ERP-BCI training sessions outside the fMRI scanner (t2, t3, and t4). Attended stimuli were contrasted with ignored stimuli in the first-level fMRI data analysis (t1 and t5); the training effect was verified using the EEG data (t2-t4); and brain activation was contrasted before and after training in the second-level fMRI data analysis (t1 vs. t5). Training increased the communication speed from 2.9 bits/min (t2) to 4 bits/min (t4). Strong activation was found in the putamen, supplementary motor area (SMA), and superior temporal gyrus (STG) associated with attention to the stimuli. Training led to decreased activation in the superior frontal gyrus and stronger haemodynamic rebound in the STG and supramarginal gyrus. The neural mechanisms of ERP-BCI training indicate improved stimulus perception and reduced mental workload. The ERP task used in the current study showed overlapping activations with a motor imagery based BCI task from a previous study on the neural mechanisms of BCI training in the SMA and putamen. This suggests commonalities between the neural mechanisms of training for both BCI paradigms.

A database of auditory oddball stimuli signals was used to obtain the main parameters for the ERP simulator. The average of the signals in 9 electrodes was extracted to feed the data into the simulator and the synthetic output signal compared with real data. The results show good similarities between real and synthetic signals. A correlation of 67.4% between the average of the real and synthetic signals was observed. The simulator shows good potential as a tool to generate synthetic ERPs to aid and validate the development of techniques applied to EEG signal processing.

Depression symptomatology correlates with event-related potentials in Parkinson's disease: An affective priming study	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; Electroencephalography; Event related potentials; Affective priming task; Depression	RATING-SCALES; BRAIN; N400; EMOTION; VALENCE; PREVALENCE; AMYGDALA	Background: Depression is a predominant non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), which is often under recognised and undertreated. To improve identification of depression in PD it is imperative to examine objective brain-related markers. The present study addresses this gap by using electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate the processing of emotionally valanced words in PD. Methods: Fifty non-demented PD patients, unmedicated for depression or anxiety, completed an affective priming task while EEG was simultaneously recorded. Prime and target word pairs of negative or neutral valence were presented at a short 250 ms stimulus onset asynchrony. Participants were asked to evaluate the valence of the target word by button press. Depression was measured using an established rating scale. Repeated measures analysis of covariance and correlational analyses were performed to examine whether event-related potentials (ERP) varied as a function of depression scores. Results: Key ERP findings reveal reduced responses in parietal midline P300, N400 and Late Positive Potential (LPP) difference waves between congruent and incongruent neutral targets in patients with higher depression scores. Limitations: Comparisons of ERPs were limited by insufficient classification of participants with and without clinical depression. A majority of PD patients who had high depression scores were excluded from the analysis as they were receiving antidepressant and/or anxiolytic medications which could interfere with ERP sensitivity. Conclusions: The present study suggests that the Pz-P300, N400 and LPP are ERP markers relates to emotional dysfunction in PD. These findings thus advance current knowledge regarding the neurophysiological markers of a common neuropsychiatric deficit in PD.	[Dissanayaka, Nadeeka N.

The objective of this paper was to evaluate the performance of a g.tec EEG system using a facial recognition event related potential (ERP) task. Previous work has used the Emotiv off-the-shelf system which resulted in lack of classification. For this work, we sought to use a g.tec system with the same electrode placement as the Emotiv Insight to evaluate whether a reduced electrode set would provide sufficient classification accuracy. Methods: EEG was recorded with the same electrode montage as the Insight while obscure and famous facial stimuli were presented; participants confirmed recognition with a button press and oral confirmation. ERPs were averaged across five presentations of each facial stimuli to improve the signal to noise ratio. Classifiers were trained on one session, tested on another session. Results: Using the same electrode montage as the Insight, the g.tec achieved an average accuracy of 80%. Conclusion and Significance: A new research quality system with only the Pz electrode may provide sufficient classification to develop a system for reminiscence therapy.

It brings a higher availability, sustainability and performance. However, specifics of different research areas require development of customized solutions for individual research domains. For example, electroencephalography and event-related potentials (EEG/ERP) use specific devices, data formats and machine learning workflows. As a solution, a cloud-based system for the EEG/ERP domain containing a distributed data storage, a signal processing method library and a client GUI is presented. The signal processing method library is used for training of classifiers and classifying the data in the cloud-based system controlled by the GUI. The presented system was tested using a machine learning workflow based on the data stored in the system. In the workflow, various classifiers were trained and their parameters stored into the system. Finally, testing data were classified using previously trained classifiers.

Electroencephalography (EEG) has become the most common application of BCIs and provides a way for disabled individuals to communicate. While wet sensors are the most commonly used sensors for traditional EEG measurements, they require considerable preparation time, including the time needed to prepare the skin and to use the conductive gel. Additionally, the conductive gel dries over time, leading to degraded performance. Furthermore, requiring patients to wear wet sensors to record EEG signals is considered highly inconvenient. Here, we report a wireless 8-channel digital active-circuit EEG signal acquisition system that uses dry sensors. Active-circuit systems for EEG measurement allow people to engage in daily life while using these systems, and the advantages of these systems can be further improved by utilizing dry sensors. Moreover, the use of dry sensors can help both disabled and healthy people enjoy the convenience of BCIs in daily life. To verify the reliability of the proposed system, we designed three experiments in which we evaluated eye blinking and teeth gritting, measured alpha waves, and recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) to compare our developed system with a standard Neuroscan EEG system.

This study examined the effects of state-related EEG changes, from rest to the task and within the task, on stimulus-response efforts in a visual Continuous Performance Test (CPT). EEG was recorded from fifty-six adults at rest with eyes-closed (EC) then eyes-open (EO), and during the CPT. Principal Components Analyses decomposed the EEG obtained from EC, EO and the task-based periods immediately pre-cue (PC) and preimperative (PI), and the ERPs to the cued Go/NoGo imperatives. EC amplitudes were correlated with Go/NoGo ERP amplitudes and behavioural outcomes. EEG amplitude changes from EO to PC, and from PC to PI, were assessed as predictors of these response measures. Longer mean reaction time (RT) was associated with greater RT variability (RTV) and reduced Go P2. The two EC alpha components correlated positively with RTV, and NoGo P1 and P2 positivity. Delta/theta amplitude reductions from PC to PI predicted Go N1-1 and NoGo N2b enhancements. Alpha-1 decreases from PC to PI predicted larger P2 and poorer NoGo accuracy rates, while alpha-3 decrements positively predicted NoGo P1. These findings highlight the ongoing alpha arousal effects on stimulus-response efforts, and the low frequency shifts in the cue to imperative interval associated with stimulus anticipation and response preparation. These relationships offer novel insights into the effects of pretask EEG activity, and within-task EEG changes, on attention and cognitive control processes.

The Decision Decoding ToolBOX (DDTBOX) - A Multivariate Pattern Analysis Toolbox for Event-Related Potentials	NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						Multivariate pattern classification analysis (MVPA); Decoding; Event-related potentials (ERPs); Electroencephalography (EEG); Toolbox; Support vector machines	NEURAL MECHANISMS; INFORMATION; CLASSIFICATION; DYNAMICS; FMRI; TIME; REPRESENTATIONS; TUTORIAL; INTEGRATION; RECOGNITION	In recent years, neuroimaging research in cognitive neuroscience has increasingly used multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to investigate higher cognitive functions. Here we present DDTBOX, an open-source MVPA toolbox for electroencephalography (EEG) data. DDTBOX runs under MATLAB and is well integrated with the EEGLAB/ERPLAB and Fieldtrip toolboxes (Delorme and Makeig 2004; Lopez-Calderon and Luck 2014; Oostenveld et al. 2011). It trains support vector machines (SVMs) on patterns of event-related potential (ERP) amplitude data, following or preceding an event of interest, for classification or regression of experimental variables. These amplitude patterns can be extracted across space/electrodes (spatial decoding), time (temporal decoding), or both (spatiotemporal decoding). DDTBOX can also extract SVM feature weights, generate empirical chance distributions based on shuffled-labels decoding for group-level statistical testing, provide estimates of the prevalence of decodable information in the population, and perform a variety of corrections for multiple comparisons. It also includes plotting functions for single subject and group results. DDTBOX complements conventional analyses of ERP components, as subtle multivariate patterns can be detected that would be overlooked in standard analyses. It further allows for a more explorative search for information when no ERP component is known to be specifically linked to a cognitive process of interest. In summary, DDTBOX is an easy-to-use and open-source toolbox that allows for characterising the time-course of information related to various perceptual and cognitive processes. It can be applied to data from a large number of experimental paradigms and could therefore be a valuable tool for the neuroimaging community.

However, previously identified effects of quality change on P3 might actually be traced back to modulations in earlier portions of the ERP signal, evoked by physical variability between test stimuli. The present study introduces a rigorous control procedure to isolate late ERP signal portions by eliminating such physical stimulus confounds. Due to successful removal of auditory evoked activity, observed quality-related ERP signal modulations can be attributed to P3 with higher validity. The implemented control procedure promises to form an essential part of future experimental designs in psychophysiological assessment of multimedia quality.

In the present study, using electroencephalography (EEG), we manipulated both musical pitch and time structures and investigated how the two dimensions work together. Musicians were presented with eight-chord sequences, in which the last target chord was harmonically or temporally expected or unexpected based on the preceding contexts. ERP analysis showed that listeners track both dimensions as music unfolds in time. For the time dimension, irregular temporal events induced greater MMN than regular temporal events. For the pitch dimension, harmonically less-related chords revealed greater ERAN and N5 than harmonically related chords. Moreover, there was an interaction between musical pitch and time dimensions in the N5 effect. These results indicate that for music perception, pitch and time dimensions are processed independently at the early stage and interactively at the late stage.

Fast classifying ERPs is vital for the good performance of ERP BCIs. However, due to noisy background electroencephalography (EEG) environments, current ERP-based BCI systems need to collect multiple trials for a reliable output, which is inefficient. This study compared a recently developed algorithm, i.e. discriminative canonical pattern matching (DCPM), with five traditional classification methods, i.e. linear discriminant analysis (LDA), four advanced methods of LDA included stepwise LDA, Bayesian LDA, shrinkage LDA and spatial-temporal discriminant analysis (STDA), for the detection of single-trial ERPs with a small number of training samples. Public dataset from RSVP-speller, which would induce ERPs contained N200 and P300 components in ERPs, was addressed in this study. Study results showed that the DCPM significantly outperformed the other traditional methods in single-trial ERP classification in RSVP-based BCI even with small training samples, suggesting the DCPM is a promising classification algorithm for the ERP-BCI.

Technical advances over the last 100 years or so have rendered EEG a true brain imaging technique. Here, we provide an accessible primer on the biophysics of EEG, on measurement aspects, and on the analysis of EEG data. We use the example of event-related potentials (ERPs), although the issues apply equally to other varieties of EEG signals, and provide an overview of analytic methods at the base of the so-called electrical neuroimaging framework. We detail the interpretational strengths of electrical neuroimaging for organizational researchers and describe some domains of ongoing technical developments. We likewise emphasize practical considerations with the use of EEG in more real-world settings. This primer is intended to provide organizational researchers specifically, and novices more generally, an access point to understanding how EEG may be applied in their research.

Methods: Thirty subjects were administered a daily dose of either 5 mg donepezil or placebo for 15 days in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over trial. The electroencephalogram during an auditory oddball paradigm was recorded from 58 scalp electrodes. Current source density (CSD) transformations were applied to EEG epochs. The event-related potential (ERP), inter-trial coherence (ITC: the phase consistency of the EEG spectrum) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP: the EEG power spectrum relative to the baseline) were calculated for the target (oddball) stimuli. Results: The donepezil and placebo conditions differed in terms of the changes in delta/theta/alpha/beta ITC and ERSP in various regions of the scalp (especially the frontal electrodes) but not in terms of latency and amplitude of the P300-ERP component. Conclusion: Our results suggest that ITC and ERSP analyses can provide EEG markers of donepezil's effects in young, healthy, adult volunteers at a group level. Significance: Novel EEG markers could be useful to assess the therapeutic potential of drug candidates in Alzheimer's disease in healthy volunteers prior to the initiation of Phase II/III clinical studies in patients.

However, the electrophysiological mechanisms of WM alterations following sleep restriction remain largely unknown. To identify such mechanisms, event-related potentials were recorded during the n-back WM task, before and after 36 h sleep deprivation. Thirty-one young volunteers participated in this study and performed a two-back WM task with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) recording before and after TSD and after 8 h time in bed for recovery (TIBR). Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed that, compared to resting wakefulness, sleep deprivation induced a decrease in the P200 amplitude and induced longer reaction times. ERP-component scalp topographies results indicated that such decrease primarily occurred in the frontal cortex. The N200 and P300 amplitudes also decreased after TSD. Our results suggest that decreased information replacement of WM occurs after 36 h of TSD and that 8 h TIBR after a long period of TSD leads to partial restoration of WM functions. The present findings represent the EEG profile of WM during mental fatigue.

Traditional ERP-based BCI systems may perform poorly for small training samples, i.e. the undersampling problem. In this study, the ERP classification problem was investigated, in particular, the ERP classification in the high-dimensional setting with the number of features larger than the number of samples was studied. A flexible group sparse discriminative analysis algorithm based on Moreau-Yosida regularization was proposed for alleviating the undersampling problem. An optimization problem with the group sparse criterion was presented, and the optimal solution was proposed by using the regularized optimal scoring method. During the alternating iteration procedure, the feature selection and classification were performed simultaneously. Two P300-based BCI datasets were used to evaluate our proposed new method and compare it with existing standard methods. The experimental results indicated that the features extracted via our proposed method are efficient and provide an overall better P300 classification accuracy compared with several state-of-the-art methods.

Electroencephalography (EEG) records electrical signal that can reveal the mental state of the brain. EEG-based motor imagery classification is an important branch of BCI research. ERS (event-related synchronization) and ERD (event-related desynchronization) based features have been widely employed to classify motor imageries. Meanwhile, various methods derived from ERP (event-related potential) have been developed. Previous studies have demonstrated that ERP and ERD could provide complementary information about brain activity, so approach combining them is expected to give better performance for motor imagery classification. In this study, a novel variant of ERP called spatio-temporal discrepancy feature (STDF) is proposed, which evaluates the difference of the EEG signals from the left and the right sensorimotor area. With STDF, the noise which affects the left brain signal and the right brain signal simultaneously could be suppressed and the signal difference between the left and the right sensorimotor areas could be enhanced, which will certainly benefit the left vs. right motor imagery classification. STDF as a temporal feature is then combined respectively with three kinds of frequency features describing the ERD/ERS phenomenon to further improve the classification performance. Experiments on BCI competition IV dataset 2a and 2b have been conducted. Different features and state-of-the-art methods have been compared and the proposed STDF based method has obtained the best performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, EEG is susceptible to a large amount of noise, especially from muscle activity, making it difficult to use in ubiquitous computing environments where mobility and physicality are important features. In this work, we present a novel multimodal approach for classifying the P300 event related potential (ERP) component by coupling EEG signals with nonscalp electrodes (NSE) that measure ocular and muscle artifacts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a new dataset where the P300 signal was evoked with participants on a stationary bike under three conditions of physical activity: rest, low-intensity, and high-intensity exercise. We show that intensity of physical activity impacts the performance of both our proposed model and existing state-of-the-art models. After incorporating signals from nonscalp electrodes our proposed model performs significantly better for the physical activity conditions. Our results suggest that the incorporation of additional modalities related to eye-movements and muscle activity may improve the efficacy of mobile EEG-based BCI systems, creating the potential for ubiquitous BCI.

In this paper, we propose the event-related potential encoder network (ERPENet), a multi-task autoencoder-based model, that can be applied to any ERP-related tasks. The strength of ERPENet lies in its capability to handle various kinds of ERP datasets and its robustness across multiple recording setups, enabling joint training across datasets. The ERPENet incorporates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM), in an autoencoder setup, which tries to simultaneously compress the input EEG signal and extract related P300 features into a latent vector. Here, we can infer the process for generating the latent vector as universal joint feature extraction. The network also includes a classification part for attended and unattended events classification as an auxiliary task. We experimented on six different P300 datasets. The results show that the latent vector exhibits better compression capability than the previous state-of-the-art semi-supervised autoencoder model. For attended and unattended events classification, pre-trained weights are adopted as initial weights and tested on unseen P300 datasets to evaluate the adaptability of the model, which shortens the training process as compared to using random Xavier weight initialization.

From Group-Level Statistics to Single-Subject Prediction: Machine Learning Detection of Concussion in Retired Athletes	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Event-related potentials; brain injury; electroencephalography; EEG; concussions; machine learning; explainable models	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LONG-TERM; INTERNATIONAL-CONFERENCE; CONSENSUS STATEMENT; SPORT HELD; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; REDUCTION; DEFICITS; HISTORY	There has been increased effort to understand the neurophysiological effects of concussion aimed to move diagnosis and identification beyond current subjective behavioral assessments that suffer from poor sensitivity. Recent evidence suggests that event-related potentials (ERPs) measured with electroencephalography (EEG) are persistent neurophysiological markers of past concussions. However, as such evidence is limited to group-level analyzes, the extent to which they enable concussion detection at the individual-level is unclear. One promising avenue of research is the use of machine learning to create quantitative predictive models that can detect prior concussions in individuals. In this paper, we translate the recent group-level findings from ERP studies of concussed individuals into a machine learning framework for performing single-subject prediction of past concussion. We found that a combination of statistics of single-subject ERPs and wavelet features yielded a classification accuracy of 81% with a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 80%, improving on current practice. Notably, the model was able to detect concussion effects in individuals who sustained their last injury as much as 30 years earlier. However, failure to detect past concussions in a subset of individuals suggests that the clear effects found in group-level analyses may not provide us with a full picture of the neurophysiological effects of concussion.

Due to advantages such as non-invasiveness, ease of use, and low cost, electroencephalography (EEG) is the most popular method for current BCIs. This chapter gives an overview of the current EEG-based BCIs for the main purpose of communication and control. This chapter first provides a taxonomy of the EEG-based BCI systems by categorizing them into three major groups: (1) BCIs based on event-related potentials (ERPs), (2) BCIs based on sensorimotor rhythms, and (3) hybrid BCIs. Next, this chapter describes challenges and potential solutions in developing practical BCI systems toward high communication speed, convenient system use, and low user variation. Then this chapter briefly reviews both medical and non-medical applications of current BCIs. Finally, this chapter concludes with a summary of current stage and future perspectives of the EEG-based BCI technology.

The Influence of Subclinical Neck Pain on Neurophysiological and Behavioral Measures of Multisensory Integration	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						electroencephalography (EEG); event-related potential (ERP); multisensory integration (MSI); somatosensory integration (SMI); subclinical neck pain (SCNP)	SENSORIMOTOR INTEGRATION; RISK-FACTORS; ROTATION; MANIPULATION; ATTENTION; FLEXION; HUMANS; INPUTS; TASK	Multisensory integration (MSI) is necessary for the efficient execution of many everyday tasks. Alterations in sensorimotor integration (SMI) have been observed in individuals with subclinical neck pain (SCNP). Altered audiovisual MSI has previously been demonstrated in this population using performance measures, such as reaction time. However, neurophysiological techniques have not been combined with performance measures in the SCNP population to determine differences in neural processing that may contribute to these behavioral characteristics. Electroencephalography (EEG) event-related potentials (ERPs) have been successfully used in recent MSI studies to show differences in neural processing between different clinical populations. This study combined behavioral and ERP measures to characterize MSI differences between healthy and SCNP groups. EEG was recorded as 24 participants performed 8 blocks of a simple reaction time (RT) MSI task, with each block consisting of 34 auditory (A), visual (V), and audiovisual (AV) trials. Participants responded to the stimuli by pressing a response key. Both groups responded fastest to the AV condition. The healthy group demonstrated significantly faster RTs for the AV and V conditions. There were significant group differences in neural activity from 100-140 ms post-stimulus onset, with the control group demonstrating greater MSI. Differences in brain activity and RT between individuals with SCNP and a control group indicate neurophysiological alterations in how individuals with SCNP process audiovisual stimuli. This suggests that SCNP alters MSI. This study presents novel EEG findings that demonstrate MSI differences in a group of individuals with SCNP.

Here, we present a BCI dataset that includes the three major BCI paradigms with a large number of subjects over multiple sessions. In addition, information about the psychological and physiological conditions of BCI users was obtained using a questionnaire, and task-unrelated parameters such as resting state, artifacts, and electromyography of both arms were also recorded. We evaluated the decoding accuracies for the individual paradigms and determined performance variations across both subjects and sessions. Furthermore, we looked for more general, severe cases of BCI illiteracy than have been previously reported in the literature. Results: Average decoding accuracies across all subjects and sessions were 71.1% (+/- 0.15), 96.7% (+/- 0.05), and 95.1% (+/- 0.09), and rates of BCI illiteracy were 53.7%, 11.1%, and 10.2% for MI, ERP, and SSVEP, respectively. Compared to the ERP and SSVEP paradigms, the MI paradigm exhibited large performance variations between both subjects and sessions. Furthermore, we found that 27.8% (15 out of 54) of users were universally BCI literate, i.e., they were able to proficiently perform all three paradigms. Interestingly, we found no universally illiterate BCI user, i.e., all participants were able to control at least one type of BCI system. Conclusions: Our EEG dataset can be utilized for a wide range of BCI-related research questions. All methods for the data analysis in this study are supported with fully open-source scripts that can aid in every step of BCI technology. Furthermore, our results support previous but disjointed findings on the phenomenon of BCI illiteracy.

In this paper Adaptive Noise Cancellers are implemented by utilizing gradient based algorithms, swarm-based algorithm and nature inspired algorithm which is Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO). To improve the ANC performance, an optimal weight value is calculated and GWO is used to update optimal weight value. Testing of an adaptive filter has been done through consideration of White Gaussian Noise (WGN) over sample input EEG signals at various SNR levels. The performance of the GWO algorithm is evaluated in terms of mean value, Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) in dB and correlation. A comparative analysis shows that proposed GWO technique gives better performance when compared with the gradient-based techniques like RLS, LMS and swarm-based technique like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The novelty of this proposed approach can be considered, as because first-time GWO is applied on denoising, EEG signals from the contaminated EEG signal, the result shows that extracting the desired EEG component is more effective in the proposed GWO method.

Besides mediating harsh lighting conditions, some evidence suggests that color-tinted lenses can influence how humans respond to emotional events. In this study, we systematically evaluated how color-tinted lenses modified our participants' psychophysiological responses to emotion-inducing images. The participants passively viewed pleasant, neutral or unpleasant images from the International-Affective-Picture-System (ZAPS), while wearing none, blue, red, yellow or green tinted-lenses that were controlled for luminance. Established neuroergonomic indices of arousal were measured on the autonomic level, namely Skin-ConductanceResponse (SCR) and Heart-Rate-Variability (HRV), and on the cortical level, with electroencephalography (EEG) event-related potentials (ERPs). Phasic SCR responses were significantly enhanced for unpleasant images and both pleasant and unpleasant images induced significantly larger ERP amplitudes of the Late-Positive-Potential (LPP), with pleasant images having the greatest impact. Interestingly, a significant main effect was found for tint. Similar to viewing pleasant images, red-tinted lenses induced the largest LPPs. Taken together, these findings suggest that the autonomic response to affective images is modulated at the cortical level of processing, congruent with the use of red-tinted lenses.

N400 plays an important role in the studies of cognitive science and clinical neuropsychology diseases. However, it is still a challenge to extract the N400 component from a few trials of electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Approach. A method was proposed to analyze the spatial and temporal-frequency patterns of N400 in this study. First, resampling-average difference was used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of N400 in EEG samples. Next, dictionary learning was utilized to adaptively select the wavelet bases corresponding to event-related potentials (ERPs) rather than spontaneous EEG activities and obtain the temporal-frequency patterns of ERPs. Finally, the low-rank constrained sparse decomposition was exploited to remove the spontaneous EEG activities and to learn the ERP spatial patterns, and the number of ERPs was also automatically determined. Simulation N400 datasets with different SNR levels and real N400 datasets of 15 subjects were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Main results. The results indicated that the proposed method accurately extracted the N400 component from a few trials of EEG data, and a significant difference of extracted N400 waveforms was observed between two experiment conditions. Significance. In the proposed method, the resampling-average difference significantly enhanced the SNR of EEG samples. Combined with the dictionary learning, the low-rank constrained sparse decomposition effectively removed the spontaneous EEG activities and automatically selected the correct ERP components.

It can be diagnosed using a combination of psychological tests. In addition to that, the brain activity of the patients can be analyzed using electroencephalography (EEG). The application of EEG tests requires the cooperation of the patients, which can be challenging in patients with ADHD. This paper describes the development of a system for stimuli generation, and acquisition and analysis of cognitive evoked potentials using the commercial system Emotiv EPOC+ headset. The results show that the system allows precise and reliable measurements of the P300 waves in children, and may provide a more comfortable experience for the patients compared to medical-grade systems.

In this study, with a rapid event-related simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near infrared spectroscopy recording in humans, we explored the potential contribution of anticipatory electrophysiological activation and hemodynamic activation by examining how anticipatory low-frequency oscillations and changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) concentration influence the subsequent event-related potential (ERP) marker of attentional selection. We found that expecting a target led to both a posterior lateralization of alpha-band (8-12 Hz) oscillation power and a lateralization of HbO response over the visual cortex. Importantly, the magnitude of cue-induced alpha lateralization was positively correlated with the nearby HbO lateralization in the visual cortex, and such a cue-induced alpha lateralization predicted the subsequent target-evoked N2pc amplitudes assumed to reflect attentional selection. Our results suggest that each individual's attentional selection biomarker as reflected by N2pc is predictable in advance via the anticipation-induced alpha lateralization, and such cue-induced alpha lateralization seems to play an important role in the functional coupling effects between the low-frequency EEG and the nearby hemodynamic activation.

Recently, single-trial ERP has been one of the main interests of researchers in the field of BCI and neuroscience. In this paper, an offline study which evaluated the feasibility of developing an online BCI guessing game, based on single-trial ERP, was presented. The objective was to determine the optimal methods and parameters needed to achieve high online classification accuracy and performance. Eight subjects participated in our experiments to collect the data for the offline study. Each subject had to choose one out of six cards displayed on a computer monitor. Three different algorithms of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) were used for classifying the cards into targets and non-targets. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) was applied as a spatial filter for the 16-channel data. Additionally, the data were analysed and classified per channel to deduce which channel reached the higher performance. The results proved the feasibility of the online application. The best performance was achieved with the personalised data and by taking the majority vote of the three LDA algorithms.

The detection of prediction errors, the discrepancies between experienced and anticipated outcomes, is thought to be a critical mechanism that drives new learning. Thirty-three typically developing pre-adolescents (mean age = 10.62 years) participated in an associative learning task in which they learned the probabilistic relationships between cues and outcome stimuli in the absence of explicit feedback. We investigated whether three outcome-locked event-related potentials (ERPs) could reflect prediction error processing: the P3, the late positive potential (LPP), and the feedback-related negativity (FRN). All ERP components investigated were sensitive to the magnitude of hypothetical prediction errors that were estimated based on each individual's learning performance. Higher estimated prediction errors generated larger P3 and LPP components, and a more negative FRN. These findings indicate that pre-adolescents are capable of undergoing probabilistic learning in the absence of explicit feedback, much in the same way as adults, and that prediction error processing is physiologically indexed via the FRN, P3 and LPP following outcome stimuli.

To increase our sense of physical immersion, for instance, vibrotactile gloves render the sense of touching, while electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) renders forces. Unfortunately, the established metric to assess the effectiveness of haptic devices relies on the user's subjective interpretation of unspecific, yet standardized, questions. Here, we explore a new approach to detect a conflict in visuo-haptic integration (e.g., inadequate haptic feedback based on poorly configured collision detection) using electroencephalography (EEG). We propose analyzing event-related potentials (ERPs) during interaction with virtual objects. In our study, participants touched virtual objects in three conditions and received either no haptic feedback, vibration, or vibration and EMS feedback. To provoke a brain response in unrealistic VR interaction, we also presented the feedback prematurely in 25% of the trials. We found that the early negativity component of the ERP (so called prediction error) was more pronounced in the mismatch trials, indicating we successfully detected haptic conflicts using our technique. Our results are a first step towards using ERPs to automatically detect visuo-haptic mismatches in VR, such as those that can cause a loss of the user's immersion.

By means of subjective psychophysical methods, quality of transmitted speech has been decomposed into three perceptual dimensions named 'discontinuity' (F), 'noisiness' (N) and 'coloration' (C). Previous studies using electroencephalography (EEG) already reported effects of perceived intensity of single quality dimensions on electrical brain activity. However, it has not been investigated so far, whether the dimensions themselves are dissociable on a neurophysiological level of analysis. Approach. Pursuing this goal in the present study, a high-quality (HQ) recording of a spoken word was degraded on each dimension at a time, resulting in three quality-impaired stimuli (F, N, C) which were on average described as being equal in perceived degradation intensity. Participants performed a three-stimulus oddball task, involving the serial presentation of different stimulus types: (1) HQ or degraded 'standard' stimuli to establish sensory/perceptual quality references. (2) Degraded 'oddball' stimuli to cause random, infrequent deviations from those references. EEG was employed to examine the neuro-electrical correlates of speech quality perception. Main results. Emphasis was placed on modulations in temporal and morphological characteristics of the P300 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP), whose subcomponents P3a and P3b are commonly linked to attentional orienting and task relevance categorization, respectively. Electrophysiological data analysis (N = 28) revealed significant modulations of P300 amplitude and latency by the perceptual dimensions underlying both quality references and oddball stimuli. Significance. The present study exemplifies the utility of physiological methods like EEG for dissociating speech degradations not only based on perceived intensity level, but also their distinctive quality dimension.

We provide an updated view of the cortical origins of evoked responses and discuss potential mechanisms contributing to ERP generation. In particular, we focus on the relationship between evoked and ongoing oscillatory activity and discuss the differences between ERPs and cortical activation as indexed by high-frequency activity in human intracranial electroencephalography (EEG). We highlight several possibilities for how ERPs can precisely index human perception and behavior in nontraditional approaches, such as neuronal entrainment through steady-state evoked potentials, multivariate decoding, and cross-frequency correlations. We argue that analyses of time-locked responses are beneficial to assess nonlinear and nonsinusoidal neuronal activity on a fine-grained temporal scale, since analyses in the time domain are less susceptible to artifacts than spectral decomposition techniques. Taken together, the current review provides a state-of-the-art overview of ERPs and their application in cognitive and clinical neurophysiology.

Performance of ANC will be improved by calculating the optimal weight value and proposed OWOA technique is used to update weight value. Adaptive filter's noise reduction capability has been tested through consideration of White Gaussian Noise (WGN) over contaminated EEG signals at various SNR levels (-10 dB, -15 dB and -20 dB). The performance of the proposed OWOA algorithm is assessed in terms of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) in dB, mean value, and the correlation between resultant and input ERP. In this work, ANCs are also implemented by utilizing conventional gradient-based techniques like Recursive Least Square (RLS), Least Mean Square (LMS) and other optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and WOA techniques. In average cases of noisy environment, comparative analysis shows that the proposed OWOA technique provides higher SNR value and significantly lower mean, and correlation as compared to gradient-based and swarm-based techniques. The comparative results show that extracting the desired EEG component is more effective in the proposed OWOA method. So, it has seen that OWOA-based noise reduction technique removing the artifacts and improving the quality of EEG signals significantly for biomedical analysis.

Most infant studies rely on the well-established and easy-to-use event-related brain potential (ERP). As a severe disadvantage, ERP computation requires a large number of repetitions of items from the same stimulus-category, compromising both ERPs' reliability and their ecological validity in infant research. We here explore a way to investigate infant continuous EEG responses to an ongoing, engaging signal (i.e., "neural tracking") by using multivariate temporal response functions (mTRFs), an approach increasingly popular in adult EEG research. N = 52 infants watched a 5-min episode of an age-appropriate cartoon while the EEG signal was recorded. We estimated and validated forward encoding models of auditory-envelope and visual-motion features. We compared individual and group-based ('generic') models of the infant brain response to comparison data from N = 28 adults. The generic model yielded clearly defined response functions for both, the auditory and the motion regressor. Importantly, this response profile was present also on an individual level, albeit with lower precision of the estimate but above-chance predictive accuracy for the modelled individual brain responses. In sum, we demonstrate that mTRFs are a feasible way of analyzing continuous EEG responses in infants. We observe robust response estimates both across and within participants from only 5 min of recorded EEG signal. Our results open ways for incorporating more engaging and more ecologically valid stimulus materials when probing cognitive, perceptual, and affective processes in infants and young children.

Previous studies have shown that such event-related potential (ERP) components as N400 and the late positivity (P600) are evoked in the auditory where semantic and syntactic anomalies occur. We used this knowledge to detect language expectation violation from single-trial EEGs by machine learning techniques. We recorded the brain activity of 18 participants while they listened to sentences that contained semantic and syntactic anomalies and identified the significant main effects of these anomalies in the ERP components.

A rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system relies on single-trial classification of event-related potentials (ERP) to categorize target and non-target images. The system works well in well-controlled laboratory settings; however, transitioning this approach into more dynamic, unconstrained environments poses several significant challenges. One major challenge is how to address the problem of session-to-session variability in EEG decoding. For a new session, a time-consuming and laborious calibration procedure is usually required to collect sufficient individual data for training a new classifier. This paper employed a subspace decomposition algorithm, Signal-to-noise ratio Maximizer for event-related potentials (SIM), to improve the session-to-session transfer performance of the RSVP-based BCI system. EEG data were collected from 17 subjects, each of whom performed two task sessions on two different days. Compared with the standard hierarchical discriminant component analysis (HDCA) algorithm, the classification performance was significantly improved by combining the SIM algorithm with the HDCA algorithm. The mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) across all subjects was improved from 0.7242 to 0.8546. The results suggest that the proposed approach efficiently obviates the session-to-session variability in task-related ERP signals and thereby facilitates system calibration of the RSVP-based BCIs.

Commercial EEG headsets often lead to a space-required or cost-expensive setup for obtaining simultaneous recordings of multiple subjects. The sparsity or immobility of their electrode placements may compromise their realistic applicability. Thus, this work developed a cost-efficient, portable, and customizable system to mitigate these constraints. The developed system implemented two core hardware infrastructures, including an event broadcaster and a dry electrode-compatible EEG amplifier by assembling entirely low-cost, off-the-shelf electronic components. The broadcaster allowed distribution of event markers to multiple EEG amplifiers concurrently, whereas the amplifier transmitted the digitized, event-synchronized EEG signals wirelessly. By conducting an oddball event-related potential (ERP) experiment with simultaneous recordings of three subjects on 10 days, the system reliably captured the time- and phase-locked ERP components (e.g., N100 and P300 amplitudes) by single-subject, multi-subject, and multi-day analytical approaches. The practicality and stability of the proposed system was empirically demonstrated in terms of the signal quality, EEG-event synchronization, and inter-amplifier coordination for a multi-subject setup. This work sheds light on how to economically facilitate and scale up multi-subject EEG computing for fundamental research and for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications in a larger subject population.

We filter EEG findings through a clinical lens, evaluating nuances in findings according to study criteria and participant characteristics. Within the EEG frequency domain, greater right than left parietal asymmetry in alpha band power is the most promising marker of PTSD symptoms and is linked to exaggerated physiological arousal that may impair filtering of environmental distractors. The most consistent findings within the EEG time domain focused on event related potentials (ERPs) include: 1) exaggerated frontocentral responses (contingent negative variation, mismatch negativity, and P3a amplitudes) to task-irrelevant distractors, and 2) attenuated parietal responses (P3b amplitudes) to task-relevant target stimuli. These findings suggest that some individuals with PTSD suffer from attention dysregulation, which could contribute to problems concentrating on daily tasks and goals in lieu of threatening distractors. Future research investigating the utility of alpha asymmetry and frontoparietal ERPs as diagnostic and predictive biomarkers or intervention targets are recommended.

Non-invasive physiological methods like electroencephalography (EEG) are increasingly employed to assess human information processing during exposure to multimedia signals. In the quality engineering field, previous research has promoted the utility of the P300 event-related brain potential (ERP) component for indicating variation in quality perception. The present study provides a starting point to test whether the P300 and its two subcomponents, P3a and P3b, are truly reflective of changes in the perceived quality of transmitted speech signals given the presence of other, quality-unrelated changes in acoustic stimulation. Approach. High-quality and degraded variants of spoken words were presented in a two-feature oddball task, which required participants to actively respond to rarely occurring 'target' stimuli within a series of frequent 'standard' stimuli, thereby eliciting ERP waveforms. Target presentations involved either single quality changes or concurrent double changes in quality and the initial phoneme. Main results. In case additional phonological change was present, only varying quality of standard stimuli caused significant modulations in P3a and P3b characteristics (N = 32). Thus, the formation of different short-term quality references exerted a persisting influence on the auditory processing of transmitted speech. Significance. The obtained results elucidate the importance of contextual and content-related influencing factors for proving the validity of the P300 as a psychophysiological indicator of speech quality change. Associated questions regarding the transfer of ERP-based quality assessment into more practically relevant measurement contexts are discussed.

Inferring Consumer Preferences From Single-Item Brain Potentials	FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention; preferences; decision-making; EEG; event-related potentials; consumer behavior; motivational relevance; neuromarketing	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY LOAD; POSITIVE SLOW-WAVE; NEURAL ACTIVITY; ATTENTION; EMOTION; EEG; RESPONSES; SIGNALS; METAANALYSIS	Recent research has shown that event-related brain potentials (ERPs) recorded while participants view lists of different consumer goods can be modulated by their preferences toward these products. However, it remains largely unknown whether ERP activity specific to a single consumer item can be informative about whether or not this item will be preferred in a shopping context. In this study, we examined whether single-item ERPs could reliably predict consumer preferences toward specific consumer goods. We recorded scalp EEG from 40 participants while they were viewing pictures of consumer goods and we subsequently asked them to indicate their preferences for each of these items. Replicating previous results, we found that ERP activity averaged over the six most preferred products was significantly differentiated from ERP activity averaged across the six least preferred products for three ERP components: The N200, the late positive potential (LPP) and positive slow waves (PSW). We also found that using single-item ERPs to infer behavioral preferences about specific consumer goods led to an overall predictive accuracy of 71%, although this figure varied according to which ERPs were targeted. Later positivities such as the LPP and PSW yielded relatively higher predictive accuracy rates than the frontal N200. Our results suggest that ERPs related to single consumer items can be relatively accurate predictors of behavioral preferences depending on which type of ERP effects are chosen by the researcher, and ultimately on the level of prediction errors that users choose to tolerate.

Assessing Feedback Response With a Wearable Electroencephalography System	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						applied neuroscience; EEG; P3; N2; FRN; brain computer interfaces	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; WIRELESS EEG; REWARD; OSCILLATIONS; NEGATIVITY; STIMULI	Background: Event related potential (ERP) components, such as P3, N2, and FRN, are potential metrics for assessing feedback response as a form of performance monitoring. Most research studies investigate these ERP components using clinical or research-grade electroencephalography (EEG) systems. Wearable EEGs, which are an affordable alternative, have the potential to assess feedback response using ERPs but have not been sufficiently evaluated. Feedback-related ERPs also have not been scientifically evaluated in interactive settings that are similar to daily computer use. In this study, a consumer-grade wearable EEG system was assessed for its feasibility to collect feedback-related ERPs through an interactive software module that provided an environment in which users were permitted to navigate freely within the program to make decisions. Methods: The recording hardware, which costs <$1,500 in total, incorporated the OpenBCI Cyton Board with Daisy chain, a consumer-grade EEG system that costs $949 USD. Seventeen participants interacted with an oddball paradigm and an interactive module designed to elicit feedback-related ERPs. The features of interests for the oddball paradigm were the P3 and N2 components. The features of interests for the interactive module were the P3, N2, and FRN components elicited in response to positive, neutral, and two types of negative feedback. The FRN was calculated by subtracting the positive feedback response from the negative feedback responses. Results: The P3 and N2 components of the oddball paradigm indicated statistically significant differences between infrequent targets and frequent targets which is in line with current literature. The P3 and N2 components elicited in the interactive module indicated statistically significant differences between positive, neutral, and negative feedback responses. There were no significant differences between the FRN types and significant interactions with channel group and FRN type. Conclusion: The OpenBCI Cyton, after some modifications, shows potential for eliciting and assessing P3, N2, and FRN components, which are important indicators for performance monitoring, in an interactive setting.

In particular, both the fNIRS data and ERP component of P300 were carefully inspected for participants from both the guilty group and innocent groups. During the performance of CIT task, a series of names were presented, which served as the target, irrelevant, or the probe stimuli for the two groups. The guilty participant who assumed himself (herself) as a spy was instructed to deny the recognition of probe (his (her) own name). Interestingly, we discovered that for the guilty group, the probe stimuli elicited significantly larger P300 at parietal site and also evoked significantly higher HbO concentration changes in bilateral superior frontal gyrus and bilateral middle frontal gyrus than the irrelevants stimuli. However, this is not the case for the innocent group, in which participants didn't exhibit significant difference in both ERP and fNIRS recordings between the probe and irrelevants stimuli cases. More importantly, our findings also indicated that the combined ERP and fNIRS signals can distinguish well between the guilty and innocent groups, in which AUC (the area under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) is 0.91 for deception detection based on the combined indicator, much higher than that based on ERP components P300 (0.85) or fNIRS signals (0.84).

User interaction via haptic stimuli within the YE is still unexplored for developing the BMI however, due to little understanding of cognitive processes related to such haptic interaction. Hence, we investigated a feasibility of estimating cognitive processes related to haptic interaction. Involved in the investigation, human participants undertook a task via different haptic stimuli (e.g., force and vibration) within a 3D YE. Their brain activities evoked by the stimuli were acquired as electroencephalography signals. Patterns of event-related potential and power spectral density were extracted from the signals, indicating activation in certain brain areas. The estimation of connectivity among these areas used directed transfer function, emphasizing on the middle of the beta band (14 similar to 30 Hz) in the signals. The emphasis was due to the band's association with active focus and thinking. We found that, while behavioral differences were unapparent, all vibration-related stimuli yielded distinct active brain areas and connectivity to form certain cognitive processes. The finding implied a potential of localizing the processes for BMI-based haptic interaction.

Conventional methods to diagnose cognitive decline (i.e., neuropsychological testing and clinical judgment) can lead to false positives. Tools such as electroencephalography (EEG) offer more refined, objective measures that index electrophysiological changes associated with healthy aging, MCI, and AD. Objective: We sought to review the EEG literature to determine whether visual event-related potentials (ERPs) can distinguish between healthy aging, MCI, and AD. Method: We searched Medline and PyscInfo for articles published between January 2005 and April 2018. Articles were considered for review if they included participants aged 60+ who were healthy older adults or people with MCI and AD, and examined at least one visually elicited ERP component. Results: Our search revealed 880 records, of which 34 satisfied the inclusion criteria. All studies compared cognitive function between at least two of the three groups (healthy older adults, MCI, and AD). The most consistent findings related to the P100 and the P3b; while the P100 showed no differences between groups, the P3b showed declines in amplitude in MCI and AD. Conclusion: Visually elicited ERPs can offer insight into the cognitive processes that decline in MCI and AD. The P3b may be useful in identifying older adults who may develop MCI and AD, and more research should examine the sensitivity and specificity of this component when diagnosing MCI and AD.

This sensitivity relies on statistical learning, the ability to detect predictable regularities in spatial and temporal sequences. Recent evidence has shown that infants can detect statistical regularities in action sequences they observe, but little is known about the neural process that give rise to this ability. In the current experiment, we combined electroencephalography (EEG) with eye-tracking to identify electrophysiological markers that indicate whether 8-11-month-old infants detect violations to learned regularities in action sequences, and to relate these markers to behavioral measures of anticipation during learning. In a learning phase, infants observed an actor performing a sequence featuring two deterministic pairs embedded within an otherwise random sequence. Thus, the first action of each pair was predictive of what would occur next. One of the pairs caused an action-effect, whereas the second did not. In a subsequent test phase, infants observed another sequence that included deviant pairs, violating the previously observed action pairs. Event-related potential (ERP) responses were analyzed and compared between the deviant and the original action pairs. Findings reveal that infants demonstrated a greater Negative central (Nc) ERP response to the deviant actions for the pair that caused the action-effect, which was consistent with their visual anticipations during the learning phase. Findings are discussed in terms of the neural and behavioral processes underlying perception and learning of structured action sequences.

Measures used to interpret these key aspects of HRI commonly include surveys, observations, and user interviews. In this preliminary work, we aim to extend previous research by exploring the use of electroencephalography (EEG) to augment our understanding of participants' responses to vulnerable robot behaviors. We tested this method by obtaining EEG data from participants while they interacted with a robotic tutor. The robotic tutor was designed to exhibit high vulnerability (HV) or low vulnerability (LV) behaviors similar to a previous HRI study. Our preliminary results show that event-related potentials (ERPs) may provide insights into participants' early affective processing of vulnerable robot behaviors.

The experiment was conducted in 20 healthy students (23.1 +/- 1.1 years, 10 women), using a 32 channel electroencephalography (EEG) montage system. The paradigm included geometric figures; a black square on a white background as a target and a white circle on a black background as a standard stimulus. We examined the maximal amplitude and latency of the P3b component at 18 electrode sites, as well as, temporal changes of scalp voltage distribution. We observed a non-equal spatial distribution of the visual ERP (event related potentials) waveforms on the scalp surface, with the highest P3b waveform observed over midline parietal areas and the lowest over frontal regions. Moreover, the spatial distribution of ERP signal on the scalp surface was more lateralized towards the right side in men and more centralized in women. Gender-related differences in P3b amplitude and latency were observed only in left hemisphere. Differences in P3b between men and women observed in our study arose not only from different P3b amplitudes and latencies, but also from the speed and character of P3b waveform fall, resulting in spatio-temporal amplitude changes. Moreover, the spatial distribution of the P200 potential also changed on the scalp differently in men and women. These results suggest that gender-related differences evoked in visual two-stimulus oddball paradigm, which engage attention processes, are complex and include spatio-temporal changes in P3b waveform generation, distribution, and suppression across the scalp.

However, we know little about the neural basis of the overlaps and distinctions between these disorders, particularly in young adulthood - a critical time window for brain plasticity across executive and socioemotional domains. Here, we systematically review 75 articles investigating ADHD and ASD in young adult samples (mean ages 16-26) using cognitive tasks, with neural activity concurrently measured via electroencephalography (EEG) - the most accessible neuroimaging technology. The majority of studies focused on event-related potentials (ERPs), with some beginning to capitalise on oscillatory approaches. Overlapping and specific profiles for ASD and ADHD were found mainly for four neurocognitive domains: attention processing, performance monitoring, face processing and sensory processing. No studies in this age group directly compared both disorders or considered dual diagnosis with both disorders. Moving forward, understanding of ADHD, ASD and their overlap in young adulthood would benefit from an increased focus on cross-disorder comparisons, using similar paradigms and in well-powered samples and longitudinal cohorts.

More recently the advances in medical imaging techniques have resulted in a better understanding of brain activity. These techniques (e.g. functional magnetic resonance imaging) have allowed researchers to generate applications that are based on the enhanced understanding of brain function. Detection of concealed information using brain activity is explored in this study as a better alternative to a Polygraph. Electroencephalography (EEG) allows decoding brain signals with a higher temporal resolution by applying smart signal processing techniques. In this work a commercial off the shelf wearable EEG headset is used to record brain signals in an information concealment testing environment. Although the use of such setup restricts the number of EEG channels available to the detection algorithm, but it provides portability and ease of use when compared to clinical EEG setup. The proposed algorithm is designed to give optimum results in terms of accuracy and computation time with emphasis on an easily deployable system.

Here, we intended to investigate these opposing developmental trajectories, to assess whether gains and losses early and late in life are associated with similar or different electrophysiological changes, and to get a better understanding about the development in middle-adulthood. We (re-)analyzed behavioral and electrophysiological data of 211 participants, who performed a colored Flanker task while their Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Participants were subdivided into six groups depending on their age, ranging from 8 to 83 years. We analyzed response speed and accuracy as well as the event replated potential (ERP) components P1 and N1, associated with visual processing and attention, N2 as marker of interference suppression and cognitive control, and P3 as a marker of cognitive updating and stimulus categorization. Response speed and accuracy were low early and later in life, with peak performance in young adults. Similarly, ERP latencies of all components and P1 and N1 amplitudes followed a u-shape pattern with shortest latencies and smallest amplitudes occurring in middle-age. N2 amplitudes were larger in children, and for incongruent stimuli in adults middle-aged and older. P3 amplitudes showed a parietal-to-frontal shift with age. Further, group-wise regression analyses suggested that children's performance depended on cognitive processing speed, while older adults' performance depended on cognitive resources. Together these results imply that different mechanisms restrict performance early and late in life and suggest a non-linear relationship between electrophysiological markers and performance in the Flanker task across the lifespan.

This paper attempts to provide a novel solution to this problem by utilizing Electroencephalography (EEG) technique. The acquired EEG signals of the subjects participating in the experiments undertaken are fed to an eLORETA software to examine the most active brain regions responsible for this cognitive activity. From eLORETA solutions, it is inferred that the frontal and the parietal lobes have enhanced activation during the said task. The signals obtained from the specific brain regions are further analyzed to investigate the presence of one specific (yet novel) Event Related Potential (ERP), called P1000. We found that P1000 is elicited when a subject is fully confident regarding the correctness or incorrectness of the options to a given question. However, when a subject is in ambiguity and attempts to guess a response, no significant ERP component is released. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based classifier is employed to classify the EEG response during selection of the alternatives to a question into 2 classes: confident and ambiguous on the basis of presence or absence of P1000 signal. The proposed classifier yields a classification accuracy of 98.34% during training phase and an accuracy of 94.54% during testing phase. Thus, the proposed method can effectively be utilized to detect subjects free from lack of confidence.

This review focuses on several components of the event-related potential (ERP) and how they can be successfully used to better understand subtle aspects of cognition that may be influenced by regular exercise participation. A select review of research that has incorporated ERPs to study the relationship between chronic exercise participation or cardiorespiratory fitness and cognitive function is presented followed by a brief overview of important methodological considerations when using the ERP technique. Future directions for the application of ERPs to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of chronic exercise on cognitive function are offered.

A number of researches around service science were indicated by the application of EEG experiment, for instance, the value structure of product service system, service value perception, the influence factors of online service purchase decision-making, consumer's cognitive and service purchase decisions, particularly the relationship between product and services in PSS. Event related potential (ERP) is a neuroscience method with the application of the change of EEG recorded by customers' reactions to a particular stimulus. The external stimuli through visual, auditory and other senses may induce relevant potentials and presented in the form of brain waves. Many functions and inducing conditions of ERP have been confirmed in psychological experiments, such as P300, P2, N270, N170, EPN, LPP, which has been currently applied in the research on consumer decision-making, service science and management.

Multiple mechanisms link prestimulus neural oscillations to sensory responses	ELIFE			English	Article							CURRENT SOURCE DENSITY; EEG ALPHA-ACTIVITY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; PHASE-RESET; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; EVOKED-RESPONSES; MU RHYTHM; POWER; BAND	Spontaneous fluctuations of neural activity may explain why sensory responses vary across repeated presentations of the same physical stimulus. To test this hypothesis, we recorded electroencephalography in humans during stimulation with identical visual stimuli and analyzed how prestimulus neural oscillations modulate different stages of sensory processing reflected by distinct components of the event-related potential (ERP). We found that strong prestimulus alpha- and beta-band power resulted in a suppression of early ERP components (C1 and N150) and in an amplification of late components (after 0.4 s), even after controlling for fluctuations in 1/f aperiodic signal and sleepiness. Whereas functional inhibition of sensory processing underlies the reduction of early ERP responses, we found that the modulation of non-zero-mean oscillations (baseline shift) accounted for the amplification of late responses. Distinguishing between these two mechanisms is crucial for understanding how internal brain states modulate the processing of incoming sensory information.

However, the selection of an appropriate method can be challenging and may depend on the type of data as well. In order to elaborate on this point, this manuscript investigates the impact of preprocessing on single-trial ERP detection. Method: This manuscript has investigated three scenarios for preprocessing ERP data: (1) ERP analysis without any preprocessing; (2) ERP analysis involving the amplitude-based artifact rejection method; (3) ERP analysis based on a combination of the amplitude-based artifact rejection and wavelet-enhanced independent component analysis (wICA) methods. In particular, the comparison of these preprocessing methods was based on a common machine learning (ML) framework. Therefore, the three different preprocessing methods could be compared. Also, three different classifiers (i.e., logistic regression (LR), k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and support vector machine (SVM)) were compared as well. In addition, the performance metrics utilized for this purpose were the single-trials classification recognition, precision and recall. The proposed ML framework involved the general sub-blocks of feature extraction, feature selection, classification and validation (10-fold cross-validation). The proposed ML framework was aimed to classify the single trials event-related potentials (ERPs) such as P300 (target) vs non-P300 (non-target). Results: The maximum classification accuracy was achieved for scenario 3 as described above, i.e., the combination of amplitude-based artifact rejection and wICA methods.

The same algorithm enables detecting a subjectively important item (i.e., one triggering emotional response) in an environment even without actively drawing attention to it. Such systems allow assessing the personal significance of certain information, which can be used in the diagnostics of disorders of emotional perception or value system, e.g., eating disorders. This study aimed to investigate the EEG responses of anorexia nervosa patients (diagnosis F50.0, n = 12, age 11-16 years) to the stimuli with different perceived emotional significance, as well as to validate application of P300 BCI to detect the focus of attention to subjectively important stimuli. The inclusion criteria were: diagnosed anorexia nervosa (diagnosis F50.0); active rehabilitation. We registered the EEG while presenting images with different content to the patients. The event-related potentials (ERP) were detected and analyzed with the help of MATLAB 7.1 (MathWorks; USA). Statistica 7.0 software (StatSoft; USA) was used for statistical analysis of the data. We have discovered that in passive viewing paradigm, images of body parts of emaciated people among other images caused ERP with higher amplitude than images of food. Moreover, the accuracy of detection was higher for images of body parts: 89% against 59%, respectively. Thus, we have proven the validity of applying P300 BCI to detect covert emotional foci of attention and added to the existing knowledge about the mechanisms of development of anorexia nervosa.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) population have been extensively studied using the time-domain representation of signals but time-frequency domain techniques are less explored. Although, adult ADHD is a proven disorder, most of the electrophysiological studies have focused only on children with ADHD. Methods. ERP data of 35 university students with ADHD and 35 control adults were recorded during visual continuous performance task (CPT). Gray level co-occurrence matrix-based texture features were extracted from time-frequency (t-f) images of event-related EEG epochs. Different ERP components measures, that is, amplitudes and latencies corresponding to N1, N2, and P3 components were also computed relative to standard and target stimuli. Results. Texture analysis has shown that the mean value of contrast, dissimilarity, and difference entropy is significantly reduced in adults with ADHD than in control adults. The mean correlation and homogeneity in adults with ADHD were significantly increased as compared with control adults. ERP components analysis has reported that adults with ADHD have reduced N1 amplitude to target stimuli, reduced N2 and P3 amplitude to both standard and target stimuli than controls. Conclusions. The differences in texture features obtained from t-f images of ERPs point toward altered information processing in adults with ADHD during a cognitive task. Findings of reduction in N1, N2, and P3 components highlight deficits of early sensory processing, stimulus categorization, and attentional resources, respectively, in adults with ADHD.

In an implicit HCI context, the computer interprets human physiological and behavioral data as its input, enabling the development of cognition-aware computing for the user state monitoring. In this work, we made a first step towards development of the cognition-aware computing in the industrial environments, through the introduction of a sensitive workplace. For this, we replicated the real-life workplace and equipped it with wearable electroencephalography (EEG) and motion sensor (Kinect) recording. We further investigated interaction between brain dynamics, as reflected in P300 event-related potential (ERP) component amplitude and engagement index (El), and behavioral modalities of movement energy, all of which reflects the user state. The ultimate goal of the study is a proposal of the system for on-line detection of deviations in user state, ultimately preventing operators' errors and improving working experience.

Recent advances in home automation and the Internet of things may extend the horizon of BCI applications into daily living environments at home. In this study, we developed an online BCI based on scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to control home appliances. The BCI users controlled TV channels, a digital door-lock system, and an electric light system in an unshielded environment. The BCI was designed to harness P300 and N200 components of event-related potentials (ERPs). On average, the BCI users could control TV channels with an accuracy of 83.0% +/- 17.9%, the digital door-lock with 78.7% +/- 16.2% accuracy, and the light with 80.0% +/- 15.6% accuracy, respectively. Our study demonstrates a feasibility to control multiple home appliances using EEG-based BCIs.

BCI is currently most growing field in the research area. BCI applications have different field such as medical, education, neuroergonomics, self-regulation, games and entertainment, production, security as well as marketing. Electronic devices can be controlled using brain signal called electroencephalography (EEG) to record electrical activity of the brain. The P300 wave is a positive peak of an event related potential (ERP) that occurs 300ms recorded by EEG. One major approach in the BCI research field is the P300 based oddball paradigm, subjects identify infrequent target stimuli within a series of rapid presented standard stimuli. The P300-speller is a widely used BCI system that allows users to communicate characters by focused attention. In our study, we are focusing on BCI system architecture different applications of BCI specifically P300 speller which classifies P300 waves and recognize targeted character, on the dataset II of the third BCI competition.

In particular, the statistical properties of summary metrics in this area are crucial. We draw on event-related potential (ERP) studies, a field with a relatively long history of collecting and analyzing such data, to illustrate our points. In particular, three summary measures for a component in the average ERP waveform feature prominently in the literature: the maximum (or peak amplitude), the average (or mean amplitude) and a combination (or adaptive mean). We discuss the methodological divide associated with these summary measures. Through both analytic work and simulation study, we explore the properties (e.g., Type I and Type II errors) of these competing metrics for assessing the amplitude of an ERP component across experimental conditions. The theoretical and simulation-based arguments in this article illustrate how design (e.g., number of trials per condition) and analytic (e.g., window location) choices affect the behavior of these amplitude summary measures in statistical tests and highlight the need for transparency in reporting the analytic steps taken. There is an increased need for analytic tools for waveform data. As new analytic methods are developed to address these time-intensive longitudinal data, careful treatment of the statistical properties of summary metrics used for null hypothesis testing is crucial.

Methods: Sixteen male subjects (24 +/- 1 yr.) participated in the study. Whole-body hyperthermia was induced with Finnish sauna bathing. Before and 90 min after the sauna, resting electroencephalography (EEG) for spectral analysis and EEG event-related potentials (ERPs) during oddball tasks by two modalities (auditory and visual) were recorded. Results: Sauna bathing increased rectal temperature (T-re, 37.11 +/- 0.33 degrees C to 38.84 +/- 0.32 degrees C) and heart rate (HR, 65.63 +/- 9.39 bpm to 151.0 +/- 21.8 bpm). At 90 min after the sauna, T-re (37.00 +/- 0.29 degrees C) and HR (72.1 +/- 2.80 bpm) recovered to baseline levels. An increase was found in alpha power following sauna recovery. In the visual task modality, post-sauna recovery led to enhancement in the N2 amplitude with centroparietal distribution and decreases in P3 amplitude with distribution along the frontoparietal axis for executive motor-cognitive processing. In the auditory task modality, post-sauna recovery led to a decrease in P3 amplitude with a frontoparietal distribution and this change was accompanied by auditory N2 amplitude enhancement along the centroparietal distribution for non-target cognitive processing. No significant differences in task performance were found. Conclusion: Post-sauna recovery to normothermia led to enhanced resting neural network relaxation followed by increases in cognitive processing economy for the given oddball tasks. The auditory processing was not affected more by post-sauna recovery than was visual processing. Post-sauna recovery modifications in ERP components (stimulus processing) were insufficient to affect cognitive performance in both visual and auditory task modalities.

Traditionally, clinical EEG has been analyzed in terms of temporal waveforms, looking at rhythms in spontaneous activity, subjectively identifying troughs and peaks in Event-Related Potentials (ERP), or by studying graphoelements in pathological sleep stages. Additionally, the discipline of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) requires new methods to decode patterns from non-invasive EEG signals. This field is developing alternative communication pathways to transmit volitional information from the Central Nervous System. The technology could potentially enhance the quality of life of patients affected by neurodegenerative disorders and other mental illness. This work mimics what electroencephalographers have been doing clinically, visually inspecting, and categorizing phenomena within the EEG by the extraction of features from images of signal plots. These features are constructed based on the calculation of histograms of oriented gradients from pixels around the signal plot. It aims to provide a new objective framework to analyze, characterize and classify EEG signal waveforms. The feasibility of the method is outlined by detecting the P300, an ERP elicited by the oddball paradigm of rare events, and implementing an offline P300-based BCI Speller. The validity of the proposal is shown by offline processing a public dataset of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients and an own dataset of healthy subjects.

A Single-Channel EEG-Based Approach to Detect Mild Cognitive Impairment via Speech-Evoked Brain Responses	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalography; event-related potential; mild cognitive impairment; speech-evoked brain responses	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MEMORY IMPAIRMENT; CLASSIFICATION; STEM; PERCEPTION; NETWORKS; P300; MMN	Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the preliminary stage of dementia, which may lead to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the elderly people. Therefore, early detection of MCI has the potential to minimize the risk of AD by ensuring the proper mental health care before it is too late. In this paper, we demonstrate a single-channel EEG-based MCI detectionmethod, which is cost-effective and portable, and thus suitable for regular home-based patient monitoring. We collected the scalp EEG data from 23 subjects, while they were stimulated with five auditory speech signals. The cognitive state of the subjects was evaluated by the Montreal cognitive assessment test (MoCA). We extracted 590 features from the event-related potential (ERP) of the collected EEG signals, which included time and spectral domain characteristics of the response. The top 25 features, ranked by the random forestmethod, were used for classification models to identify subjects with MCI. Robustness of our model was tested using leave-one-out cross-validation while training the classifiers. Best results (leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy 87.9%, sensitivity 84.8%, specificity 95%, and F score 85%) were obtained using support vectormachine (SVM) methodwith radial basis kernel (RBF) (sigma = 10/cost = 10(2)). Similar performances were also observedwith logistic regression (LR), further validating the results. Our results suggest that single-channel EEG could provide a robust biomarker for early detection of MCI.

Electroencephalography can reveal neural mechanisms underlying language impairment in ASD, potentially improving our ability to predict language outcomes and target interventions. Verbal (V) and MV children with ASD, along with an age-matched typically developing (TD) group participated in a semantic congruence ERP paradigm, during which pictures were displayed followed by the expected or unexpected word. An N400 effect was evident in all groups, with a shorter latency in the TD group. A late negative component (LNC) also differentiated conditions, with a group by condition by region interaction. Post hoc analyses revealed that the LNC was present across multiple regions in the TD group, in the mid-frontal region in MVASD, and not present in the VASD group. Cluster analysis identified subgroups within the ASD participants. Two subgroups showed markedly atypical patterns of processing, one with reversed but robust differentiation of conditions, and the other with initially reversed followed by typical differentiation. Findings indicate that children with ASD, including those with minimal language, showed EEG evidence of semantic processing, but it was characterized by delayed speed of processing and limited integration with mental representations.

Traditionally, the sensitivity of EEG to cerebellar activity has been considered limited with the electrical potentials assumed to stem from cortical pyramidal cells. This study leverages recent work examining the structure, organization, and synchrony of purkinje neurons to promote local field potentials measured by EEG. In conjunction with high fidelity EEG recording and source imaging analysis we examined the feasibility of using current EEG systems to characterize cerebellar function in a series of simple motor tasks. Distributed source imaging analysis revealed consistent task-related cerebellar activity across subjects whose time course was consistent with cerebellar involvement for the control of voluntary movement. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using current EEG systems and source imaging techniques to resolve activity in the cerebellum that is distinct from task-related activity in cortex.

The first method, named "multichannel EEG thresholding by similarity" (METS), simultaneously denoises all of the information recorded by the channels. The second approach, named "semblance-based ERP window selection" (SEWS), presents two versions to automatically localize the ERP in time for each subject to reduce the time window to be analysed by removing useless features. We empirically show that when these methods are used independently, they are suitable for ERP denoising and feature extraction. Meanwhile, the combination of both methods obtains better results compared to using them independently. The denoising algorithm was compared with classic thresholding methods based on wavelets and was found to obtain better results, which shows its suitability for ERP processing. The combination of the two algorithms for denoising the signals and selecting the time window has been compared to xDAWN, which is an efficient algorithm to enhance ERPs. We conclude that our wavelet-based semblance method performs better than xDAWN for single-trial detection in the presence of artifacts or noise.

In this study, we used event-related potential (ERP) to assess whether brain injury impacts the ability to process different emotional prosodies (happy, fear, and neutral) in neonates; whether the ERP measure has potential value for the evaluation of neurodevelopmental outcome in later childhood. A total of 42 full-term neonates were recruited from the neonatology department of Peking University First Hospital from June 2014 to January 2015. They were assigned to the brain injury group (n = 20) or control group (n = 22) according to their clinicalmanifestations, physical examinations, cranial images and routine EEG outcomes. Using an oddball paradigm, ERP data were recorded while subjects listened to happy (20%, deviation stimulus), fearful (20%, deviation stimulus) and neutral (80%, standard stimulus) prosodies to evaluate the potential prognostic value of ERP indexes for neurodevelopment at 30 months of age. Results showed that while the mismatch responses (MMRs) at the frontal lobe were larger for fearful than happy prosody in control neonates, this difference was not observed in neonates with brain injuries. This finding suggests that perinatal brain injury may influence the cognitive ability to process different emotional prosodies in neonatal brain; this deficit could be reflected by decreased MMR amplitudes in response to fearful prosody. Moreover, the decreased MMRs at the frontal lobe was associated with impaired neurodevelopment at 30 months old.

J	Ehrlich, SK; Cheng, G				Ehrlich, Stefan K.; Cheng, Gordon			A Feasibility Study for Validating Robot Actions Using EEG-Based Error-Related Potentials	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ROBOTICS			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Passive brain-computer interface (BCI); Error-related potentials (ErrP); Event-related potentials (ERP); Error monitoring; Human-robot interaction (HRI)	ERP COMPONENTS; SYSTEM; CLASSIFICATION; ATTENTION; CORTEX; P600	Validating human-robot interaction can be a challenging task, especially in cases in which the robot designer is interested in the assessment of individual robot actions within an ongoing interaction that should not be interrupted by intermittent surveys. In this paper, we propose a neuro-based method for real-time quantitative assessment of robot actions. The method encompasses the decoding of error-related potentials (ErrPs) from the electroencephalogram (EEG) of a human during interaction with a robot, which could be a useful and intuitive complement to existing methods for validating human-robot interaction in the future. To demonstrate usability, we conducted a study in which we examined EEG-based ErrPs in response to a humanoid robot displaying semantically incorrect actions in a simplistic HRI task. Furthermore, we conducted a procedurally identical control experiment with computer screen-based symbolic cursor action. The results of our study confirmed decodeability of ErrPs in response to incorrect robot actions with an average accuracy of 69.0 +/- 7.9% across 11 subjects. Cross-comparisons of ErrPs between experimental tasks revealed high temporal and topographical similarity, but more distinct signals in response to the cursor action and, as a result, better decodeability with a mean accuracy of 90.6 +/- 3.9%. This demonstrated that ErrPs can be sensitive to the stimulus eliciting them despite procedurally identical protocols. Re-using ErrP-decoders across experimental tasks without re-calibration is accompanied by significant performance losses and therefore not recommended. Overall, the outcomes of our study confirm feasibility of ErrP-decoding for human-robot validation, but also highlight challenges to overcome in order to enhance usability of the proposed method.

Despite this divergent pattern, few have asked how the use of these emotion-regulation strategies relates to reward responsivity. We predicted that elevated suppression would be associated with blunted reward responsivity, whereas reappraisal would be associated with elevated reward responsivity. To test this hypothesis, participants completed a measure of individual differences in emotion-regulation strategies, measures of self-reported reward responsivity, and then a reward time-estimation task (Kotani a al., 2003) while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Results revealed that individual differences in cognitive reappraisal were unrelated to self-report measures of reward responsivity, whereas suppression was associated with blunted reward responsivity. At the neural level, reappraisal was associated with greater attention to the rewarding cues, as indexed by the P300 event-related potential (ERP) component, whereas suppression was related to blunted reward anticipation, as indexed by the stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN) ERP component. Suppression prospectively predicted worse psychological well-being 2.5 years later and blunted neural reward anticipation partially explained this association. Taken together with past research, these results suggest reappraisal tendencies may lead to better outcomes due, in part, to enhanced reward responsivity, whereas the negative consequences of suppression may be associated with blunted reward responsivity.

However, there is still no objective and universal index for diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Many researchers have studied language processing in schizophrenia since most of the patients show symptoms related to language processing, such as thought disorder, auditory verbal hallucinations, or delusions. Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) with millisecond order high temporal resolution, have been applied to reveal the abnormalities in language processing in schizophrenia. The aims of this review are (a) to provide an overview of recent findings in language processing in schizophrenia with EEG and MEG using neurophysiological indices, providing insights into underlying language related pathophysiological deficits in this disease and (b) to emphasize the advantage of EEG and MEG in research on language processing in schizophrenia.

The cognitive profiles of individuals with ASD are varied, and the neurophysiological underpinnings of these developmental difficulties are unclear. While many studies have focused on overall group differences in the amplitude or latency of event related potential (ERP) responses, recent research suggests that increased intra-subject neural variability may also be a reliable indicator of atypical brain function in ASD. This study aimed to identify behavioral and neural variability responses during an emotional inhibitory control task in children with ASD compared to typically developing (TD) children. Children with ASD showed increased variability in response to both inhibitory and emotional stimuli, evidenced by greater reaction time variability and single-trial ERP variability of N200 and N170 amplitudes and/or latencies compared to TD children. These results suggest that the physiological basis of ASD may be more accurately explained by increased intra-subject variability, in addition to characteristic increases or decreases in the amplitude or latency of neural responses.

Lay Summary The cognitive functions including memory, attention, executive functions, and perception, of individuals with ASD are varied, and the physiological underpinnings of these profiles are unclear. In this study, children with ASD showed increased intra-subject neural and behavioral variability in response to an emotional inhibitory control task compared to typically developing children. These results suggest that the physiological basis of ASD may also be explained by increased behavioral and neural variability in people with ASD, rather than simply characteristic increases or decreases in averaged brain responses.

Here we employ mobile EEG to characterise the allocation of attention across multiple sensory-cognitive processing demands during naturalistic movement. We used a neural marker of attention, the Event-Related Potential (ERP) P300 effect, to show that attention to targets is reduced when human participants walk compared to when they stand still. In a second experiment, we show that this reduction in attention is not caused by the act of walking per se. A third experiment identified the independent processing demands driving reduced attention to target stimuli during motion. ERP data reveals that the reduction in attention seen during walking reflects the linear and additive sum of the processing demands produced by visual and inertial stimulation. The mobile cognition approach used here shows how limited resources are precisely re-allocated according to the sensory processing demands that occur during real-world behaviour.

As a solution to this problem, a new data-driven segmentation method for recordings obtained through electroencephalography (EEG) is presented. Methods: The proposed method utilizes singular value decomposition (SVD) to identify the time intervals in the EEG recordings during which the spatial distribution of clusters of active cortical neurons remains quasi-stationary. Theoretical analysis shows that the spatial locality features of these clusters can be, asymptotically, captured by the most significant left singular subspace of the EEG data. A reference/sliding window approach is employed to dynamically extract this feature subspace, and the running projection error is monitored for significant changes using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Results: Simulation results, for a wide range of possible scenarios regarding the spatial distribution of active cortical neurons, show that the algorithm is successful in accurately detecting the segmental structure of the simulated EEG data. The algorithm is also applied to experimental EEG recordings of a modified visual oddball task. Results identify a unique sequence of dynamic patterns in the event-related potential (ERP) response to each of the three involved stimuli. Conclusion: The proposed method, without using source localization methods or scalp topographical maps, is able to identify intervals of quasi-stationarity in the EEG recordings. Significance: The proposed segmentation technique can offer new insights on the dynamics of functional organization of the brain in action.

This study intended to explore the effect of 3D presentation of visual stimuli on P300-speller in VR. Four different presentation paradigms, including three 3D paradigms and one two-dimension (2D) paradigm, were adopted. These 3D paradigms formed 3D visual stimuli by presenting depth information in character intensifications dynamically. The features of event-related potentials (ERP) and the spelling performance were analyzed, and the results showed that the electroencephalograph (EEG) class discriminant and accuracy of the 3D paradigm were superior to the 2D paradigm. Especially the two paradigms, Different depth information Array Character Flash (DACF) paradigm and Same depth information Array Character Jump (SACJ) paradigm, were recommended.

Traditional tests for coma outcome prediction are based mainly on a set of clinical observations. Recently, certain event-related potentials (ERPs), which are transient electroencephalogram (EEG) responses to auditory, visual or tactile stimuli, have been introduced as useful predictors of a positive coma outcome (ie, emergence). However, such tests require the skills of clinical neurophysiologists, who are not commonly available in many clinical settings. Additionally, none of the current standard clinical approaches have sufficient predictive accuracies to provide definitive prognoses. Objective The objective of this study is to develop improved machine learning procedures based on EEG/ERP for determining emergence from coma. Methods and analysis Data will be collected from 50 participants in coma. EEG/ERP data will be recorded for 24 consecutive hours at a maximum of five time points spanning 30 days from the date of recruitment to track participants' progression. The study employs paradigms designed to elicit brainstem potentials, middle-latency responses, N100, mismatch negativity, P300 and N400. In the case of patient emergence, data are recorded on that occasion to form an additional basis for comparison. A relevant data set will be developed from the testing of 20 healthy controls, each spanning a 15-hour recording period in order to formulate a baseline. Collected data will be used to develop an automated procedure for analysis and detection of various ERP components that are salient to prognosis. Salient features extracted from the ERP and resting-state EEG will be identified and combined to give an accurate indicator of prognosis. Ethics and dissemination This study is approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board (project number 4840). Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal articles and presentations at scientific conferences.

However, the specificity of this activation to semantic unification remains unknown. To more closely examine the brain processes involved in semantic unification, we employed simultaneous EEG-fMRI to time-lock the semantic unification related N400 change, and integrated trial-by-trial variation in both N400 and BOLD change beyond the condition-level BOLD change difference measured in traditional fMRI analyses. Participants read sentences in which semantic unification load was parametrically manipulated by varying doze probability. Separately, ERP and fMRI results replicated previous findings, in that semantic unification load parametrically modulated the amplitude of N400 and cortical activation. Integrated EEG-fMRI analyses revealed a different pattern in which functional activity in the left IFG and bilateral supramarginal gyrus (SMG) was associated with N400 amplitude, with the left IFG activation and bilateral SMG activation being selective to the condition level and trial-level of semantic unification load, respectively. By employing the EEG-fMRI integrated analyses, this study among the first sheds light on how to integrate trial-level variation in language comprehension.

Theoretical frameworks detailing how variations in stimulus features that create overlaps between response categories can affect action control, like the Theory of Event Coding (TEC), have not been transferred to inhibitory control. We present a novel Go/Nogo paradigm in which we varied stimulus feature overlap between Go and Nogo trials. To examine what cognitive-neurophysiological subprocesses and functional neuroanatomical structures are modulated by stimulus-response feature overlap and recoding during inhibitory control, we combine event-related potential (ERP) recordings with source localization analyses. We show that response inhibition was compromised when stimulus features overlapped between Go and Nogo trials. The EEG data show that the recoding of stimulus-response mappings induced by such a stimulus feature overlaps affects subprocesses from perceptual gating/categorization (P1 ERP-component) to pre-motor inhibition (Nogo-N2 ERP-component) and motor inhibition (Nogo-P3 ERP-component). Although these are distinct processes, overlapping neuronal structures are associated with these modulations. The cascade of processes starts in the superior frontal cortex and is associated with perceptual categorization mechanisms. Subsequently, pre-motor inhibition or stimulus-response unbinding processes are modulated in parahippocampal structures before stimulus-response rebinding and motor inhibition is accomplished in parahippocampal and superior frontal structures. The study shows how perceptual processes can affect response inhibition using a theoretical framework, which has, until now, not been brought into connection with inhibitory control and establishes links between neurophysiology and functional neuroanatomy of inhibitory control with the TEC framework.

To date, several studies have shown the presence of ErrP under various task situations. However, in the context of assist-as-needed methods, the existence of ErrP is unexplored. Therefore, the principal objective of this study is to determine if an ErrP can be evoked when a subject is unable to complete a physical exercise in a given time. Fifteen stroke patients participated in an experiment that involved performing a physical rehabilitation exercise. Results showed that the electroencephalographic (EEG) response of the trials, where patients failed to complete the exercise, against the trials, where patients successfully completed the exercise, significantly differ from each other, and the resulting difference of event-related potentials resembles the previously reported ErrP signals as well as has some unique features. Along with the highly statistically significant difference, the trials differ in time-frequency patterns and scalp distribution maps. In summary, the results of the study provide a novel basis for the detection of the failure against the success events while executing rehabilitation exercises that can be used to improve the state-of-the-art robot-assisted rehabilitation methods.

Neuroergonomics Applications of Electroencephalography in Physical Activities: A Systematic Review	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						EEG; neuroergonomics; ergonomics; physical exercise; physical activity; physical exertion; brain; human factors	AEROBIC EXERCISE; EEG ACTIVITY; CORTICAL POTENTIALS; EXHAUSTIVE EXERCISE; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; PERCEIVED EXERTION; HUMAN-PERFORMANCE; MENTAL PRACTICE; MUSCLE FATIGUE; BRAIN ACTIVITY	Recent years have seen increased interest in neuroergonomics, which investigates the brain activities of people engaged in diverse physical and cognitive activities at work and in everyday life. The present work extends upon prior assessments of the state of this art. However, here we narrow our focus specifically to studies that use electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brain activity, correlates, and effects during physical activity. The review uses systematically selected, openly published works derived from a guided search through peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings. Identified studies were then categorized by the type of physical activity and evaluated considering methodological and chronological aspects via statistical and content-based analyses. From the identified works (n = 110), a specific number (n = 38) focused on less mobile muscular activities, while an additional group (n = 22) featured both physical and cognitive tasks. The remainder (n = 50) investigated various physical exercises and sporting activities and thus were here identified as a miscellaneous grouping. Most of the physical activities were isometric exertions, moving parts of upper and lower limbs, or walking and cycling. These primary categories were sub-categorized based on movement patterns, the use of the event-related potentials (ERP) technique, the use of recording methods along with EEG and considering mental effects. Further information on subjects' gender, EEG recording devices, data processing, and artifact correction methods and citations was extracted. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the findings from various studies, statistical analyses were not performed. These were thus included in a descriptive fashion. Finally, contemporary research gaps were pointed out, and future research prospects to address those gaps were discussed.

Type II diabetes is also closely related to brain recognition, so it is extremely necessary to diagnose the patient's cognition as early as possible. Among them, the event-related potential (ERP) based on electroencephalogram (EEG) is an important research method. In order to diagnose the disease more accurately, machine learning has been widely used. However, deep learning still has a broad application space. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) is high-performance model for deep learning. In this study, we constructed a Daul input encoder convolutional neural network (DIE-CNN) for event related potential (ERP) data with type 2 diabetes. In experiments with multiple models, DIE -CNN performed optimally. The results show that DIE-CNN is an effective method to diagnose the condition of the subject, and the method also retains the expansion space to build a more complex comprehensive evaluation system.

Detecting the neural correlates of episodic memory with mobile EEG: Recollecting objects in the real world	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Mobile EEG; Event-Related Potentials (ERPs); Episodic memory; Familiarity; Recollection; Late posterior negativity (LPN)	LATE POSTERIOR NEGATIVITY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; RETRIEVAL; ERP; CONTEXT; FAMILIARITY; STATISTICS; IMAGERY	Episodic memory supports recognition of the details of complex real world experiences, providing a continuous record of events embedded within spatial and temporal context. Despite the inherently dynamic nature of real events, the bulk of neuroscientific research to date examines recognition in absence of the detailed contextual information that is known to be a defining characteristic. Given the importance of environmental context for episodic memory, examining ERP correlates of memory in more naturalistic settings is vital for progress in understanding how retrieval operates in daily life. The current study capitalized on recent advances in mobile EEG technology to address this issue and is the first to investigate ERP correlates of episodic retrieval in real world contexts. Participants were guided around a pre-defined route inside a building on campus, while performing a recognition memory task, which paired images of objects with actual physical locations in the building to provide context. Importantly, the findings clearly demonstrate that it is possible to observe reliable neural correlates of memory in real world contexts. Replicating two well established ERP correlates of episodic retrieval reported in prior laboratory based studies, we detected FN400 old/new effects traditionally associated with familiarity between 300 and 500 ms, and a late posterior negativity (LPN) often linked to reconstructive processing or evaluation of retrieval outcomes between 500 and 800 ms. Moreover, the FN400 effect was found to be sensitive to retrieval of context, with more sustained effects for objects encountered in a different context at study and test. Overall, the current work highlights the power of mobile EEG technology for examining complex cognitive functions in more naturalistic real world settings.

We used data from 79 healthy participants with EEG referenced to mastoid average and investigated the detection rate of auditory N400 effect in single-subject analysis using five methods: visual inspection of participant-wise averaged ERPs, analysis of variance (ANOVA) for amplitude averages in a time window, cluster-based non-parametric testing, a novel Bayesian approach and Studentized continuous wavelet transform (t-CWT). Visual inspection by three independent raters yielded N400 effect detection in 85% of the participants in at least one paradigm (active responding or passive listening), whereas ANOVA identified the effect in 68%, the cluster-method in 59%, the Bayesian method in 89%, and different versions of t-CWT in 22-59% of the participants. Thus, the Bayesian method was the most liberal and also showed the greatest concordance between the experimental paradigms (active/passive). ANOVA detected significant effect only in cases with converging evidence from other methods. The t-CWT and cluster-based method were the most conservative methods. As we show in the current study, different analysis methods provide results that do not completely overlap. The method of choice for determining the presence of an ERP component at single-subject level thus remains unresolved. Relying on a single statistical method may not be sufficient for drawing conclusions on single-subject ERPs.

A number of features are extracted from an online EEG dataset with 81 subjects, including 32 healthy controls and 49 Schizophrenia patients. The EEG signals are preprocessed and since the dataset is relatively small, the random forest machine learning algorithm is chosen to be applied on different combinations of feature sets for classification. It is found that the classification accuracy can be improved by adding certain features extracted from EEG signals.

One of the methods frequently applied for assessing interoceptive sensitivity is the heartbeat discrimination task, where individuals judge whether the timing of external stimuli (e.g., tones) are synchronized to their own heartbeat. Despite its extensive use in research, the neural dynamics underlying the temporal matching between interoceptive and exteroceptive stimuli in this task have remained unclear. The present study used electroencephalography (EEG) to examine the neural responses of healthy participants who performed a heartbeat discrimination task. We analyzed the differences between EEG responses to tones, which were likely to be perceived as "heartbeat-synchronous" (200 ms delayed from the R wave) or "heartbeat-asynchronous" (0 ms delayed). Possible associations of these neural differentiations with task performance were also investigated. Compared with the responses to heartbeat-asynchronous tones, heartbeat-synchronous tones caused a relative decrease in early gamma-band EEG response and an increase in later P2 event-related potential (ERP) amplitude. Condition differences in the EEG/ERP measures were not significantly correlated with the behavioral measures. The mechanisms underlying the observed neural responses and the possibility of electrophysiological measurement of interoceptive sensitivity are discussed in terms of two perspectives: the predictive coding framework and the cardiac-phase-dependent baroreceptor function.

Sex differences in event-related potential (ERP) waveforms of primary psychotic disorders: A systematic review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						Psychotic disorders; Schizophrenia; Sex; Electroencephalogram; Event-related potentials	AUDITORY P300; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; COMPONENT; BRAIN; ABNORMALITIES; GENDER; FACE; LATENCY; N170	Research aimed at understanding primary psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, and schizoaffective disorder, with electrophysiological methods has flourished over recent years. However, a significant component that is often overlooked or underreported in electrophysiological research of psychosis is the factor of biological sex. Thus, the goal of this systematic review was to summarize the current understanding of EEG sex differences in primary psychotic disorders. Our study found a consistent sex difference relating to the P300 component (male amplitude < females), and that research examining sex differences of ERP waveforms, other than the P300, is very limited with ambiguous findings. This review also addressed the lack of consideration of sex as an influencing factor in electrophysiological research.

We tested this possibility with an event-related potential (ERP) study by examining how self-affirmation influences ambiguous feedback processing in a simple gambling task, which was used to investigate risk decision-making. We assigned 48 participants randomly to the affirmation and non-affirmation (i.e., control) groups. All participants accepted the manipulation first and then completed the gambling task with an electroencephalogram (EEG) recording, in which participants might receive a positive (winning), negative (losing), or ambiguous (unknown valence) outcome after they made a choice. We considered both the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and P3 components elicited by the outcome feedback, which reflected the amount of cognitive resources being invested in the early and late stages of the outcome feedback processing, respectively. ERP results showed that ambiguous feedback elicited a larger FRN among affirmed participants than unaffirmed participants but exerted no influence on the P3. This finding suggests that self-affirmation may help coping with uncertainty by enhancing the early processing of uncertainty.

Method: Auditory selective attention was measured using P300, and the resting state EEG was assessed using the default mode function analysis. Ten individuals with continuous and bothersome tinnitus along with 10 age- and gender-matched control participants underwent event-related potential testing and 5 min of EEG recording (at wakeful rest). Results: Individuals with tinnitus were observed to have larger N1 and P3 amplitudes along with prolonged P3 latency. The default mode function analysis revealed no significant oscillatory differences between the groups. Conclusion: The current study shows changes in both the early sensory and late cognitive components of auditory processing. The change in the P3 component is suggestive of selective auditory attention deficit, and the sensory component (N1) suggests an altered bottom-up processing in individuals with tinnitus.

Challenges of P300 Modulation Using Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS)	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						transcranial alternating current stimulation; EEG; ERP; ERO; P300; P3b	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION-DEFICIT; DELTA; DETERMINANTS; LATENCY; ADHD	The P300 component of the event-related potential (ERP) is a well investigated phenomenon in the human electroencephalogram (EEG) and has been related to stimulus processing and attentional mechanisms. Event-related oscillations (ERO) represent a potential mechanism responsible for generating the ERP. In particular, oscillatory activity in the delta and theta frequency range has been associated with the generation of the P300 component. Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) is capable of modulating oscillatory brain activity in a frequency-specific manner. In this study, we aimed to modulate P300 amplitude using tACS by stimulating the individual ERO involved in the generation of the P300 component. TACS was applied precisely in time to the target P300 occurring in a visual oddball task. In order to achieve an appropriate current distribution, we designed an electrode configuration consisting of two clusters of stimulation electrodes on central-parietal locations. We could not demonstrate a group difference in P300 amplitude after applying tACS in the stimulation condition (N = 17) vs. the sham condition (N = 11). TACS condition and sham condition did not differ regarding their reaction times in response to target stimuli or their event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) at stimulation frequency. Although a significant influence of stimulation could not yet be revealed on a statistical level, we suggest that the proposed method of using tACS for modulating EROs merits further investigation. Modulation of the P300 component in the ERP could help to gain further insights in the role of EROs generating ERPs and the functional relevance of the P300 component. In this study, we propose a novel approach of applying tACS and provide advice on using tACS for the modulation of EROs.

To establish the relationship between tactile perception and friction, 64-channel Neuroscan event-related potential (ERP) system and a three-axis force sensor were used to obtain electroencephalograph (EEG) and friction signals during fingers exploring surfaces. An oddball variation mode was applied to produce the late positive component (LPC) of ERP. Three fabric samples with different friction coefficient were chosen. The results indicate that LPC amplitude is affected by friction. High friction leads to high LPC amplitude. LPC latency is related to difference of friction. Large difference of friction between samples induces small LPC latency. During tactile perception, the applied normal load of male is larger than that of female. Tactile perception is effected by gender. Female has larger LPC latency than male, indicating female are more sensitive to recognize fabrics. This fundamental study could provide theory support to the related researches.

Although there are neurophysiological changes 24-48 hours before migraine attacks, so far, they have not been used in patients' management. This study evaluates the applicability and the ability to identify pre-attack changes of daily "at home" electroencephalography obtained with a portable system for migraine patients. Methods Patients with episodic migraine fulfilling ICHD-3 beta criteria used a mobile system composed of a wireless EEG device (BrainStation (R), Neuroverse (R), Inc., USA) and mobile application (BrainVitals(M)(R), Neuroverse (R), Inc., USA) to self-record their neural activity daily at home while resting and while performing an attention task, over the course of 2 weeks. Standard EEG spectral analysis and event-related brain potentials (ERP) methods were used and recordings were grouped by time from migraine attacks (i.e. "Interictal day", "24 h Before Migraine", "Migraine day" and "Post Migraine"). Results Twenty-four patients (22 women) recorded an average of 13.3 +/- 1.9 days and had 2 +/- 0.9 attacks. Twenty-four hours before attack onset, there was a statistically significant modulation of relative power in the delta (decrease) and beta (increase) frequency bands, at rest, and a significant reduction of the amplitude and inter-trial coherence measures of an attention event-related brain potential (P300). Conclusions This proof-of-concept study shows that brain state monitoring, utilising an easy-to-use wearable EEG system to track neural modulations at home, can identify physiological changes preceding a migraine attack enabling valuable pre-symptom prediction and subsequent early intervention.

METHODS Using fNIRS we obtained frontal cortex hemodynamic responses and using event related potentials (ERP) we obtained amplitude values of P3 component of 18 children with ADHD and gender matched 18 healthy controls performing an oddball task. Same recordings were repeated 3 months after extended-release MPH (OROS-MPH) administration for ADHD group. Prefrontal cortex oxygenation and P3 amplitude were compared between control and pre-MPH ADHD groups and between Pre-MPH and post-MPH ADHD groups. RESULTS fNIRS indicated that the healthy controls exhibited higher right prefrontal activation than pre-MPH children with ADHD. Reduced P3 amplitude values were found in children with ADHD compared the control group. Reduced right prefrontal activation and P3 amplitude was normalized in ADHD group after MPH therapy. CONCLUSION Recently multimodal neuroimaging which combine signals from different brain modalities have started to be considered as a potential to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. The current study provides MPH effect assessment in children with ADHD using multimodal EEG/fNIRS system for the first time. This study suggests combination of neuroimaging and electrophysiological parameters is a promising approach to investigate MPH effect assessment in children with ADHD.

Current Understanding of Religion, Spirituality, and Their Neurobiological Correlates	HARVARD REVIEW OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						electroencephalography (EEG); electrophysiology; event-related potential (ERP); functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); neurobiology; positron emission tomography (PET); religion; spirituality	POSTERIOR EEG ALPHA; FAMILIAL RISK; ASSOCIATION; MEDITATION; DEPRESSION; BELIEF; ADULTS	Religion and spirituality (R/S) have been prominent aspects of most human cultures through the ages; however, scientific inquiry into this phenomenon has been limited. We conducted a systematic literature review of research on the neurobiological correlates of R/S, which resulted in 25 reports studying primarily R/S with electroencephalography, structural neuroimaging (MRI), and functional neuroimaging (fMRI, PET). These studies investigated a wide range of religions (e.g., Christianity, Buddhism, Islam) and R/S states and behaviors (e.g., resting state, prayer, judgments) and employed a wide range of methodologies, some of which (e.g., no control group, varying measures of religiosity, small sample sizes) raise concerns about the validity of the results. Despite these limitations, the findings of these studies collectively suggest that the experience of R/S has specific neurobiological correlates and that these correlates are distinct from non-R/S counterparts. The findings implicate several brain regions potentially associated with R/S development and behavior, including the medial frontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, default mode network, and caudate. This research may suggest future clinical applications and interventions related to R/S and various disorders, including mood, anxiety, psychotic, pain, and vertiginous disorders. Further studies with more rigorous study designs are warranted to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms of R/S and their potential clinical applications.

Brain Vital Signs: Expanding From the Auditory to Visual Modality	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalogram (EEG); event-related potentials (ERPs); clinical assessment; neurology; point-of-care; vital signs	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; STIMULUS-INTENSITY; LEXICAL DECISION; ACTIVE TASKS; OWN NAME; P300; ERP; COMPONENT; CONSCIOUSNESS; GENERATORS	The critical need for rapid objective, physiological evaluation of brain function at point-of-care has led to the emergence of brain vital signs-a framework encompassing a portable electroencephalography (EEG) and an automated, quick test protocol. This framework enables access to well-established event-related potential (ERP) markers, which are specific to sensory, attention, and cognitive functions in both healthy and patient populations. However, all our applications to-date have used auditory stimulation, which have highlighted application challenges in persons with hearing impairments (e.g., aging, seniors, dementia). Consequently, it has become important to translate brain vital signs into a visual sensory modality. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to: 1) demonstrate the feasibility of visual brain vital signs; and 2) compare and normalize results from visual and auditory brain vital signs. Data were collected from 34 healthy adults (33 +/- 13 years) using a 64-channel EEG system. Visual and auditory sequences were kept as comparable as possible to elicit the N100, P300, and N400 responses. Visual brain vital signs were elicited successfully for all three responses across the group (N100: F = 29.8380, p < 0.001; P300: F = 138.8442, p < 0.0001; N400: F = 6.8476, p = 0.01). Initial auditory-visual comparisons across the three components showed attention processing (P300) was found to be the most transferrable across modalities, with no group-level differences and correlated peak amplitudes (rho = 0.7, p = 0.0001) across individuals. Auditory P300 latencies were shorter than visual (p < 0.0001) but normalization and correlation (r = 0.5, p = 0.0033) implied a potential systematic difference across modalities. Reduced auditory N400 amplitudes compared to visual (p = 0.0061) paired with normalization and correlation across individuals (r = 0.6, p = 0.0012), also revealed potential systematic modality differences between reading and listening language comprehension. This study provides an initial understanding of the relationship between the visual and auditory sequences, while importantly establishing a visual sequence within the brain vital signs framework. With both auditory and visual stimulation capabilities available, it is possible to broaden applications across the lifespan.

This technology has the potential to provide patients who have severe generalized myopathy, such as those suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), with the ability to communicate. Recently, auditory oddball paradigms have been developed to implement more practical event-related potential (ERP)-based BCIs because they can operate without ocular activities. These paradigms generally make use of clinical (over 16-channel) EEG devices and natural sound stimuli to maintain the user's motivation during the BCI operation; however, most ALS patients who have taken part in auditory ERP-based BCIs tend to complain about the following factors: (i) total device cost and (ii) setup time. The development of a portable auditory ERP-based BCI could overcome considerable obstacles that prevent the use of this technology in communication in everyday life. To address this issue, we analyzed prefrontal single-channel EEG data acquired from a consumer-grade single-channel EEG device using a natural sound-based auditory oddball paradigm. In our experiments, EEG data was gathered from nine healthy subjects and one ALS patient. The performance of auditory ERP-based BCI was quantified under an offline condition and two online conditions. The offline analysis indicated that our paradigm maintained a high level of detection accuracy (%) and ITR (bits/min) across all subjects through a cross-validation procedure (for five commands: 70.0 +/- 16.1 and 1.29 +/- 0.93, for four commands: 73.8 +/- 14.2 and 1.16 +/- 0.78, for three commands: 78.7 +/- 11.8 and 0.95 +/- 0.61, and for two commands: 85.7 +/- 8.6 and 0.63 +/- 0.38). Furthermore, the first online analysis demonstrated that our paradigm also achieved high performance for new data in an online data acquisition stream (for three commands: 80.0 +/- 19.4 and 1.16 +/- 0.83). The second online analysis measured online performances on the different day of offline and first online analyses on a different day (for three commands: 62.5 +/- 14.3 and 0.43 +/- 0.36). These results indicate that prefrontal single-channel EEGs have the potential to contribute to the development of a user-friendly portable auditory ERP-based BCI.

The areas of improvement include significantly lower averaging error (45% lower RMSE and 37% lower maximum difference than for original implementation) and increased robustness to local minima, strong outliers and corrupted epochs common to real-life EEG signals, especially from low-cost devices. Our proposed procedure was tested on two datasets, one artificially generated for purposes of this study (including different noise sources) and one real-life dataset collected with Emotiv EPOCthorn. The lower error results mainly from more effective rejection (lowering the weights) of corrupted epochs by integrating the correlation-based weighting. The advantages of our method over pure correlation-based weighting are lower RMSE (up to two times) and robustness to the algorithm initialization and strong outliers. The performance of the methods was measured using bootstrap testing to avoid dependency of results on data. It shows that our improvements lead to significantly lower error, especially when the EEG signal is not filtered. The values of the parameters were adjusted for EEG signals but they can easily be incorporated in other repetitive electrophysiological measurement techniques.

No consensus has been reached on the functional role and the relationship between each event-related potential (ERP) characterizing this function. In this study, we used a modified version of the flanker task, measuring the impact of task difficulty on the amplitudes of response-locked and feedback-locked performance monitoring ERPs in a single trial. We observed a functional differentiation between fronto-central (ERN/CRN and FRN) and centro-parietal (Pe/Pc and P300) components: the former seem to be only sensitive to accuracy, whereas the latter seem to be mainly modulated by task difficulty. The use of a surface Laplacian transformation, estimating current source density, on our data also supported an effect of difficulty on centro-parietal response-locked and feedback-locked ERPs. This technique allowed the spatial resolution to be improved and provided clarity, associated with the difficulty manipulation, on the activity of response-locked and feedback-locked performance monitoring ERPs.

Music and rhythm perception have been shown to support auditory and language skills. Here we compare newborn infants' learning from a song, a nursery rhyme, and normal speech for the first time in the same study. Infants' electrophysiological brain responses revealed that the nursery rhyme condition facilitated learning from auditory input, and thus led to successful detection of deviations. These findings suggest that coincidence of prosodic cue patterns and to-be-learned items is more important than the format of the input. Overall, the present results support the view that rhythm is likely to create a template for future events, which allows auditory system to predict prospective input and thus facilitates language development.

The RewP is typically elicited in monetary gambling tasks and has a relatively larger amplitude for positive vs. negative outcomes. However, the extent to which RewP amplitude is modulated by non-monetary feedback is less clear. To address this issue, EEG was used to record reward-related electrocortical activity during a simple non-monetary gambling task. We hypothesized that the RewP would be enhanced for non-monetary wins relative to losses, which was supported by the results. In our supplementary material, we provide additional analyses suggesting that this effect was not observed for the P3. In sum, RewP amplitudes were larger for positive (nonmonetary) feedback relative to negative feedback at frontocentral electrode sites-suggesting that monetary reward is not necessary to elicit the RewP.

The purpose was to determine whether the well-known neurophysiological modulations elicited by hypoxic and hypercapnic conditions can also be detected during pBH induced hypoxic hypercapnia. Ten experienced free-divers (all male, aged 35.10 +/- 7.89 years) were asked to hold their breath twice for 4 min per instance. During the first pBH, a checker board reversal task was presented and in the second four-min pBH phase a classical visual oddball paradigm was performed. A visual evoked potential (VEP) as an index of early visual processing (i.e., latencies and amplitudes of N75, P100, and N145) and the latency and amplitude of a P300 component (visual oddball paradigm) as an index of cognitive processing were investigated. In a counterbalanced cross-over design, all tasks were once performed during normal breathing (B), and once during pBH. All components were then compared between an early pBH (0-2 min) and a later pBH stage (2-4 min) and with the same time phases without pBH (i.e., during normal breathing). Statistical analyses using analyses of variance (ANOVA) revealed that comparisons between B and pBH yielded no significant changes either in the amplitude and latency of the VEP or in the P300. This indicates that neurocognitive markers, whether in an early visual processing stream or at a later cognitive processing stage, were not affected by pBH in experienced free-divers.

Mindfulness meditators show altered distributions of early and late neural activity markers of attention in a response inhibition task	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; COGNITIVE THERAPY; VISUAL-ATTENTION; PARIETAL CORTEX; ERP; MECHANISMS; CONFLICT; ALPHA; EEG; PERFORMANCE	Attention is vital for optimal behavioural performance in every-day life. Mindfulness meditation has been shown to enhance attention. However, the components of attention altered by meditation and the related neural activities are underexplored. In particular, the contributions of inhibitory processes and sustained attention are not well understood. To address these points, 34 meditators were compared to 28 age and gender matched controls during electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of neural activity during a Go/Nogo response inhibition task. This task generates a P3 event related potential, which is related to response inhibition processes in Nogo trials, and attention processes across both trial types. Compared with controls, meditators were more accurate at responding to Go and Nogo trials. Meditators showed a more frontally distributed P3 to both Go and Nogo trials, suggesting more frontal involvement in sustained attention rather than activity specific to response inhibition. Unexpectedly, meditators also showed increased positivity over the right parietal cortex prior to visual information reaching the occipital cortex (during the pre-C1 window). Both results were positively related to increased accuracy across both groups. The results suggest that meditators show altered engagement of neural regions related to attention, including both higher order processes generated by frontal regions, and sensory anticipation processes generated by poster regions. This activity may reflect an increased capacity to modulate a range of neural processes in order to meet task requirements. This increased capacity may underlie the improved attentional function observed in mindfulness meditators.

Current NF systems enable the selection of only one NF parameter, so that two parameters cannot be feedback simultaneously. Consequently, the ability to individually-tailor the treatment to a patient is limited, and treatment efficiency may therefore be compromised. We aimed to design, implement and test an all-in-one, novel, computerized platform for closed-loop NF treatment, based on principles from learning theories. Our prototype performs numeric evaluation based on quantifying resting EEG and event-related EEG responses to various sensory stimuli. The NF treatment was designed according to principles of efficient learning, and implemented as a gradual, patient-adaptive 1D or 2D computer game, that utilizes automatic EEG feature extraction. Verification was performed as we compared the mean area under curve (AUC) of the theta band of a dozen subjects staring at a wall or performing the NF. Most of the subjects (75%) increased their theta band AUC during the NF session compared with the trial staring at the wall (p=0.041). Our system enables multiple feature selection and its machine learning capabilities allow an accurate discovery of patient-specific biomarkers and treatment targets. Its novel characteristics may allow for improved evaluation of patients and treatment outcomes.

However, much more is known about the development of linguistic compared to musical syntax. In the present study, we examined 3.5-year-olds' implicit knowledge of Western musical pitch structure using electroencephalography (EEG). Event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured while children listened to chord sequences that either 1) followed Western harmony rules, 2) ended on a chord that went outside the key, or 3) ended on an in-key but less expected chord harmonically. Whereas adults tend to show an early right anterior negativity (ERAN) in response to unexpected chords (Koelsch, 2009), 3.5-year-olds in our study showed an immature response that was positive rather than negative in polarity. Our results suggest that very young children exhibit implicit knowledge of the pitch structure of Western music years before they have been shown to demonstrate that knowledge in behavioral tasks.

However, the neural mechanisms of attention have mainly been investigated during fixation, which is uncommon in everyday life where people move their eyes to shift attention to faces. Therefore, the current study combined eye-tracking and Electroencephalography (EEG) to measure neural mechanisms of overt attention shifts to faces with happy, neutral and angry expressions, allowing participants to move their eyes freely towards the stimuli. Saccade latencies towards peripheral faces did not differ depending on expression and early neural response (P1) amplitudes and latencies were unaffected. However, the later occurring Early Posterior Negativity (EPN) was significantly larger for emotional than for neutral faces. This response appears after saccades towards the faces. Therefore, emotion modulations only occurred after an overt shift of gaze towards the stimulus had already been completed. Visual saliency rather than emotional content may therefore drive early saccades, while later top-down processes reflect emotion processing. (C) 2019 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Many methods for vigilance detection, based on biological and behavioural characteristics, have been proposed in the literature. In general, the existing approaches do not provide any solution to measure vigilance level quantitatively and adopt costly equipment. This paper utilizes a portable electroencephalography (EEG) device and presents a new method for estimation of vigilance level of an individual by utilizing event-related potentials (P300 and N100) of EEG signals and eye blink rate. Here, we propose a fuzzy rule-based system using amplitude and time variations of the N100 and P300 components and blink variability to establish the correlation among N100, P300, eye blink and the vigilance activity. We have shown, with the help of our proposed fuzzy model, we can efficiently calculate and quantify the vigilance level, and thereby obtain a numerical value of vigilance instead of its mere presence or absence. To validate the results obtained from our fuzzy model, we performed subjective analysis (for assessing the mood and stress level of participants), reaction time analysis and compared the vigilance values with target detection accuracy. The obtained results prove the efficacy of our proposal.

Opportunities to sit and stand trigger equivalent reward-related brain activity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Behaviors minimizing energetic costs; Physical activity; Physical inactivity; Exercise; Reward; EEG	PHYSICAL INACTIVITY; VALUATION; EXERCISE; DELAY; ERPS	A recent theory contends that behaviors minimizing energetic cost are rewarding (Cheval et al., 2018). However, direct experimental evidence supporting this theory is lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated the effect of energy expenditure on reward-related brain activity in a pre-registered study. This preregistered study included thirty-one participants who were equipped with an electroencephalography (EEG) cap and performed a monetary incentive delay task. After attempting to quickly respond to a target, participants were given feedback instructing them to retrieve a token (reward condition) or to wait (no reward condition). In half of the rewarding trials, participants stood up to retrieve a token, thereby increasing energy expenditure. In the other half, participants just had to extend their arm to retrieve a token, thereby minimizing energy expenditure. The contingent negative variation event-related potential (ERP) component preceding the motor response was used as an indicator of reward pursuit. The reward positivity ERP component time-locked to feedback onset was used to determine reward valuation. Results showed that response time, contingent negative variation, and the reward positivity were not influenced by energy expenditure (remaining seated vs. standing up). This null effect of conditions was confirmed using equivalence tests. These results do not support the theory of energetic cost minimization but the equivalent effect of sitting and standing on reward-related brain activity is new knowledge that could contribute to shed light on the neural processes underlying the pandemic of physical inactivity.

Method: Event-related potentials (ERPs) were obtained from a 64-channel EEG in 25 participants when performing the IGT. Brain source localization analyses of the ERP components were also assessed. Results: ERP amplitudes were sensitive to gains and losses. An early fronto-central negativity was elicited when feedback was provided for both gains and losses, and correlated with the number of gains at FCz and with the number of both gains and losses at Cz. The P200 component had larger amplitudes to losses and correlated positively with the number of losses. Feedback related negativity (FRN) was higher at frontal, temporal and occipital electrodes in trials with monetary losses. In addition, trials with monetary losses elicited larger P300 magnitudes than trials with monetary gains at all electrode localizations. Conclusions: All ERP components (except P300) were related to participants' performance in the IGT. Amplitudes of P200 and P300 were associated with the conscious recognition of the error during the decision-making. Performance data and source analysis underline the importance of the medial prefrontal cortex when processing feedback about monetary losses in the IGT.

As a result, electrophysiological responses from subsequent events often overlap with each other. In addition, the recorded neural activity is typically modulated by numerous covariates, which influence the measured responses in a linear or non-linear fashion. Examples of paradigms where systematic temporal overlap variations and low-level confounds between conditions cannot be avoided include combined electroencephalogram (EEG)/eye-tracking experiments during natural vision, fast multisensory stimulation experiments, and mobile brain/body imaging studies. However, even "traditional," highly controlled ERP datasets often contain a hidden mix of overlapping activity (e.g., from stimulus onsets, involuntary microsaccades, or button presses) and it is helpful or even necessary to disentangle these components for a correct interpretation of the results. In this paper, we introduce unfold, a powerful, yet easy-to-use MATLAB toolbox for regression-based EEG analyses that combines existing concepts of massive univariate modeling ("regression-ERPs"), linear deconvolution modeling, and non-linear modeling with the generalized additive model into one coherent and flexible analysis framework. The toolbox is modular, compatible with EEGLAB and can handle even large datasets efficiently. It also includes advanced options for regularization and the use of temporal basis functions (e.g., Fourier sets). We illustrate the advantages of this approach for simulated data as well as data from a standard face recognition experiment. In addition to traditional and non-conventional EEG/ERP designs, unfold can also be applied to other overlapping physiological signals, such as pupillary or electrodermal responses.

During an event-related EEG experiment, 36 subjects performed either color (low-level condition) or magnitude (high-level condition) evaluations of masked digits. Participants also assessed subjective visibility of each stimulus using the Perceptual Awareness Scale (PAS). Mean amplitude of the components of interest was analyzed (VAN - 140-240 ms; LP - 380-480 ms) with weighted regression mixed model. In the VAN component time window the mean amplitude correlated with PAS rating in both conditions. Mean amplitude in the LP time window correlated with PAS ratings in the high-level condition, but not in the low-level condition. Our results support the temporal unfolding of ERP makers of conscious processing, with an early component reflecting the initial perceptual experience and a late component being a correlate of the conscious experience of non-perceptual information.

A gateway to consumers' minds: Achievements, caveats, and prospects of electroencephalography-based prediction in neuromarketing	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-COGNITIVE SCIENCE			English	Review						consumer neuroscience; EEG; neuromarketing; prediction	POTENTIAL SSVEP TOPOGRAPHY; SOCIAL DESIRABILITY BIAS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; FEEDBACK NEGATIVITY; MARKETING-RESEARCH; REWARD POSITIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURAL RESPONSES	In the last decade, the field of consumer neuroscience, or neuromarketing, has been flourishing, with numerous publications, academic programs, initiatives, and companies. The demand for objective neural measures to quantify consumers' preferences and predict responses to marketing campaigns is ever on the rise, particularly due to the limitations of traditional marketing techniques, such as questionnaires, focus groups, and interviews. However, research has yet to converge on a unified methodology or conclusive results that can be applied in the industry. In this review, we present the potential of electroencephalography (EEG)-based preference prediction. We summarize previous EEG research and propose features which have shown promise in capturing the consumers' evaluation process, including components acquired from an event-related potential design, inter-subject correlations, hemispheric asymmetry, and various spectral band powers. Next, we review the latest findings on attempts to predict preferences based on various features of the EEG signal. Finally, we conclude with several recommended guidelines for prediction. Chiefly, we stress the need to demonstrate that neural measures contribute to preference prediction beyond what traditional measures already provide. Second, prediction studies in neuromarketing should adopt the standard practices and methodology used in data science and prediction modeling that is common in other fields such as computer science and engineering.

This effect was found to be stronger with increasing task complexity and was independent of previous experience of weightlessness as well as anti-nausea medication. Analysis of event related potentials showed a decreased amplitude of the N100-P200 complex in weightlessness but was not able to distinguish a possible effect of task complexity. The present study aimed to extend this previous work, by comparing behavioral (reaction time) and neurological (event related potentials analysis) performance to a simple (oddball) and a complex (mental arithmetic + oddball) task during weightlessness. 28 participants participated in two experiments. 11 participants performed a simple oddball experiment in the 1G and 0G phases of a parabolic flight. 17 participants were presented a complex arithmetic task in combination with an oddball task during the 1G and 0G phases of a parabolic flight. Reaction time as well as event related potentials (ERP) were assessed. Results revealed a reduced reaction time (p < .05) for the complex task during 0G. No gravity effects on reaction time were found for the simple task. In both experiments a reduction of typical ERP amplitudes was noticeable in weightlessness. It is assumed that the weightlessness induced fluid shift to the brain is positively affecting neuro-behavioral performance.

Here the research question is: Does an oddball paradigm maintain the greater P3a amplitude under several experimental conditions? An EEG study was carried out with an oddball number parity decision task having four conditions in control and schizophrenic participants. Contrary to previous findings (Gonsalvez and Polich, 2002; Polich, 2007) in control participants, non-correlation was found between the time of a novel (N) stimulus condition to the next novel condition and P3a amplitude. Moreover, with an innovative method for stimulus properties extraction features and EEG analysis, single trial across-subject averaging of participants' data revealed significant correlations (r > 0.3) of stimulus properties (such as probability, frequency, amplitude, and duration) on P300, and even r > 0.5 was found when N was an environmental sound in schizophrenic patients. Therefore, stimulus properties are strong markers of some of the features in the P3a wave. Finally, a context analysis of ERP waves across electrodes revealed a consistent modulation in novel appearance for MisMatch Negativity in schizophrenia. A supplementary analysis running linear modeling (LIMO) in EEG was also provided (see Supplementary Material). Therefore, in a multiple condition task: stimulus properties and their temporal properties are strong markers of some of the features in the P300 wave. An interpretation was done based on differences between controls and schizophrenics relate to differences in the operation of implicit memory for stimulus properties and stronger correlations were observed within groups related contextual and episodic processes.

This is seen behaviorally in reduced response times for matching tone-suffix pairs. Neurophysiologically, online prediction is reflected in the event-related potential (ERP) component pre-activation negativity (PrAN) occurring for tones with a higher predictive value. Invalid suffixes relative to the tone produce a left anterior negativity (LAN), or a broadly distributed negativity, and a P600. When native speakers make decisions about the inflection of words, response times are also longer for invalid tone-suffix combinations. In this study, low to intermediate level second language learners with non-tonal native languages trained tone-suffix associations for two weeks. Before and after training, they participated in a perception test where they listened to nouns with valid and invalid tone-suffix combinations and performed a singular/plural judgment task. During the test, electroencephalography (EEG) and response times were measured. After training, the PrAN effect increased, and a LAN emerged for invalid stimuli, indicating that the participants had acquired the tone-suffix association, using the tones as predictors more extensively post-training. However, neither a P600 nor longer response times for invalidity were found, suggesting potential differences in native and second language processing of the tone-suffix association.

Auditory oddball event related potentials have been observed to be sensitive to the mind wandering state and can be used as a real-time passive measure. This has advantages over standard survey techniques because it is an objective, non-disruptive real time measure. We describe an experiment to observe the neurophysiological correlates of mind wandering in online learning environments using an auditory oddball. In doing so, we introduce a new experimental paradigm to the IS literature which could be used to extend other attention-related research.

J	Wagner, J; Martinez-Canino, R; Makeig, S				Wagner, Johanna; Martinez-Canino, Ramon; Makeig, Scott			Trial-by-trial source-resolved EEG responses to gait task challenges predict subsequent step adaptation	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; ERROR-DETECTION; NEURAL SYSTEM; BEHAVIORAL ADAPTATION; ONLINE ADJUSTMENTS; INHIBITORY CONTROL; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION	A growing body of evidence indicates a pivotal role of cognition and in particular executive function in gait control and fall prevention. In a recent gait study using electroencephalographic (EEG) imaging, we provided direct proof for cortical top-down inhibitory control in step adaptation. A crucial part of motor inhibition is recognizing stimuli that signal the need to inhibit or adjust motor actions such as steps during walking. One of the EEG signatures of performance monitoring in response to events signaling the need to adjust motor responses, are error-related potential (error-ERP) features. To examine whether error-ERP features may index executive control during gait adaptation, we analyzed high-density (108-channel) EEG data from an auditory gait pacing study. Participants (N = 18) walking on a steadily moving treadmill were asked to step in time to an auditory cue tone sequence, and then to quickly adapt their step length and rate, to regain step-cue synchrony following occasional unexpected shifts in the pacing cue train to a faster or slower cue tempo. Decomposition of the continuous EEG data by independent component analysis revealed a negative deflection in the source-resolved event-related potential (ERP) time locked to 'late' cue tones marking a shift to a slower cue tempo. This vertex-negative ERP feature, localized primarily to posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) and peaking 250 ms after the onset of the tempo-shift cue, we here refer to as the step-cue delay negativity (SDN). SDN source, timing, and polarity resemble other error-related ERP features, e.g., the Error-Related Negativity (ERN) and Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN) in (seated) button press response tasks. In single trials, SDN amplitude varied with the magnitude of the cue latency deviation (the time interval between the expected and actual cue onsets). Regression analysis also identified linear coupling between SDN amplitude and the subsequent speed of gait tempo adaptation (as measured by the increase in length of the ensuing adaptation step). The SDN in this paradigm thus seems both to index the perceived need for and the subsequent magnitude of the immediate gait adjustment, consistent with performance-monitoring models. Future research might investigate relationships of these control processes to the impairment of gait adjustment in motor disorders and cognitive decline, for example to develop a biomarker for fall risk prediction in early-stage Parkinson's.

While cognitive mechanisms represent a central risk pathway, children's appraisals of parental symptoms have been understudied. This study examined associations between children's self-blame, threat, and frequency/duration appraisals for maternal symptoms in relation to cognitive control and emotional response processes. Methods: Sixty mother-daughter (aged 10-14-years) pairs participated. Affective processing was assessed by three Event Related Potential (ERP) components, the N2, P3, and LPP, during an emotional Go/NoGo task. Results: Threat-appraisals were associated with alterations in all three ERP components, independently of maternal diagnostic histories or youth depressive symptoms. Self-blame was associated with early attentional engagement towards calm faces. Independent effects of maternal depression history and youth symptoms were also observed. Conclusions: Results highlight the importance of youth perceptions of maternal depressive symptoms in models of depression-risk.

Taking off the training wheels: Measuring auditory P3 during outdoor cycling using an active wet EEG system	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Mobile EEG; Biking; P3; Attention; Raspberry PI	TASK-DIFFICULTY; COMPONENT; BRAIN; PLASTICITY; DETERMINANTS; ELECTRODES; EXERCISE; COMPLEX; SOUND; TIME	Mobile EEG allows the investigation of brain activity in increasingly complex environments. In this study, EEG equipment was adapted for use and transportation in a backpack while cycling. Participants performed an auditory oddball task while cycling outside and sitting in an isolated chamber inside the lab. Cycling increased EEG noise and marginally diminished alpha amplitude. However, this increased noise did not influence the ability to measure reliable event related potentials (ERP). The P3 was similar in topography, and morphology when outside on the bike, with a lower amplitude in the outside cycling condition. There was only a minor decrease in the statistical power to measure reliable ERP effects. Unexpectedly, when biking outside significantly decreased P2 and increased N1 amplitude were observed when evoked by both standards and targets compared with sitting in the lab. This may be due to attentional processes filtering the overlapping sounds between the tones used and similar environmental frequencies. This study established methods for mobile recording of ERP signals. Future directions include investigating auditory P2 filtering inside the laboratory. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Dataset of 24-subject EEG recordings during viewing of real-world objects and planar images of the same items	DATA IN BRIEF			English	Article; Data Paper						Real-world objects; Images; EEG; ERP; Mu rhythm		Here we present a collection of electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded from 24 observers (14 females, 10 males, mean age: 25.4) while observing individually-presented stimuli comprised of 96 real-world objects, and 96 images of the same items printed in high-resolution. EEG was recorded from 128 scalp channels. Six additional external electrodes were used to record vertical and horizontal electrooculogram, as well as the signal from the left and right mastoid. EEG has been pre-processed, segmented in non-overlapping epochs, and independent component analysis (ICA) has been conducted to reject artifacts. Moreover, supplemental pre-processing steps have been completed to facilitate the analysis of event-related potentials (ERP). These data are linked to the article "Distinct visuo-motor brain dynamics for real-world objects versus planar images". Alongside this data we provide the custom-written Matlab (R) code that can be used to fully reproduce all analyses and figures presented in the linked research article. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

Source activity during emotion processing and its relationship to cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; Cognitive impairment; Event-related potentials; Source imaging; Affective priming paradigm	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DECISION-MAKING; BRAIN; DEPRESSION; AMYGDALA; N400; CONNECTIVITY; CRITIQUE; VALENCE; SCALES	Background: Neural mechanisms contributing to an underlying cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) are poorly understood. An effective method to probe cognitive processing deficits in PD is the examination of brain activity during emotional processes, particularly in explicit language emotion recognition contexts. Methods:: The present study utilised cortical source imaging of event related potentials (ERP) from electro-encephalography (EEG) to evaluate valence judgements on negative and neutral target words in an automatic affective priming paradigm. Fifty non-demented PD patients, unmedicated for depression or anxiety, completed affective priming tasks during EEG monitoring. Cognitive impairment was measured using the validated Parkinson's Disease-Cognitive Rating Scale (PD-CRS). Results: : Results reveal that compared to healthy age-matched controls, PD patients demonstrate a reduced N400 activation during affective priming tasks in bilateral regions of the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and, notably, have a late wave ERP component (LPP) in left MFG, present between 600 and 800 ms, following family-wise error correction (P-FWE < 0.05). LPP in PD patients were significantly associated with PD-CRS scores. Limitations:: Although affective priming paradigms are an effective means for various domains of cognition, it is not a focused cognitive behavioural test for cognitive dysfunction. Our study is thus limited to a surrogate measure of cognitive dysfunction via examination of emotional word processing cues. Conclusions:: These findings suggest that source imaging methods with ERP paradigms in PD are effective in identifying delayed cognitive processes in PD.

An EEG study of detection without localisation in change blindness	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Change blindness; Sensing; Event-related potentials; Awareness	CHANGE IDENTIFICATION; ATTENDED OBJECTS; VISUAL-ATTENTION; FERNANDEZ-DUQUE; AWARENESS; ERP; MEMORY; SEE; REPRESENTATION; REPLICATION	Previous studies of change blindness have suggested a distinction between detection and localisation of changes in a visual scene. Using a simple paradigm with an array of coloured squares, the present study aimed to further investigate differences in event-related potentials (ERPs) between trials in which participants could detect the presence of a colour change but not identify the location of the change (sense trials), versus those where participants could both detect and localise the change (localise trials). Individual differences in performance were controlled for by adjusting the difficulty of the task in real time. Behaviourally, reaction times for sense, blind, and false alarm trials were distinguishable when comparing across levels of participant certainty. In the EEG data, we found no significant differences in the visual awareness negativity ERP, contrary to previous findings. In the N2pc range, both awareness conditions (localise and sense) were significantly different to trials with no change detection (blind trials), suggesting that this ERP is not dependent on explicit awareness. Within the late positivity range, all conditions were significantly different. These results suggest that changes can be 'sensed' without knowledge of the location of the changing object, and that participant certainty scores can provide valuable information about the perception of changes in change blindness.

In the present study, we investigated the neural processes underpinning error and monetary rewards processing in such cooperative and competitive situations. We used electroencephalography (EEG) and analyzed event-related potentials (ERPs) triggered by feedback in both social situations. 26 dyads performed a joint four-alternative forced choice (4AFC) visual task either cooperatively or competitively. At the end of each trial, participants received performance feedback about their individual and joint errors and accompanying monetary rewards. Furthermore, the outcome, i.e., resulting positive, negative, or neutral rewards, was dependent on the pay-off matrix, defining the social situation either as cooperative or competitive. We used linear mixed effects models to analyze the feedback-related-negativity (FRN) and used the Threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) method to explore activations of all electrodes and times. We found main effects of the outcome and social situation, but no interaction at mid-line frontal electrodes. The FRN was more negative for losses than wins in both social situations. However, the FRN amplitudes differed between social situations. Moreover, we compared monetary with neutral outcomes in both social situations. Our exploratory TFCE analysis revealed that processing of feedback differs between cooperative and competitive situations at right temporo-parietal electrodes where the cooperative situation elicited more positive amplitudes. Further, the differences induced by the social situations were stronger in participants with higher scores on a perspective taking test. In sum, our results replicate previous studies about the FRN and extend them by comparing neurophysiological responses to positive and negative outcomes in a task that simultaneously engages two participants in competitive and cooperative situations.

This requires the combination of well-established neural mechanisms, and the development of increasingly sensitive methodologies. The P300 event-related potential (ERP) has been one of the most heavily investigated neural markers of attention and cognition, and studies have reliably shown that changes in the amplitude and latency of the P300 ERP index the process of aging. However, it is still not clear whether either the P3a or P3b sub-components additionally index levels of cognitive impairment. Here, we used a traditional visual three-stimulus oddball paradigm to investigate both the P3a and P3b ERP components in sixteen young and thirty-four healthy elderly individuals with varying degrees of cognitive ability. EEG data extraction was enhanced through the use of a novel signal processing method called Functional Source Separation (FSS) that increases signal-to-noise ratio by using a weighted sum of all electrodes rather than relying on a single, or a small sub-set, of EEG channels. Whilst clear differences in both the P3a and P3b ERPs were seen between young and elderly groups, only P3b amplitude differentiated older people with low memory performance relative to IQ from those with consistent memory and IQ. A machine learning analysis showed that P3b amplitude (derived from FSS analysis) could accurately categorise high and low performing elderly individuals (78% accuracy). A comparison of Bayes Factors found that differences in cognitive decline within the elderly group were 87 times more likely to be detected using FSS compared to the best performing single electrode (Cz). In conclusion, we propose that P3b amplitude could be a sensitive marker of early, age-independent, episodic memory dysfunction within a healthy older population. In addition, we advocate for the use of more advanced signal processing methods, such as FSS, for detecting subtle neural changes in clinical populations.

ERPs associated with task preparation (switch and mixing positivity) and task execution processes (N2 and P3b) were investigated. Participants performed a cued letter-number task switching paradigm that included single task and mixed task blocks, while their electroencephalography was recorded. Behavioral results revealed smaller switch and mixing costs in bilinguals relative to monolinguals, in both young and older participants. There were no ERP differences in the effect size of the cue-locked mixing and switch positivities, nor the target-locked mixing and switch N2 and P3b components. However, overall larger target-locked N2 amplitudes were observed in bilinguals relative to monolinguals. In addition, bilingual older adults exhibited smaller P3b amplitudes than monolingual older adults. The smaller behavioral mixing and switch costs observed in bilinguals suggest that bilinguals exhibit superior sustained attention and faster task-set reconfiguration processes compared to monolinguals. The ERP measures provide evidence for differences in brain processes between monolinguals and bilinguals and a reliance on different processing strategies in bilingual compared to monolingual older adults.

This work is based on the P300 speller BCI (oddball) paradigm and the xDAWN algorithm, with ten healthy subjects; while using a non-invasive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) based on low fidelity electroencephalographic (EEG) equipment. Our results suggest that the accuracy was best for the no music (MO), followed by music at 90% (M90), music at 60% (M60) and last music at 30% (M30), which results were in identical order to the subjects' preferences. In addition, the amplitude did not show any statistical significance in all scenarios while the latency exhibited a minor statistical difference. This work is part of a larger EEG based project where we are introducing different categories of distractions that are being considered alongside the development of a taxonomy. These results should give some insight into the practicability of the current P300 speller to be used for real-world applications.

Accessing knowledge of the 'here and now': a new technique for capturing electromagnetic markers of orientation processing	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						neuroimaging; neural signal processing; orientation; MEG; ERP; neurotechnology	MIDDLE CEREBRAL-ARTERY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; SEMANTIC MEMORY; N400; EEG; COMPONENT; TIME; MEG; ERP; INTEGRATION	Objective. The ability to orient with respect to the current context (e.g. current time or location) is crucial for daily functioning, and is used to measure overall cognitive health across many frontline clinical assessments. However, these tests are often hampered by their reliance on verbal probes (e.g. 'What city are we in?') in evaluating orientation. Objective, physiology-based measures of orientation processing are needed, but no such measures are currently in existence. We report the initial development of potential brainwave-based markers of orientation processing as characterized using electroencephlography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Approach. An auditory stimulus sequence embedded with words corresponding to orientation-relevant (i.e. related to the 'here and now') and orientation-irrelevant (i.e. unrelated to the current context) conditions was used to elicit orientation processing responses. EEG/MEG data, in concert with clinical assessments, were collected from 29 healthy adults. Analysis at sensor and source levels identified and characterized neural signals related to orientation processing. Main results. Orientation-irrelevant stimuli elicited increased negative amplitude in EEG-derived event-related potential (ERP) waveforms during the 390-570ms window (p < 0.05), with cortical activations across the left frontal, temporal, and parietal regions. These effects are consistent with the wellknown N400 response to semantic incongruence. In contrast, ERP responses to orientation-relevant stimuli exhibited increased positive amplitude during the same interval (p < 0.05), with activations across the bilateral temporal and parietal regions. Importantly, these differential responses were robust at the individual level, with machine-learning classification showing high accuracy (89%), sensitivity (0.88) and specificity (0.90). Significance. This is the first demonstration of a neurotechnology platform that elicits, captures, and evaluates electrophysiological markers of orientation processing. We demonstrate neural responses to orientation stimuli that are validated across EEG and MEG modalities and robust at the individual level. The extraction of physiology-based markers through this technique may enable improved objective brain functional evaluation in clinical applications.

Neural Correlates of Attentional Processing of Threat in Youth with and without Anxiety Disorders	JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Event-related potential; Youth; Anxiety; Attention	EMOTIONAL FACES; SOCIAL ANXIETY; NONANXIOUS INDIVIDUALS; CHILDHOOD ANXIETY; BIAS; CHILDREN; POTENTIALS; STIMULI; FEARFUL; RELIABILITY	Late-stage attentional processing of threatening stimuli, quantified through event-related potentials (ERPs), differentiates youth with and without anxiety disorders. It is unknown whether early-stage attentional processing of threatening stimuli differentiates these groups. Examining both early and late stage attentional processes in youth may advance knowledge and enhance efforts to identify biomarkers for translational prevention and treatment research. Twenty-one youth with primary DSM-IV-TR anxiety disorders (10 males, ages 8-15years) and 21 typically developing Controls (15 males, ages 8-16years) completed a dot probe task while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded, and ERPs were examined. Youth with anxiety disorders showed significantly larger (more positive) P1 amplitudes for threatening stimuli than for neutral stimuli, and Controls showed the opposite pattern. Youth with anxiety showed larger (more negative) N170 amplitudes compared with Controls. Controls showed significantly larger (more positive) P2 and P3 amplitudes, regardless of stimuli valence, compared with youth with anxiety disorders. ERPs observed during the dot probe task indicate youth with anxiety disorders display distinct neural processing during early stage attentional orienting and processing of faces; this was not the case for Controls. Such results suggest these ERP components may have potential as biomarkers of anxiety disorders in youth.

Explicitly, we investigate the effect that auditory distractions, distinctively that of ambient noise (AN), passive talking (PT), and active listening (AL) have on the signal of a visual P300 Speller in terms of accuracy, amplitude, latency, user preference, signal morphology, and overall signal quality. This work is part of a larger EEG based project and is based on the P300 speller BCI (oddball) paradigm and the xDAWN algorithm, with eight healthy subjects; while using a non-invasive Brain-Computer Interface based on low fidelity electroencephalographic (EEG) equipment. Our results show that the accuracy was best for the Lab (LC) at 100%, followed by AN at 92.5%, PT at 90% and last AL at 87.5%, which results were in identical order to the subjects' preferences. In addition, the amplitude and latency did not show any statistical significance in all settings This paper provides additional results that impart insight into the practicability of the aforementioned P300 speller methodology and low-cost equipment to be used in real-world applications.

J	Gallagher, D				Gallagher, Daniel			Languagelike-Specificity of Event-Related Potentials From a Minimalist Program Perspective	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review						minimalist program; faculty of language; event-related potentials; math; music	ERP; COMPREHENSION; REVEAL; PIRAHA; MUSIC; EEG	In this mini-review, I use event-related potential (ERP) studies to test the minimalist program (MP) prediction that organisms with the faculty of language cognitively process languagelike systems in a qualitatively distinct manner. I first discuss "languagelike" as a technical term defined by recursion criteria. From this definition and using a generative perspective, I show that certain domains of math and music can be considered languagelike. These domains are then used as case studies to test whether or not different languagelike systems are cognitively processed in a similar manner. This is done by investigating the elicitation of common language-related ERPs (namely, the left-anterior negativity (LAN), N400, and P600) in these languagelike systems. I show that these systems do indeed elicit the same language-related ERPs, supporting the claim that different languagelike systems are processed similarly. I then discuss discrepancies between these systems, as exemplified by the P3, and I provide plausible accounts for interpreting those results. I ultimately conclude that present data on the LAN, N400, and P600 disprove language-specificity but that languagelike-specificity remains plausible, and as yet there is no reason to reject MP's prediction that languagelike systems are processed in a qualitatively distinct way.

Sensory-processing deficits are common in humans with FXS and an animal model, the Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse, manifesting in the auditory system as debilitating hypersensitivity and abnormal electroencephalographic (EEG) and event-related potential (ERP) phenotypes. FXS is a neurodevelopmental disorder, but how EEG/ERP phenotypes change during development is unclear. Therefore, we characterized baseline and stimulus-evoked EEG in auditory and frontal cortex of developing (postnatal day (P) 21 and P30) and adult (P60) wildtype (WT) and Fmr1 KO mice with the FVB genetic background. We found that baseline gamma-band power and N1 amplitude of auditory ERP were increased in frontal cortex of Fmr1 KO mice during development and in adults. Baseline gamma power was increased in auditory cortex at P30. Genotype differences in stimulus-evoked gamma power were present in both cortical regions, but the direction and strength of the changes were age-dependent. These findings suggest that cortical deficits are present during early development and may contribute to sensory-processing deficits in FXS, which in turn may lead to anxiety and delayed language. Developmental changes in EEG measures indicate that observations at a single time-point during development are not reflective of FXS disease progression and highlight the need to identify developmental trajectories and optimal windows for treatment.

Method: Behavioral and EEG data in cued GO/NOGG task were recorded in 132 healthy controls (HC) and age, gender and education matched 63 ADHD adults, and 68 SZ patients. Results: N2d wave in NOGO-GO contrast of ERPs did not differ between the groups while the P3d wave discriminated SZ group from two other groups. Latent components of ERPs were extracted by blind source separation method based on second-order statistics Kropotov et al. (2017) and compared between the groups. A counterpart of N2d wave of a frontally distributed latent component was smaller in SZ indicating a specific frontal dysfunction of conflict detection in SZ. Two centrally distributed P3 subcomponents were reduced in both groups indicating a non-specific dysfunction of action inhibition operations in ADHD and SZ. Conclusion: A pattern of specific and common dysfunctions in terms of latent ERP components shows a more complex picture of functional impairment in schizophrenia and ADHD in comparison to conventional N2/P3 ERP description.

J	Kim, HH; Kim, YH				Kim, Hyun Hee; Kim, Yong Ho			Video summarization using event-related potential responses to shot boundaries in real-time video watching	JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							SERIAL VISUAL PRESENTATION; SEMANTIC INTEGRATION; WORLD; RELEVANCE; DISCOURSE; ATTENTION; ERPS; EEG	Our aim was to develop an event-related potential (ERP)-based method to construct a video skim consisting of key shots to bridge the semantic gap between the topic inferred from a whole video and that from its summary. Mayer's cognitive model was examined, wherein the topic integration process of a user evoked by a visual stimulus can be associated with long-latency ERP components. We determined that long-latency ERP components are suitable for measuring a user's neuronal response through a literature review. We hypothesized that N300 is specific to the categorization of all shots regardless of topic relevance, N400 is specific for the semantic mismatching process for topic-irrelevant shots, and P600 is specific for the context updating process for topic-relevant shots. In our experiment, the N400 component led to more negative ERP signals in response to topic-irrelevant shots than to topic-relevant shots and showed a fronto-central scalp pattern. P600 elicited more positive ERP signals for topic-relevant shots than for topic-irrelevant shots and showed a fronto-central scalp pattern. We used discriminant and artificial neural network (ANN) analyses to decode video shot relevance and observed that the ANN produced particularly high success rates: 91.3% from the training set and 100% from the test set.

Methods: A literature search was conducted using the PubMed database from inception to March 2018. Studies included in the review measured any event-related potentials, neural oscillations, or phase synchrony. Results: A total of 113 articles were identified. Twenty-nine studies were included for the review. The majority of the studies focused on the N170 component. Smaller N170 amplitudes were consistently reported in schizophrenia patients compared to the healthy control group. Significant correlations between N170 amplitudes and social functioning scales were reported. Other results were quite inconsistent; however, group differences were more prominent for tasks with specific conditions. Conclusions: Older patients with longer disease duration show more consistent neuropsychological correlations. Alterations of event-related potentials are likely to be linked to higher severity of symptoms. The N170 component seems to be the most promising event-related potential to be used for evaluation of present status and for dynamic control of cognitive impairments, social functioning, and rehabilitation effectiveness. Significance: This systematic review provides evidence of (1) neuropsychological alterations of face processing outside an emotional context, and (2) a potential role of N170 as a diagnostic and treatment monitoring biomarker.

Previous learning studies using this approach have, however, mostly used meaningless novel word forms; it therefore remains uncertain whether the increased amplitude simply reflects increased familiarity with the new stimulus or is indeed a reflection of a complete word representation. Here, we used the oddball paradigm to measure the mismatch negativity (MMN) responses to novel word forms before and after semantic training, during which they were associated with previously familiar words of either high or low frequency of occurrence. Following training, the amplitude of the MMN to novel words was enhanced. Furthermore, these changes were dependent on the frequency of the reference which novel items became associated with: namely, the MMN amplitude became greater and the latency shorter for the item which was assigned the high-frequency meaning. Even though the amount of training was the same for both types of items, the low-frequency stimulus did not achieve similar significant changes. Our results suggest that the new surface form becomes linked to the existing representation, which then automatically activates in full when the respective stimulus is present at the input. This finding indicates that the learning-related MMN dynamics, manifest as a response increase after learning, likely reflects the formation and activation of a complete lexicosemantic memory circuits for words.

Previous studies have reported the superiority of handwriting to typing in terms of learning performance, but differences between the use of an ink pen vs. a digital pen remain unclear. In the present study, the participants learned to read difficult words by writing with an ink pen vs. a digital pen. After the learning period, electroencephalography (EEG) signals were measured, while the participants underwent a repetition priming paradigm with the use of the learned words. The repetition priming effect of the N400 event-related potential (ERP) was quantified as an index of the learning effect and the effects between pen types were compared. The groups were also subdivided according to whether a digital pen is frequently used (familiar vs. unfamiliar group). The number of writing repetitions for each word within 10 min during the learning activity and the post-learning test scores were not affected by the pen-type or familiarity with a digital pen. However, the repetition priming effect of the N400 was greater for words written with a digital pen in the learning session, as compared with an ink pen, in the familiar group, but not the unfamiliar group. These results suggest that for those familiar with its use, writing with a digital pen may improve learning relative to the use of an ink pen.

In particular, expressive changes heard on speech signals have to be integrated with speaker identity, differentiating e.g. self- and other-produced signals. While previous research has shown that self-related visual information processing is facilitated compared to non-self stimuli, evidence in the auditory modality remains mixed. Here, we compared electroencephalography (EEG) responses to expressive changes in sequence of self- or other-produced speech sounds using a mismatch negativity (MMN) passive oddball paradigm. Critically, to control for speaker differences, we used programmable acoustic transformations to create voice deviants that differed from standards in exactly the same manner, making EEG responses to such deviations comparable between sequences. Our results indicate that expressive changes on a stranger's voice are highly prioritized in auditory processing compared to identical changes on the self-voice. Other-voice deviants generate earlier MMN onset responses and involve stronger cortical activations in a left motor and somatosensory network suggestive of an increased recruitment of resources for less internally predictable, and therefore perhaps more socially relevant, signals.

However, this technique lacks focality and electrophysiological effects or correlates are rarely examined. The present study investigated whether anodal and/or cathodal high-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) would influence facial emotion processing performance relative to sham stimulation, and whether task performance changes were related to neurophysiological changes. Participants completed a facial emotion attribution tasks before and after rTPJ HD-tDCS, with event-related potentials (ERP) recorded during task performance. Anodal rTPJ HD-tDCS improved facial emotion processing performance for static depictions of fear (but not surprise). Stimulation condition influenced P300 latency, and also influenced the relationship between behavioural and electrophysiological (ERP) outcomes in several circumstances, findings which both support and challenge anodal-excitation/cathodal-inhibition accounts of tDCS effects. Results suggest that rTPJ anodal HD-tDCS can influence facial emotion recognition (i.e., affective mentalizing), and elucidate the nature and distribution of underlying neurophysiological processes. Stimulation effects, however, might depend on the intensity and salience/valence (negativity/threat) of the emotion, and these behavioural effects may not relate directly or simply to the ERPs assessed here.

Brain Painting has shown to improve the Quality of Life of patients with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), by giving the patients ways of expressing themselves and affecting society through art exhibitions. Although there is currently no known cure for ALS, through such outlets, we can help mitigate the physical and psychological impairments. Therefore, this paper discusses a study where users paint with their brain with a BCI in an immersed Virtual environment, also known as Brain Painting. This study evaluates the cognitive workload, presence, and changes in affect through standardized questionnaires. Also, to explore the validity for users to express themselves creatively can lead to a more positive experience using the application in an immersed environment, in comparison to non-immersive.

They provide easy access to multilingual media content within everyday scenarios to enhance language skills or improve vocabulary. The detection of learners' vocabulary deficiencies is an integral part of effective language learning. However, retrieving translations during everyday media consumption causes inattention and hinders fluent learning. In this paper, we investigate Electroencephalography (EEG) to assess single-word incomprehension within non-native learning contents. In a user study (N = 10), we employed Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) to display text while recording Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) for different word difficulties. Our results show that incomprehension of words can be detected in participants' neural responses, as is confirmed by post hoc ratings.

J	Seib-Pfeifer, LE; Gibbons, H				Seib-Pfeifer, Laura-Effi; Gibbons, Henning			Independent ERP predictors of affective priming underline the importance of depth of prime and target processing and implicit affect misattribution	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Affective priming; Depth of processing; Affect misattribution; Affect discrimination; Event-related potentials	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; ATTENTION; EMOTION; ACTIVATION; NEGATIVITY; ATTITUDES; AWARENESS; AMPLITUDE; COGNITION	We used event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the mental processes that contribute to affective priming (AP), a systematic shift of evaluative judgments about neutral targets toward the valence of preceding primes. 64 participants rated their liking of a priori neutral ideographs preceded by 800-ms emotional primewords, while 64-channel EEG was recorded. We observed a significant AP effect that was closely associated with prime valence dependent variations of the right central-to-parieto-occipital positive slow wave (PSW) amplitude in the target ERP, providing evidence for implicit affect misattribution as one source of the effect. While deeper target processing mirrored in valence unspecific central-to-parieto-occipital target PSW amplitude was negatively associated with AP, deeper prime processing indicated by valence unspecific central-to-parieto-occipital prime PSW amplitude was positively related to AP. These depth of processing effects underline the importance of strategic processes in AP. In a stepwise linear regression analysis, the prime valence effect on right central-to-parieto-occipital target PSW indicating affect misattribution and the two valence-unspecific ERP indices of processing depth (central-to-parieto-occipital prime- and target PSW) were independent predictors of the size of the AP effect. Together they accounted for 60% of the variance. Furthermore, an explorative analysis provided first evidence for the relevance of early discrimination of prime valence for AP.

The present study intends to clarify the changes in cognition at the electrophysiological level. Changes in amplitude and latency of N1, P2, N2, and P3 components of event-related potentials (ERPs) were analyzed for error and correct trials during normal and fatigue. Twenty-nine participants had to perform a 2-back working memory (WM) task for 100 min. The first 10 min and the last 10 min of the task were used as the normal state and fatigue state of the participant, respectively. EEG data were obtained from the first 10-min period and the final 10-min period. The results revealed smaller P3 and P2 amplitudes and longer P2 and N2 latency in the final 10-min which was after a long-lasting time task. Moreover, smaller P3 and P2 amplitudes but larger N2 amplitudes were observed in error trials for both states. Our results indicated that: (1) long lasting involvement in a cognitive task had a detrimental effect on attention, memory updating and cognitive control; and (2) impaired attention, impairments in memory updating and cognitive control were related to task errors. Our results imply that several impaired cognitive processes were consistently associated with the error and the altered ERP represents the neural patterns prior to error response in mental fatigue state.

EEG was recorded while participants overtly named pictures accompanied by categorically related versus unrelated written distractor words. In contrast to previous studies, stimuli were presented for only 250 ms to avoid any re-processing. ERP effects of relatedness were found around 290, 470, 540, and 660 ms post stimulus onset. In addition, related distractors led to an increase in midfrontal theta power, especially from about 440 to 540 ms, as well as to decreased high beta power between 40 and 110 ms and increased high beta power between 275 and 340 ms post stimulus onset. Response-locked analyses showed no differences in ERPs, however increased low and high beta power for related distractors in various time windows, most importantly a high beta power increase between -175 and -155 ms before speech onset. These results suggest that the semantic distractor effect is a combination of various effects and that the lexical competition account and the response exclusion account each capture a part, but not all aspects of the effect.

Most of the electronic gadgets involve the direct exposure to extremely harmful levels of highly dangerous electromagnetic radiations (EM). The chronic exposure of these EM radiations may adversely affect the human health. An attempt has been made to investigate the EM radiation effect on human brain using electroencephalography (EEG) analysis. A detailed event related potential and topographic map analysis of acquired EEG signals has been done using MATLAB and studied as an outcome during two states viz., normal relaxed state and EM radiation exposure state. Significant rise in potential concentrations has been observed at frontal and frontal-temporal regions of scalp during radiation exposure state. This has also been inferred from three dimensional topographic scalp maps of human brain. This indicates that the time domain analysis of EEG responses possess the ability to be developed as a tool to assess the level of radiation exposure on cognitive functions of human brain. It could lead to explore and correlate a variety of health effects such as memory loss, cognitive impairment, brain tumors, headaches, frustration, anxiety, etc with the EM radiation exposure.

We conducted an ERP experiment with an oddball paradigm consisting of two types of deviant stimuli (easy and hard) and standard stimulus. A nonnegative Tucker tensor decomposition (NTD) was used to characterize differences in processing of stimuli using a time-frequency-spatial (multi-domain) features. We extracted the multi-domain features for a reliable representation of the underlying infant brain activity to analyze the processing of standard and deviant stimuli. The obtained results show significant differences in processing between standard and deviant stimuli and may be interpreted in terms of mismatch negativity (MMN) and acoustic change complex (ACC) evoked potentials. Moreover, these results serve as a proof-of-concept for application of tensor decomposition-based analyses for challenging infant EEG data.

We have developed an automated general-purpose framework, the EEG Quality Index, for the objective assessment of EEG signal quality. This framework currently uses 6 metrics that are shown to be highly sensitive to various typical artifacts. Normalized scores for each metric can be used in a framework to provide indications of the overall quality of the recorded EEG signal. Using simulated clean and artifact-contaminated EEG in a Support Vector Machine classifier, the EEG Quality Index metrics can identify artifact-contaminated EEG with 90.75% accuracy, 97.7% sensitivity, and 83.8% specificity. This is the first demonstration of a general-purpose framework for the automated and objective assessment of the quality of EEG data. With portable, low-density EEG systems being increasingly adopted in real-world clinical applications, this type of quality assessment is important.

However, the extent to which recollection and familiarity share similar electrophysiological processes associated with subjectively perceived memory confidence remains an open question. In addition, the role of memory encoding in subjectively perceived confidence during retrieval has not yet been investigated. To address these issues, an EEG study was performed in thirty healthy volunteers. During a memory task, participants encoded a subset of words while rating the words on pleasantness. Memory recognition and subjectively perceived confidence concerning these 'old' and additional 'new' words was tested. Results showed that during retrieval, correctly classifying an old item with high subjectively perceived confidence was associated with a parietal ERP and parietal theta power, while frontal theta activity was related to high-confident novelty processing. During the memory encoding phase, a parietal ERP and frontal theta oscillations were related to subsequent subjectively perceived memory confidence. Our findings provide the first evidence that subjectively perceived memory confidence is associated with distinct electrophysiological correlates during both memory encoding and retrieval.

To mitigate this issue, recent research has established non-physical signals such as brainwaves as viable sources for secured person authentication. As the brain signal has been found to be unique for individuals, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can be potentially utilized as an identity discrimination tool, especially since EEG reflects the delicate difference in individuals' mental characteristics. However, the existing EEG-based authentication methods not only apply one or few techniques to stimulate the signals but also there are some vulnerabilities in the limited scope of the study. Therefore, we propose to combine steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) and event-related potential (ERP) features to discriminate the distinction between individuals and apply the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for the analysis. The proposed methodology is divided into three stages. Firstly, we collect raw EEG data from the 20 human subjects, whose brains were stimulated by 7.5 Hz square SSVEP with targeted and non-targeted Snodgrass-Vanderwart's set of images as ERP stimulus. Then, the raw data is pre-processed by a notch filter, band-pass filter, and eye blink artifacts removal. The LSTM architecture is used to process data of individuals for predicting the results. After prediction, the performance is evaluated based on False Acceptance Rates and False Rejection Rates. The EEG-based authentication method with visual stimulus demonstrates high verification accuracy and can be applied with some improvement in the future through the use of brain connectivity techniques.

Recent evidence suggests that trait empathy levels may also influence performance monitoring processes. The present study investigated how outcome expectation and empathy interact during a turn-taking piano duet task, using simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) recording. During the performances, one note in each player's part was altered in pitch to elicit the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and subsequent P3 complex. Pianists memorized and performed pieces containing either a similar or dissimilar sequence as their partner. For additional blocks, pianists also played both sequence types with an audio-only computer partner. The FRN and P3a were larger in response to self than other, while P3b occurred only in response to self, suggesting greater online monitoring of self- compared to other-produced actions during turn-taking joint action. P3a was larger when pianists played a similar sequence as their partner. Finally, as trait empathy level increased, FRN in response to self decreased. This association was absent for FRN in response to other. This may reflect that highly-empathetic musicians during joint performance could use a strategy to suppress exclusive focus on self-monitoring.

Many factors impact system performance, including inadequate training datasets and models' ignorance of the temporal dependency of brain responses to serial stimuli. Here, we propose a signal model for event-related responses in the EEG evoked with a rapid sequence of stimuli in BCI applications. The model describes the EEG as a superposition of impulse responses time-locked to stimuli corrupted with an autoregressive noise process. The performance of the signal model is assessed in the context of RSVP keyboard, a language-model-assisted EEG-based BCI for typing. EEG data obtained for model calibration from 10 healthy participants are used to fit and compare two models: the proposed sequence-based EEG model and the trial-based feature-class-conditional distribution model that ignores temporal dependencies, which has been used in the previous work. The simulation studies indicate that the earlier model that ignores temporal dependencies may be causing drastic reductions in achievable information transfer rate (ITR). Furthermore, the proposed model, with better regularization, may achieve improved accuracy with fewer calibration data samples, potentially helping to reduce calibration time. Specifically, results show an average 8.6% increase in (cross-validated) calibration AUC for a single channel of EEG, and 54% increase in the ITR in a typing task.

EEG measurement in real environments has become increasingly important as a means to monitor brain activity in our daily lives, such as while playing consumer games in the living room. The present study measured brain EEG activity while two players engaged in a competitive consumer baseball game in conditions that closely resembled daily life. The recorded brain activity was thus likely related to natural mental reactions and cognitive function that occur in similar daily life activities. To measure the EEG from participants who freely moved while playing the game, we developed EEG devices that incorporated a wireless time synchronization system using Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) signals. These devices stamped the time obtained from the GPS signals onto each data sample, which was then used to synchronize the data that were recorded by different devices. When the batter in the game swung and missed, the error-related negativity component of the event-related EEG potential was strongly evoked in frontal electrodes of the participant controlling the batter. Furthermore, the error-related negativity was modulated according to who was winning and by how much. Thus, here we have demonstrated "real-world" brain activity using a competitive consumer game, which increases intrinsic participant motivation.

In this approach, an Emotiv Epoc (R) was modified to enable it to record in the parieto-central area. All subjects (15 healthy individuals) performed a visual oddball task while connected to both devices to obtain electrophysiological data and behavioral responses for comparative analysis. A Pearson's correlation analysis revealed a good between-devices correlation with respect to electrophysiological measures. The present study not only corroborates previous reports on the ability of the Emotiv Epoc (R) to suitably record EEG data but presents an alternative device that allows the study of a wide range of psychophysiological experiments with simultaneous behavioral and mobile EEG recordings.

This study was designed to test the role of the PFC in the early modality-specific modulation of event-related potentials (ERPs) generated during a sensory selection task. The task required participants to make a scaled motor response to the amplitudes of visual and tactile stimuli presented individually or concurrently. Task relevance was manipulated and continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) was used to transiently inhibit PFC activity to test the contribution of the PFC to modulation of sensory gating. Electroencephalography (EEG) was collected from participants both before and after cTBS was applied. The somatosensory-evoked N70 ERP was shown to be modulated by task relevance before but not after cTBS was applied to the PFC, and downregulating PFC activity through the use of cTBS abolished any relevancy differences in N70 amplitude. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that early modality-specific changes in cortical somatosensory processing are modulated by attention, and that this effect is subserved by prefrontal cortical activity.

EEG time-frequency analysis provides arguments for arm swing support in human gait control	GAIT & POSTURE			English	Article						Arm swing; Gait cycle; Supplementary motor area (SMA); Ambulant electroencephalography (EEG); Event Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP)	SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; FRONTAL-LOBE; SPINAL-CORD; CORTEX; MOVEMENT; WALKING; SYNCHRONIZATION; POTENTIALS	Background: Human gait benefits from arm swing, which requires four-limb co-ordination. The Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) is involved in multi-limb coordination. With its location anterior to the leg motor cortex and the pattern of its connections, this suggests a distinct role in gait control. Research question: Is the SMA functionally implicated in gait-related arm swing? Methods: Ambulant electroencephalography (EEG) was employed during walking with and without arm swing in twenty healthy subjects (mean age: 64.9yrs, SD 7.2). Power changes across the EEG frequency spectrum were assessed by Event Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP) analysis over both the putative SMA at electrode position Fz and additional sensorimotor regions. Results: During walking with arm swing, midline electrodes Fz and Cz showed a step-related pattern of Event Related Desynchronization (ERD) followed by Event Related Synchronization (ERS). Walking without arm swing was associated with significant ERD-ERS power reduction in the high-beta/low-gamma band over Fz and a power increase over Cz. Electrodes C3 and C4 revealed a pattern of ERD during contralateral- and ERS during ipsilateral leg swing. This ERD power decreased in gait without arm swing (low-frequency band). The ERSP pattern during walking with arm swing was similar at CP1 and CP2: ERD was seen during double support and the initial swing phase of the right leg, while a strong ERS emerged during the second half of the left leg's swing. Walking without arm swing showed a significant power reduction of this ERD-ERS pattern over CP2, while over CP1, ERS during left leg's swing turned into ERD. Conclusion: The relation between arm swing in walking and a step-related ERD-ERS pattern in the high-beta/low-gamma band over the putative SMA, points at an SMA contribution to integrated cyclic anti-phase movements of upper- and lower limbs. This supports a cortical underpinning of arm swing support in gait control.

This turns our attention to potentially objective neuroimaging, methods. Paradigms based on electroencephalography (EEG) are most suited for bedside applications, but sensitive to artifacts. These problems are especially pronounced in pediatric patients. We present the first study on the assessment of pediatric DOC patients by means of command-following procedures and involving long-latency cognitive event-related potentials. To deal with the above mentioned challenges, we construct a specialized signal processing scheme including artifact correction and rejection, parametrization, classification and final assessment of the statistical significance. To compensate for the possible bias of the tests involved in the final diagnosis, we propose the Monte Carlo evaluation of the processing pipeline. To compensate for possible sensory impairments of DOC patients, for each subject we check command-following responses to the stimuli in the major modalities: visual, tactile, and audio (words and sounds). We test the scheme on 20 healthy volunteers and present results for 15 patients from a hospital for children with severe brain damage, in relation to their behavioral diagnosis on the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R).

Previous EEG studies on the effect of MPH in ADHD found changes in evoked response potential (ERP) components that were inconsistent between studies. These inconsistencies highlight the need for a well-designed study which includes multiple baseline sessions and controls for possible fatigue, learning effects and between-days variability. To this end, we employ a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study and explore the effect of MPH on the ERP response of subjects with ADHD during a Go/No-Go cognitive task. Our ERP analysis revealed significant differences in ADHD subjects between the placebo and MPH conditions in the frontal-parietal region at 250ms-400ms post stimulus (P3). Additionally, a decrease in the late 650ms-800ms ERP component (LC) is observed in frontal electrodes of ADHD subjects compared to controls. The standard deviation of response time of ADHD subjects was significantly smaller in the MPH condition compared to placebo and correlated with the increased P3 ERP response in the frontoparietal electrodes. We suggest that mental fatigue plays a role in the decrease of the P3 response in the placebo condition compared to pre-placebo, a phenomenon that is significant in ADHD subjects but not in controls, and which is interestingly rectified by MPH.

Most of these studies have employed subjective rating scales to assess processes and outcomes of exposure to nature, while only few of them have used physiological measures to assess the neural correlates of these benefits. The present study used electroencephalography (EEG) to explore how the brain engages in processing of images of natural vs. urban scenery. During EEG recording, the participants (n = 32) were presented with a series of photos depicting urban or natural scenery. Participants rated the sceneries for their subjective relaxing value. Images of natural scenery were rated as more relaxing compared to the images of urban scenery. Event related potentials suggested a lower attentional demand for images of natural scenery compared to urban ones. Signal spectral analyses revealed differences in brain activity level and cognitive demand between natural and urban scenery. Our data suggest that the visual perception of natural environments calls for less attentional and cognitive processing, compared with urban ones.

These findings highlight the significance of applying multivariate pattern recognition to the multimodal data (such as neural responses) to predict dynamic categorical representations relevant to social interaction.

Attentional modulation of neural responses to illusory shapes: Evidence from steady-state and evoked visual potentials	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Spatial attention; Modal completion; Illusory contours; Electroencephalography (EEG); Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs); Event-related potentials (ERPs)	KANIZSA SUBJECTIVE FIGURES; SPATIAL ATTENTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; FILLING-IN; EEG-DATA; CONTOURS; PERCEPTION; MECHANISMS; CORTEX; SIGNATURE	Our perception of illusory shapes, such as the classic Kanizsa triangle, is thought to reflect the visual system's capacity to fill in missing information associated with fragmented or partially occluded objects. Previous work has suggested that such 'modal' filling-in arises at relatively early stages of visual processing, prior to the allocation of focused attention, but few studies have examined whether attention influences neural responses to illusory shapes. Here we asked whether spatial attention affects neural activity evoked by illusory shapes by having participants focus on stimuli presented in one visual field (left or right), while ignoring those on the other side. In two separate experiments, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs; Experiment 1) and event-related potentials (ERPs; Experiment 2), elicited by a Kanizsa square in one hemifield and a competing control stimulus, matched for all relevant physical features, in the other. In Experiment 1, the inducers used to construct the Kanizsa and control stimuli flickered at unique frequencies (10 and 13.33 Hz) to elicit SSVEPs. In Experiment 2, segments were removed briefly from static circular placeholders within the left and right visual hemifields to induce ERPs. In both experiments, participants were instructed to attend covertly to the stimulus on the left or right side to detect brief contrast changes of the inducers. SSVEP analyses revealed that illusory shapes that were ignored yielded a significantly larger neural response than those elicited by non-illusory control stimuli. By contrast, when the stimuli were attended, neural responses to the illusory and control stimuli were statistically indistinguishable. Consistent with these steady-state findings, results of the ERP analyses revealed that evoked responses to illusory shapes emerged earlier relative to control stimuli when they were ignored than when they were attended. Taken together the findings suggest that neural activity associated with modal completion is reliably modulated by spatial attention. Specifically, we show that neural responses to actively ignored illusory shapes are elicited earlier and are sustained at a higher amplitude than responses to control stimuli. This advantage for ignored shapes might reflect adaptive signalling of the presence of an object available for future goal-directed behaviour.

Electroencephalography reveals a selective disruption of cognitive control processes in craving cigarette smokers	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						addiction; craving; EEG; event-related potentials; nicotine	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; NICOTINE DEPENDENCE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURAL MECHANISMS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ERP COMPONENT; SMOKING; TASK	Addiction to nicotine is extremely challenging to overcome, and the intense craving for the next cigarette often leads to relapse in smokers who wish to quit. To dampen the urges of craving and inhibit unwanted behaviour, smokers must harness cognitive control, which is itself impaired in addiction. It is likely that craving may interact with cognitive control, and the present study sought to test the specificity of such interactions. To this end, data from 24 smokers were gathered using EEG and behavioural measures in a craving session (following a three-hour nicotine abstention period) and a non-craving session (having just smoked). In both sessions, participants performed a task probing various facets of cognitive control (response inhibition, task switching and conflict processing). Results showed that craving smokers were less flexible with the implementation of cognitive control, with demands of task switching and incongruency yielding greater deficits under conditions of craving. Importantly, inhibitory control was not affected by craving, suggesting that the interactions of craving and cognitive control are selective. Together, these results provide evidence that smokers already exhibit specific control-related deficits after brief nicotine deprivation. This disruption of cognitive control while craving may help to explain why abstinence is so difficult to maintain.

EEG-Based Neurocognitive Metrics May Predict Simulated and On-Road Driving Performance in Older Drivers	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; event related potentials; sustained attention; driving; HIV; neurodegeneration; driving impairment test; on-road evaluation	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EARLY ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; QUANTITATIVE EEG; HIV PATIENTS; DEMENTIA; SLEEP; BRAIN	The number of older drivers is steadily increasing, and advancing age is associated with a high rate of automobile crashes and fatalities. This can be attributed to a combination of factors including decline in sensory, motor, and cognitive functions due to natural aging or neurodegenerative diseases such as HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND). Current clinical assessment methods only modestly predict impaired driving. Thus, there is a need for inexpensive and scalable tools to predict on-road driving performance. In this study EEG was acquired from 39 HIV+ patients and 63 healthy participants (HP) during: 3-Choice-Vigilance Task (3CVT), a 30-min driving simulator session, and a 12-mile on-road driving evaluation. Based on driving performance, a designation of Good/Poor (simulator) and Safe/Unsafe (on-road drive) was assigned to each participant. Event-related potentials (ERPs) obtained during 3CVT showed increased amplitude of the P200 component was associated with bad driving performance both during the on-road and simulated drive. This P200 effect was consistent across the HP and HIV+ groups, particularly over the left frontal-central region. Decreased amplitude of the late positive potential (LPP) during 3CVT, particularly over the left frontal regions, was associated with bad driving performance in the simulator. These EEG ERP metrics were shown to be associated with driving performance across participants independent of HIV status. During the on-road evaluation, Unsafe drivers exhibited higher EEG alpha power compared to Safe drivers. The results of this study are 2-fold. First, they demonstrate that high-quality EEG can be inexpensively and easily acquired during simulated and on-road driving assessments. Secondly, EEG metrics acquired during a sustained attention task (3CVT) are associated with driving performance, and these metrics could potentially be used to assess whether an individual has the cognitive skills necessary for safe driving.

All participants were tested in Simple Response Task (SRT) and Discriminative Response Task (DRT). A subset of 36 participants was tested also in Passive Vision task. Both pre- and post-stimulus ERPs were analyzed and compared among different tasks. Spatiotemporal patterns of all the observed components were analyzed using source analysis. Beside the well-known ERP components, we also described recently identified prefrontal components: the pre-stimulus prefrontal negativity (pN) associated to proactive cognitive (mainly inhibitory) control within the inferior frontal gyrus (iFg); the post-stimulus prefrontal N1, P1 and P2 (pN1, pP1 and pP2) involved in perceptual and visual-motor awareness (pN1 and pP1), and in stimulus-response mapping and decision-making (pP2) localized within the insular cortex. The large sample of high-quality EEG datasets allowed to identify four additional components: the pre-stimulus visual negativity (vN) originating in extrastriate visual areas and interpreted as a visual readiness activity; the post-stimulus prefrontal N2 and N3 (pN2 and pN3) components interpreted as feedback reactivation of the anterior insular cortex; and the post-stimulus prefrontal P3 (pP3), interpreted as persisting inhibitory activity of the iFg for inhibited trials.

Neurophysiological measures by electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) could increase the accuracy of predicting sensorimotor upper limb recovery. New method: The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the current evidence for EEG/MEG-based measures to index neural activity after stroke and the relationship between abnormal neural activity and sensorimotor upper limb impairment. Relevant papers from databases EMBASE, CINHAL, MEDLINE and pubMED were identified. Methodological quality of selected studies was assessed with the Modified Downs and Black form. Data collected was reported descriptively. Results: Seventeen papers were included; 13 used EEG and 4 used MEG applications. Findings showed that: (a) the presence of somatosensory evoked potentials in the acute stage are related to better outcome of upper limb motor impairment from 10 weeks to 6 months post-stroke; (b) an interhemispheric imbalance of cortical oscillatory signals associated with upper limb impairment; and (c) predictive models including beta oscillatory cortical signal factors with corticospinal integrity and clinical measures could enhance upper limb motor prognosis. Comparing with existing method: The combination of neurological biomarkers with clinical measures results in higher statistical power than using neurological biomarkers alone when predicting motor recovery in stroke. Conclusions: Alterations in neural activity by means of EEG and MEG are demonstrated from the early post-stroke stage onwards, and related to sensorimotor upper limb impairment.

Separating normosmic and anosmic patients based on entropy evaluation of olfactory event-related potentials	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Olfaction; EEG; Anosmia; Diagnosis; Shannon Entropy; Kozachenko-Leonenko entropy estimation	WAVELET ENTROPY; CLINICAL-SIGNIFICANCE; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; MUTUAL INFORMATION; SERIES; EEG	Objective: Methods based on electroencephalography (EEG) are used to evaluate brain responses to odors which is challenging due to the relatively low signal-to-noise ratio. This is especially difficult in patients with olfactory loss. In the present study, we aim to establish a method to separate functionally anosmic and normosmic individuals by means of recordings of olfactory event-related potentials (OERP) using an automated tool. Therefore, Shannon entropy was adopted to examine the complexity of the averaged electrophysiological responses. Methods: A total of 102 participants received 60 rose-like odorous stimuli at an inter-stimulus interval of 10 s. Olfactory-related brain activity was investigated within three time-windows of equal length; pre-, during-, and post-stimulus. Results: Based on entropy analysis, patients were correctly diagnosed for anosmia with a 75% success rate. Conclusion: This novel approach can be expected to help clinicians to identify patients with anosmia or patients with early symptoms of neurodegenerative disorders. Significance: There is no automated diagnostic tool for anosmic and normosmic patients using OERP. However, detectability of OERP in patients with functional anosmia has been reported to be in the range of 50%.

Extended categorization of conjunction object stimuli decreases the latency of attentional feature selection and recruits orthography-linked ERPs	CORTEX			English	Article						Category learning; ERP; EEG; N250; Selection negativity; Orthography; Perceptual expertise	FUSIFORM FACE AREA; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VISUAL WORD RECOGNITION; TIME-COURSE; ARTIFICIAL LANGUAGE; NAME LABELS; EXPERTISE; REPRESENTATIONS; EEG; COMPONENT	The role of attention in driving perceptual expertise effects is controversial. The current study addressed the effect of training on ERP components related to and independent of attentional feature selection. Participants learned to categorize cartoon animals over six training sessions (8,800 trials) after which ERPs were recorded during a target detection task performed on trained and untrained stimulus sets. The onset of the selection negativity, an ERP component indexing attentional modulation, was about 60 msec earlier for trained than untrained stimuli. Trained stimuli also elicited centro-parietal N200 and N320 components that were insensitive to attentional feature selection. The scalp distribution and timecourse of these components were better matched by studies of orthography than object expertise. Source localization using eLORETA suggested that the strongest neural sources of the selection negativity were in right ventral temporal cortex whereas the strongest sources of the N200/N320 components were in left ventral temporal cortex, again consistent with the hypothesis that training recruited orthography related areas. Overall, training altered neural processes related to attentional selection, but also affected neural processes that were independent of feature selection. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Audiovisual Multisensory Integration and Evoked Potentials in Young Adults With and Without Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ADHD; multisensory integration; EEG; event-related potentials; response time	SUPERIOR PARIETAL LOBULE; FOLLOW-UP; ADOLESCENTS; CHILDREN; HUMANS	The purpose of this study was to assess how young adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) process audiovisual (AV) multisensory stimuli using behavioral and neurological measures. Adults with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD (n = 10) and neurotypical controls (n = 11) completed a simple response time task, consisting of auditory, visual, and AV multisensory conditions. Continuous 64-electrode electroencephalography (EEG) was collected to assess neurological responses to each condition. The AV multisensory condition resulted in the shortest response times for both populations. Analysis using the race model (Miller, 1982) demonstrated that those with ADHD had violation of the race model earlier in the response, which may be a marker for impulsivity. EEG analysis revealed that both groups had early multisensory integration (MSI) occur following multisensory stimulus onset. There were also significant group differences in event-related potentials (ERPs) in frontal, parietal, and occipital brain regions, which are regions reported to be altered in those with ADHD. This study presents results examining multisensory processing in the population of adults with ADHD, and can be used as a foundation for future ADHD research using developmental research designs as well as the development of novel technological supports.

Previous neuroimaging studies have described altered activity in brain areas associated with reward processing following reward or punishment. This study examines the extent to which feedback-based experience of gain and loss is associated with electrophysiological correlates. Methods. Twenty-nine healthy participants used a gambling task that focused on actual nonpredictable gains and losses. During the task, an electroencephalography recording was performed in order to assess reward processing. Event-related potentials were analyzed when participants were receiving gain/loss feedback. Results. Event-related potentials revealed higher feedback-related negativity for both overall gain and loss compared with a neutral condition in fronto-centro-parietal electrodes. P3 potentials were significantly increased for high gains/losses compared to neutral and small gains/losses. Conclusion. These results indicate that the paradigm is suitable to evoke specific patterns of reward-related electrophysiological responses. The wavelet analysis showed that electroencephalography frequency variations depended on the amount of gains/losses. Significance. This gambling paradigm is appropriate to measure aspects of feedback processing and could help analyze disease-specific alterations of the reward system in patients.

The EEG signals elicited by different stimuli, such as calling by name and music, were collected from 20 patients, including 10 in a minimally conscious and 10 in a vegetative state. A classification-based assessment framework was employed, consisting of the following major components: a preprocessing step, applied to remove the noises in the EEG data; selection of two types of features, including common spatial patterns and partial least squares; and application of the multiple kernel support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to perform the training and classification. Our results indicate that the EEG features detected in severe disorders of consciousness are significant for different auditory stimuli, and the multiple kernel SVM yields the best classification performance among different classifiers. We achieved average classification accuracies of 81.24% and 94.60% for calling by name and musical stimuli, respectively. The proposed method uses EEG signals to effectively classify patients into minimally conscious and vegetative states. It could be a promising tool for quantitatively identifying states of severe disorder of consciousness, and could also provide auxiliary information for clinical assessment of the level of consciousness.

Inattentional deafness to auditory alarms: Inter-individual differences, electrophysiological signature and single trial classification	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Inattentional deafness; Electroencephalography; Event related potential; Visual dominance over hearing; Single trial classification; Auditory alarm; Flight simulator	WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ATTENTION; BLINDNESS; STRESS; ERP; SUPPRESSION; INTEGRATION; MUSICIANS; CONFLICT	Inattentional deafness can have deleterious consequences in complex real-life situations (e.g. healthcare, aviation) leading to miss critical auditory signals. Such failure of auditory attention is thought to rely on top-down biasing mechanisms at the central executive level. A complementary approach to account for this phenomenon is to consider the existence of visual dominance over hearing that could be implemented via direct visual-to-auditory pathways. To investigate this phenomenon, thirteen aircraft pilots, equipped with a 32-channel EEG system, faced a low and high workload scenarii along with an auditory oddball task in a motion flight simulator. Prior to the flying task, the pilots were screened to assess their working memory span and visual dominance susceptibility. The behavioral results disclosed that the volunteers missed 57.7% of the auditory alarms in the difficult condition. Among all evaluated capabilities, only the visual dominance index was predictive of the miss rate in the difficult scenario. These findings provide behavioral evidences that other early cross-modal competitive process than top down modulation process could account for inattentional deafness. The electrophysiological analyses showed that the miss over the hit alarms led to a significant amplitude reduction of early perceptual (N100) and late attentional (P3a and P3b) event-related potentials components. Eventually, we implemented an EEG-based processing pipeline to perform single-trial classification of inattentional deafness. The results indicate that this processing chain could be used in an ecological setting as it led to 72.2% mean accuracy to discriminate missed from hit auditory alarms.	[Dehais, F.; Roy, R.

The current study reviewed 68 research reports that focused on psychopathy and various components of EEG. We examined early, mid, and late level ERP processing as well as spectra analyses. The results indicate that psychopathic individuals exhibit generally unencumbered performance categorizing cognitive stimuli and demonstrate the typical facilitation of physical responses commensurate with an intact orienting response. Moreover, the results suggest that individuals with elevated psychopathic traits are especially adept at screening out distracting threat-related and other irrelevant information allowing them to allocate attention to stimuli that are goal-relevant. Those with elevated psychopathic traits also do not appear to have significant impairments in associative learning or error processing. Where psychopathic individuals diverge most from those with low levels of these traits is in relation to processing affect-laden content. In some contexts, psychopathic individuals appear to quickly terminate the processing of emotional information and in other contexts (e.g., seeing others in pain) they elaborately process emotional information both of which may help explain their prototypical lack of conscience. Much of the aberrant functioning of those with elevated psychopathic traits depends on the psychopathy factor being examined with F1 traits showing less cognitive impairment than F2 traits. Recommendations for future research are provided.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the mental fatigue effects on brain areas by dynamic casual modeling (DCM) parameters that are extracted from event-related potential (ERP) signals which were then estimated based on mental fatigue data with visual stimulation. METHODS: ERP were recorded based on a Continuous Performance Task in four consecutive trials. Active regions and brain sources were extracted by a Multiple Sparse Priors algorithm. RESULTS: Four models are proposed for DCM. The parameters and the structure of the best model were obtained by SPM software for ERP in each of the four trials. CONCLUSION: The results illustrate that an increase of mental fatigue through trials leads to increased likelihood of choosing forward models.

However, the mechanisms underlying this "survival processing effect" are still controversial. To address this issue, we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine the recognition retrieval processes associated with words previously encoded in either a survival or a control scenario. More specifically, we investigated how recollection- and familiarity-based retrieval are influenced by survival processing of high- and low-imageability words. Participants incidentally encoded words and then completed a surprise recognition test while their EEG was recorded. The encoding of concrete, high-imageability words in a survival context lead to improved recognition memory compared to the control context, and this improvement was associated with an increase in both the ROC and ERP measures of recollection-based memory retrieval. Survival processing was also associated with an increase in the ERP familiarity signal for these words, but the ROC analysis indicated that recognition judgments relied upon recollection rather than familiarity. These findings provide evidence that survival processing increases elaboration during encoding, leading to greater recollection at retrieval and, in turn, enhanced memory.

J	Volz, K; Stark, R; Vaitl, D; Ambach, W				Volz, Katja; Stark, Rudolf; Vaitl, Dieter; Ambach, Wolfgang			Event-related potentials differ between true and false memories in the misinformation paradigm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						False memory; EEG; Misinformation paradigm; Memory	CONCEALED INFORMATION TEST; COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; RETRIEVAL ORIENTATION; ERP; P300; RECOLLECTION; RECOGNITION; PERFORMANCE; INTEGRATION	Several studies investigating psychophysiological correlates of false memories suggest that psychophysiology may provide incremental information to subjectively reported memory. Based on previous findings in a Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm, we examined three components of event-related EEG potentials of memory in a misleading information paradigm. 39 participants watched a video that included eight randomized details (e.g., the color of an envelope). After a retention interval of one week, four out of eight details were replaced by misleading details in a narrative text. Afterward, EEG was derived during a recognition test. First, we found that the amplitude at parietal electrodes did not differ between true and false memories. Instead, parietal positivity was more pronounced during yes-compared to no-responses, indicating parietal positivity reflects subjectively reported memory. Second, we found more positive frontal amplitudes associated with false compared to true memories in late time windows. Consequently, our findings indicate that false memories differ from true memories with respect to late frontal activation. In conclusion, we assume that parietal positivity reflects subjectively experienced memory, whereas late frontal activation holds incremental information to the subjectively experienced and reported memory.

Its focus is on changes in electrical signals, including summated generator potentials that occur after nasal or oral stimulation. In the first part of the review, we describe tools available to the clinician for assessing olfactory and nasotrigeminal function, including modern electroencephalography (EEG) analysis of brain responses both in the time domain and in the time-frequency (TF) domain. Particular attention is paid to chemosensory event- related potentials (CSERPs) and their potential use in medical-legal cases. Additionally, we focus on the changes of summated generator potentials from the olfactory and respiratory nasal epithelium that could provide new diagnostic insights. In the second part, we describe gustatory event-related potentials (gCSERPs) obtained using a relatively new computer controlled gustometer. A device for presenting different pulses of electrical current to the tongue is also described, with weaker pulses likely reflecting gCSERPs and stronger ones trigeminal CSERPs. Finally, summated generator potentials from the surface of the tongue during gustatory stimulation are described that may prove useful for examining peripheral taste function.

In the present study, we investigated whether the LPC tracks the strength of multiple types of memory signals, and whether it does so in a decision dependent manner. For this purpose, we employed judgements of cumulative lifetime exposure to object concepts, and judgements of cumulative recent exposure (i.e., frequency judgements) in a study-test paradigm. A comparison of ERP signatures in relation to degree of prior exposure across the two memory tasks and the study phase revealed that the LPC tracks both types of memory signals, but only when they are relevant to the decision at hand. Another ERP component previously implicated in recognition memory, the FN400, showed a distinct pattern of activity across conditions that differed from the LPC; it tracked only recent exposure in a decision-dependent manner. Another similar ERP component typically linked to conceptual processing in past work, the N400, was sensitive to degree of recent and lifetime exposure, but it did not track them in a decision dependent manner. Finally, source localization analyses pointed to a potential source of the LPC in left ventral lateral parietal cortex, which also showed the decision-dependent effect. The current findings highlight the role of decision making in ERP markers of prior exposure in tasks other than those typically used in studies of recognition memory, and provides an initial link between the LPC and the previously suggested role of ventral lateral parietal cortex in memory judgements.

Brain Painting has shown to improve the Quality of Life (QOL) of patients with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), by giving patients a way to express themselves and affect society through their art [1]. Although there is currently no known cure for ALS, through such outlets we can help mitigate the physical and psychological impairments of those living with ALS. This paper discusses the development and testing of an immersive Brain Painting application using a Google brush-like tool in a 3D Environment, for able-bodied users. It also discusses how it can help provide a more immersive medium for users to express themselves creatively. In addition, we also discuss feedback received from a preliminary study on how the brush and application can be improved to better allow users to paint in VR using their brain.

Event-related neural oscillation changes following reasoning training in individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Mild Cognitive Impairment; Cognitive training; EEG; Theta; Alpha; Go/NoGo	OLDER-ADULTS; INTERVENTION PROGRAMS; RESPONSE PRODUCTION; DIRECTED ATTENTION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; FRONTAL THETA; EEG ALPHA; MEMORY; INHIBITION	Emerging evidence suggests cognitive training programs targeting higher-order reasoning may strengthen not only cognitive, but also neural functions in individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). However, research on direct measures of training-induced neural changes, derivable from electroencephalography (EEG), is limited. The current pilot study examined effects of Gist Reasoning training (n = 16) compared to New Learning training (n = 16) in older adults with amnestic MCI on measures of event-related neural oscillations (theta and alpha band power) corresponding to Go/NoGo tasks during basic and superordinate semantic categorization. EEG data were recorded while participants performed the Go/NoGo task pre- and post-training, and power in theta and alpha frequency bands was examined. Both groups were comparable at pre-training on all measures and both groups showed greater event-related theta synchronization post-training. Furthermore, the Gist Reasoning group had enhanced event-related desynchronization in low-frequency alpha band (8-10 Hz)on response inhibition (NoGo) trials and high-frequency alpha band (11-13 Hz) on response execution (Go) trials during superordinate categorization, relative to the New Learning group. These findings suggest that Gist Reasoning training in MCI impacted neural processing linked to strategic processing of Go and NoGo trials during the more complex superordinate categorization task. Targeting higher-order top-down cognitive processing seems to better harness residual neuroplastic potential in MCI.

Removal of Gross Artifacts of Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation in Simultaneous EEG Monitoring	SENSORS			English	Article						EEG; tACS; artifact removal; adaptive filter	BRAIN-STIMULATION; OSCILLATIONS; EEG/MEG; TDCS	Transcranial electrical stimulation is a widely used non-invasive brain stimulation approach. To date, EEG has been used to evaluate the effect of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS), but most studies have been limited to exploring changes in EEG before and after stimulation due to the presence of stimulation artifacts in the EEG data. This paper presents two different algorithms for removing the gross tACS artifact from simultaneous EEG recordings. These give different trade-offs in removal performance, in the amount of data required, and in their suitability for closed loop systems. Superposition of Moving Averages and Adaptive Filtering techniques are investigated, with significant emphasis on verification. We present head phantom testing results for controlled analysis, together with on-person EEG recordings in the time domain, frequency domain, and Event Related Potential (ERP) domain. The results show that EEG during tACS can be recovered free of large scale stimulation artifacts. Previous studies have not quantified the performance of the tACS artifact removal procedures, instead focusing on the removal of second order artifacts such as respiration related oscillations. We focus on the unresolved challenge of removing the first order stimulation artifact, presented with a new multi-stage validation strategy.

Neural field theory of evoked response potentials in a spherical brain geometry	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NEOCORTICAL DYNAMICS; WAVES; EEG; SLEEP; NETWORKS; MODEL; OSCILLATIONS; PROPAGATION; PREDICTION	Evoked response potentials (ERPs) are calculated in spherical and planar geometries using neural field theory of the corticothalamic system. The ERP is modeled as an impulse response and the resulting modal effects of spherical corticothalamic dynamics are explored, showing that results for spherical and planar geometries converge in the limit of large brain size. Cortical modal effects can lead to a double-peak structure in the ERP time series. It is found that the main difference between infinite planar geometry and spherical geometry is that the ERP peak is sharper and stronger in the spherical geometry. It is also found that the magnitude of the response decreases with increasing spatial width of the stimulus at the cortex. The peak is slightly delayed at large angles from the stimulus point, corresponding to group velocities of 6-10 m s(-1). Strong modal effects are found in the spherical geometry, with the lowest few modes sufficing to describe the main features of ERPs, except very near to spatially narrow stimuli.	[Mukta, K.

Such preferential activation appears in the N1 event-related potential (ERP) over the occipitotemporal scalp after around 150-250 ms and the corresponding blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in the ventral occipitotemporal (vOT) cortex. Here, orthography-sensitive (print vs. false font) processing was examined using simultaneous EEG-fMRI in 38 first grade children with poor and typical reading skills, and at varying familial risk for developmental dyslexia. Coarse orthographic sensitivity was observed as an increased activation to print in the N1 ERP and in the BOLD signal of individually varying vOT regions in 57% of beginning readers. Finer differentiation in processing orthographic strings (words vs. nonwords) further occurred in specific vOT clusters. Neither method alone showed robust differences in orthography-sensitive processing between typical and poor reading children. Importantly, using single-trial N1 ERP-informed fMRI analysis, we found differential modulation of the orthography-sensitive BOLD response in the left vOT for typical readers only. This result, thus, confirms subtle functional alterations in a brain structure known to be critical for fluent reading at the very beginning of reading instruction.

Event-related potentials reveal the time-course of exploratory decisions	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Explore/exploit dilemma; Reward positivity; N200; P300; Response conflict	ADAPTIVE GAIN; LOCUS; NOREPINEPHRINE; CONFLICT; DOPAMINE; NEURONS; EEG; EXPLOITATION; INFORMATION; BEHAVIOR	The decision trade-off between exploiting the known and exploring the unknown has been studied using a variety of approaches and techniques. Surprisingly, electroencephalography (EEG) has been underused in this area of study, even though its high temporal resolution has the potential to reveal the time-course of exploratory decisions. We addressed this issue by recording EEG data while participants tried to win as many points as possible in a two-choice gambling task called a two-armed bandit. After using a computational model to classify responses as either exploitations or explorations, we examined event-related potentials locked to two events preceding decisions to exploit/explore: the arrival of feedback, and the subsequent appearance of the next trial's choice stimuli. In particular, we examined the feedback-locked P300 component, thought to index a phasic release of norepinephrine (a neural interrupt signal), and the reward positivity, thought to index a phasic release of dopamine (a neural prediction error signal). We observed an exploration-dependent enhancement of the P300 only, suggesting a critical role of norepinephrine (but not dopamine) in triggering decisions to explore. Similarly, we examined the N200/P300 components evoked by the appearance of the choice stimuli. In this case, exploration was characterized by an enhancement of the N200, but not P300, a result we attribute to increased response conflict. These results demonstrate the usefulness of combining computational and EEG methodologies, and suggest that exploratory decisions are preceded by two characterizing events: a feedback-locked neural interrupt signal (enhanced P300), and a choice-locked increase in response conflict (enhanced N200).

Event-related potentials were recorded while subjects learned to categorize a visual stimulus that required integration of different physical dimensions. Feedback was provided following the subject's response. High learners achieved about 80% accuracy while low learners remained slightly above chance performance. A feedback-related negativity (FRN) peaking at about 340 ms became less negative-going as the study progressed. This FRN did not however differ between the two groups. On the other hand, the P300, peaking at about 400 was significantly larger following correct feedback for the high than low learners. Importantly, this P300 difference emerged early in learning and was predictive of future performance. The P300 following incorrect feedback increased in amplitude across the study for the high learners but did not change for low learners. A later positivity, peaking at about 625 ms following incorrect feedback was especially large for the high learners when it had a low probability of occurrence, after learning had occurred. The ERP group differences suggest a discrepancy in the utilization of feedback prior to and following learning.

J	Tanaka, H; Miyakoshi, M				Tanaka, Hirokazu; Miyakoshi, Makoto			Cross-correlation task-related component analysis (xTRCA) for enhancing evoked and induced responses of event-related potentials	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG data analysis; Multivariate analysis; Trial-by-trial reproducibility; Generalized eigenvalue problem; Matrix perturbation; Woody's method; Evoked response; Induced response	SPATIAL FILTERS; ERP COMPONENTS; LATENCY; VARIABILITY; RELIABILITY; DYNAMICS; SIGNALS; P3A	We propose an analysis method that extracts trial-reproducible (i.e., recurring) event-related spatiotemporal EEG patterns by optimizing a spatial filter as well as trial timings of task-related components in the time domain simultaneously in a unified manner. Event-related responses are broadly categorized into evoked and induced responses, but those are analyzed commonly in the time and the time-frequency domain, respectively. To facilitate a comparison of evoked and induced responses, a unified method for analyzing both evoked and induced responses is desired. Here we propose a method of cross-correlation task-related component analysis (xTRCA) as an extension of our previous method. xTRCA constructs a linear spatial filter and then optimizes trial timings of single trials based on trial reproducibility as an objective function. The spatial filter enhances event-related responses, and the temporal optimization compensates trial-by-trial latencies that are inherent to ERPs. We first applied xTRCA to synthetic data of induced responses whose phases varied from trial to trial, and found that xTRCA could realign the induced responses by compensating the phase differences. We then demonstrated with mismatch negativity data that xTRCA enhanced the event-related-potential waveform observed at a single channel. Finally, a classification accuracy was improved when trial timings were optimized by xTRCA, suggesting a practical application of the method for a brain computer interface. We conclude that xTRCA provides a unified framework to analyze and enhance event-related evoked and induced responses in the time domain by objectively maximizing trial reproducibility.

Data was collected from both systems using the lab streaming layer (LSL). Both EEG systems recorded an electric signal from the surface of a customised gel phantom. The electric signal was generated using a solar cell which was illuminated by a monitor presenting a sequence of black and white images. Test results show that the g.Tec had a mean delay of 51.22 ms from the stimulus onset and the Emotiv had a mean delay of 162.69 ms from the stimulus onset. The result should be taken into account with future ERP studies which will use either the EEG system and the lab streaming layer. The design of this experiment provides a smart way to evaluate the temporal accuracy of other EEG systems.

The home page of mobile games, especially the design of the navigation interface, has a significant impact on users' initial experience, which is an important determent to users' preferences and purchase decision. Hence, measuring users' perceptual experiences of the navigation interface can help designers understand real demands from users. Previous studies primarily used self-report scales or interviews to measure gamers' perceptual experiences. However, it may not reflect gamers' real perceptions that they are feeling as most of time the feeling is short-lived and implicit. To fill this gap, the current study attempted to combine subjective evaluation with event-related potentials (ERP) to objectively measure gamers' perceptual experience evoked by the navigation interface of the mobile game. The navigation interfaces of mobile games with low, medium, and high perceptual experience were developed and the ERP experiment was conducted to detect the differences in users' electroencephalograph (EEG) components when subjects were exposed to the different design levels of navigation interface. The results showed that N1 reaction showed asymmetry in brain regions, and P2 and N2 showed symmetry, and relative to the navigation interface with low and medium perceptual experiences, the high level of navigation interface induced a larger amplitude of N2 in the anterior scalp and P2 in the frontal scalp. These EEG components can, therefore, be regarded as significant indicators reflecting gamers' perceptions of the navigation interface. The findings benefit game companies of navigation interface designs.

Method: We review the diagnostic approaches available in the field, from clinical scales to neuroimaging methods, and concentrate upon measures derived from electroencephalographic event related potentials. Results: Evoked potentials were recorded in five procedures, encompassing visual, auditory and tactile modalities, from ten pediatric DoC patients-six in a minimally conscious state (MCS), three in unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and one who emerged from MCS (eMCS)-and the control group of 10 healthy children. In almost all the eMCS and MCS patients, higher amplitude of P300 was observed and the effect was statistically significant in at least one out of the five performed procedures. Additionally, signs of conscious information processing were detected in one UWS patient. Conclusion: The presented results provide a proof of concept for the possibility of applying ERP-derived electrophysiological measures as an aid in the assessment of children and adolescents in DoC.

Despite the application of time-frequency analysis (TFA) to extract the temporal and spectral characteristics of non-phase-locked component (NPLC) of interest simultaneously, the statistical results are not always expectedly satisfying, in that the spatial information is not considered. Complex Morlet wavelet transform is widely applied to TFA of event-related-potential (ERP) data, and mother wavelet (which should be firstly defined by center frequency and bandwidth (CFBW) before using the method to TFA of ERP data) influences the time-frequency results. In this study, an optimal set of CFBW was firstly selected from the number sets of CFBW, to further analyze for TFA of the ERP data in a cognitive experiment paradigm of emotion (Anger and Neutral) and task (Go and Nogo). Then tensor decomposition algorithm was introduced to investigate the NPLC of interest from the fourth-order tensor. Compared with the TFA results which only revealed a significant difference between Go and Nogo task condition, the tensor-based analysis showed significant interaction effect between emotion and task. Moreover, significant differences were found in both emotion and task conditions through tensor decomposition. In addition, the statistical results of TFA would be affected by the selected region of interest (ROI), whereas those of the proposed method were not subject to ROI. Hence, this study demonstrated that tensor decomposition method was effective in extracting NPLC, by considering spatial information simultaneously as the potential to explore the brain mechanisms related to experimental design.

Findings showed neurophysiology yielding large effect sizes, with the majority of studies examining electroencephalography and eye-related outcome measures. Effect sizes on neurophysiological outcomes were smaller than effect sizes on behavioral outcomes, however. Neurophysiological outcomes were, but behavioral outcomes were not, influenced by several modulating factors. These factors included the sensory system in which learning took place, number of learning days, whether feedback on performance was provided, and age of participants. Controlling for these factors resulted in the effect size differences between behavior and neurophysiology to disappear. The findings of the current meta-analysis demonstrate that neurophysiology is an appropriate measure in assessing learning, particularly when taking into account factors that could have an influence on neurophysiology.

However, such real-life-like stimulation by videos or virtual-reality environments may serve as powerful means of creating specific cognitive or affective states and help to investigate dysfunctions in psychiatric and neurological disorders more efficiently. This study aims to develop a method to generate ERPs and EROs during watching videos. Repeated luminance changes were introduced on short video segments, while EEGs of 10 subjects were recorded. The ERP/EROs time-locked to these distortions were analyzed in time and time-frequency domains and tested for their cognitive significance through a long term memory test that included frames from the watched videos. For each subject, ERPs and EROs corresponding to video segments of recalled images with 25% shortest and 25% longest reaction times were compared. ERPs produced by transient luminance changes displayed statistically significant fluctuations both in time and time-frequency domains. Statistical analyses showed that a positivity around 450 ms, a negativity around 500 ms and delta and theta EROs correlated with memory performance. Few studies mixed video streams with simultaneous ERP/ERO experiments with discrete task-relevant or passively presented auditory or somatosensory stimuli, while the present study, by obtaining ERPs and EROs to task-irrelevant events in the same sensory modality as that of the continuous sensory input, produces minimal interference with the main focus of attention on the video stream.

It evaluates the neurophysiological activities of human emotion using electroencephalography (EEG). This study is aimed to classify a comparison of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal to observe human reflection towards relaxation state of mind during divine Quran recitation and listening to music. The objectives of this study is to measure the changes in alpha band and prove that the brain is less active when the subject is listening to Quran compared to music. Six healthy subjects were recruited to measure their behaviors of the mind for a total duration of three minutes. We have highlighted the observation in Topographic Map of the brain through ERP Analysis to observe whether the brain experience any changes. The results showed that the brain activity is less active and the Alpha Power is higher when the subject is listening to Quran Recitation. We conclude that listening to Quran Recitation is a useful tool for a healthy and happy mind which can help people recognize the need of Islamic practice in human life.

The staging model would gain specificity if one or more quantifiable biological markers could be identified. Several biomarkers reflecting possible causal mechanisms and/or consequences of the pathophysiology are candidates for integration into the clinical staging model of psychiatric illnesses. Methods This review covers the evolution (from stage 0 to stage 4) of the most important brain functioning impairments as measured with electroencephalography (EEG), in psychosis spectrum and in severe mood disorders. Results The present review of the literature demonstrates that it is currently not possible to draw any conclusion with regard to the state or trait character of any of the EEG impairments in both major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. As for schizophrenia, the most promising markers of the stage of the illness are the pitch mismatch negativity as well as the p300 event-related potentials, as these components seem to deteriorate with increasing severity of the illness. Conclusions Given the complexity of major psychiatric disorders, and that not a single impairment can be observed in all patients, future research should most likely consider combinations of markers in the quest for a better identification of the stages of the psychiatric illnesses.

These auditory ERP modulations have been proposed to reflect internal predictions about the sensory consequences of our actions and more generally about our sensory context. The present exploratory ERP study (1) compared the processing of self-triggered tones by either intention-based or stimulus-driven actions, and (2) studied the impact of impulsivity traits on the prediction of action-effects. Our results are consistent with an early distinction, before N1, between tones triggered by intention-based actions and tones triggered by stimulus-driven actions. Moreover, we observed an enhanced N2b for deviant stimuli triggered by intention-based actions only. In addition, N2b modulations were correlated with impulsiveness scores. Altogether our results suggest that action-effect prediction is stronger in intention-based actions and impaired in impulsive participants but replication studies are needed to corroborate the reported findings.

Prior Emotional Context Modulates Early Event-Related Potentials to Neutral Retrieval Cues	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EPISODIC RETRIEVAL; NEURAL ACTIVITY; BOLD SIGNAL; MEMORY; VALENCE; ERP; REACTIVATION; SPECIFICITY; CORTEX; RECAPITULATION	Memory retrieval is thought to involve the reactivation of encoding processes. Previous fMRI work has indicated that reactivation processes are modulated by the residual effects of the prior emotional encoding context; different spatial patterns emerge during retrieval of memories previously associated with negative compared with positive or neutral context. Other research suggests that event-related potential (ERP) indicators of memory retrieval processes, like the left parietal old/new effect, can also be modulated by emotional context, but the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of these effects are unclear. In the current study, we examined "when" emotion affects recognition memory and whether that timing reflects processes that come before and may guide successful retrieval or postrecollection recovery of emotional episodic detail. While recording EEG, participants (n = 25) viewed neutral words paired with negative, positive, or neutral pictures during encoding, followed by a recognition test for the words. Analyses focused on ERPs during the recognition test. In line with prior ERP studies, we found an early positive-going parietally distributed effect starting around 200 msec after retrieval-cue onset. This effect emerged for words that had been encoded in an emotional compared with neutral context (no valence differences), before the general old/new effect. This emotion-dependent effect occurred in an early time window, suggesting that emotion-related reactivation is a precursor to successful recognition.

The question of how various face-related systems and functions may be bound together remains an active area of investigation. We hypothesize that face processing may be associated with specific frequency band oscillations that serve to integrate distributed face processing systems. Using a multimodal imaging approach, including electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), simultaneous signals were acquired during face and object picture viewing. As expected for face processing, hemodynamic activity in the right occipital face area (OFA) increased during face viewing compared to object viewing, and in a subset of participants, the expected N170 EEG response was observed for faces. Based on recently reported associations between the theta band and visual processing, we hypothesized that increased hemodynamic activity in a face processing area would also be associated with greater theta-band activity originating in the same area. Consistent with our hypothesis, theta-band oscillations were also localized to the right OFA for faces, whereas alpha- and beta-band oscillations were not. Together, these findings suggest that theta-band oscillations originating in the OFA may be part of the distributed face-specific processing mechanism. (C) The Authors.

It was hypothesized that a social co-actor's response should be reflected in stronger modulation (slower RTs on subsequent trials; augmented neural responses) for social compared to non-social nogo. RTs and ERPs replicated flanker compatibility effects, with faster responses and increased P3a on compatible trials. In line with the hypotheses, ERPs revealed distinct coding of social and non-social nogo in the conflict-sensitive N2 which showed a compatibility effect only for social nogo, and in the attention/memory-related P3b which was larger for social relative to non-social nogo. The P3a did not distinguish between social and non-social nogo, but was larger for compatible and smaller for go trials. Contrary to our hypotheses, RTs were faster after social relative to non-social nogo. Hence, the representation of the co-actor's response in joint action modulates conflict processing reflected in the N2 and response discrimination and evaluation reflected in the P3b and may facilitate subsequent responses in the context of social versus non-social nogo.

Driver sleepiness has also been associated with increasing levels of electroencephalogram (EEG) power, especially in the alpha range. The present exploratory study investigated a new measure of driver sleepiness, the EEG fixation-related lambda response. Thirty young male drivers (23.6 +/- 1.7 years old) participated in a driving simulator experiment in which they drove on rural and suburban roads in simulated daylight versus darkness during both the daytime (full sleep) and night-time (sleep deprived). The results show lower lambda responses during night driving and with longer time on task, indicating that sleep deprivation and time on task cause a general decrement in cortical responsiveness to incoming visual stimuli. Levels of subjective sleepiness and line crossings were higher under the same conditions. Furthermore, results of a linear mixed-effects model showed that low lambda responses are associated with high subjective sleepiness and more line crossings. We suggest that the fixation-related lambda response can be used to investigate driving impairment induced by sleep deprivation while driving and that, after further refinement, it may be useful as an objective measure of driver sleepiness.

The topic relevance model uses event-related potential (ERP) components to describe the process of topic relevance judgment. More specifically, the topic relevance model indicates that N400 and P600, which have been successfully applied to the mismatch process of a stimulus and the discourse-internal reorganization and integration process of a stimulus, respectively, are used for the topic mismatch process of a topic-irrelevant video shot and the topic formation process of a topic-relevant video shot. To evaluate our proposed ERP/MMR-based method, we compared the video skims generated by the ERP/MMR-based, ERP-based, and shot boundary detection (SBD) methods with ground truth skims. The results showed that at a significance level of 0.05, the ROUGE-1 scores of the ERP/MMR method are statistically higher than those of the SBD method, and the diversity scores of the ERP/MMR method are statistically higher than those of the ERP method. This study suggested that the proposed method may be applied to the construction of a video skim without operational intervention, such as the insertion of a black screen between video shots.

According to the World Health Organization, more than 300 million people worldwide suffer from this disorder, being the leading cause of disability. The advancements in electroencephalography (EEG) make it a powerful tool for non-invasive studies on neurological disorders including depression. Scientific community has used EEG to better understand the mechanisms behind the disorder and find biomarkers, which are characteristics that can be precisely measured in order to identify or diagnose a disorder. This work presents a systematic mapping of recent studies ranging from 2014 to the end of 2018 which use non-invasive EEG to detect depression biomarkers. Our research has analyzed more than 250 articles and we discuss the findings and promising biomarkers of 42 studies, finding that the depressed brain appear to have a more random network structure, also finding promising features for diagnostic, such as, gamma band and signal complexity; among others which may detect specific depression-related symptoms such as suicidal ideation.

Neuroalgorithms are models of multidimensional brain networks by means of which ADHD patient data can be separated from healthy control data. Methods: Spontaneous electroencephalographic and event-related potential (ERP) data were collected three times over the course of 2 years from a multicentre sample of adults comprising 181 patients with ADHD and 147 healthy controls. Spectral power and ERP amplitude and latency measures were used as input data for a semi-automatic machine-learning framework. Results: ADHD patients and healthy controls could be classified with a sensitivity ranging from 75% to 83% and specificity values of 71% to 77%. In the analysis of the repeated measurements, sensitivity values of the selected logistic regression model remained high (72% and 76%), while specificity values slightly decreased over time (64% and 67%). Conclusions: Implementation of the system in clinical practice requires facilities to track affected networks, as well as expertise in neuropathophysiology. Therefore, the use of neuroalgorithms can enhance the diagnostic process by making it less subjective and more reliable and linking it to the underlying pathology.

BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Self-face processing; Familiarity; Event-related potential (ERP); N170; P200; N250	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SELF-FACE; EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION; NEURAL SYSTEM; RECOGNITION; REPRESENTATIONS; ERP; PERCEPTION; ACTIVATION; ATTENTION	This study aimed to elucidate whether distinct early processes underlie the perception of our own face. Alternatively, self-face perception might rely on the same processes that realize the perception of highly familiar faces. To this end, we recorded EEG activity while participants performed a facial recognition task in which they had to discriminate between their own face, a friend's face, and an unknown face. We analyzed the event-related potentials (ERPs) to characterize the time course of neural processes involved in different stages of self-face recognition. Our results show that the N170 component was not sensitive to self-face. In contrast, the subsequent P200 component distinguished between self-face and the other faces. Finally, N250 amplitude increased as a function of face familiarity. Overall, our data suggest that self-face recognition neither emerges at the first stage of the encoding of facial information nor at a later stage when familiarity is processed. Rather, the distinctive processing of self-face arises at an intermediate stage ((similar to)200 ms), as indicated by a lower P200 amplitude. This could be taken as an indicator that self-face recognition is facilitated by a reduced need for attentional resources. In sum, our results suggest that self-face is more than a highly familiar face.

Auditory EEG Biomarkers in Fragile X Syndrome: Clinical Relevance	FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Fragile X Syndrome; EEG; chirp; habituation; gamma; sensory	GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; MOUSE MODEL; SENSORIMOTOR CONTROL; LATERAL INHIBITION; SPECTRUM DISORDER; AUTISM; POWER; HABITUATION; RELIABILITY; AGE	Sensory hypersensitivities are common and distressing features of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). While there are many drug interventions that reduce behavioral deficits in Fmr1 mice and efforts to translate these preclinical breakthroughs into clinical trials for FXS, evidence-based clinical interventions are almost non-existent potentially due to lack of valid neural biomarkers. Local circuit function in sensory networks is dependent on the dynamic balance of activity in inhibitory/excitatory synapses. Studies are needed to examine the association of electrophysiological alterations in neural systems with sensory and other clinical features of FXS to establish their clinical relevance. Adolescents and adults with FXS (n = 38, Mean age = 25.5, std = 10.1; 13 females) and age matched typically developing controls (n = 40, Mean age = 27.7, std = 12.1; 17 females) completed auditory chirp and auditory habituation tasks while undergoing dense array electroencephalography (EEG). Amplitude, latency, and percent change (habituation) in N1 and P2 event-related potential (ERP) components were characterized for the habituation task; time-frequency calculations using Morlet wavelets characterized phase-locking and single trial power for the habituation and chirp tasks. FXS patients showed increased amplitude but some evidence for reduced habituation of the N1 ERP, and reduced phase-locking in the low and high gamma frequency range and increased low gamma power to the chirp stimulus. FXS showed increased theta power in both tasks. While the habituation finding was weaker than previously found, the remaining findings replicate our previous work in a new sample of patients with FXS. Females showed less deficit in the chirp task but not the habituation task. Abnormal increases in gamma power were related to more severe behavioral and psychiatric features as well as reductions in neurocognitive abilities. Replicating electrophysiological deficits in a new group of patients using different EEG equipment at a new data collection site with differing levels of environmental noise that were robust to data processing techniques utilizing multiple researchers, indicates a potential for scalability to multi-site clinical trials. Given the robust replicability, relevance to clinical measures, and preclinical evidence for sensitivity of these EEG measures to pharmacological intervention, the observed abnormalities may provide novel translational markers of target engagement and potentially outcome measures in large-scale studies evaluating new treatments targeting neural hyperexcitability in FXS.

Beyond Hypnograms: Assessing Sleep Stability Using Acoustic and Electrical Stimulation	NEUROMODULATION			English	Article						PSG; sleep architecture; sleep ERP; sleep stability; sleep tACS	ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; OSCILLATIONS	Objective Conventional polysomnographic recordings reflect brain dynamics associated with sleep architecture. We hypothesized that noninvasive tools like transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and acoustic stimulation (for generating event related potentials [ERPs]) would help to predict sleep stability and provide a window to actively assess brain activity during sleep. Materials and Methods Twelve healthy male volunteers participated in the multiple whole-night polysomnography (PSG) recording protocol. Acoustic tones (100 msec duration) were presented throughout night to evaluate ERP during sleep. Furthermore, 30 sec tACS were presented during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep on subsequent two nights without disturbing the subject's sleep. For ERP analysis, event-locked artifact-free epochs from each sleep stage were averaged separately. For tACS analysis, 30 sec prestimulus and poststimulus artifact-free EEG epochs were subjected to bootstrapping-based comparison of power spectral values. Results Acoustic stimulation generated sleep stage-dependent ERP components (N350, N550, and P900) in all participants. The tACS stimulation during NREM sleep (0.75 Hz) increased parietal delta power but decreased frontocentral theta and increased frontal gamma power when delivered during REM sleep (40Hz). These interventions provide details on sleep stability as larger N550-P900 ERP-complex correlated with lower NREM disruptions (Spearman's rho = -0.553; p = 0.049; n = 10) and tACS-related theta power perturbation with higher REM disruptions (Spearman's rho = 0.734; p = 0.030; n = 7). Conclusions Noninvasive brain stimulation approaches such as sleep ERP and sleep tACS are reliable tools to evaluate sleep stability during NREM and REM sleep, respectively, but more large-sample studies are warranted.

Diminished Neural Responses to Emotionally Valenced Facial Stimuli: A Potential Biomarker for Unemotional Traits in Early Childhood	CHILD PSYCHIATRY & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						CU traits; Unemotional traits; Event-related potential; Early childhood	FEAR-RECOGNITION DEFICITS; CONDUCT PROBLEMS; EXPRESSION RECOGNITION; ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR; AMYGDALA RESPONSE; CHILDREN; ERP; FACES; N170; ADOLESCENCE	Callous-unemotional (CU) traits are characterized by deficits in guilt/empathy, shallow affect, and the callous and manipulative use of others. Individuals showing CU traits have increased risk for behavior problems and reduced responses to displays of distress in others. To explore how deficits in emotion-processing are associated with CU traits, the current study examined the association between callous-unemotionality and a neural index of facial emotion processing, using the event-related potential technique in a group of 3-5year olds. Children viewed a series of static emotional faces, depicting either fear or happiness, while electroencephalography data were collected. The N170 component, thought to index the neural processes associated with face perception, was examined along with CU traits. Findings suggest that the unemotional dimension of CU traits is associated with diminished emotion-processing responses to fearful faces. Reduced neural responses to facial depictions of fear could be a biomarker for unemotional traits in early childhood.

At the same time, two event-related potential (ERP) peaks have shown an emotional modulation of endogenous attention: the early posterior negativity (EPN; peaking around 250 msec) and the late positive potential (LPP, peaking around 600 msec). Furthermore, an emotional bias on conscious perception has been reported in Binocular Rivalry (BR) studies. Here, we combined an intermittent BR paradigm with neutral and emotional stimuli while recording the behavioral subjective perception and ERPs with two aims: i) to explore the NCCs of emotional content in the time ranges previously described, and ii) to study the emotional bias in conscious perception as first percept when neutral and emotional images rival against each other. First, results revealed a specific ERP emotional modulation (emotional content awareness modulation; ECAM) at the VAN time range. This was the first time window sensitive to the emotional information and showing the strongest modulation in conscious emotional content. Second, results revealed an emotional bias in conscious perception towards the positive valence. This work shows how conscious perception pertaining to emotional content relates to perceptual areas at the VAN latency, which supports the claim of the 130-320 msec time window as the earliest NCC and extends the claim to apply to more than visual perceptual features. Additionally, our findings show that positive and negative content modulates the conscious perception differently. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In order to explore the optimal electroencephalogram reference electrode scheme for the ERP signal related to facial recognition, we investigated the influence of average reference (AR), mean mastoid reference (MM), and Reference Electrode Standardization Technique (REST) on the N170 component via statistical analysis, statistical parametric scalp mappings (SPSM) and source analysis. The statistical results showed that the choice of reference electrode scheme has little effect on N170 latency (p > 0.05), but has an significant impact on N170 amplitude (p < 0.05). ANOVA results show that, for the three references scheme, there was statistically significant difference between N170 latency and amplitude induced by the unfamiliar face and that induced by the scrambled face (p < 0.05). Specifically, the SPSM results show an anterior and a temporo-occipital distribution for AR and REST, whereas just anterior distribution shown for MM. However, the circumstantial evidence provided by source analysis is more consistent with SPSM of AR and REST, compared with that of MM. These results indicate that the experimental results under the AR and REST references are more objective and appropriate. Thus, it is more appropriate to use AR and REST reference scheme settings in future facial recognition experiments.

We report work in progress to create a novel passive brain computer interface (pBCI), designed to modulate a user's level of sustained attention in an ecologically valid information system (IS) context. To modulate sustained attention, we take measures of cognitive engagement and vigilance using electroencephalography (EEG) in real time, to form the basis of the BCI, and create a closed neurophysiological feedback loop which adapts elements of a dynamic user interface according to the user's level of sustained attention. The interface utilizes the ERPsim simulation engine to create an ecologically valid IS task supported by a real-life ERP framework.

Participants were asked to compare the duration of time intervals with a 2-sec reference interval. The color of circles marking a given comparison interval signaled the valence of the upcoming stimulus to be presented, each stimulus being drawn from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). The behavioral data suggest that time distortion can be induced by the expectation of stimuli with different valences and that expecting a negative stimulus leads to an overestimation of time. The electrophysiological data, more specifically the N150, N200, LPP and CNV components, provide evidence of the implication of attentional mechanisms and possibly strategic adjustments of cognitive control for time perception.

Resting-state prefrontal EEG biomarkers in correlation with MMSE scores in elderly individuals	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MINI-MENTAL-STATE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; ALPHA-RHYTHM; DEMENTIA; POWER; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; SYNCHRONIZATION	We investigated whether cognitive decline could be explained by resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers measured in prefrontal regions that reflect the slowing of intrinsic EEG oscillations. In an aged population dwelling in a rural community (total = 496, males = 165, females = 331), we estimated the global cognitive decline using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and measured resting-state EEG parameters at the prefrontal regions of Fp1 and Fp2 in an eyes-closed state. Using a tertile split method, the subjects were classified as T3 (MMSE 28-30, N = 162), T2 (MMSE 25-27, N = 179), or T1 (MMSE <= 24, N = 155). The EEG slowing biomarkers of the median frequency, peak frequency and alpha-to-theta ratio decreased as the MMSE scores decreased from T2 to T1 for both sexes (-5.19 <= t-value <= -3.41 for males and -7.24 <= t-value <= -4.43 for females) after adjusting for age and education level. Using a double cross-validation procedure, we developed a prediction model for the MMSE scores using the EEG slowing biomarkers and demographic covariates of sex, age and education level. The maximum intraclass correlation coefficient between the MMSE scores and model-predicted values was 0.757 with RMSE = 2.685. The resting-state EEG biomarkers showed significant changes in people with early cognitive decline and correlated well with the MMSE scores. Resting-state EEG slowing measured in the prefrontal regions may be useful for the screening and follow-up of global cognitive decline in elderly individuals.

Default examinations for understanding attention are questionnaires or physiological signals, like evoked potentials and electroencephalography. Physiological records were obtained using visual, auditory, and auditory-visual stimuli combinations with 48 participants-18-25-year-old university students-to find differences between sustained and divided attention. A Fourier-based filter was used to get a 0.01-30-Hz frequency band. Fractal dimensions, entropy values, power spectral densities, and Hjorth parameters from electroencephalography and P300 components from evoked potentials were calculated as features. To decrease the size of the feature set, some features, which yield less detail level for data, were eliminated. The visual and auditory stimuli in selective attention were compared with the divided attention state, and the best accuracy was found to be 88.89% on a support vector machine with linear kernel. As a result, it was seen that divided attention could be more difficult to determine from selective attention, but successful classification could be obtained with appropriate methods. Contrary to literature, the study deals with the infrastructure of attention types by working on a completely healthy and attention-high group.

The aim of this proof-of-concept study was to assess the biomechanical and neurophysiological effects of acute and subacute oropharyngeal sensory stimulation with transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) agonists (capsaicinoids) in older patients with OD. Methods: We studied the effect of a single dose versus multiple doses (2 weeks) of oral capsaicin treatment (10(-5) M) or placebo in 28 older patients with OD (81.2 +/- 4.6 years) using videofluoroscopy (penetration-aspiration scale [PAS], timing of swallow response) and electroencephalography (EEG) (latency and amplitude of pharyngeal event-related potential [ERP]). Results: Acute stimulation by capsaicinoids 10(-5) M did not improve swallow function and did not produce significant changes in pharyngeal ERP. In contrast, after 10 days of treatment, patients presented a clinically relevant and statistically significant reduction in the laryngeal vestibule closure (LVC) time (22.5%, p = 0.042), and in the PAS (24.2%, p = 0.038), compared with the placebo group. EEG results showed a reduction in the latency of the N1 peak (28.6%, p = 0.007) and an increase of the amplitude of the P1-N2 (59.4%, p = 0.038) and the N2-P2 (43.6%, p = 0.050) peaks. We observed a strong and significant correlation between the reduction in the latency of the N1 peak and change in LVC time after subacute treatment (r = 0.750, p = 0.003). Conclusions: After 2 weeks of treatment, oropharyngeal sensory stimulation with capsaicinoids induced cortical changes that were correlated with improvements in swallowing biomechanics in older patients with OD. These results further show that sensory stimulation by TRPV1 agonists can become a useful pharmacological treatment for older patients with OD.

The current study included 63 college students with social anxiety. Participants were assigned to the attention modification program (AMP, n = 20), the attention control condition (ACC, n = 20) and the passive waiting group (PW, n = 23). Questionnaires and the emotional Stroop task with EEG recordings were used to assess whether and how the 4-week ABM period affected emotional symptoms and specific emotional processing. Results showed that the two training groups (AMP and ACC) produced comparable emotional improvements and both showed a decrease in negative bias compared with the PW group. The ERP results indicated that despite no significant ERP changes in the PW group, the ACC group exhibited a greater N1, whereas the AMP group exhibited a reduced VPP at the post-test stage compared to the pre-test stage. Besides, both training groups showed a similar late positive potential (LPP) reduction. Notably, the reduction in LPP was positively correlated with behavioral and symptom improvement. Thus, manipulations unique to ABM (face-target contingency) primarily modulate the early attention distribution of material-related stimuli. However, the clinical benefits of attention training may be due to later cognitive-affective mechanisms.

Family Risk for Depression and Prioritization of Religion or Spirituality: Early Neurophysiological Modulations of Motivated Attention	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						depression risk; emotional lateralization; event-related potential (ERP); religion; spirituality; source localization; surface Laplacian; visual half-field paradigm	POSTERIOR EEG ALPHA; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; RIGHT TEMPOROPARIETAL CORTEX; BLUNTED NEURAL RESPONSE; ERP GENERATOR PATTERNS; LAPLACIAN WAVE-FORMS; EMOTIONAL AROUSAL; BRAIN MECHANISMS; PARENTAL DEPRESSION; AFFECTIVE-DISORDERS	The personal importance of religion or spirituality (R/S) has been associated with a lower risk for major depression (MDD), suicidal behavior, reduced cortical thinning and increased posterior EEG alpha, which has also been linked to antidepressant treatment response in MDD. Building on prior event-related potential (ERP) findings using an emotional hemifield paradigm, this study examined whether abnormal early (preconscious) responsivity to negative arousing stimuli, which is indicative of right parietotemporal dysfunction in both MDD patients and individuals at clinical high risk for MDD, is likewise moderated by R/S. We reanalyzed 72-channel ERP data from 127 individuals at high or low family risk for MDD (Kayser et al., 2017, NeuroImage Clin. 14, 692-707) after R/S stratification (low R/S importance, low/high risk, n = 38/61; high R/S importance, n = 15/13). ERPs were transformed to reference-free current source density (CSD) and quantified by temporal principal components analysis (tPCA). This report focused on N2 sink (peak latency 212 ms), the earliest prominent CSD-tPCA component previously found to be sensitive to emotional content. While overall N2 sink reflected activation of occipitotemporal cortex (prestriate/cuneus), as estimated via a distributed inverse solution, affective significance was marked by a relative (i.e., superimposed) positivity. Statistical analyses employed both non-parametric permutation tests and repeated measures ANOVA for mixed factorial designs with unstructured covariance matrix, including sex, age, and clinical covariates. Participants with low R/S importance, independent of risk status, showed greater ERP responsivity to negative than neutral stimuli, particularly over the right hemisphere. In contrast, early emotional ERP responsivity and asymmetry was substantially reduced for high risk individuals with high R/S importance, however, enhanced for low risk individuals with high R/S importance. Hemifield modulations of these effects (i.e., emotional ERP enhancements with left visual field/right hemisphere stimulus presentations) further corroborated these observations. Results suggest down-regulation of a right-lateralized network for salience detection at an early processing stage in high risk and high R/S importance individuals, presumably to prevent overactivation of ventral brain regions further downstream. These findings may point to a neurophysiological mechanism underlying resilience of families at risk for depression with high R/S prioritization.

Neural and Behavioral Correlates of Attentional Bias to Cannabis Cues Among Adults With Cannabis Use Disorders	PSYCHOLOGY OF ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS			English	Article						cannabis use disorders; attentional bias; inhibitory control; EEG; event-related potentials	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS; CLINICAL-RELEVANCE; COGNITIVE BIAS; TIME-COURSE; DEPENDENCE; RELIABILITY; VALIDITY; SMOKERS; ERROR	The current pilot study probed the time course of attentional bias to cannabis-related cues among individuals with cannabis use disorders (CUDs) compared with healthy controls. Forty participants (individuals with CUDs, n = 20, M-age = 26.2 and healthy controls, n = 20, M-age = 28) completed a modified visual attention task in which they made decisions about the orientation of a target line while ignoring temporally flanking lines and cannabis-related, positive-, negative-, and neutral-images as behavioral responses and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. To examine the time course of attentional bias, we analyzed ERP responses separately to targets and distractors from 125 ms to 620 ms after stimulus onset. Results showed that, compared with healthy controls, cannabis users demonstrated greater selective attention failure (i. e., had more difficulties ignoring distractor stimuli) when making decisions in the presence of cannabis cues. Likewise, cannabis smokers demonstrated relatively larger differences in accuracy (i. e., committed more errors in target decisions) between trials involving cannabis cues versus neutral cues. ERP data revealed that the N1 component (125-200 ms after stimulus onset) to flankers preceding cannabis cues peaked relatively earlier and was of larger amplitude in cannabis users, suggesting an early perceptual bias toward the cannabis cues. Findings suggest that individuals with CUDs have poorer selective attention, impaired inhibitory control, and early attentional biases toward cannabis uses compared with healthy nonusers. The augmented early perceptual response suggests an involuntary orienting of attention toward cannabis cues. Implications for future research and intervention development for individuals with CUD are discussed.

Mobile EEG leverages state-of-the-art hardware alongside established advantages of traditional EEG and recent advances in signal processing. In this review, we propose that mobile EEG could open unprecedented possibilities for studying neurodevelopmental disorders. We first present a brief overview of recent developments in mobile EEG technologies, emphasising the proliferation of studies in several neuroscientific domains. As these developments have yet to be exploited by neurodevelopmentalists, we then identify three research opportunities: 1) increase in the ease and flexibility of brain data acquisition in neurodevelopmental populations; 2) integration into powerful developmentally-informative research designs; 3) development of innovative non-stationary EEG-based paradigms. Critically, we address key challenges that should be considered to fully realise the potential of mobile EEG for neurodevelopmental research and for understanding developmental psychopathology more broadly, and suggest future research directions.

Assessing Field Dependence-Independence Cognitive Abilities Through EEG-Based Bistable Perception Processing	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Field-Dependence; Field-Independence; bistable perception	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NECKER CUBE REVERSALS; GAMMA-BAND; AMBIGUOUS FIGURES; STYLE; ALPHA; VARIABILITY; COMPONENT; VIEWS; P300	Field Dependence-Independence (FDI) is a widely studied dimension of cognitive styles designed to measure an individual's ability to identify embedded parts of an organized visual field as entities separate from that given field. The research aims to determine whether the brain activity features that are considered to be perceptual switching indicators could serve as robust features, differentiating Field-Dependent (FD) from Field-Independent (FI) participants. Previous research suggests that various features derived from event related potentials (ERP) and frequency features are associated with the perceptual reversal occurring during the observation of a bistable image. In this study, we combined these features in the context of a different experimental scheme using ambiguous and unambiguous stimuli during participants' perceptual observations. We assessed the participants' FD-I classification with the use of the Hidden Figures Test (HFT). Results show that the peak amplitude of the frontoparietal positivity, the late positive deflection in frontal and parietal areas, is higher for the FD group at specific locations of the left lobe, whereas it occurs later for the FD group at the central and occipital electrodes. Additionally, the FD group exhibits higher levels of gamma power before stimulus onset at channel TP10 and higher gamma power during reversal at the right centroparietal electrodes (T8, CP6, and TP10). The peak amplitude of the reversal positivity, the positive deflection during the reversal, is higher for the FD group at the rear right lobe (P4).

We further explored whether there was preliminary evidence that such ERPs could also index genetic risk for ADHD (depending on finding phenotypic associations). Sixty-seven male-only twin pairs (N = 134; aged 12-15) from a subsample of the Twins' Early Development Study, concordant and discordant for ADHD symptoms, performed the flanked CPT (or CPT-OX) while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. ERPs were obtained for cue (P3, CNV or contingency negative variation), go (P3, N2) and nogo trials (P3, N2). We found no phenotypic associations between CPT-derived ERPs and ADHD-the sizes of the estimated phenotypic correlations were nonsignificant and very small (r's = -.11 to.04). Twin-model fitting analyses using structural equation modelling provided preliminary evidence that some of the ERPs were heritable (with the most robust effect for go-P3 latency), but there was limited evidence of any genetic associations between ERPs and ADHD, although with the caveat that our sample was small and hence had limited power. Overall, unlike in previous research, there was no evidence of phenotypic (nor preliminary evidence for genetic) associations between ADHD and CPT-derived ERPs in this study. Hence, it may be currently premature for genetic analyses of ADHD to be guided by CPT-derived ERP parameters (unlike alternative cognitive-neurophysiological approaches which may be more promising). Further research with better-powered, population-based, genetically-informative and cross-disorder samples are required, which could be facilitated by emerging mobile EEG technologies.

Increased ERN amplitudes have been observed in several psychological disorders characterized by high negative affect. While the ERN has extensively been studied in tasks using exteroceptive stimuli, its relation to interoceptive stimuli is unknown. Since errors related to interoception might be particularly relevant for survival and negative affect, this study aimed to explore the ERN for errors related to interoceptive, respiratory sensations (intERN). Moreover, we compared the intERN with a commonly observed ERN related to exteroceptive, visual stimuli (extERN) and examined their associations with interoception-related negative affect. We studied the ERN using a respiratory occlusion task (intERN) and a visual flanker task (extERN) in 40 healthy volunteers during continuous 129 channel EEG recordings. In the occlusion task, participants received inspiratory occlusions of two different durations and indicated whether each occlusion was short or long. In the Flanker task, participants indicated the direction of arrowheads. Interoception-related negative affect was assessed with the Anxiety Sensitivity Index. Comparable with the extERN, the intERN was observed at fronto-central scalp positions after error commission in the occlusion task, but it peaked significantly earlier than the extERN. Mean amplitudes of the intERN and extERN showed no significant difference and were not correlated. Moreover, higher levels of anxiety sensitivity were correlated with significantly greater amplitudes of the intERN, but with lower amplitudes of the extERN. The present results firstly demonstrate an error-related negativity EEG-potential that is related to interoceptive sensations (intERN). This intERN is not associated with a commonly observed ERN elicited by exteroceptive stimuli and is distinctly linked to higher levels of interoceptionrelated negative affect. The intERN might be a promising neural marker for future studies on interoception, negative affect and error processing.

Such differences may account for contradictory findings in the literature relating to age-related changes in neural activation during WM tasks. In the present study, 39 young adults (aged 18-30) and 34 older adults (aged 65+) completed an n-back task while their electroencephalography, accuracy, and reaction time was recorded. They were then categorized as high or low performers. High performers had larger P3b and parietal P200 amplitudes and smaller parietal N200 amplitudes than low performers. High-performing older adults exhibited larger parietal P200 amplitudes than low-performing older adults, and similar P3bs to young adults during the 2-back. Low-performing older adults, in contrast, exhibited smaller parietal P3bs than young adults during the 2-back. These findings suggest that brain activity during a WM task is influenced by individual differences in performance level. Moreover, some older adults can maintain high WM performance and capacity through recruitment of additional brain regions.

Brain function is related to perceptual processing of emotional stimuli. The current EEG study evaluated the contextual effect of the positive and negative valence emotional stimuli processing on neural oscillations by examining the neurological activities. EEG data were collected from eighteen individuals based on the international 10-20 system with a sampling rate of 1000Hz. Electrodes from the visual cortex were selected for analysis (O1, Oz and O2). Pre-processing and filtering of the raw data were done with an independent-component analysis (ICA) and time-frequency decomposition functions included in EEGLAB and ERPLAB toolbox. The ERP result confirmed that there is a difference in the reaction time between the negative and positive valences emotional stimuli when participants were experiencing different affective state. Positively valence stimuli react faster than negatively valence emotional stimuli. Three time windows, P2 (125-230ms), EPN (120-200ms) and P3 (300-650ms) were obtained and differences in amplitude and latencies were analyzed. A higher P2 amplitude and a remarkable decrease on P3 amplitude were observed at the visual cortex. The spectral power analysis shows a higher reactivity of alpha band than theta and beta bands. Nonetheless, we found a remarkable decrease in beta power for the given condition. However, beta and theta band showed a spectral change appeared laterally. As enlightened by different scholars, alpha oscillations are associated with the top-down control of visual cortex and play an important role for perception and involved in information processing during periodic cycle of the sensory information.

To increase portability of the setup and reduce cabling it is possible to perform a unified and real-time synchronized recording of data from multiple sources. However, delays and jitter may impair the quality of the subsequent event-related potential (ERP) analyses. Here we used an online auditory oddball P300 paradigm on one subject to compare the quality of P300 ERPs obtained (i) with online synchronization and alignment and (ii) offline with conventional alignment (synchronization channel) while sitting. We showed that offline and online synchronization strategies provided comparable although slightly different P300 ERP. We also recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) while walking indoors and outdoors. A decreasing P300 amplitude respectively from sitting to walking indoors and outdoors confirms the dual-task effect on P300. These results show that integrated real-time P300 protocols are feasible but it is also necessary to test delays and quantify the jitter among different signals when developing real-world MoBI applications.

State-trait influences of Vipassana meditation practice on P3 EEG dynamics	MEDITATION	Progress in Brain Research		English	Review	International Conference on Meditation	MAR 04-06, 2018	Univ Allahabad, Ctr Behav & Cognit Sci, Allahabad, INDIA		Univ Allahabad, Ctr Behav & Cognit Sci	Vipassana; Proficiency; Cognition; Event-related potentials; Attention; Neural plasticity	ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; MINDFULNESS; ATTENTION; THETA; PRACTITIONERS; CONSCIOUSNESS; NEUROSCIENCE; SYNCHRONY; EMOTION; IMPACT	Several studies have demonstrated that meditation naive subjects can, in just a few weeks, become proficient enough in meditation to show cognitive improvements accompanied with functional and structural changes in the brain. Would long-term exposure to qualitatively different levels of meditative training bring about differences in cognitive processing? Would meditation prior to task performance help separate out these differences? Could the nature of the task influence the findings related to cognitive enhancements? To address these questions, we evaluated cognitive functions in three groups of experienced Vipassana practitioners (Novices: n = 22, Mean +/- SD meditation experience = 989 +/- 595h; Senior practitioners: 21, 10,510 +/- 5313; Teachers: 16, 14,648 +/- 9623) who differed in terms of duration and quality of meditative practice. Specifically, we employed "ANGEL" a gamified multilevel oddball paradigm, to assess P3 event-related potentials (ERPs) and associated EEG dynamics-power spectra, event related spectral perturbations (ERSP) and inter-trial coherence (ITC). In order to elicit the state-trait influences of meditation, the cognitive task was performed after the participants had undergone an hour long traditional meditation session. All participants could perform the task well and the gross ERP waveforms were similar for the three groups. As hypothesized, we found distinct state-trait influences of meditation leading to graded differences in P3 EEG dynamics. Specifically, we found reduced theta synchrony, enhanced alpha de-synchrony and lesser theta-alpha coherence in the more proficient meditators. Post hoc analyses revealed several differences between the novice and teacher groups but not as many between novice and seniors suggesting that the senior meditators formed an intermediate group. Our study demonstrates that both quantity and quality of meditation influence EEG dynamics during cognitive processing and that meditation prior to a task can provide additional state-trait effects involved in meeting the specific cognitive demands.

More specifically, the P300 component of the ERP was shown to be sensitive to the behavioral adjustment that an individual makes when not agreeing with the majority of a group. Starting from these contributions, in the present study, the famous experiment of Solomon Asch [1] was replicated online. The experiment was conducted on a sample of university students, using an innovative and low-cost tool capable of recording the brain signal (a wireless headset equipped with fourteen electrodes, called Emotiv EPOC). The present research aims to demonstrate how cheap and little sensitive tools enable the detection of ERP components that characterize social conformity in an ecological context.

Automatic detection and removal of such offending artifacts from EEG for online processing pose a great challenge. In this paper, we present a novel method that can map the artifact probability of an EEG epoch based on four statistical measures: entropy, kurtosis, skewness and Periodic Waveform Index (PWI). Then a removal method is adopted based on stationary wavelet transform that can be applied to the epochs by setting a particular probability threshold from the user. This epoch by epoch preprocessing would allow the user to tune the threshold parameters after some initial training with the same EEG recordings and eventually can be applied to both offline and online processing. Experimental results with both simulated and real EEG data prove the efficacy of the method that it can reliably trace the artifactual epoch with reasonable accuracy and eventually reduces the artifacts from EEG with very little distortion to the signal of interest. Further testing with EEG datasets for BCI experiments also shows that artifact removal can significantly enhance the BCI performance in both motor-imagery (MI) and event related potential (ERP) based BCI applications.

Distinct visuo-motor brain dynamics for real-world objects versus planar images	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Real-world objects; Images; EEG; Mu rhythm	MU RHYTHM DESYNCHRONIZATION; EVENT-RELATED DYNAMICS; LONG-TERM-MEMORY; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; GRASPABLE OBJECTS; STORAGE CAPACITY; EEG; PERCEPTION; ALPHA; DEPTH	Ultimately, we aim to generalize and translate scientific knowledge to the real world, yet current understanding of human visual perception is based predominantly on studies of two-dimensional (2-D) images. Recent cognitive-behavioral evidence shows that real objects are processed differently to images, although the neural processes that underlie these differences are unknown. Because real objects (unlike images) afford actions, they may trigger stronger or more prolonged activation in neural populations for visuo-motor action planning. Here, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) when human observers viewed real-world three-dimensional (3-D) objects or closely matched 2-D images of the same items. Although responses to real objects and images were similar overall, there were critical differences. Compared to images, viewing real objects triggered stronger and more sustained event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the mu frequency band (8-13 Hz) - a neural signature of automatic motor preparation. Event-related potentials (ERPs) revealed a transient, early occipital negativity for real objects (versus images), likely reflecting 3-D stereoscopic differences, and a late sustained parietal amplitude modulation consistent with an 'old-new' memory advantage for real objects over images. Together, these findings demonstrate that real-world objects trigger stronger and more sustained action-related brain responses than images do. The results highlight important similarities and differences between brain responses to images and richer, more ecologically relevant, real-world objects.

Testing for the neuroadaptive system utilized a G.nautilus headset, MATLAB with the EEGLAB toolbox, and a computer with the Processing IDE. Code from the Processing IDE provides an image slideshow which displays faces of various individuals so that the subject presses a keyboard key on a certain image. Three subjects were tested for 60 trials each, 30 trials where the keyboard key was pressed, and 30 trials where they were not, to gather enough data to train and test a classifier by using a machine learning algorithm. Machine learning assessed classification accuracy initially using 10 training trials and increased the training set by 10 trials each time to reassess accuracy until a total of 40 training trials were used. A set of 20 trials were used to assess accuracy without and with machine learning. Additionally, theoretical accuracy was computed by removing unfeasible machine learning features to assess the potential accuracy in a real-time system. The results provided an average accuracy of 52% without machine learning and an average accuracy ranging from 91.66% to 96.66% using the K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) algorithm. The average theoretical accuracy ranged from to be 60% to 68.33%.

Evidence has found that among those addicted, individuals suffering with psychiatric illnesses are disproportionally abusing. To assess this disparity, our study observed event related potential (ERP) responses recorded with electroencephalogram (EEG) in chronic smokers with (MI; n=6) and without mental illness (NMI; n=6). We found that the MI group alone presented heightened late positive potential (LPP) responses while processing cigarette (addictive) stimuli compared to neutral images (t-value = 3.11 at Cz, 3.92 at Pz). Our study illustrates the significance of the LPP as a promising biomarker to assess tobacco addiction in individuals facing mental illness.	[White, A.

However, it is still unclear whether this practice might indeed impact higher cognitive functions, such as control mechanisms that allow the appropriate and flexible allocation of attentional resources. In this longitudinal study, changes associated with a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program were investigated, with a focus on proactive and reactive cognitive control mechanisms, namely, the ability to maintain task-relevant information and to prepare in advance the response, and the ability to promptly adjust overlearned behaviors in response to conflicting stimuli. Methods Two groups of participants took part in the study: 26 participants who completed a formal MBSR training (mean age = 43 years, females = 21) and 23 participants who performed a control training (mean age = 47.2 years, females = 20). They were tested on a modified AX-continuous performance task (AX-CPT), before and after eight weeks of training. The electroencephalographic (EEG) signal was recorded during task execution, and amplitude modulations of event-related potentials (ERPs) associated with cues and probes were examined. Results After the training, the MBSR group exhibited a significant reduction of errors on high conflicting trials. Concurrently, the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV), an ERP index of anticipatory processes elicited by task cues, became more pronounced in the post-training session in the MBSR group only. In addition, an attenuated probe-locked N2 and an increased P3a component emerged. Conclusions Taken together, the behavioral and electrophysiological results suggest that the mindfulness practice enhanced the ability to implement both proactive and reactive cognitive control processes.

Using a 'Social Interaction Empathy Task', we found that BPD patients judged neutral and psychologically painful conditions as more painful than healthy subjects. Here, we present the neural correlates underlying these differences in empathy for pain. Methods: Female BPD patients and healthy controls completed the 'Social Interaction Empathy Task' during EEG recording. Event-related potentials (ERP) were analysed for an early anterior component and a late latency positivity. Empathic abilities were assessed using the Interpersonal Reactivity Index and early aversive experiences were measured by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Results: ERPs in the patient group matched the behaviour results and correlated with the level of personal distress and CTQ. In addition, ERPs of patients were predicted by childhood maltreatment and stress. Conclusions: Taken together, our findings indicate that the observed behavioural differences between patients with BPD and controls might be due to modulatory effects of empathic abilities on the evaluation of pain-related social stimuli, which are supposed to be based on childhood maltreatment.

Previous studies revealed that proprioceptive and exteroceptive signals contribute to error-monitoring processes, which are implemented in the posterior medial frontal cortex. Interestingly, errors also trigger changes in autonomic nervous system activity such as pupil dilation or heartbeat deceleration. Yet, the contribution of implicit interoceptive signals of bodily states to error-monitoring during ongoing performance has been overlooked. This study investigated whether cardiovascular interoceptive signals influence the neural correlates of error processing during performance, with an emphasis on the early stages of error processing. We recorded musicians' electroencephalography and electrocardiogram signals during the performance of highly-trained music pieces. Previous event-related potential (ERP) studies revealed that pitch errors during skilled musical performance are preceded by an error detection signal, the pre-error-negativity (preERN), and followed by a later error positivity (PE). In this study, by combining ERP, source localization and multivariate pattern classification analysis, we found that the error-minus-correct ERP waveform had an enhanced amplitude within 40-100 ms following errors in the systolic period of the cardiac cycle. This component could be decoded from single-trials, was dissociated from the preERN and PE, and stemmed from the inferior parietal cortex, which is a region implicated in cardiac autonomic regulation. In addition, the phase of the cardiac cycle influenced behavioral alterations resulting from errors, with a smaller post-error slowing and less perturbed velocity in keystrokes following pitch errors in the systole relative to the diastole phase of the cardiac cycle. Lastly, changes in the heart rate anticipated the upcoming occurrence of errors. This study provides the first evidence of preconscious visceral information modulating neural and behavioral responses related to early error monitoring during skilled performance.

We developed a three-hour Complex Treatment Program (CTP) on quadratic functions for the study. In the summer of 2016, we collected data of the pre and post MA questionnaires by Mathematics Anxiety Scale for Students (MASS), the percent of correct answers (PCA) and reaction time (RT) by E-prime program, and also brain-imaging data of the event related potentials (ERP) by Electroencephalograph (EEG) using computer-based functional F-G model. The result indicated the CTP to be effective with the group with higher math anxiety and the group with higher achievement respectively. The MASS result was verified with the better performance of PCA on type G, which was measured by E-prime program. Some interesting patterns were revealed on brain-imaging data by EEG, indicating more brain activities with the MA groups.

The form or shape of windows in building facades has direct impacts on perceivers' affective state and emotions. To understand the impacts of geometric windows on the subject's feedback and cortical activity, psychophysics experiments and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were measured from the participants. Our behavioral results show a distinguished categorization of the window shapes as pleasant and unpleasant stimuli. The rectangular, square, circular and semi-circular arch were determined as the pleasant window shapes, while the triangular and triangular arch window shapes were distinguished as unpleasant. Furthermore, event-related potential (ERP) components (N1, P2 and P3) were investigated to determine the influence of window shapes on the local brain activity. To measure reliable cortical responses, a Butterworth notch filter (50 Hz), band pass filter (0.1-60 Hz) and ADJUST filter were employed to remove the artifacts. The electrophysiological results show increased activity for the unpleasant in comparison to the pleasant windows (p < 0.05, Rank-Sum test) in both frontal (for P2 component) and posterio-occipital (ERP amplitudes; the N1 through to the P3 peak) channels. The ERP amplitudes of the right hemisphere were significantly larger than in the left hemisphere, not only in response to the unpleasant (p < 0.001) but also to the pleasant window stimuli (p < 0.001, Signed-Rank test). However, the unpleasant stimuli evoked significantly larger ERP amplitude than the pleasant stimuli. Moreover, the significant ERPP2 amplitude was more distinguished for unpleasant (p = 0.01, Signed-Rank test) than pleasant windows (p = 0.01, Rank-Sum test) between frontal and central cortical lobes. Overall, our behavioral and electrophysiological studies demonstrate a distinguished categorization of pleasant and unpleasant window shapes and more significant ERP modulations in the right than left hemisphere for unpleasant windows compared to pleasant ones.

Sequential processing in the classic oddball task: ERP components, probability, and behavior	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						behavior; equiprobable; ERP components; oddball; principal components analysis (PCA); probability	AUDITORY GO/NOGO TASK; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; P300 COMPONENT; INTRINSIC EEG; GO; STIMULI; NOVELTY; PERFORMANCE; INHIBITION; NEGATIVITY	This study compared the ERP components and behavior associated with the auditory equiprobable and classic oddball tasks, to relate the cognitive processing stages in those paradigms and continue the development of the sequential processing schema. Target and nontarget ERP data were acquired from 66 healthy young adults (M-age = 20.1, SD = 2.4 years, 14 male) who completed both equiprobable (target p = 0.5) and oddball tasks (target p = 0.3). Separate temporal PCAs were used to decompose the ERP data in each task and condition, and the similarity of the components identified in each condition was examined between tasks. Probability effects on component amplitudes and behavior were also analyzed to identify task differences in cognitive demands. A highly similar series of components was identified in each task, closely matching the schema: targets elicited N1-3, N1-1, PN, N2c, P3b, SW1, SW2; whereas nontargets elicited N1-3, N1-1, PN, N2b, P3a, SW1, SW2. N1-1 and PN amplitudes increased as stimulus probability decreased, irrespective of the condition. N2b, P3b, SW1, and SW2 amplitudes also varied between tasks, illustrating task-specific demands on those processing stages. These findings complemented the behavioral outcomes, which demonstrated greater accuracy and control in the classic oddball task. Overall, this study demonstrated comparable processing in the auditory equiprobable and classic oddball tasks, extending the generalizability of the schema and enabling further integration of the ERP theory associated with these tasks. This study also clarifies stimulus probability effects on the schema, providing important insight into the functionality of common ERP components.

However, most existing EEG headsets exhibit a fixed design, whereby its immobile montage in terms of electrode density and coverage inevitably poses a great challenge with applicability and generalizability to the fundamental study and application of the brain-computer interface (BCI). In this study, a cost-efficient, custom EEG-electrode holder infrastructure was designed through the assembly of primary components, including the sensor-positioning ring, inter-ring bridge, and bridge shield. It allows a user to (re)assemble a compact holder grid to accommodate a desired number of electrodes only to the regions of interest of the brain and iteratively adapt it to a given head size for optimal electrode-scalp contact and signal quality. This study empirically demonstrated its easy-to-fabricate nature by a low-end fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer and proved its practicability of capturing event-related potential (ERP) and steady-state visual-evoked potential (SSVEP) signatures over 15 subjects. This paper highlights the possibilities for a cost-efficient electrode-holder assembly infrastructure with replaceable montage, flexibly retrofitted in an unlimited fashion, for an individual for distinctive fundamental EEG studies and BCI applications.

In this paper, a face image-based rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm for identity authentication is proposed. This paradigm combines two kinds of biometric trait, face and EEG, together to evoke more specific and stable traits for authentication. The event-related potential (ERP) components induced by self-face and non-self-face (including familiar and not familiar) are investigated, and significant differences are found among different situations. On the basis of this, an authentication method based on Hierarchical Discriminant Component Analysis (HDCA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed to build subject-specific model with optimized fewer channels. The accuracy and stability over time are evaluated to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method. The averaged authentication accuracy of 94.26% within 6 s can be achieved by our proposed method. For a 30-day averaged time interval, our method can still reach the averaged accuracy of 88.88%. Experimental results show that our proposed framework for EEG-based identity authentication is effective, robust, and stable over time.

And Brain Computer Interface (BCI) technology makes it possible for users to communicate and interact with devices without any handle, keyboard or mouse. Combining VR and BCI, this paper proposes and designs a novel platform which is called virtual smart home based on electroencephalograph (EEG) control (VSH-EEG). P300 is an event-related potential (ERP), which can be evoked when random stimulus happens. In VSH-EEG system, the paradigm display of P300 is embedded in the virtual smart home. Users' P300 is extracted, processed and classified by self-adaptive Bayes linear discriminant analysis (SA-BLDA) algorithm. Besides, asynchronous BCI paradigm based on P300 can offer an appropriate number of control instructions and enables users to control the appliances in virtual home freely. In order to test the accuracy and effectiveness of the system, 8 subjects are asked to control the relative objects. Finally, the experiment results show that the VSH-EEG system is acceptable and users can enjoy a new way of entertainment.

Previous research has shown that talking about helping, sharing and giving to others creates positive impression on others, by which individuals and governments gain public approval. So far, the value judgement of approval and disapproval in terms of prosocial or antisocial has not been investigated in the domain of neuroscience of language. Here, the influence of prosocial words towards neural adaptability for greater acceptance is examined using behavioural response mapping with electroencephalography activities of human brain. The prosocial and antisocial words employing correct and incorrect set of sentences in English are presented to participants for performing grammatical judgement task. Our results show that processing of antisocial word requires larger neurocognitive resources as compared to prosocial one, which is corroborated with our behavioural response time suggesting higher response time for antisocial than prosocial words.

Engaging in habitual exercise could attenuate these declines in middle age. In the present study, the event-related potential (ERP) activity of 40 middle age adults (21 females) and 42 young adults (24 females) was recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) as participants completed two cognitive tasks that elicit inhibitory processing, one indexing interference control (i.e., the Flanker Task), and the other response inhibition (i.e., the Stop-Signal task). Congruent arrays elicited significantly earlier peaks in P3b activity compared to incongruent arrays in the Flanker task for non-exercisers and young habitual exercisers. For middle age habitual exercisers, this difference was of much smaller magnitude, and non-significant. This finding suggests that the timing of interference control, as indexed by P3b latency, was similar in the congruent and congruent conditions for middle age adults who engaged in regular exercise. On the Stop-Signal task, the P3b activity of habitual exercisers was larger and peaked earlier than that of non-exercisers, indicating that ERP activity signalling response inhibition was enhanced in young and middle age adult regular exercisers. Sex differences were also observed in peak P3b activity on the Flanker task, results which suggest the relationship between regular exercise and interference control differs between men and women. The findings of this study suggest that it is important to consider individual differences, for example sex, when examining the effectiveness of exercise interventions targeting cognitive decline.

This study applied electroencephalogram (EEG) technique to investigate the emotional interference inhibitory control ability in 25 LD children and 22 non-LD controls with face-word emotional Stroop task. Results from behavioral tasks showed that LD children exhibited lower accuracy and longer reaction times. The EEG analysis showed that the non-LD children displayed significant interference effects both in the ERP components, with N2, N450 and SP exhibiting a larger activation in incongruent condition than the congruent condition, and brain oscillation, with early and late alpha demonstrating a larger desynchronization in the incongruent condition compared to the congruent condition. However, all these interference effects were absent in the LD children except the SP component. The present findings seem to indicate that the deficit during emotional interference control ability among children with LD might be due to the impaired attention allocation ability during emotional conflict detection process. Future research is needed to replicate these results and to explore the biochemical mechanisms between the impaired emotional interference inhibitory control ability and impaired attentional control ability.

This close relationship between smell and memory has been extensively studied; however, less attention has been paid to the direct comparison of associative and non-associative memory odours. This study aimed to measure responses to odours related to memories and responses to odours related to none or few memories using electroencephalography. In a within-subject design, 25 individuals received two food odours (chocolate and apple strudel) while olfactory event-related potentials (oERP) were recorded. These stimuli were chosen because individuals had an autobiographical memory associated with either one of the odours. Additionally, individuals rated the characteristics of the odours and were tested on their memory capacity. The results indicate that apple strudel, but not chocolate, produced larger oERP amplitudes when associated with a memory. Additionally, the apple strudel odour was found to be less pleasant and familiar than the chocolate odour, and fewer individuals had an association with the apple strudel odour. This indicates that oERP can be used to indicate the strength of odour-related memories.

This paper analyzes the neural feedback of embedded system learners in learning embedded systems by observing the generation and fluctuation of EEG signals. The ERP signals of computer learners in learning embedded system are monitored by ERP technology. The results show that the embedded system leads to the changes in EEG of computer linguists, and the changes of EEG amplitudes caused by different embedded systems. Combined with previous studies, it is shown that the embedded system processing has different effects on neural feedback. The analysis of EEG signals provides some theoretical basis and new ideas for embedded system teaching.

For instance, during the preictal phase, migraineurs experience symptoms and signs of altered pain perception as well as other well-known premonitory CNS-symptoms. In the present study we measured EEG-activation to non-painful motor and sensorimotor tasks in the different phases of the migraine cycle by longitudinal measurements of beta event related desynchronization (beta-ERD).MethodsWe recorded electroencephalography (EEG) of 41 migraine patients and 31 healthy controls. Each subject underwent three EEG recordings on three different days with classification of each EEG recording according to the actual migraine phase. During each recording, subjects performed one motor and one sensorimotor task with the flexion-extension movement of the right wrist.ResultsMigraine patients had significantly increased beta-ERD and higher baseline beta power at the contralateral C3 electrode overlying the primary sensorimotor cortex in the preictal phase compared to the interictal phase. We found no significant differences in beta-ERD or baseline beta power between interictal migraineurs and controls.ConclusionIncreased preictal baseline beta activity may reflect a decrease in pre-activation in the sensorimotor cortex. Altered pre-activation may lead to changes in thresholds for inhibitory responses and increased beta-ERD response, possibly reflecting a generally increased preictal cortical responsivity in migraine. Cyclic fluctuations in the activity of second- and third-order afferent somatosensory neurons, and their associated cortical and/or thalamic interneurons, may accordingly also be a central part of the migraine pathophysiology.

Since, a single-electrode EEG is accurately method to recognize the internal state of mind. The acquisition of EEG signals on frontal electrode, which is pasted on the forehead between the left eye and hair (Fp1) from eight subjects for classification of mental task into two classes. The mental tasks were induced by showing images with symbol or text to allow the users reply a true/ false question by imagination to an answer. The event related potential (ERPs) features were determined from the processed EEG signals for two classes of mental task. The acquired brain wave data were processed by the OpenViBE platform. Then, the classification was performed using LibSVM and Multiple-Layers Perceptron (MLP), while the parameters were differently validated with 10-Fold Cross Validation methods, and were compared for selection the highest accuracy of classification.

Cortical Activation Elicited by Subthalamic Deep Brain Stimulation Predicts Postoperative Motor Side Effects	NEUROMODULATION			English	Article						Cortical evoked potential; deep brain stimulation; EEG; high frequency activity; Parkinson's disease; subthalamic nucleus	SHORT-LATENCY ACTIVATION; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; NUCLEUS; CORTEX; POTENTIALS; ATTENTION; OUTCOMES	Objective Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for movement disorders, improvement varies substantially in individuals, across clinical trials, and over time. Noninvasive biomarkers that predict the individual response to DBS could be used to optimize outcomes and drive technological innovation in neuromodulation. We sought to evaluate whether noninvasive event related potentials elicited by subthalamic DBS during surgical targeting predict the tolerability of a given stimulation site in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. Methods Using electroencephalography, we measured event related potentials elicited by 20 Hz DBS over a range of stimulus intensities across the spatial extent of the implanted electrode array in 11 patients. We correlated event related potential timing and morphology with the stimulus amplitude thresholds for motor side effects during postoperative programming at >= 130 Hz. Results During surgical targeting, DBS at 20 Hz elicits large amplitude, high frequency activity (evoked HFA) with mean onset latency of 9.0 +/- 0.3 msec and a mean frequency of 175.8 +/- 7.8 Hz. The lowest DBS amplitude that elicits the HFA predicts thresholds for motor side effects during postoperative stimulation at >= 130 Hz (p < 0.001, ANOVA). Conclusion Event related potentials elicited by DBS can predict clinically relevant corticospinal activation by stimulation after surgery. Noninvasive scalp physiology requires no patient interaction and could serve as a biomarker to guide targeting, postoperative programming, and emerging technologies such as directional and closed-loop stimulation.

Individual Differences in Reading Speed are Linked to Variability in the Processing of Lexical and Contextual Information: Evidence from Single-trial Event-related Brain Potentials	WORD-JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL LINGUISTIC ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Lexical processing; reading; event-related brain potential; EEG; semantics	EYE-MOVEMENTS; WORD-FREQUENCY; PERCEPTUAL SPAN; PROBING INTERACTIONS; REPETITION; REGRESSION; PREDICTABILITY; PREDICTION; QUALITY; READERS	In the current paper, we examined the effects of lexical (e.g. word frequency, orthographic neighborhood density) and contextual (e.g. word predictability in the form of cloze probability) features on single-trial event-related brain potentials in a self-paced reading paradigm. Critically, we examined whether individual differences in reading speed modulated single-trial effects on the N400, an ERP component linked to semantic memory access. Consistent with past work, we found that word frequency effects on the N400 were attenuated with increasing predictability. However, effects of orthographic neighborhood density were robust across all levels of predictability. Importantly, individual differences in reading speed moderated the influence of both frequency and predictability (but not orthographic neighborhood density) on the N400, such that slower readers showed reduced effects compared to faster readers. These data show that different lexical factors influence word processing through dissociable mechanisms. Our findings support a dynamic semantic-memory access model of the N400, in which information at multiple levels (lexical, sentential, individual) simultaneously contributes to the unfolding neural dynamics of comprehension.

Pushing attention to one side: Force field adaptation alters neural correlates of orienting and disengagement of spatial attention	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography/event-related potentials; prism adaptation; sensorimotor adaptation; stroke; unilateral spatial neglect; visual attention	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PRISM ADAPTATION; UNILATERAL NEGLECT; FUNCTIONAL DISSOCIATION; HEMISPATIAL NEGLECT; MOTOR ADAPTATION; VISUAL NEGLECT; BRAIN; REHABILITATION; SENSORIMOTOR	Sensorimotor adaptation to wedge prisms can alter the balance of attention between left and right space in healthy adults, and improve symptoms of spatial neglect after stroke. Here we asked whether the orienting of spatial attention to visual stimuli is affected by a different form of sensorimotor adaptation that involves physical perturbations of arm movement, rather than distortion of visual feedback. Healthy participants performed a cued discrimination task before and after they made reaching movements to a central target. A velocity-dependent force field pushed the hand aside during each reach, and required participants to apply compensatory forces toward the opposite side. We used event-related potentials (ERPs) to determine whether electroencephalography (EEG) responses reflecting orienting (cue-locked N1) and disengagement (target-locked P1) of spatial attention are affected by adaptation to force fields. After adaptation, the cue-locked N1 was relatively larger for stimuli presented in the hemispace corresponding to the direction of compensatory hand force. P1 amplitudes evoked by invalidly cued targets presented on the opposite side were reduced. This suggests that force field adaptation boosted attentional orienting responses toward the side of hand forces, and impeded attentional disengagement from that side, mimicking previously reported effects of prism adaptation. Thus, remapping between motor commands and intended movement direction is sufficient to bias ERPs, reflecting changes in the orienting of spatial attention in the absence of visuo-spatial distortion or visuo-proprioceptive mismatch. Findings are relevant to theories of how sensorimotor adaptation can modulate attention, and may open new avenues for treatment of spatial neglect.

According to the Memory, Unification and Control (MUC) model, sentence processing requires long-range feedback from the left inferior frontal cortex (LIFC) to left posterior temporal cortex (LPTC). Single word processing however may only require feedforward propagation of semantic information from sensory regions to LPTC. Here we tested the claim that long-range feedback is required for sentence processing by reducing visual awareness of words using a masking technique. Masking disrupts feedback processing while leaving feedforward processing relatively intact. Previous studies have shown that masked single words still elicit an N400 ERP effect, a neural signature of semantic incongruency. However, whether multiple words can be combined to form a sentence under reduced levels of awareness is controversial. To investigate this issue, we performed two experiments in which we measured electroencephalography (EEG) while 40 subjects performed a masked priming task. Words were presented either successively or simultaneously, thereby forming a short sentence that could be congruent or incongruent with a target picture. This sentence condition was compared with a typical single word condition. In the masked condition we only found an N400 effect for single words, whereas in the unmasked condition we observed an N400 effect for both unmasked sentences and single words. Our findings suggest that long-range feedback processing is required for sentence processing, but not for single word processing.

Performance analysis of wavelet basis function in de-trending and ocular artefact removal from electroencephalogram	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						ocular artefacts; electroencephalogram; EEG; electro-oculogram; EOG; physiological interference; discrete wavelet transform; DWT; adaptive filter; brain-computer interface; BCI; coherence; correlation; performance metrics	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; EOG ARTIFACTS; EEG	The event related potential (ERP) brain-computer interface (BCI) system extensively uses the scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) for communication and motor control. It is a non-invasive procedure and the signal record has ERPs buried in EEG due to its low strength and it is usually contaminated with artefacts. For BCI control applications, the ocular artefacts produced by eye movement and blink which are dominant over the other physiological artefacts are undesirable. The objective of the study is to effectively remove the ocular artefact from EEG using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) combined with recursive least mean square (RLS) adaptive noise cancellation technique using the optimal basis function with Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE) thresholding. The proposed methodology is tested on the datasets created from the experimental setup measuring the performance metrics - mean square error (MSE), artefact to signal ratio (ASR), correlation coefficient and coherence. The results show that db4 wavelet performs better in de-trending and ocular artefact suppression by providing better signal to noise ratio and high level of coherence from 5 Hz onwards while preserving the original EEG signal.

J	Guven, A				Guven, Aysegul			Alcoholism detection based on Hu moment invariants of event-related potentials	JOURNAL OF THE CHINESE INSTITUTE OF ENGINEERS			English	Article						Alcohol dependence; event-related potentials; Hu moment invariants; clinical decision support	EEG; CLASSIFICATION; BRAIN; P300; SELECTION; ENTROPY; ERP	Diagnostic efforts to identify alcoholism are frequently subjective; however, recent technological advances have allowed the automated assessment of objective signals. To improve the performance of the automated classification of patients with alcohol dependence (AD) and controls, we analyzed features of event-related potentials (ERPs) in 72 subjects with AD and 42 controls while the subjects underwent three different visual oddball tasks. In addition to such commonly used morphological features (MFs) as time-domain amplitude and latency components as well as discrete wavelet transform coefficient entropies (WEs), we analyzed Hu moment invariants (HMIs) in this study. Smaller P3 and P2 amplitudes, longer latencies, lower WE values, and lower HMI values were observed for AD subjects relative to those observed for controls. We used a Naive Bayes algorithm to compare classification accuracies among MFs, WEs, HMIs, combinations of MFs/WEs, and combinations of all three characteristics. We found that HMIs improved the classification accuracy by 17%. Our findings demonstrated that a combined feature analysis of ERPs obtained during a visual oddball task can be a useful and discriminative tool for diagnostic purposes in alcoholism and that HMIs show promise for improving the objective diagnosis of alcoholism and similar diseases.

The P300 speller is one of the BCI applications used most commonly, as is very simple and reliable and can achieve satisfactory performance. However, like other BCIs, the P300 speller still has room for improvements in terms of its practical use, for example, selecting the best compromise between spelling accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR; speed) so that the P300 speller can maintain high accuracy while increasing spelling speed. Therefore, seeking correlates of, and predicting, the P300 speller's performance is necessary to understand and improve the technique. In this work, we investigated the correlations between rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task features and the P300 speller's performance. Fifty-five subjects participated in the RSVP and conventional matrix P300 speller tasks and RSVP behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) features were compared in the P300's speller performance. We found that several of the RSVP's event-related potential (ERP) and behavioral features were correlated with the P300 speller's offline binary classification accuracy. Using these features, we propose a simple multi-feature performance predictor (r = 0.53, p = 0.0001) that outperforms any single feature performance predictor, including that of the conventional RSVP T1% predictor (r = 0.28, p = 0.06). This result demonstrates that selective multi-features can predict BCI performance better than a single feature alone.

Threat-conditioned contexts modulate the late positive potential to faces-A mobile EEG/virtual reality study	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						contextualized face processing; fear conditioning; LPP; mobile EEG; virtual reality	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VIRTUAL-REALITY; ANXIETY DISORDERS; SOCIAL ANXIETY; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EXTINGUISHED FEAR; EXPOSURE THERAPY; EMOTIONAL SCENES; SENSITIVE N170	In everyday life, the motivational value of faces is bound to the contexts in which faces are perceived. Electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that inherent negatively valent contexts modulate cortical face processing as assessed with ERP components. However, it is not well understood whether learned (rather than inherent) and three-dimensional aversive contexts similarly modulate the neural processing of faces. Using full immersive virtual reality (VR) and mobile EEG techniques, 25 participants underwent a differential fear conditioning paradigm, in which one virtual room was paired with an aversive noise burst (threat context) and another with a nonaversive noise burst (safe context). Subsequently, avatars with neutral or angry facial expressions were presented in the threat and safe contexts while EEG was recorded. Analysis of the late positive potential (LPP), which presumably indicates motivational salience, revealed a significant interaction of context (threat vs. safe) and face type (neutral vs. angry). Neutral faces evoked increased LPP amplitudes in threat versus safe contexts, while angry faces evoked increased early LPP amplitudes regardless of context. In addition to indicating that threat-conditioned contexts alter the processing of ambiguous faces, the present study demonstrates the successful integration of EEG and VR with particular relevance for affective neuroscience research.

For example, the amplitude is often smaller and the latency is often longer in major depressive disorder, in bipolar disorder and in schizophrenia. On the other hand, in other neuropsychiatric populations, it is often possible to note the opposite phenomena of larger P300 amplitude and shorter latency in comparison with norm, but only for a specific subset of stimuli. This is often reported in various anxiety disorders, substance abuse and various chronic pain syndromes. These findings in the various clinical populations, on their commonalities and differences, are presented in this work. The prevalence of these two types of deviations in the electrophysiological markers of attention, shared by multiple neuropsychiatric populations, raise interesting questions regarding the role of attention deviation and regulation in neuropsychiatry. We present these questions and outline a possible hypothesis in this regard. Furthermore, such potential sensitivity of the attention-related markers to clinical dynamics suggests they could be candidates for monitoring and, potentially, early-sensing of clinical dynamics. Therefore, we discuss the potential usability of such markers.

The aim of this study is to determine whether 16p11.2 deletion (DEL) and duplication (DUP) carriers demonstrate a distinct and reciprocal pattern of electroencephalography (EEG) activity as represented by neural variability measures. EEG data were previously collected as part of the Simons Variation in Individuals Project. Variability measures, as estimated by single-trial ERP and spectral power analyses in the alpha and beta frequency bands, in addition to signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), were analyzed in DEL (n = 20), DUP (n = 8), and typical (n = 11) groups. We also analyzed mean visual evoked potentials and spectral power (alpha and beta power) to facilitate comparisons with other studies of associated disorders and CNVs. From measures of single-trial variability, we found higher intraparticipant variability in P1 amplitude and timecourse amplitude in DEL compared to controls. Compared to DUP, DEL showed higher variability in absolute alpha and absolute beta power but lower variability in P1 latency. SNRs did not differ between the groups. From measures of amplitude, latency, and spectral power, DUP showed lower relative alpha power compared to controls. Although it is yet unclear whether 16p11.2 CNV dosage impacts neural activity in an opposing manner, findings suggest that 16p11.2 DEL impacts the level of variability of neural responses. Higher neural variability may play a role in a range of cognitive processes in 16p11.2 CNV carriers. Autism Res 2019, (c) 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Lay Summary The study analyzed the consistency of patterns of brain waves and rhythms in those affected with a loss or gain of DNA material in the 16p11.2 region. Compared with typical individuals, 16p11.2 deletion carriers showed greater inconsistency in the way the brain responds to the same visual event. This high inconsistency in brain activity may play a role in some core symptoms in 16p11.2 copy number variation carriers.

Previous studies suggest a blunted neural response to reward may be a biomarker of depression and risk. In a sample of 86 pregnant women, the present study examined whether a reduced Reward Positivity (RewP), an event-related potential (ERP) elicited to feedback indicating monetary reward, relates to greater antenatal depressive symptoms. We also examined whether the RewP explains unique variance in antenatal depressive symptoms relative to other indices of risk, including annual income, history of a major depressive episodes, and score on a validated psychosocial risk measure, the Pregnancy Risk Questionnaire (PRQ). Zero-order correlations revealed that lower annual income, greater PRQ scores, and a blunted RewP were associated with greater antenatal depressive symptoms. The RewP and PRQ scores were identified as the best predictors of antenatal depressive symptoms in a stepwise regression, and together predicted 48 percent of the variance in antenatal depressive symptoms. PRQ scores accounted for 44% of the variance in antenatal depressive symptoms while the RewP accounted for 4% of additional incremental variance. This is the first study to combine self-report and neural activity to examine depressive symptoms in pregnant women. Future directions for research on perinatal depression are discussed.

Although visuotactile bimodal neurons integrate visual and haptic inputs, their receptive fields in monkey cortex encompass the whole hand, not just the palm. Using ERPs, we investigated whether hand function influenced the topology of integrated space around the hand. In a visual detection paradigm, target and non-target stimuli appeared equidistantly in front or in back of the hand. Equivalent N1 amplitudes were found for both conditions. P3 target versus non-target amplitude differences were greater for palm conditions. Hand proximity biased processing of visual targets equidistant from the hand early in processing. However, hand function biases emerged later when targets were selected for potential action. Thus, early hand proximity effects on object processing depend on sensory-reliant neural responses, whereas later multisensory integration depend more on the hand's functional expertise.

In theory, combining transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) with electroencephalography (EEG) is compelling, as both use non-invasive electrodes and image-guided dose can be informed by the reciprocity principle. To distinguish real changes in EEG from stimulation artifacts, prior studies applied conventional signal processing techniques (e.g. high-pass filtering, ICA). Here, we address the assumptions underlying the suitability of these approaches. We distinguish physiological artifacts - defined as artifacts resulting from interactions between the stimulation induced voltage and the body and so inherent regardless of tDCS or EEG hardware performance - from methodology-related artifacts - arising from non-ideal experimental conditions or non-ideal stimulation and recording equipment performance. Critically, we identify inherent physiological artifacts which are present in all online EEG-tDCS: 1) cardiac distortion and 2) ocular motor distortion. In conjunction, non-inherent physiological artifacts which can be minimized in most experimental conditions include: 1) motion and 2) myogenic distortion. Artifact dynamics were analyzed for varying stimulation parameters (montage, polarity, current) and stimulation hardware. Together with concurrent physiological monitoring (ECG, respiration, ocular, EMG, head motion), and current flow modeling, each physiological artifact was explained by biological source-specific body impedance changes, leading to incremental changes in scalp DC voltage that are significantly larger than real neural signals. Because these artifacts modulate the DC voltage and scale with applied current, they are dose specific such that their contamination cannot be accounted for by conventional experimental controls (e.g. differing stimulation montage or current as a control). Moreover, because the EEG artifacts introduced by physiologic processes during tDCS are high dimensional (as indicated by Generalized Singular Value Decomposition-GSVD), non-stationary, and overlap highly with neurogenic frequencies, these artifacts cannot be easily removed with conventional signal processing techniques. Spatial filtering techniques (GSVD) suggest that the removal of physiological artifacts would significantly degrade signal integrity. Physiological artifacts, as defined here, would emerge only during tDCS, thus processing techniques typically applied to EEG in the absence of tDCS would not be suitable for artifact removal during tDCS. All concurrent EEG-tDCS must account for physiological artifacts that are a) present regardless of equipment used, and b) broadband and confound a broad range of experiments (e.g. oscillatory activity and event related potentials). Removal of these artifacts requires the recognition of their non-stationary, physiology-specific dynamics, and individualized nature. We present a broad taxonomy of artifacts (non/stimulation related), and suggest possible approaches and challenges to denoising online EEG-tDCS stimulation artifacts.

Quantifying two-dimensional and three-dimensional stereoscopic learning in anatomy using electroencephalography	NPJ SCIENCE OF LEARNING			English	Article							INSTRUCTIONAL-DESIGN; REWARD POSITIVITY; MENTAL ROTATIONS; VISUALIZATION; FACE; ACQUISITION; CATEGORY; FEEDBACK; REFLECT	Advances in computer visualization enabling both 2D and 3D representation have generated tools to aid perception of spatial relationships and provide a new forum for instructional design. A key knowledge gap is the lack of understanding of how the brain neurobiologically processes and learns from spatially presented content, and new quantitative variables are required to address this gap. The objective of this study was to apply quantitative neural measures derived from electroencephalography (EEG) to examine stereopsis in anatomy learning by comparing mean amplitude changes in N250 (related to object recognition) and reward positivity (related to responding to feedback) event related to potential components using a reinforcement-based learning paradigm. Health sciences students (n = 61) learned to identify and localize neuroanatomical structures using 2D, 3D, or a combination of models while EEG and behavioral (accuracy) data were recorded. Participants learning using 3D models had a greater object recognition (N250 amplitude) compared to those who learned from 2D models. Based on neurological results, interleaved learning incorporating both 2D and 3D models provided an advantage in learning, retention, and transfer activities represented by decreased reward positivity amplitude. Behavioral data did not have the same sensitivity as neural data for distinguishing differences in learning with and without stereopsis in these learning activities. Measuring neural activity reveals new insights in applied settings for educators to consider when incorporating stereoscopic models in the design of learning interventions.

Integrating high-density ERP and fMRI measures of face-elicited brain activity in 9-12-year-old children: An ERP source localization study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Face processing; Dot-probe; fMRI; ERP; Source analysis; Children	PREFRONTAL CORTEX ACTIVATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EEG SOURCE ANALYSIS; ATTENTION BIAS; ANGRY FACES; BEHAVIORAL-INHIBITION; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; DEVELOPMENTAL ERP; SOCIAL ANXIETY; TRAIT ANXIETY	Social information processing is a critical mechanism underlying children's socio-emotional development. Central to this process are patterns of activation associated with one of our most salient socioemotional cues, the face. In this study, we obtained fMRI activation and high-density ERP source data evoked by parallel face dot-probe tasks from 9-to-12-year-old children. We then integrated the two modalities of data to explore the neural spatial-temporal dynamics of children's face processing. Our results showed that the tomography of the ERP sources broadly corresponded with the fMRI activation evoked by the same facial stimuli. Further, we combined complementary information from fMRI and ERP by defining fMRI activation as functional ROIs and applying them to the ERP source data. Indices of ERP source activity were extracted from these ROIs at three a priori ERP peak latencies critical for face processing. We found distinct temporal patterns among the three time points across ROIs. The observed spatial-temporal profiles converge with a dual-system neural network model for face processing: a core system (including the occipito-temporal and parietal ROIs) supports the early visual analysis of facial features, and an extended system (including the paracentral, limbic, and prefrontal ROIs) processes the socioemotional meaning gleaned and relayed by the core system. Our results for the first time illustrate the spatial validity of high-density source localization of ERP dot-probe data in children. By directly combining the two modalities of data, our findings provide a novel approach to understanding the spatial-temporal dynamics of face processing. This approach can be applied in future research to investigate different research questions in various study populations.

Early signal from the hippocampus for memory encoding	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						EEG; encoding; event-related potentials; hippocampus; novelty detection; mediotemporal lobe	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; LONG-TERM-MEMORY; WORKING-MEMORY; NOVELTY; FAMILIARITY; AMNESIA; BRAIN; TRANSFORMATION; CONSOLIDATION; MAINTENANCE	The mediotemporal lobe (MTL), including the hippocampus, is involved in all stages of episodic memory including memory encoding, consolidation, and retrieval. However, the exact timing of the hippocampus' involvement immediately after stimulus encounter remains unclear. In this study, we used high-density 156-channel electroencephalography to study the processing of entirely new stimuli, which had to be encoded, in comparison to highly overlearned stimuli. Sixteen healthy subjects performed a continuous recognition task with meaningful pictures repeated up to four consecutive times. Waveform and topographic cluster analyses of event-related potentials revealed that new items, in comparison to repetitions, were processed significantly differently at 220-300 ms. Source estimation localized activation for processing new stimuli in the right MTL. Our study demonstrates the occurrence of a transient signal from the MTL in response to new information already at 200-300 ms poststimulus onset, which presumably reflects encoding as an initial step toward memory consolidation.

J	Spape, MM; Dundas, K				Spape, Michiel M.; Dundas, Kimberley			I'll make you an offer you can refuse: How socially sensitive is the MFN?	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Medial frontal negativity; EEG; ERP; economic decision-making	MEDIAL FRONTAL NEGATIVITY; ULTIMATUM GAME; RESPONSES; FAIRNESS; ERP	Medial frontal negativity (MFN) is an event-related potential thought to originate in the anterior cingulate cortex. It is evoked by outcomes being worse than expected, such as when presented with unfair economic proposals during the Ultimatum Game (UG). This could mean the MFN indexes a social-emotional response, as commonly suggested in accounts that relate it to a violation of a social norm of fairness. To examine the link between MFN and norm violation, we designed an EEG experiment with participants acting as representatives in an UG. Participants responded either as themselves, or as representatives of two charities. Of these, a norm-compatible charity conformed to the participant's values, while the norm-incompatible charity contrasted to them. The behavioral results showed that norm-incompatible representation reversed behavior, with almost all fair offers being declined. The MFN, however, was unaffected by the norm representation, with unfair offers consistently evoking MFNs across conditions. We furthermore replicated the curious finding that unexpectedly generous offers evoke as much MFN as unfair offers. Thus, the MFN is not nearly as sensitive to higher-order social-emotional processes as commonly assumed. Instead, the perceived inequality that drives the MFN likely reflects a rational, probabilistic process.

In this paper, we develop a novel event-related potential (ERP)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) to detect human intention for continuously controlling dynamic systems. First, channel selection is performed by using the improved forward floating search algorithm (ISFFS). Then, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for feature extraction and a linear discrimination analysis or support vector machine classifier is used to decode intention for each subject. The experimental results of eight subjects show that the proposed system based on the optimal channels selected by the ISFFS algorithm and features extracted by the CNN performs well. Compared to other similar BCI systems, the proposed one can issue a command more quickly and accurately. This work not only facilitates the research of brain-controlled dynamic systems, but it also provides some new insights into the research of BCIs.

However, it is not clear to what extent the rhythm could affect the processes of sentence speech production. In this event-related potential (ERP) study, we examined whether a particular rhythmic pattern could affect the planning of speech production before articulation. We recorded electrophysiological (EEG) and behavioural (reaction time) data while participants read aloud a target speech in Chinese. Target speeches were sentences or phrases consisting four characters, with regular (e.g., the 2 + 2 pattern; numbers in the brackets represent the number of syllables) or irregular (e.g., 1 + 3) rhythmic patterns, which were preceded by congruent or incongruent musical rhythmic patterns formed by simple pure tones with different temporal intervals. Behavioural and ERP findings indicated a rhythmic priming effect in comparing congruent and incongruent conditions in the regular target speeches, but not in the irregular ones. An early component (N100) that was elicited in response to target speeches that were rhythmically mismatched to primes was linked to the detection of hierarchical linguistic units, which did not conform to expectations. A later negative component (N400) was thought to reflect the violation of expectation on rhythmic pattern in speech production. These findings suggest that rhythmic pattern constrains grammatical and prosodic encoding during speech production, and support the hypothesis that speakers form a grammatical or a prosodic abstract frame before articulation.

The odor was presented via a computer - controlled olfactometer and EEG was recorded from 64 scalp locations. At behavioral level, the longer the odor stimulus was presented, the greater the concentration was perceived by participants. Electrophysiological data showed that longer duration time lengthened the latency of Negative waves of about 200 ms appeared in stimulation (N2) and Positive waves of about 300 ms appeared in stimulation (P3) components, besides, have a larger N2 amplitude than the shorter duration time condition in the mid-frontal and left frontal-temporal areas. These results revealed that duration time of odor mixture do have an influence on the central nervous odor processing.

The present study was aimed at examining, by means of intracerebral EEG recordings, the time course of the activity in this structure, as well as in other functionally connected cortical (frontal, cingulate, insular and temporal) areas, during a visual time reproduction task. Four patients undergoing stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) for presurgical investigation of refractory focal epilepsy were enrolled. They were selected on the presence of depth electrodes implanted within the SMA. They were instructed to encode, keep in memory and then reproduce the duration (3, 5 and 7 s) of emotionally-neutral or negative pictures. Emotional stimuli were used with the aim of examining neural correlates of temporal distortions induced by emotion. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were analyzed during three periods: During and at the extinction of the target interval (TI) and at the beginning of the reproduction interval (RI). Electrophysiological data revealed an ERP time-locked to TI-offset whose amplitude varied monotonically with TI-duration. This effect was observed in three out of the four patients, especially within the SMA and the insula. It also involved the middle and anterior cingulate cortex, the superior, middle and inferior frontal gyri and the paracentral lobule. These effects were modulated by the prior TI-duration and predicted variations in temporal reproduction accuracy. In contrast, modulations of ERPs with TI-duration, emotion or temporal performance during the target or the reproduction interval were modest and less consistent across patients. These results demonstrate that, during reproduction of supra-second time intervals, the SMA, in concert with a fronto-insular network, is involved at the end of the target interval, and suggest a role in the duration categorization and decision making operations or alternatively in the preparedness of the timing of the future movement that will be executed during the reproduction phase.

ERPs were recorded using a passive oddball paradigm to sinusoidal standard and deviant tone stimuli of 500 and 520 Hz, respectively, in four conditions: prehypnosis, neutral hypnosis, hypnotic suggestion for altering the tone perception, and posthypnotic conditions. Earlier studies have indicated that hypnosis and hypnotic suggestions might have an effect on MMN, but the results of our study contradict these results: No statistically significant differences were found between the conditions in the MMN amplitudes.

Working memory and non-verbal emotion regulation both draw upon EC mechanisms so may also be affected by bilingualism, but these relationships are not fully understood. These relationships were explored using an n-back task with distracting emotional stimuli administered to young adults while continuous EEG was recorded. Monolinguals were faster but less accurate on the 2-back than bilinguals, and monolingual accuracy was more impeded by the presence of emotional stimuli than was that of bilinguals. The P300 event-related potential, a neural signature of working memory processing in the re-back, had smaller amplitudes in both groups on the 2-back than the 1-back, but attenuation in response to distracting emotional stimuli was greater for bilinguals than monolinguals. P300 latencies were also differentially affected by emotional stimuli in each group: Bilingual latencies were constant across emotions but monolingual latencies increased from neutral to angry conditions. In general, bilingual performance was less impacted by the emotional distraction than was that of the monolinguals. Additionally, bilinguals adjusted to the changing demands of the 1-back and 2-back conditions by recruiting neural networks to support different behavioral outcomes than monolinguals.

Both animal models of NMDAR blockade and clinical studies in patients with schizophrenia have suggested that behavioral phenotypes are associated with reduction in inhibition within the frontal cortex. METHODS: Here we investigate event-related potentials to a roving auditory oddball paradigm under ketamine in healthy human volunteers (N = 18; double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design). Using recent advances in Bayesian modeling of group effects in dynamic causal modeling, we fit biophysically plausible network models of the auditory processing hierarchy to whole-scalp event-related potential recordings. This allowed us to identify regionally specific effects of ketamine in a distributed network of interacting cortical sources. RESULTS: We show that the effect of ketamine is best explained as a selective change in intrinsic inhibition, with a pronounced ketamine-induced reduction of inhibitory interneuron connectivity in frontal sources, compared with temporal sources. Simulations of these changes in an integrated microcircuit model shows that they are associated with a reduction in superficial pyramidal cell activity that can explain drug effects observed in the event-related potential. CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with findings from invasive recordings in animal models exposed to NMDAR blockers, and provide evidence that inhibitory interneuron-specific NMDAR dysfunction may be sufficient to explain electrophysiological abnormalities induced by NMDAR blockade in human subjects.

Morphological processing without semantics: An ERP study with spoken words	CORTEX			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Morphological Processing Conference (MoProc)	JUN 22-24, 2017	SISSA, Trieste, ITALY		SISSA	Morphological processing; Spoken word recognition; Auditory lexical decision; Event-related potentials (ERPs)	DISTRIBUTED CONNECTIONIST APPROACH; MORPHO-ORTHOGRAPHIC SEGMENTATION; TIME-COURSE; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; RECOGNITION EVIDENCE; NEURAL DYNAMICS; DECOMPOSITION; EEG; TRANSPARENCY; TRACKING	The time-course of morphological processing during spoken word recognition was investigated using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) in an auditory lexical decision task. We compared three different types of French words: truly suffixed (e.g., pochette 'little pocket' = poche 'pocket' + diminutive suffix -ette), pseudo-suffixed (e.g., mouette 'seagull' = mou 'soft' + pseudo-suffix -ette) and non-suffixed target words (e.g., fortune 'fortune' = fort 'strong' + non-suffix -une). Suffixed (e.g., mouesse = mou + suffix-esse) and non-suffixed nonwords (e.g., mouipe = mou + non-suffix -ipe) were also tested. The behavioural results showed that participants responded more slowly to non-suffixed words than to truly suffixed and pseudo-suffixed words, but there was no difference between the two suffixed conditions. Moreover, participants made more errors rejecting pseudo-suffixed nonwords than non-suffixed nonwords. In the ERP analyses, TO was shifted to the end of the embedded stem or pseudo-stem. The ERP results revealed enhanced N400 amplitudes for non-suffixed words compared to truly suffixed and pseudo suffixed words. Again, there was no difference between the truly and pseudo-suffixed conditions. In addition, we found an increased N400 amplitude for both pseudo-suffixed and non-suffixed nonwords than for words. The latency of the onset of this N400 effect varied between the three experimental conditions: the word-nonword difference occurred earliest in the truly suffixed condition, slightly later in the pseudo-suffixed condition and latest in the non-suffixed condition. Both behavioural and EEG data jointly suggest that spoken words with a genuine morphological structure and words with a pseudo morphological structure are decomposed into morphemic sub-units. Moreover, the earlier appearance of the N400 effects in the truly suffixed condition indicates that morphological information is more readily available in words with a semantically transparent morphological structure.

Participants performed the flanker task with an alerting tone in half of the trials and SAT manipulation. Behavioral results showed the usual increase of the conflict effect (incongruent-congruent flankers) in the alerting trials. This interaction was not affected by SAT manipulation in response times, although accuracy emphasis abolished alerting effects in error rates. Event-related potential (ERP) results showed that alerting increased the conflict by facilitating the selection and activation of stimulus-response links, reflected in modulations of the P3b component, and by enhancing the activation of incorrect response evoked by incongruent flankers, reflected in an increased initial incorrect activation in the lateralized readiness potential (LRP). Time-frequency analysis showed that the alerting-triggered increase of conflict entailed stronger response of executive mechanisms, reflected in a larger conflict-related midfrontal theta-band power. These EEG effects were not affected by SAT manipulation. In conclusion, alerting affects both the emergence of conflict and conflict control, and this alerting-conflict interaction could not be explained in terms of SAT.

Event-related potentials in response to feedback following risk-taking in the hot version of the Columbia Card Task	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Columbia Card Task; electroencephalography; FRN; P300; risk	MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; DECISION-MAKING; DELIBERATIVE PROCESSES; BRAIN POTENTIALS; AGE-DIFFERENCES; GAMBLING TASK; REWARD; ADOLESCENTS; PERFORMANCE; P300	Given the importance of risk-taking in individuals' personal and professional life, several behavioral tasks for measuring the construct have been developed. Recently, a new task was introduced, the Columbia Card Task (CCT). This task measures participants' risk levels and establishes how sensitive participants are to gains, losses, and probabilities when taking risk. So far, the CCT has been examined in behavioral studies and in combination with several (neuro)biological techniques. However, no electroencephalography (EEG) research has been done on the task. The present study fills this gap and helps to validate this relatively new experimental task. To this end, n = 126 students were asked to complete self-reports (reward responsiveness, impulsiveness, and sensation-seeking) and to perform the CCT (and other risk tasks) in an EEG setup. The results show that feedback appraisal after risky decision-making in the CCT was accompanied by a feedback-related negativity (FRN) and a P300, which were stronger in response to negative than positive feedback. Correlations between the FRN and P300 difference wave on the one hand and risk-related self-reports and behavior on the other were nonsignificant and small, but were mostly in the expected direction. This pattern did not change after excluding participants with psychiatric/neurological disorders and outliers. Excluding participants with reversed (positive > negative) difference waves strengthened FRN correlations. The impact such individuals can have on the data should be taken into account in future studies. Regarding the CCT in particular, future studies should also address its oddball structure and its masking of true values (censoring).

The P300 wave is a neural marker of human inhibitory control, and it can be used to recognize the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in human. In addition, the P300 neural marker can be considered as a stop command in the brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies. Therefore, the present study of electroencephalography (EEG) recognizes the mindset of human inhibition by observing the brain dynamics, like P300 wave in the frontal lobe, supplementary motor area, and in the right temporoparietal junction of the brain, all of them have been associated with response inhibition. Our work developed a hierarchical classification model to identify the neural activities of human inhibition. To accomplish this goal phase-locking value (PLV) method was used to select coupled brain regions related to inhibition because this method has demonstrated the best performance of the classification system. The PLVs were used with pattern recognition algorithms to classify a successful-stop versus a failed-stop in left-and right-hand inhibitions.

Although IPs are highly comorbid with alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and despite evidence that AUDs are also characterized by aberrant reward processing styles, no studies have examined how AUD history impacts the RewP among adults with IPs. The current preliminary study sought to examine this question in a sample of 65 adults with 1) current IPs (i.e., depression, social anxiety, and/or generalized anxiety, 2) current IPs with a history of an AUD (IP + Past AUD), and 3) no history of a DSM-IV disorder. Participants completed a guessing reward task while electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Results indicated that participants in the IP group exhibited a more attenuated RewP relative to IP + Past AUD and healthy control individuals. Findings from this study highlight the importance of examining diagnostic subgroups among adults with anxiety and depressive disorders, and suggest that a history of AUD may enhance reward reactivity at the neural level in individuals with IPs.

Insights from EEG-based visual word decoding, feature derivation and image reconstruction	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						EEG; multivariate analysis; reading; word processing	TIME-COURSE; BRAIN ACTIVATION; FORM AREA; RECOGNITION; ERP; PATTERNS; IMPACT	Investigations into the neural basis of reading have shed light on the cortical locus and the functional role of visual-orthographic processing. Yet, the fine-grained structure of neural representations subserving reading remains to be clarified. Here, we capitalize on the spatiotemporal structure of electroencephalography (EEG) data to examine if and how EEG patterns can serve to decode and reconstruct the internal representation of visually presented words in healthy adults. Our results show that word classification and image reconstruction were accurate well above chance, that their temporal profile exhibited an early onset, soon after 100 ms, and peaked around 170 ms. Further, reconstruction results were well explained by a combination of visual-orthographic word properties. Last, systematic individual differences were detected in orthographic representations across participants. Collectively, our results establish the feasibility of EEG-based word decoding and image reconstruction. More generally, they help to elucidate the specific features, dynamics, and neurocomputational principles underlying word recognition.	[Ling, Shouyu; Lee, Andy C.

Electrophysiology of Inhibitory Control in the Context of Emotion Processing in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						autism spectrum disorder; electroencephalography; event related potentials; inhibitory control; emotion processing	RESPONSE-INHIBITION; ERP COMPONENTS; CONFLICT ADAPTATION; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; GO/NOGO TASK; STOP-SIGNAL; N2; ADHD; GO	Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is an increasingly common developmental disorder that affects 1 in 59 children. Despite this high prevalence of ASD, knowledge regarding the biological basis of its associated cognitive difficulties remains scant. In this study, we aimed to identify altered neurophysiological responses underlying inhibitory control and emotion processing difficulties in ASD, together with their associations with age and various domains of cognitive and social function. This was accomplished by assessing electroencephalographic recordings during an emotional go/nogo task alongside parent rating scales of behavior. Event related potential (ERP) N200 component amplitudes were reduced in children with ASD compared to typically developing (TD) children. No group differences were found, however, for task performance, P300 amplitude or latency, or N170 amplitude or latency, suggesting that individuals with ASD may only present conflict monitoring abnormalities, as reflected by the reduced N200 component, compared to TD individuals. Consistent with previous findings, increased age correlated with improved task performance scores and reduced N200 amplitude in the TD group, indicating that as these children develop, their neural systems become more efficient. These associations were not identified in the ASD group. Results also showed significant associations between increased N200 amplitudes and improved executive control abilities and decreased autism traits in TD children only. The newly discovered findings of decreased brain activation in children with ASD, alongside differences in correlations with age compared to TD children, provide a potential neurophysiological indicator of atypical development of inhibitory control mechanisms in these individuals.

We investigated this issue in an evaluative feedback scenario. Participants were told that an expert psychotherapist, a layperson or a randomly acting computer was going to give them online positive, neutral or negative personality feedback while high-density EEG was recorded. Sender attribution affected processing rapidly, even though the feedback was on average identical. Event-related potentials revealed a linear increase with attributed expertise beginning 150 ms after disclosure and most pronounced for N1, P2 and early posterior negativity components. P3 and late positive potential amplitudes were increased for both human senders and for emotionally significant (positive or negative) feedback. Strikingly, feedback from a putative expert prompted large P3 responses, even for inherently neutral content. Source analysis localized early enhancements due to attributed sender expertise in frontal and somatosensory regions and later responses in the posterior cingulate and extended visual and parietal areas, supporting involvement of mentalizing, embodied processing and socially motivated attention. These findings reveal how attributed sender expertise rapidly alters feedback processing in virtual interaction and have implications for virtual therapy and online communication.

Effect of the stop-signal modality on brain electrical activity associated with suppression of ongoing actions	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Motor preparation; Motor inhibition; Stop-signal task; EEG; Stimulus modality effects; Stop-N2/P3	INHIBITORY MOTOR CONTROL; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; REACTION-TIME; COGNITIVE CONTROL; ERROR-DETECTION; COMPONENTS; CONFLICT; GO/NOGO	To clarify how the modality of stop signals affects the ability to suppress ongoing actions, we compared behavioural indices and event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded in healthy volunteers performing visual and auditory stop-signal tasks. Auditory stop signals were associated with faster reaction times and shorter stop-N2 and stop-P3 latencies. Given that the tasks did not differ in attentional/ arousal processes (go-P3 or stop-P3 amplitudes) or motor preparation (LRP amplitude, onset or latency), our results suggest that stop signal modality mainly affects bottom-up sensory processes (faster auditory processing). The ERP waveform obtained by subtracting successfully stopped from unsuccessfully stopped trials showed similar amplitude and topography in both tasks, indicating that the strength of top-down processes related to inhibition was independent of modality. The findings contribute further knowledge about the variables associated with efficient inhibition and have practical implications for the design of settings or interventions to improve reactive inhibition.

Using principal components analysis to examine resting state EEG in relation to task performance	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						brain dynamics; cognition; decision making; EEG; ERPs; principal components analysis (PCA)	CURRENT SOURCE DENSITY; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PRESTIMULUS ALPHA; TIME VARIABILITY; ERP RESPONSES; INTRINSIC EEG; GO/NOGO TASK; BRAIN; DELTA; THETA	Brain dynamics research has highlighted the significance of the ongoing EEG in ERP genesis and cognitive functioning. Few studies, however, have assessed the contributions of the intrinsic resting state EEG to these stimulus-response processes and behavioral outcomes. Principal components analysis (PCA) has increasingly been used to obtain more objective, data-driven estimates of the EEG and ERPs. PCA was used here to reassess resting state EEG and go/no-go task ERP data from a previous study (Karamacoska et al., 2017) and the relationships between these measures. Twenty adults had EEG recorded with eyes closed (EC) and eyes open (EO), and as they completed an auditory go/no-go task. Separate EEG and ERP PCAs were conducted on each resting condition and stimulus type. For each state, seven EEG components were identified within the delta-beta frequency range, and six ERP components were obtained for go and no-go stimuli. Within the task, mean reaction time (RT) correlated positively with go P2 amplitude and negatively with P3b positivity. Regressions revealed that greater EC delta-1 amplitude predicted shorter mean RT, and larger alpha-3 amplitude predicted go P3b enhancement. These findings demonstrate the immediate P2 and P3b involvement in decision making and response control and the intrinsic EC delta-1 and alpha-3 amplitudes that underpin these processes. The brain's EEG state activity is a fundamental determinant of ERP and behavioral responses. Across brain dynamics studies, however, EEG has been assessed using predefined frequency ranges. Considered a more data-driven approach to decomposing electrophysiological data, principal components analysis was applied here to examine resting state EEG relations to performance.

In this study, we employed traditional electrophysiological and advanced time-frequency methods, combined with principal component analyses, to extract neural activity related to error monitoring and tested their relations to academic achievement in cognitively able kindergarteners with autism spectrum disorder. In total, 35 cognitively able kindergarteners with autism spectrum disorder completed academic assessments and the child-friendly "Zoo Game" Go/No-go task at school entry. The Go/No-go task successfully elicited an error-related negativity and error positivity in children with autism spectrum disorder as young as 5 years at fronto-central and posterior electrode sites, respectively. We also observed increased response-related theta power during errors relative to correct trials at fronto-central sites. Both larger error positivity and theta power significantly predicted concurrent academic achievement after controlling for behavioral performance on the Zoo Game and intelligence quotient. These results suggest that the use of time-frequency electroencephalography analyses, combined with traditional event-related potential measures, may provide new opportunities to investigate neurobiological mechanisms of executive function and academic achievement in young children with autism spectrum disorder.

Language disorders may occur in patients with disorders of consciousness (DoCs), and they could interfere with the behavioral assessment of consciousness and responsiveness. Objective. In this study, we retrospectively explored whether ERP N400 was eventually associated with the presence of aphasia diagnosed in those patients who had evolved into Exit-Minimally Conscious State (E-MCS) at the clinical follow-up. Methods. In this retrospective cohort study, the ERPs elicited by an auditory sentences task were retrospectively examined in a sample of 15 DoC patients diagnosed according to the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R). All these 15 DoC patients underwent a (at least) 1-year clinical follow-up, which included a neuropsychological evaluation to assess language function among other cognitive functions. Ten healthy individuals also underwent the same paradigm to investigate the variability of ERPs characteristics. Results. The N400 ERP component with centroparietal topography was found in 9 of 10 healthy controls in response to the ill-formed sentences. Analysis of patients' data revealed that (1) a significant N400 component could be detected in 64% (9 of 14 patients) of the DoC patients regardless of the type of DoC; (2) no significant N400 ERP component was retrospectively detected in those E-MCS patients who showed aphasia at the follow-up; and (3) the presence/absence of the N400-ERP component was consistent with the brain lesion side and significantly predict the recovery. Conclusion. These preliminary findings indicate that the absence of N400 was significantly associated with the presence of aphasia diagnosed at the clinical follow-up in E-MCS patients.

The time course of semantic and relational processing during verbal analogical reasoning	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Analogical reasoning; Event related potentials; Semantic priming; N400; Relational comparison; Electroencephalography	ROSTROLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LEXICAL DECISION; BRAIN; N400; INTEGRATION; ASSOCIATION; RECRUITMENT; RETRIEVAL; SENTENCES; COMPONENT	Analogy is an important ability that allows humans to discover relationships between information domains that often vary in surface and relational characteristics. Cognitive neuroscience studies of analogy have demonstrated the importance of the prefrontal cortex during relational comparisons, but little is known about how semantic and relational similarity interact throughout its time course. We used scalp electroencephalography (EEG) analyzed with event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine the neural time course of analogical reasoning while 16 participants solved four-term verbal analogies. Semantic similarity was manipulated by increasing the semantic distance between source and target analogs creating semantically near and far analogies. Relational similarity was manipulated by creating relationally valid and invalid analogies. Only valid analogies were impacted by semantic distance such that far analogies were solved slower and less accurately than near analogies. Correctly solving near analogies elicited more positive waveforms at the N400 and during later relational processing. However, valid analogies elicited more positive signals during only later relational processing and not during the N400. These results suggest that semantic information impacts both early semantic and late relational comparison stages, while relational properties exert more influence in later stages of analogical reasoning. The degree of semantic similarity shared between knowledge domains demonstrated a potent effect throughout the time course of analogy that affected not only semantic access, but also the mapping of relational structures.

Exceptions are generally only made for mental health disorders associated with delusions and hallucinations where behaviour may be triggered by the experience of objectively non-existent percepts. Here, we demonstrate, using synaesthesia as a model condition (in N = 19 grapheme-colour synaesthetes), how objectively non-existent (i.e. non-veridical) but still non-pathological perceptions affect actions in healthy humans. Using electroencephalography, we determine whether early-stage perceptual processes (reflected by P1 and N1 event-related potential (ERP) components), or late-stage-integration processes (reflected by N2 component), underlie the effects of non-veridical perceptions on action control. ERP analysis suggests that even though the examined peculiarities and experimental variations are perceptual in nature, it is not early-stage perceptual processes, but rather higher-order executive control processes linking perceptions to the appropriate motor response underlying this effect. Source localization analysis implicates activation within medial frontal cortices in the effect of how irrelevant non-veridical perceptions modulate behaviour. Our results challenge common conceptions about the determinants of human behaviour but can be explained by well-established theoretical frameworks detailing the link between perception and action. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Bridging senses: novel insights from synaesthesia'.

Expectations shape pain perception and can inhibit (placebo) or enhance (nocebo) pain. Sleep restriction appears to enhance placebo responses; however, whether sleep restriction also affects nocebo responses remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to determine whether sleep restriction facilitates nocebo-induced changes in pain and pain-evoked cortical potentials. Methods In an experimental study with a crossover design, the sensitivity to electrically induced pain was determined in 53 nurses under two sleep conditions, after habitual sleep and after two consecutive nights at work. Nocebo was induced by conditioning one-third of the pain stimuli. Pain-elicited cortical event-related potentials were recorded by electroencephalography (EEG). Data were analysed both in the time domain (N2P2 amplitude) and in the time-frequency domain (ERP magnitude). Sleepiness and vigilance were also assessed. Results Both nocebo alone and sleep restriction alone increased the sensitivity to electrically induced pain. However, no interaction effect was found. Moreover, the magnitude of the pain-elicited responses increased after sleep restriction and decreased after nocebo expectation, suggesting that nocebo is probably not an underlying mechanism for the commonly observed hyperalgesia induced by sleep restriction. Conclusions The present work addresses whether sleep restriction, known to increase the sensitivity of the pain system, facilitates nocebo-induced hyperalgesia. Our findings suggest that this is not the case, indicating that the increased sensitivity of the pain system following nocebo and sleep restriction are mediated by different cortical mechanisms.

In both domains, this segmentation can be facilitated by perceptual cues contained within the information stream. In speech, prosodic cues (e.g., a pause, pre-boundary lengthening, and pitch rise) mark boundaries between words and phrases, while boundaries between actions of an action sequence can be marked by kinematic cues (e.g., a pause, pre-boundary deceleration). The processing of prosodic boundary cues evokes an Event-related Potentials (ERP) component known as the Closure Positive Shift (CPS), and it is possible that the CPS reflects domain-general cognitive processes involved in segmentation, given that the CPS is also evoked by boundaries between subunits of non-speech auditory stimuli. This study further probed the domain-generality of the CPS and its underlying processes by investigating electrophysiological correlates of the processing of boundary cues in sequences of spoken verbs (auditory stimuli; Experiment 1; N = 23 adults) and actions (visual stimuli; Experiment 2; N = 23 adults). The EEG data from both experiments revealed a CPS-like broadly distributed positivity during the 250 ms prior to the onset of the post-boundary word or action, indicating similar electrophysiological correlates of boundary processing across domains, suggesting that the cognitive processes underlying speech and action segmentation might also be shared.

There is growing evidence that tDCS-related outcomes are likely to be influenced by an individual's brain state at the time of stimulation, i.e., effects show a degree of 'state-dependency'. However, few studies have examined the behavioural and physiological impact of state-dependency within cognitively salient brain regions. Here, we applied High-Definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in 20 healthy participants, whilst they either remained at rest, or performed a cognitive task engaging working memory (WM). In a third condition sham stimulation was administered during task performance. Neurophysiological changes were probed using TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs), event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded during n-back WM tasks, and via resting-state EEG (RS-EEG). From a physiological perspective, our results indicate a degree of neuromodulation following HDtDCS, regardless of task engagement, as evidenced by changes in TEP amplitudes following both active stimulation conditions. Changes in ERP (P3) amplitudes were also observed for the 2-Back task following stimulation delivered during task performance only. However, no changes were seen on RS-EEG for any condition, nor were any group-level effects of either stimulation condition observed on n-back performance. As such, these findings paint a complex picture of neural and behavioural responses to prefrontal stimulation in healthy subjects and provide only limited support for state-dependent effects of HD-tDCS over the DLPFC overall.

One prominent aspect is the evaluation of facial signs of trustworthiness, which has been shown to occur reliably, rapidly, and without conscious awareness in adults. Recent developmental work indicates that the sensitivity to facial trustworthiness has early ontogenetic origins as it can already be observed in infancy. However, it is unclear whether infants' sensitivity to facial signs of trustworthiness relies upon conscious processing of a face or, similar to adults, occurs also in response to subliminal faces. To investigate this question, we conducted an event-related brain potential (ERP) study, in which we presented 7-month-old infants with faces varying in trustworthiness. Facial stimuli were presented subliminally (below infants' face visibility threshold) for only 50 ms and then masked by presenting a scrambled face image. Our data revealed that infants' ERP responses to subliminally presented faces differed as a function of trustworthiness. Specifically, untrustworthy faces elicited an enhanced negative slow wave (800-1000 ms) at frontal and central electrodes. The current findings critically extend prior work by showing that, similar to adults, infants' neural detection of facial signs of trustworthiness occurs also in response to subliminal face. This supports the view that detecting facial trustworthiness is an early developing and automatic process in humans.

This tactile N2cc emerges at the same time as the visual N2pc component but has a different modality-specific topography over central somatosensory areas. Here, we investigated links between N2cc components and the space-based versus feature-based attentional selection of task-relevant tactile stimuli. On each trial, a pair of tactile items was presented simultaneously to one finger on the left and right hand. Target stimuli were defined by their location (e.g., left index finger; Spatial Attention Task), by a nonspatial feature (continuous vs. pulsed; Feature-Based Attention Task), or by a combination of spatial and nonspatial features (Conjunction Task). Reliable N2cc components were observed in all three tasks. They emerged considerably earlier in the Spatial Attention Task than in the Feature-Based Attention Task, suggesting that space-based selection mechanisms in touch operate faster than feature-guided mechanisms. The temporal pattern of N2cc components observed in the Conjunction Task revealed that space-based and feature-based attention both contributed to target selection, which was initially driven primarily by spatial location. Overall, these findings establish the N2cc component as a new electrophysiological marker of the selective attentional processing of task-relevant stimuli in touch.

Using a nonclinical sample, the current ERP study examined the effects of sensation seeking on performance monitoring and response inhibition. Twenty high sensation seekers and 21 low sensation seekers were selected from a large sample based on their sensation-seeking score and performed a stop-signal task while their EEG was recorded. High relative to low sensation seekers displayed similar response inhibition in terms of performance measure and stop-P3 amplitudes. Compared to low sensation seekers, however, high sensation seekers exhibited a reduced stop-N2 for unsuccessful, but not successful, inhibition. Moreover, an enhanced go-N2 in response to go signals was observed for high versus low sensation seekers, irrespective of whether the go signals were followed by a stop signal or not. Together, our findings suggest that sensation seeking in nonclinical populations is related to individual variability in performance monitoring rather than response inhibition, which provides important implications for the prevention and intervention of addictive behaviors that are driven by trait sensation seeking.

Downstream Behavioral and Electrophysiological Consequences of Word Prediction on Recognition Memory	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						language comprehension; prediction; false memory; recognition; ERP	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; FALSE MEMORIES; LEXICAL PREDICTION; PROACTIVE BRAIN; EYE-MOVEMENTS; ERP; RECOLLECTION; FACILITATION; CONTEXT	When people process language, they can use context to predict upcoming information, influencing processing and comprehension as seen in both behavioral and neural measures. Although numerous studies have shown immediate facilitative effects of confirmed predictions, the downstream consequences of prediction have been less explored. In the current study, we examined those consequences by probing participants' recognition memory for words after they read sets of sentences. Participants read strongly and weakly constraining sentences with expected or unexpected endings ("I added my name to the list/basket"), and later were tested on their memory for the sentence endings while EEG was recorded. Critically, the memory test contained words that were predictable ("list") but were never read (participants saw "basket"). Behaviorally, participants showed successful discrimination between old and new items, but false alarmed to the expected-item lures more often than to new items, showing that predicted words or concepts can linger, even when predictions are disconfirmed. Although false alarm rates did not differ by constraint, event-related potentials (ERPs) differed between false alarms to strongly and weakly predictable words. Additionally, previously unexpected (compared to previously expected) endings that appeared on the memory test elicited larger N1 and LPC amplitudes, suggesting greater attention and episodic recollection. In contrast, highly predictable sentence endings that had been read elicited reduced LPC amplitudes during the memory test. Thus, prediction can facilitate processing in the moment, but can also lead to false memory and reduced recollection for predictable information.

It is well acknowledged that BCI control is a skill and could be improved through practice and training. In this study, we explore the change of BCI behavioral performance as well as the electrophysiological properties across three training sessions in a pool of 42 human subjects. Our results show that the group average of BCI accuracy and the information transfer rate improved significantly in the third session compared to the first session; especially the significance reached in a smaller subset of a low BCI performance group (average accuracy <70%) as well. There was a significant difference of event-related desynchronization (ERD) lateralization for BCI control between the left-and right-hand imagination task in the last two sessions, but this significant difference was not revealed in the first training sessions. No significant change of R-2 value or event-related desynchronization and synchronization (ERD/ERS) for either channel C3 or channel C4, which were used for online control, was found across the training sessions. The change of ERD lateralization was also not significant across the training sessions. The present results indicate that BCI training could induce a change of behavioral performance and electrophysiological properties quickly, within just a few hours of training, distributed into three sessions. Multiple training sessions might especially be beneficial for the low BCI performers.

However, such evidence lacks temporal information. In this study, we examined the temporal dynamics of humour comprehension between two types of jokes: semantic (SEMs) and pun (PUNs) jokes, using electroencephalographic (EEG) techniques. Thirty SEMs and 30 PUNs were presented to 16 healthy subjects, and their EEG data were concurrently recorded. PUNs consequently showed a larger N400 amplitude than did SEMs, without a specified scalp site, which implies that PUNs induce greater surprise and semantic violation. Meanwhile, SEMs induced a larger P600-like amplitude at the posterior site, which implies that, in order to understand SEMs, higher working memory loads are needed to form novel associations and successfully frame-shift. A possible explanation is the differing logical mechanisms used to understand SEMs and PUNs: the former builds on semantic relationships, the latter on phonological causality.

J	Choi, SI; Hwang, HJ				Choi, Soo-In; Hwang, Han-Jeong			Effects of Different Re-referencing Methods on Spontaneously Generated Ear-EEG	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography (EEG); ear-EEG; re-referencing; mental task classification; brain-computer interface (BCI)	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; AVERAGE REFERENCE; CLASSIFICATION; POTENTIALS	In recent years, electroencephalography (EEG) measured around the ears, called ear-EEG, has been introduced to develop unobtrusive and ambulatory EEG-based applications. When measuring ear-EEGs, the availability of a reference site is restricted due to the miniaturized device structure, and therefore a reference electrode is generally placed near the recording electrodes. As the electrical brain activity recorded at a reference electrode closely placed to recording electrodes may significantly cancel or influence the brain activity recorded by the recording electrodes, an appropriate re-referencing method is often required to mitigate the impact of the reference brain activity. In this study, therefore, we systematically investigated the impact of different re-referencing methods on ear-EEGs spontaneously generated from endogenous paradigms. To this end, we used two ear-EEG datasets recorded behind both ears while subjects performed an alpha modulation task [eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO)] and two mental tasks [mental arithmetic (MA) and mental singing (MS)]. The measured ear-EEGs were independently re-referenced using five different methods: (i) all-mean, (ii) contralateral-mean, (iii) ipsilateral-mean, (iv) contralateral-bipolar, and (v) ipsilateral-bipolar. We investigated the changes in alpha power during EO and EC tasks, as well as event-related (de) synchronization (ERD/ERS) during MA and MS. To evaluate the effects of re-referencing methods on ear-EEGs, we estimated the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the two ear-EEG datasets, and assessed the classification performance of the two mental tasks (MA vs. MS). Overall patterns of changes in alpha power and ERD/ERS were similar among the five re-referencing methods, but the contralateral-mean method showed statistically higher SNRs than did the other methods for both ear-EEG datasets, except in the contralateral-bipolar method for the two mental tasks. In concordance with the SNR results, classification performance was also statistically higher for the contralateral-mean method than it was for the other re-referencing methods. The results suggest that employing contralateral mean information can be an efficient way to re-reference spontaneously generated ear-EEGs, thereby maximizing the reliability of ear-EEG-based applications in endogenous paradigms.

Error-related brain activity in relation to psychopathic traits in multi-problem young adults: An ERP study	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Psychopathy; Electroencephalography; Event-related potential; Young adulthood; Error-processing; Error-related negativity	YOUTH; INVENTORY; CHILDREN; DEFICITS; VERSION; SYSTEM; SAMPLE; CORTEX	One of the most prominent issues in psychopathy is the inability to adequately monitor one's performance and learn from one's mistakes. We investigated the relationship between psychopathic traits, as measured with the Youth Psychopathy Inventory-Short Version, and both early and late error-related brain activity in an at-risk sample of male young adults. These multi-problem young adults (age 18-27) are severely dysfunctional in society and suffer from multiple problems including financial problems, delinquency, psychological problems, and drug use. Our final sample consisted of 115 multi-problem young adults and 26 controls. Participants performed an Eriksen-Flanker task during EEG measurements. We used the difference wave of the error-related negativity (Delta ERN) as a measure of early error processing and the error positivity (Pe) as a measure of late error processing. Multi-problem young adults showed reduced ERN amplitudes compared to controls, but did not differ in Pe amplitude. We found no statistically significant relation between psychopathic traits and ERN and Pe amplitudes within the multi-problem group. Thus, we found evidence for dysfunctional error-processing in multi-problem young adults compared to controls. However, within the multi-problem sample we did not find evidence for a relationship between psychopathic traits and dysfunctional error-processing. One explanation may be that this is due to the specific developmental stage of our young adult participants in which a transition between error-processing deficits, as present in adolescents high in psychopathic traits, and error-processing overcompensation, as present in adults high in psychopathic traits, may occur.

The contribution of higher-order cognitive functions to postural control is poorly understood. It is recognized that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is active after postural perturbations, however little is known about anticipatory PFC activity occurring before an upcoming perturbation. Here we aim at advancing our understanding on the contribution of higher-order cognitive functions in the fore period before postural perturbations. Methods: Thirteen healthy men underwent both self-paced and externally-triggered lower limb perturbations during high-resolution electroencephalography and surface electromyography (sEMG) recordings. Event-related potentials (ERP) and sEMG associated with perturbations were compared between conditions. Results: Both self-paced and externally-triggered perturbations elicited a large prefrontal negativity before the perturbation onset, but the externally-triggered condition evoked larger activity over the left hemisphere; source analysis localized this activity in the PFC. The motor readiness potential occurred earlier and was larger for self-paced perturbations and its origin in premotor areas was confirmed. A larger bilateral activity over lateral occipital derivations was observed for externally-triggered perturbations and was localized in the occipital-temporal cortex, likely within the extrastriate body area (EBA). Discussion: We confirm that the preparatory activity of premotor areas is associated with the intentional engagement of upcoming actions since it occurs only before self-paced perturbations. The PFC anticipating both perturbations can be interpreted as an unintentional top-down cognitive control required by the tasks, especially involving attention and inhibition. However, before externally-triggered perturbations also other cognitive resources are required. The EBA activity anticipating externally-triggered perturbation may represent a visual prediction of the desired posture.

The proliferation of dementia cases in aging societies creates a remarkable economic as well as medical problems in many communities worldwide. A recently published report by The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 47 million people are suffering from dementia-related neurocognitive declines worldwide. The number of dementia cases is predicted by 2050 to triple, which requires the creation of an AI-based technology application to support interventions with early screening for subsequent mental wellbeing checking as well as preservation with digital-pharma (the so-called beyond a pill) therapeutical approaches. We present an attempt and exploratory results of brain signal (EEG) classification to establish digital biomarkers for dementia stage elucidation. We discuss a comparison of various machine learning approaches for automatic event-related potentials (ERPs) classification of a high and low task-load sound stimulus recognition. These ERPs are similar to those in dementia. The proposed winning method using tensor-based machine learning in a deep fully connected neural network setting is a step forward to develop AI-based approaches for a subsequent application for subjective-and mild-cognitive impairment (SCI and MCI) diagnostics.

The brain-computer interface is a technology that allows establishing communication between a human brain and external devices. BCIs may be applied in medicine to improve the life of disabled people and as well for entertainment. The P300 is an event-related potential (ERP) appearing about 300 ms after the occurrence of the stimulus of visual, auditory or sensory nature. It is based on the phenomenon observed in anticipation for a target event among non-target events. The 21-channel 201 Mitsar amplifier was used during the experiment to store EEG data from seven electrodes placed on the dedicated cap. The study was conducted on a group of five persons using P300 scenario available in OpenVibe software. The experiment was based on three steps - the classifier learning process, comparison and averaging of the obtained result and the final test of the classifier. The comparative analysis was performed with the application of two supervised classification methods: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP).

Methods: Twenty children aged between 8 and 17 wars, diagnosed with SH, and 20 age-matched healthy controls were included in this study. A classical auditory oddball paradigm was applied during the electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, and event-related potentials (ERPs) were evaluated between the 0.5- and 20-Hz frequency intervals. P1, N1, P2, N2 and P3 amplitudes and latencies were measured in Fz, FCz, Cz, CPz, Pz and Oz electrodes. Additionally, a number of neuropsychological tests evaluating the reaction time and various cognitive functions were carried out. Results: In children with SH, P3 amplitudes in FCz, Cz and CPz electrodes were significantly lower than those in controls (p <0.05). In addition to this, the P1N1 and N1P2 peak-to-peak amplitude values were also found to be smaller for children with SH than controls (p <0.05). With regard to the neuropsychological tests, no significant difference was observed between the SH and control groups on any of the cognitive test parameters, reaction time or correct response rates. Conclusions: In the present study, while children with SI I did not differ from controls with respect to their cognitive functions evaluated via neuropsychological tests, cognitive differences were detected via electrophysiological investigations. This result implies that implicit changes in cognition which are not yet overtly reflected on neuropsychological tests may be detected at an early stage in children with SH.

Research indicates that dysfunctional decision processes and trait variables such as impulsivity contribute to this awareness-behavior discrepancy. The present study focused on decision-related versus feedback-related processes as potential contributors to decision making in AUD by examining the relationship between decision choices and decision- and feedback-related ERP phenomena in the balloon analogue risk task (BART). N = 39 AUD and n = 35 healthy comparison participants (HC) performed the BART modified for EEG assessment. In each of 100 runs, participants made a series of choices about whether to pump up a virtual balloon, which popped pseudorandomly, ending the run. Alternatively, participants ended the run by pressing a "cash-out" button. Each pump not producing a pop provided .05 euro; popping resulted in loss of the run's accumulated gain. Groups made similar choices, though AUD responded more slowly. The decision P3 200-400 ms after decision prompt (balloon) was larger in AUD than in HC, and decision P3 enhancement on high-risk trials predicted choices to pump. Feedback-related negativity (FRN) after loss (relative to cash out) feedback was smaller in AUD than in HC, suggesting indifference to negative feedback. In AUD, high impulsivity was associated with risk-modulated decision P3 but not FRN. Results indicate atypical decision- and feedback-related processes that could contribute to difficulties in engaging with daily challenges effectively.

However, they require a tedious and time-consuming training procedure to build the decoding model, which can translate EEG signals into commands. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose an adaptive DVI by using a new semi-supervised algorithm. The decoding model of the proposed DVI is first built with a small labeled training set, and then gradually improved by updating the proposed semi-supervised decoding model with new collected unlabeled EEG signals. In our semi-supervised algorithm, independent component analysis (ICA) and Kalman smoother are first used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). After that, variational autoencoder is applied to provide a robust feature representation of EEG signals. Finally, a prior information-based transductive support vector machine (PI-TSVM) classifier is developed to translate these features into commands. Experimental results show that the proposed DVI can significantly reduce the training effort. After a short updating, its performance can be close to that of the supervised DVI requiring a lengthy training procedure. This work is vital for advancing the application of these DVIs.

Decoding motion direction using the topography of sustained ERPs and alpha oscillations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Decoding; Motion perception; EEG; ERPs; Alpha-band oscillations	VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; PERCEPTUAL DECISION; WORKING-MEMORY; EEG; REPRESENTATION; ARTIFACTS; MULTIPLE; TRACKING; MEG	The present study sought to determine whether scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) signals contain decodable information about the direction of motion in random dot kinematograms (RDKs), in which the motion information is spatially distributed and mixed with random noise. Any direction of motion from 0 to 360 degrees was possible, and observers reported the precise direction of motion at the end of a 1500-ms stimulus display. We decoded the direction of motion separately during the motion period (during which motion information was being accumulated) and the report period (during which a shift of attention was necessary to make a fine-tuned direction report). Machine learning was used to decode the precise direction of motion (within +/- 11.25 degrees) from the scalp distribution of either alpha-band EEG activity or sustained event-related potentials (ERPs). We found that ERP-based decoding was above chance (1/16) during both the stimulus and the report periods, whereas alpha-based decoding was above chance only during the report period. Thus, sustained ERPs contain information about spatially distributed direction-of-motion, providing a new method for observing the accumulation of sensory information with high temporal resolution. By contrast, the scalp topography of alpha-band EEG activity appeared to mainly reflect spatially focused attentional processes rather than sensory information.

In the present study, we investigated the sensory processing underlying vection by measuring the human event-related brain potentials (ERPs) elicited by the movement onset of a visual stimulus. We presented participants a visual stimulus consisting of alternating black-and-white vertical bars that moved in horizontal direction, creating the sensation of vection. The stimulus was presented on a screen that was divided into a central and a surrounding peripheral visual area. Both areas moved independently from each other, resulting in four different movement patterns: the peripheral and the central stimulus moved in the same or opposite direction, or one of the two visual areas of the stimulus moved while the other remained stable. In addition, two different stimulus types varying with respect to the bars' width (narrow vs. wide) were used. Participants were presented with these stimuli in two phases of the experiment: During EEG-recording, only short phases (2.5-3.5 ms) of visual motion were applied. In a separate rating phase, visual motion was presented for 45 s. In this phase, vection onset, intensity, and duration were verbally recorded. Overall, the visual stimulation generated vection with different intensities (Le., weakest vection with sole central stimulus movement). Stimulus type did not affect vection. In the ERPs, stimulus onset elicited parieto-occipital P2 and N2 components. The amplitudes of the ERP components differed significantly between the four movement patterns (irrespective of stimulus type), however, they did not fully align with the subjective vection ratings. Since the ERPs are associated with early sensory processing preceding vection, we argue that the ERPs mirror the contribution of sensory cortical processes to vection rather than the subjective sensation of vection per se.

As a negatively valenced yet approach motivation -related emotion, anger can be used to tease apart motivational direction versus affective valence contributions to the RewP amplitude. The present study examined the relation between trait anger and RewP. Participants were 98 young adult student volunteers who completed the Doors reward task and self-report questionnaires. Their asymmetric frontal cortical activity during resting baseline was also examined. Results revealed that trait anger was positively correlated with the RewP amplitude. The present study contributes to the literature by providing novel evidence for the link between trait anger and the RewP.

In this study, we used electroencephalography and behavioural measures (recognition test) to examine whether or not children with ASD can correctly identify biological motion. Method Twenty participants with ASD (mean = 11.3, SD = 2.1 years) and 20 typically developed (TD) participants (mean = 11.4, SD = 2.8 years) participated in the study. They watched videos and point light displays of actions, and their EEG was recorded. Then they answered action recognition test, and their accuracy and response times were recorded. Results Our findings showed that children with ASD had the same mu suppression as a TD age-matched control group in both point light display and video presentations. Furthermore, the results showed that while TD and ASD groups did not differ in accuracy, ASD participants had a slower reaction time. Conclusion Taken together, our results indicate that the perception of non-emotional BMs is preserved in children with ASD.	[Sotoodeh, M.

Characteristics of Waveform Shape in Parkinson's Disease Detected with Scalp Electroencephalography	ENEURO			English	Article						beta; EEG; electrophysiology; motor cortex; Parkinson's disease; waveform shape	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; ERP GENERATOR PATTERNS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; BETA-OSCILLATIONS; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; GENERIC METHOD; POWER; IMPROVEMENT; INCREASES	Neural activity in the beta frequency range (13-30 Hz) is excessively synchronized in Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous work using invasive intracranial recordings and non-invasive scalp electroencephalography (EEG) has shown that correlations between beta phase and broad-band gamma (>50 Hz) amplitude [i.e., phase amplitude coupling (PAC)] are elevated in PD, perhaps a reflection of this synchrony. Recently, it has also been shown, in invasive human recordings, that non-sinusoidal features of beta oscillation shape also characterize PD. Here, we show that these features of beta waveform shape also distinguish PD patients on and off medication using non-invasive recordings in a dataset of 15 PD patients with resting scalp EEG. Specifically, beta oscillations over sensorimotor electrodes in PD patients off medication had greater sharpness asymmetry and steepness asymmetry than on medication (sign rank, p < 0.02, corrected). We also showed that beta oscillations over sensorimotor cortex most often had a canonical shape, and that using this prototypical shape as an inclusion criteria increased the effect size of our findings. Together, our findings suggest that novel ways of measuring beta synchrony that incorporate waveform shape could improve detection of PD pathophysiology in non-invasive recordings. Moreover, they motivate the consideration of waveform shape in future EEG studies.

In this study, we aimed to identify the electrophysiological components associated with goal-directed versus habitual performance using an outcome devaluation procedure. Datasets from 35 healthy participants were analyzed. Behaviorally, in line with previous research, participants displayed sensitivity to outcome devaluation, a hallmark of goal-directed control. Electrophysiologically, decreased N2 and increased error-related negativity (ERN) amplitudes were associated with slips of action in conditions that could potentially engage both the goal-directed and habitual systems. These amplitude differences were more pronounced in participants that displayed more sensitivity to devaluation. Furthermore, we show how specific neurophysiological learning signals, namely ERN and feedback-locked P3, could predict subsequent sensitivity to devaluation. Our findings indicate that the N2 and ERN components can be used as indices of goal-directed versus habitual control, and emphasize the importance of the ERN as an electrophysiological trait in the context of goal-directed behavior.

In particular, a considerable number of publications have described spectral alterations in several pathologies using this time-frequency approach. However, ERD is not capable of specifically showing nonphase (induced) activity related to the presentation of stimuli. Recent studies have described an evoked and induced activity in the early phases (first 200 ms) of stimulus processing. However, scarce studies have analyzed induced and evoked modulations in longer latencies (>200 ms) and their potential roles in cognitive processing. The main goal of the present study was to analyze diverse evoked and induced modulations in response to visual stimuli. Thus, 58-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded in 21 healthy subjects during the performance of a visual attention task, and analyses were performed for both target and standard stimuli. The initial result showed that phase-locked and nonphase locked activities coexist in the early processing of target and standard stimuli as has been reported by previous studies. However, more modulations were evident in longer latencies in both evoked and induced activities. Correlation analyses suggest that similar maps were present for evoked and induced activities at different timepoints. In the discussion section, diverse proposals will be stated to define the potential roles of these modulations in the information processing for this cognitive task. As a general conclusion, induced activity enables the observation of cognitive mechanisms that are not visible by ERD or ERP modulations.

In this study, we used electroencephalograms (EEG) and near infrared stereoscopy (NIRS) to test and compare a system called "brain computer interface" for the purpose of selecting menus. The feature of the EEG-based system is that wavelet analysis is used to detect the event-related potential P300, and then, to determine the selected menu. Additionally, an appropriate stimulus-to-stimulus interval time of the menu was derived to be approximately 0.50-0.75 s. Regarding the NIRS-based system, real-time feedback was effective in increasing oxygenated hemoglobin (Oxy-Hb) signal, which resulted in a higher success ratio. The average success ratio of EEG-based system was higher than that of NIRS-based system. In general, using the proposed system, the time required to select a menu is shortened, and the feeling of restraint is reduced.

This paper proposes to define an "EEG-Copeia" as an organized list of scientifically validated EEG markers, characterized by a specific association with an identified cognitive process, that define a psychophysiological unit of analysis useful for mental or brain disorder evaluation and treatment. A characteristic of EEG neurofeedback for mental and brain disorders is that it targets a EEG markers related to a supposed cognitive process, whereas conventional treatments target clinical manifestations. This could explain why EEG neurofeedback studies encounter difficulty in achieving reproducibility and validation. The present paper suggests that a first step to optimize EEG neurofeedback protocols and future research is to target a valid EEG marker. The specificity of the cognitive skills trained and learned during real time feedback of the EEG marker could be enhanced and both the reliability of neurofeedback training and the therapeutic impact optimized. However, several of the most well-known EEG markers have seldom been applied for neurofeedback. Moreover, we lack a reliable and valid EEG targets library for further RCT to evaluate the efficacy of neurofeedback in mental and brain disorders. With the present manuscript, our aim is to foster dialogues between cognitive neuroscience and EEG neurofeedback according to a psychophysiological perspective. The primary objective of this review was to identify the most robust EEG target. EEG markers linked with one or several clearly identified cognitive-related processes will be identified. The secondary objective was to organize these EEG markers and related cognitive process in a psychophysiological unit of analysis matrix inspired by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project.

Single-trial detection in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of brain evoked responses, like event-related potentials (ERPs), requires multiple processing stages, in the spatial and temporal domains, to extract high level features. Convolutional neural networks, as a type of deep learning method, have been used for EEG signal detection as the underlying structure of the EEG signal can be included in such system, facilitating the learning step. The EEG signal is typically decomposed into 2 main dimensions: space and time. However, the spatial dimension can be decomposed into 2 dimensions that better represent the relationships between the sensors that are involved in the classification. We propose to analyze the performance of 2D and 3D convolutional neural networks for the classification of ERPs with a dataset based on 64 EEG channels. We propose and compare 6 conv net architectures: 4 using 3D convolutions, that vary in relation to the number of layers and feature maps, and 2 using 2D convolutions. The results support the conclusion that 3D convolutions provide better performance than 2D convolutions for the binary classification of ERPs.

J	Lee, MH; Williamson, J; Kee, YJ; Fazli, S; Lee, SW				Lee, Min-Ho; Williamson, John; Kee, Young-Jin; Fazli, Siamac; Lee, Seong-Whan			Robust detection of event-related potentials in a user-voluntary short-term imagery task	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; ERP COMPONENTS; P300 DEVELOPMENT; SPELLING SYSTEM; HABITUATION	Event-related potentials (ERPs) represent neuronal activity in the brain elicited by external visual or auditory stimulation and are widely used in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. The ERP responses are elicited a few milliseconds after attending to an oddball stimulus; target and non-target stimuli are repeatedly flashed, and the ERP trials are averaged over time in order to improve their decoding accuracy. To reduce this time-consuming process, previous studies have attempted to evoke stronger ERP responses by changing certain experimental parameters like color, size, or the use of a face image as a target symbol. Since these exogenous potentials can be naturally evoked by merely looking at a target symbol, the BCI system could generate unintended commands while subjects are gazing at one of the symbols in a non-intentional mental state. We approached this problem of unintended command generation by assuming that a greater effort by the user in a short-term imagery task would evoke a discriminative ERP response. Three tasks were defined: passive attention, counting, and pitch-imagery. Users were instructed to passively attend to a target symbol, or to perform a mental tally of the number of target presentations, or to perform the novel task of imagining a high-pitch tone when the target symbol was highlighted. The decoding accuracy were 71.4%, 83.5%, and 89.2% for passive attention, counting, and pitch-imagery, respectively, after the fourth averaging procedure. We found stronger deflections in the N500 component corresponding to the levels of mental effort (passive attention: -1.094 +/- 0.88 mu V, counting: -2.226 +/- 0.97 mu V, and pitch -imagery: -2.883 +/- 0.74 mu V), which highly influenced the decoding accuracy. In addition, the rate of binary classification between passive attention and pitch-imagery tasks was 73.5%, which is an adequate classification rate that motivated us to propose a two-stage classification strategy wherein the target symbols are estimated in the first stage and the passive or active mental state is decoded in the second stage. In this study, we found that the ERP response and the decoding accuracy are highly influenced by the user's voluntary mental tasks. This could lead to a useful approach in practical ERP systems in two respects. Firstly, the user-voluntary tasks can be easily utilized in many different types of BCI systems, and performance enhancement is less dependent on the manipulation of the system's external, visual stimulus parameters. Secondly, we propose an ERP system that classifies the brain state as intended or unintended by considering the measurable differences between passively gazing and actively performing the pitch-imagery tasks in the EEG signal thus minimizing unintended commands to the BCI system.

Autistic and alexithymic traits modulate distinct aspects of face perception	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Autism; Alexithymia; EEG; Face perception; N170	FACIAL AFFECT RECOGNITION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SPECTRUM QUOTIENT AQ; EMOTION RECOGNITION; BRAIN RESPONSES; GENERAL-POPULATION; YOUNG-CHILDREN; EXPRESSIONS; VALIDITY; N170	Background: Atypical face processing is a prominent feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but is not universal and is subject to individual variability. This heterogeneity could be accounted for by reliable yet unidentified subgroups within the diverse population of individuals with ASD. Alexithymia, which is characterized by difficulties in emotion recognition and identification, serves as a potential grouping factor. Recent research demonstrates that emotion recognition impairments in ASD are predicted by its comorbidity with alexithymia. The current study assessed the relative influence of autistic versus alexithymic traits on neural indices of face and emotion perception. Methods: Capitalizing upon the temporal sensitivity of event-related potentials (ERPs), it investigates the distinct contributions of alexithymic versus autistic traits at specific stages of emotional face processing in 27 typically developing adults (18 female). ERP components reflecting sequential stages of perceptual processing (P100, N170 and N250) were recorded in response to fear and neutral faces. Results: The results indicated that autistic traits were associated with structural encoding of faces (N170), whereas alexithymic traits were associated with more complex emotion decoding (N250). Conclusions: These findings have important implications for deconstructing heterogeneity within ASD.

Especially, the P300, which is evoked as an event-related potential (ERP), when humans perceive task-relevant infrequent events among task-irrelevant frequent events, is widely used in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). P300 detection has been used as an indicator that a human perceives task-relevant events or detects the occurrence of task-relevant or important events. In this paper, we focus on not only perceived task-relevant events but also not-perceived task-relevant events (i.e., missed events). In fact, a human can miss task-relevant events for different reasons, e.g., reduced attention level or increased workload level during parallel task-processing situations among others. Moreover, a human can also intentionally ignore task-relevant events to manage several simultaneous tasks. However, such missed events do not often occur in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a transfer approach to handle insufficient number of events for training a classifier. For example, task-irrelevant infrequent events are used for training of classifier to detect missed task-relevant events. We evaluated our approach in different settings of training and testing a classifier with and without classifier transfer.

Although inhibition control defects in young smokers were investigated, the effects of short-term abstinence on inhibition control in young smokers were still unclear. Thirty young smokers participated in the present study. The EEG signals during the Go/NoGo task were recorded in both satiety and 12 h abstinence conditions. The task performances were observed and compared between the two conditions. Event-related potential (ERP) analysis was used to investigate changes in N200 and P300 amplitude and latency induced by 12 h of abstinence. After 12 h of abstinence, the latency of N200 was prolonged in young smokers. No significant changes were found in the number of NoGo errors and the response time of Go in young smokers after 12 h of abstinence. Correlation analysis showed that the N200 latency of abstinence condition was significantly correlated with the number of NoGo errors and the response time of Go in the abstinence condition. The present findings may improve the understanding of the effect of short-term abstinence in young smokers. We suggested that the latency of N200 may be associated with inefficient inhibitory control of the abstinence condition in young smokers. Our results may contribute new insights into the neural mechanism of nicotine abstinence in young smokers.

NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Emotional consciousness; Electroencephalography; Disorders of consciousness; Network connectivity	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN NETWORKS; CROSS	Increasing evidence from studies of brain responses to subject's own name (SON) indicates that residual consciousness is preserved in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) and that specific network activation might provide evidence of consciousness. However, it remains unclear whether SON is suitable for detection of emotional consciousness; moreover, the particular aspects of brain network organization that are critical for consciousness are unknown. The present study used an innovative approach to explore affective consciousness in patients with DOC during emotional stimuli. EEG data were acquired from 15 patients and 15 healthy volunteers. We analyzed brain potentials and functional network connectivity with a passive emotional paradigm based on graph theoretical methods. Larger N1 or P3a was detected in patients upon exposure to emotional sound, relative to neutral stimuli. Brain topology revealed that emotional sound evoked significantly stronger network linkages in healthy controls; additionally, it evoked several connectivity changes in patients with DOC. In conclusion, emotional consciousness might be partially preserved in patients with DOC; moreover, EEG network patterns could provide new insights into the neural activity of emotional perception in these patients.

Physical aggression and attentional bias to angry faces: An event related potential study	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Physical aggression; Attentional bias; Angry faces; Event-related potential; P3	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; COGNITIVE BIAS; TRAIT ANGER; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; REAL-WORLD; ANXIETY; INFORMATION; THREAT; INDIVIDUALS	This study aimed to identify the neural correlates of aggression-related attentional selectivity to angry faces in physical aggression. Physical aggression in a non-clinical sample of young men (N = 36) was measured using an aggression questionnaire. Visual attentional bias to angry faces was assessed using a dot-probe task during which angry and neutral faces were presented simultaneously, and EEG was recorded. Median split and correlational analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between physical aggression and attentional bias. Behavioural results indicated that higher levels of physical aggression were associated with greater attentional bias to angry faces. ERP results revealed an interaction where males with higher physical aggression had undifferentiated P3 amplitudes to angry and neutral trials, whereas low physical aggression males exhibited greater P3 amplitude to angry than to neutral trials (effect of probe congruency). Increased levels of physical aggression were also significantly correlated with increased P3 amplitude to probes replacing neutral faces, relative to angry faces. It was concluded that the aggressive males selectively attend to angry faces, and that attentional bias is characterized by undifferentiated P3 amplitude. We propose that this results from an inferior ability to downregulate competing angry face distractors when responding to probes replacing neutral faces (as reflected by the P3 response). These findings indicate that attentional bias to angry faces in individuals with higher physical aggression is characterized by a distinctive ERP signature; this could inform the development of therapeutic interventions seeking to reduce aggression.

PharmaCog Consortium	Two-Year Longitudinal Monitoring of Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment Patients with Prodromal Alzheimer's Disease Using Topographical Biomarkers Derived from Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Electroencephalographic Activity	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE			English	Article						Alpha rhythms; amnesic mild cognitive impairment; biomarkers; clinical trial; electroencephalography; functional magnetic resonance imaging; oddball event-related potentials; PharmaCog project; prodromal Alzheimer's disease; resting state	DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CORTICAL MIDLINE STRUCTURES; EEG SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; RESTING-STATE FMRI; QUANTITATIVE EEG; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; PARIETAL CORTEX; ALPHA RHYTHMS	Auditory "oddball" event-related potentials (aoERPs), resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) connectivity, and electroencephalographic (rsEEG) rhythms were tested as longitudinal functional biomarkers of prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD). Data were collected at baseline and four follow-ups at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months in amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients classified in two groups: "positive" (i.e., "prodromal AD"; n = 81) or "negative" (n = 63) based on a diagnostic marker of AD derived from cerebrospinal samples (A beta(42)/P-tau ratio). A linear mixed model design was used to test functional biomarkers for Group, Time, and Group x Time effects adjusted by nuisance covariates (only data until conversion to dementia was used). Functional biomarkers that showed significant Group effects ("positive" versus "negative", p < 0.05) regardless of Time were 1) reduced rsfMRI connectivity in both the default mode network (DMN) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), both also giving significant Time effects (connectivity decay regardless of Group); 2) increased rsEEG source activity at delta (<4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) rhythms and decreased source activity at low-frequency alpha (8-10.5 Hz) rhythms; and 3) reduced parietal and posterior cingulate source activities of aoERPs. Time x Group effects showed differential functional biomarker progression between groups: 1) increased rsfMRI connectivity in the left parietal cortex of the DMN nodes, consistent with compensatory effects and 2) increased limbic source activity at theta rhythms. These findings represent the first longitudinal characterization of functional biomarkers of prodromal AD relative to "negative" aMCI patients based on 5 serial recording sessions over 2 years.

A simultaneous EEG-fMRI study to localize the generators of endogenous ERPs in an omitted target paradigm	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PARIETAL CORTEX; P300 POTENTIALS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; VISUAL TARGET; ODDBALL; CONSCIOUSNESS; PREDICTION; ATTENTION	Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) occurring independently from any stimulus are purely endogenous (emitted potentials) and their neural generators can be unequivocally linked with cognitive processes. In the present study, the subjects performed two similar visual counting tasks: a standard two-stimulus oddball, and an omitted-target oddball task, characterized by the physical absence of the target stimulus. Our investigation aimed at localizing the neural sources of the scalp-recorded endogenous/emitted ERPs. To optimize the source localization, the high temporal resolution of electrophysiology was combined with the fine spatial information provided by the simultaneous recording of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI). Both tasks identified two endogenous ERP components in the 300 to 520 ms interval. An earlier component, pP2, showed a bilateral generator in the anterior Insula. A later P3 component (P3b) was generated bilaterally in the temporal-parietal junction, the premotor and motor area and the anterior intraparietal sulcus (this latter one only in the standard oddball). Anticipatory slow waves (beginning 900 to 500 ms pre-stimulus), also of endogenous nature, were produced by the inferior and middle frontal gyrus and the supplementary and cingulate motor areas. Our protocol disentangled pre- from post-stimulus fMRI activations and provided original clues to the psychophysiological interpretation of emitted/endogenous ERPs.

J	Jafadideh, AT; Asl, BM				Jafadideh, Alireza Talesh; Asl, Babak Mohammadzadeh			Modified Dominant Mode Rejection Beamformer for Localizing Brain Activities When Data Covariance Matrix Is Rank Deficient	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain source localization; electroencephalography (EEG); magnetoencephalography (MEG); evoked potentials; minimum variance beamformer (MVB); modified dominant mode rejection	EEG SOURCE LOCALIZATION; MEG; NOISE	Objective: Minimum variance beamformer (MVB) and its extensions fail in localizing short time brain activities particularly evoked potentials because of rank deficiency or inaccurate estimation of a data covariance matrix. In this paper, the conventional dominantmode rejection (DMR) adaptive beamformer is modified to localize brain short time activities. Methods: In the modified DMR, it is attempted to obtain a well-conditioned covariance matrix by dividing the eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix into dominant, medium, and small eigenvalues and then modifying medium and small parts. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with diagonal loading MVB (DL_MVB) and fast fully adaptive (FFA) beamformer by using simulated event-related potentials and real event-related field data. Eigenspace versions of DL_ MVB and modified DMR are also implemented. Results: In all simulations, the modified DMR obtains the least localization error (0-5 mm) and spread radius (0-8 mm) when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) varies from 0 to 10 dB with step 1 dB. In real data, the new approach in comparison to two other ones attains the most concentrated power spectrum. Eigenspace projection of DL_MVB presents better results than DL_MVB but worse results than the modified DMR. Applying eigenspace projection on the proposed method improves its performance at high SNR levels. Conclusion: Empirical results illustrate the superiority of the proposed DMR method to the DL_MVB and FFA in localizing brain short time activities. Significance: The proposed method can be utilized in source localization of epilepsy for presurgical clinical evaluation purpose and also in applications dealing with the localization of evoked potentials and fields.

During the emotional directed forgetting (DF) paradigm participants have to apply volitional mechanisms to resist automatic emotional enhancement of the memory. Here we sought to compare mechanisms underlying emotional DF in SCZ and in healthy persons (HC). Eighteen SCZ and eighteen HC completed a DF paradigm with neutral and negative pictures. EEG was recorded during study and test phase of the task. We analyzed both the behavioral outcomes and event-related potential components, indicating emotional enhancement of memory (Late Positive Potential elicited by pictures) and DF strategies (N2/P3 elicited by forget/remember cues during study-phase; "old/new" and "reversed old/new" effects during test-phase of the task). Directed forgetting effects and emotional enhancement of memory were observed in both groups, even despite overall lower recognition rates in SCZ. Furthermore, cue presentation elicited similar pattern of N2/P3s in SCZ and in HC. However, "reversed old/new" effect was observed only in HC for negative stimuli. Patients may show similar reaction to affective stimuli as healthy controls during the emotional DF task. However, further investigation is needed to elicit the specific mechanisms underlying the DF strategies in SCZ.

Classical conditioning (as a typical case of associative learning) and electroencephalography together provide a good framework for expanding our knowledge about fast learning-related cortical changes. In our experiment, we employed a novel paradigm in which classical conditioning was combined with passive oddball. Nineteen subjects participated in the first experiment (aversive conditioning with painful shock as unconditioned stimulus (US) and neutral tones as conditioned stimulus (CS)), and 22 subjects in the second experiment (with a subject's own name as US). We used event-related potentials (ERPs) and time-frequency analyses to explore the CS-US interaction. We found a learning-induced increment of P3a in the first experiment and the late positive potential (LPP) in both experiments. These effects may be related to increased attentional and emotional significance of conditioned stimuli. We showed that the LPP and P3a effects, earlier found only in visual paradigms, generalize to the auditory sensory system. We also observed suppression of the low beta activity to CS+ in aversive conditioning over the hemisphere contralateral to expected electrical shocks, presumably indicating preparation of the somatosensory system to the expected nociceptive US.

New short-term interventions can be used as an effective adjunct or alternative to pharmaco- and psychotherapy. One of these approaches is therapeutic tapping. It combines somatic stimulation of acupressure points with elements from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Tapping reduces anxiety symptoms after only one session. Anxiety is associated with a deficient emotion regulation for threatening stimuli. These deficits are compensated e.g., by CBT. Whether Tapping can also elicit similar modulations and which dynamic neural correlates are affected was subject to this study. Anxiety patients were assessed listening to pseudowords with a different emotional prosody (happy, angry, fearful, and neutral) prior and after one Tapping session. The emotion-related component Late Positive Potential (LPP) was investigated via electroencephalography. Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) served as control intervention. Results showed LPP reductions for negative stimuli after the interventions. Interestingly, PMR influenced fearful and Tapping altered angry prosody. While PMR generally reduced arousal for fearful prosody, Tapping specifically affected fear-eliciting, angry stimuli, and might thus be able to reduce anxiety symptoms. Findings highlight the efficacy of Tapping and its impact on neural correlates of emotion regulation.

The majority of the previous work in BCI use spatial, temporal, or spatiotemporal features of event-related potentials (ERPs). In this study, we examined the discriminatory effect of their spatiospectral features to capture the most relevant set of neural activities from electroencephalographic recordings that represent users' mental intent. In this regard, we model ERP waveforms using a sum of sinusoids with unknown amplitudes, frequencies, and phases. The effect of this signal modeling step is to represent high-dimensional ERP waveforms in a substantially lower dimensionality space, which includes their dominant power spectral contents. We found that the most discriminative frequencies for accurate decoding of visual attention modulated ERPs lie in a spectral range less than 6.4 Hz. This was empirically verified by treating dominant frequency contents of ERP waveforms as feature vectors in the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques used herein. The constructed predictive models achieved remarkable performance, which for some subjects was as high as 94% as measured by the area under curve. Using these spectral contents, we further studied the discriminatory effect of each channel and proposed an efficient strategy to choose subject-specific subsets of channels that generally led to classifiers with comparable performance.

While their neural signatures have been explored in native speakers, no study has targeted foreign-language users, let alone comparing early and late bilinguals. Here, we administered a validated FS paradigm to subjects from both populations and evaluated time-frequency modulations evoked by FS and control sentences. Early bilinguals exhibited greater sensitivity towards FSs, indexed by reduced fronto-posterior theta-band oscillations across semantic- and structural-integration windows. Such oscillatory modulations may represent a key marker of age-of-acquisition effects during foreign language wordplay processing.

This approach, termed Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI), has the potential to elucidate the neural correlates of perceptual and cognitive processes during real-life activities, such as locomotion. However, as of yet, no one has assessed the long-term stability of event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded under these conditions. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to evaluate the test-retest reliability of cognitive ERPs recorded while walking. High-density EEG was acquired from 12 young adults on two occasions, separated by an average of 2.3 years, as they performed a Go/No-Go response inhibition paradigm. During each testing session, participants performed the task while walking on a treadmill and seated. Using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) as a measure of agreement, we focused on two well-established neurophysiological correlates of cognitive control, the N2 and P3 ERPs. Following ICA-based artifact rejection, the earlier N2 yielded good to excellent levels of reliability for both amplitude and latency, while measurements for the later P3 component were generally less robust but still indicative of adequate to good levels of stability. Interestingly, the N2 was more consistent between walking sessions, compared to sitting, for both hits and correct rejection trials. In contrast, the P3 waveform tended to have a higher degree of consistency during sitting conditions. Overall, these results suggest that the electro-cortical signals obtained during active walking are representative of stable indices of neurophysiological function. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Here we applied fast periodic visual stimulation coupled with electroencephalography (EEG) to objectively measure the neural coding of facial attractiveness. We presented different pictures of faces at 6 Hz, i.e. six faces/second, for a minute while participants attended to a central fixation cross and indicated whether the cross shortly changed color. Every other face in the stimulation was attractive and was replaced by a relatively less attractive face. This resulted in alternating more/less attractive faces at a 3 Hz rate, eliciting a significant increase in occipito-temporal EEG amplitude at 3 Hz both at the group and the individual participant level. This response was absent in two control conditions where either only attractive or only less attractive faces were presented. These observations support the view that face-sensitive visual areas discriminate attractiveness implicitly and rapidly from the human face.

However, few studies have focused on the evaluation process. In this study, event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related spectrum perturbation (ERSP) techniques were used to explore the neural dynamics underlying the evaluation process of ambiguous options through an ambiguous choice task. Some important results emerged. We found a preference for lotteries with low ambiguity regardless of reward amount, suggesting that subjects were averse to ambiguity in our paradigm. Our electroencephalography (EEG) results clarified the neural dynamics underlying the evaluation process. In the time domain, lotteries with both a larger reward and lower ambiguity elicited a larger P3. In the time-frequency domain, larger amplitudes of delta activity at 200-400 ms and 500-600 ms post-stimulus were elicited by lotteries with low ambiguity. Moreover, lotteries with a larger reward elicited larger amplitudes of delta activity at 400-600 ms post-stimulus. Our ERPs and ERSP results suggested that individuals in our paradigm evaluated ambiguity and reward separately, and then integrated their evaluation to form subjective values of different lotteries.

Our aim was to explore the contribution of the frontal eye field (FEF) in early orienting of attention towards stimuli with social value. We used a TMS-EEG approach to investigate event related potentials (ERPs; no-TMS block) and TMS evoked potentials (TEPs; TMS block) during the cueing phase of a modified version of the dot-probe task, comparing competing (face vs. house) and not competing (house vs. house) conditions. Our results revealed an increased amplitude of ERP components in the competing condition, showing greater posterior N170 and fronto-central vertex positive potential (VPP) and an enhanced frontal negative component at 250-270 ms from cue onset. TMS pulses over the FEF induced similar N170 and VPP amplified components. In addition, in the ERPs, a reduced positivity at 400 ms was shown when the face appeared on the left side vs. the right side of space. In contrast, in the TMS blocks, we found lateralized effects on N170 depending on the side of face presentation. The enhanced cortical excitability induced by TMS over the right FEF significantly correlated with the performance on the behavioral task, suggesting a link between the FEF activity during the cueing phase of the dot-probe task and the subsequent behavioral response times to the targets.

The glass is half empty: Negative self-appraisal bias and attenuated neural response to positive self-judgment in adolescence	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Self-referential processing; adolescence; depression; negative appraisal; event-related potential	GENDER-DIFFERENCES; MIDDLE CHILDHOOD; DEPRESSION; STABILITY; BRAIN; ASSOCIATIONS; INFORMATION; EMOTION; MEMORY; EEG	Substantial changes in cognitive-affective self-referential processing occur during adolescence. We studied the behavioral and ERP correlates of self-evaluation in healthy male and female adolescents aged 12-17 (N = 109). Participants completed assessments of depression symptoms and puberty as well as a self-referential encoding task while 128-channel high-density EEG data were collected. Depression symptom severity was associated with increased endorsement of negative words and longer reaction times. In an extreme group analysis, a negative appraisal-bias subsample (n = 28) displayed decreased frontal P2 amplitudes to both positive and negative word stimuli, reflecting reduced early attentional processing and emotional salience. Compared to the positive appraisal-bias subsample (n = 27), the negative appraisal-bias subsample showed reduced LPP to positive words but not negative words, suggesting attenuated sustained processing of positive self-relevant stimuli. Findings are discussed in terms of neural processes associated with ERPs during negative versus positive self-appraisal bias, and developmental implications.

Reward Processing in Certain Versus Uncertain Contexts in Schizophrenia: An Event-Related Potential (ERP) Study	JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						certainty effects; event-related potentials (ERPs); reward processing; schizophrenia; valence effects	COGNITIVE CONTROL ADJUSTMENTS; DECISION-MAKING; FEEDBACK NEGATIVITY; CONFLICT ADAPTATION; ANXIETY DISORDERS; PREDICTION ERROR; NEURAL RESPONSE; RISK-TAKING; PERFORMANCE; ANTICIPATION	Disturbances in motivation are prominent in the clinical presentation of people with schizophrenia and might reflect a disturbance in reward processing. Recent advances in affective neuroscience have subdivided reward processing into distinct components. but there are two limitations of the prior work in schizophrenia. First. studies typically focus on only one component rather than on the unfolding of reward processing across multiple stages. Second, studies have not considered the impact of certainty effects, which represent an important contextual factor that impacts processing. We examined whether individuals with schizophrenia show the typical certainty effects across three phases of reward processing: cue evaluation, feedback anticipation, and feedback receipt. Electroencephalography from 74 healthy controls and 92 people with schizophrenia was recorded during a cued gambling task under conditions in which cues indicated forthcoming reward outcomes that were certain or uncertain. Controls demonstrated the expected certainty effects across each stage. Initial cue evaluation (cue P300) was intact in the schizophrenia group, but people with schizophrenia showed diminished certainty effects during feedback anticipation (stimulus-preceding negativity [SPN]) and receipt (feedback reward positivity [fRewP] and feedback P300). During feedback receipt, event-related potentials in people with schizophrenia were similar to controls for the uncertain context but larger than controls for the certain context. Essentially, people with schizophrenia appeared to process certain feedback as though it were uncertain. These findings show, for the first time, that the fundamental distinction between certain and uncertain contexts is altered in schizophrenia at a neural level.

The topographic representation of different body parts within this brain region is commonly investigated through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, fMRI does not provide direct information about neuronal activity. In this study, we used high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) to map the representations of hand, foot, and lip movements in the primary sensorimotor cortex, and to study their neural signatures. Specifically, we assessed the event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the cortical space. We found that the performance of hand, foot, and lip movements elicited an ERD in beta and gamma frequency bands. The primary regions showing significant beta- and gamma-band ERD for hand and foot movements, respectively, were consistent with previously reported using fMRI. We observed relatively weaker ERD for lip movements, which may be explained by the fact that less fine movement control was required. Overall, our study demonstrated that ERD based on hdEEG data can support the study of motor-related neural processes, with relatively high spatial resolution. An interesting avenue may be the use of hdEEG for deeper investigations into the pathophysiology of neuromotor disorders.

This study aimed to provide insight into this issue by capitalizaing on the high temporal resolution of electroencephalography and information provided by source localization methods. To this end, twenty unmedicated patients with BPD and 20 healthy control subjects performed a modified go/no-go task designed to better isolate the brain activity specifically associated with response inhibition. Event-related potentials (ERP) were measured and further analyzed at the scalp and source levels. Patients with BPD made more commission errors (failed inhibitions) than control subjects. Scalp ERP data showed that both groups displayed greater frontocentral P3 amplitude for no-go (response inhbition) than for go trials (response execution). However, source reconstruction data revealed that patients with BPD activated posterior parietal regions (precuneus) to inhibit their responses, whereas controls activated prefrontal regions (presupplementary motor area, preSMA). This dissociation was supported by a significant Region (precuneus, preSMA) x Trial Type (no-go, go) x Group (BPD, control) interaction. These findings extend our understanding of the neurophysiological basis of abnormal response inhibition in BPD, suggesting that patients with BPD recruit different brain regions for inhibiting prepotent responses compared to controls. Future research in larger, medication-naive samples of patients with BPD is required to confirm and extend these findings.

Impact of Mindfulness Martial Arts Training on Neural and Behavioral Indices of Attention in Youth with Learning Disabilities and Co-occurring Mental Health Challenges	MINDFULNESS			English	Article						Mindfulness; Youth; Learning disability; Attention; Electroencephalography	ACTIVITY ESTIMATION SCALE; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ACUTE EXERCISE; DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; P300 LATENCY; CHILDREN; HYPERACTIVITY; ADOLESCENTS; RELIABILITY	Objectives Deficits in attentional control are often associated with academic and mental health challenges experienced by youth with learning disabilities (LDs). Mindfulness treatments may improve attentional control; however, findings in youth populations to date have been mixed. Neural measures of attentional control may be more sensitive to treatment effects, but have been rarely employed. We addressed this limitation by examining the impact of a 20-week mindfulness martial arts training program for youth aged 11-17 years with LD and mental health challenge on electroencephalography (EEG), parent-report, and behavioral indices of attention. Methods At pre- and post-treatment, a sample of 48 youth receiving treatment and 38 waitlisted controls completed two attention tasks while EEG was recorded. Task performance and P3 amplitude and latency from EEG data were calculated. Parent-reported attention was also measured. Results Findings varied depending on the type of measure. Controlling for pre-treatment levels of attention, significant post-treatment group differences were indicated on parent-reported attention and P3 amplitude for one attention task, with significant gains noted for the treatment but not the control group. Significant gains identified were maintained at 3-month follow-up for the treatment group. No significant post-treatment group differences were found for P3 latency or task performance measures. Conclusions Mindfulness-based martial arts training appears to significantly impact some, but not all, indices of attentional control. Further research using a randomized control trial design with an exercise-only control is warranted. Recommendations for future research design are discussed.

Neutral face and complex object neurophysiological processing deficits in long-term schizophrenia and in first hospitalized schizophrenia-spectrum individuals	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Schizophrenia; First hospitalization; Chronic; Face analysis; EEG; Event-related potential; N170	GYRUS GRAY-MATTER; FACIAL AFFECT RECOGNITION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; 1ST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; FUSIFORM GYRUS; PARAHIPPOCAMPAL GYRUS; EMOTION RECOGNITION; VOLUME REDUCTION; PERCEPTION; N170	Background: Face processing is impaired in long-term schizophrenia as indexed by a reduced face-related N170 event-related potential (ERP) that corresponds with volumetric decreases in right fusiform gyrus. Impairment in face processing may constitute an object-specific deficit in schizophrenia that relates to social impairment and misattribution of social signs in the disease, or the face deficit may be part of a more general deficit in complex visual processing. Further, it is not clear the degree to which face and complex object processing deficits are present early in disease course. To that end, the current study investigated face- and object-elicited N170 in long-term schizophrenia and the first hospitalized schizophrenia-spectrum. Methods: ERPs were collected from 32 long-term schizophrenia patients and 32 matched controls, and from 31 first hospitalization patients and 31 matched controls. Subjects detected rarely presented butterflies among nontarget neutral faces and automobiles. Results: For both patient groups, the N170s to all stimuli were significantly attenuated. Despite this overall reduction, the increase in N170 amplitude to faces was intact in both patient samples. Symptoms were not correlated with N170 amplitude or latency to faces. Conclusions: Information processing of complex stimuli is fundamentally impaired in schizophrenia, as reflected in attenuated N170 ERPs in both first hospitalized and long-term patients. This suggests the presence of low-level visual complex object processing deficits near disease onset that persist with disease course.

J	Proverbio, AM; Carminati, M				Proverbio, Alice M.; Carminati, Manuel			Electrophysiological markers of poor versus superior math abilities in healthy individuals	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						arithmetic processing; Dyscalculia; event-related potentials; individual differences; number; P300; skills	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; ARITHMETIC FACTS; P300; ACTIVATION; RETRIEVAL; MEMORY; SIZE; ABNORMALITIES; INFORMATION	Interindividual differences in the numerical ability of healthy adults have been previously demonstrated, mainly with tasks involving mental number line or size representation. However, electrophysiological correlates of superior versus poor arithmetic ability (in the healthy population) have been scarcely investigated. We correlated electric potentials with math performance in 13 skilled and 13 poor calculators selected from a sample of 41 graduate students on the basis of their poor or superior math abilities assessed through a timed test. EEG was recorded from 128 channels while participants solved 352 arithmetical operations (additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions) and decided whether the provided solution was correct or incorrect. Overall skilled individuals correctly solved a higher number of operations than poor calculators and had faster response times. Consistently, the latency of fronto-central P300 component of event-related potentials (ERPs) peaked earlier in the skilled than poor group. The P300 was larger in amplitude to correct than incorrect solutions, but just in the skilled group, with a tendency found in poor calculators. Spearman's rho correlation coefficient analyses showed that the larger P300 response was to correct arithmetic solutions, the better the performance; conversely, the larger the P300 amplitude was to incorrect solutions, the worse the performance. The results suggest that poor calculators had a less clear representation of arithmetic solutions and difficulty in quickly accessing it. This study provides a standard method for directly investigating math abilities throughout ERP recordings that could be useful for assessing acalculia/dyscalculia in the clinical population (children, elderly, brain-damaged patients).

Abnormal neural functions associated with motor inhibition deficits in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						bipolar disorder; electroencephalography; event-related potentials; inhibition; risk factors; schizophrenia	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; N2/P3 COMPLEX; RACE MODEL; ERP; SELECTION; IMPULSIVITY; DIMENSIONS; TASK	Deficits in response inhibition have been observed in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; however, the neural origins of the abnormalities and their relevance to genetic liability for psychosis are unknown. We used a stop-signal task to examine motor inhibition and associated neural processes in schizophrenia patients (n = 57), bipolar disorder patients (n = 21), first-degree biological relatives of patients with schizophrenia (n = 34), and healthy controls (n = 56). Schizophrenia patients demonstrated motor control deficits reflected in longer stop-signal reaction times and elongated reaction times. With the possibility of needing to inhibit a button press, both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients showed diminished reductions of the P300 brain response and only the healthy controls demonstrated adjustments in response execution time, as measured by response-locked lateralized readiness potentials. Schizotypal traits in the biological relatives were associated with less P300 modulation consistent with the motor-related anomalies being associated with subtle schizophrenia-spectrum symptomatology in family members. The two patient groups had elongated response selection processes as manifest in the delayed onset of the stimulus-locked lateralized readiness potential. The bipolar disorder group was unique in showing significantly diminished neural responses to the stop-signal to inhibit a response. Antipsychotic medication dosage was related to worse motor inhibition, thus motor inhibition deficits in schizophrenia may be partially explained by the effect of pharmacological agents. Failed modulation of brain processes in relation to response inhibition probability and the lengthening of motor response selection appear to be transdiagnostic abnormalities spanning schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

Role of Familiarity in Recognizing Faces and Words: an EEG Study	SOVREMENNYE TEHNOLOGII V MEDICINE			English	Article						evoked potentials; visual perception; face and word recognition	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FORM AREA; RECOGNITION; MEMORY; ERP; PROSOPAGNOSIA; SELECTIVITY; INVERSION; PATTERNS; SYSTEMS	The ability to recognize faces and words is crucial for social communication. A close relationship between the face recognition and the word recognition has been documented in numerous studies involving EEG, evoked potentials, functional MRI, as well as clinical data in patients with impaired face perception who suffered from some word recognition inability. Therefore, identifying common mechanisms underlying the recognition of verbal and non-verbal stimuli is relevant not only for normal physiology and cognitive neuroscience, but also for the clinical conditions of agnosia of various etiologies. We hypothesized that EEG patterns related to the recognition of words and faces might be influenced by both the stimulus-type factor (word or face) and the factor of familiarity. The aim of the study is to identify the EEG patterns responsible for the perception and recognition of a visual stimulus, regardless of its specificity, i.e. the common patterns for verbal (words) and non-verbal (faces) stimuli. Materials and Methods. The EEG data were obtained from 26 volunteers who were presented with complex visual stimuli, i.e., photos of people with words superimposed on them, where familiar (known) and unfamiliar people and words were combined in equal parts. Firstly, the tested subjects were asked to classify the faces into familiar or unfamiliar (with the attention only to faces); secondly - to classify the words in the same way (the attention only to words). Results. We found a pronounced effect of familiarity on the EEG patterns: the amplitude of the N250 component of evoked potentials detected in the frontal areas was significantly greater in the responses to unfamiliar stimuli (both faces and words) compared to familiar ones. We also found an effect of instruction on the responses: the N400 component amplitude was greater in responses followed the "attention to words" instruction as compared to the "attention to faces" instruction; this effect was also best detectable in the frontal sites. Conclusion. At the early stages of the visual stimuli recognition, the evoked potentials responses are modulated by the familiarity of the stimuli (that is, by their representation in long-term memory), and not by their type (face or word). The categorization of stimuli by their modality (verbal or non-verbal), apparently, occurs at later stages of their processing.	[Podvigina, D.

Acute Exercise Prevents Angry Mood Induction but Does Not Change Angry Emotions	MEDICINE AND SCIENCE IN SPORTS AND EXERCISE			English	Article						ANGER EXPRESSION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; EMOTION; ERP; MOOD	EXCITATION TRANSFER; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; STATE ANXIETY; RESPONSES; ANGER; ACTIVATION; ATTENTION; RECOVERY	Introduction Exercise is well known to enhance a variety of mood states, but few studies have been specifically designed to investigate whether acute aerobic exercise alters feelings of anger. The goal of this study was to determine the magnitude of the effects of acute exercise on both angry mood and angry emotions. Methods Angry mood and angry emotions were assessed in 16 men with elevated trait anger who viewed a variety of emotionally evocative scenic pictures before and after 30 min of moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise. Angry mood, captured by self-reports of state anger, angry emotions, as indexed by event-related brain activity (e.g., early posterior negativity and late positive potential), and self-reports of anger intensity were measured. Results The results indicate that acute exercise both 1) reduces angry mood and 2) mitigates angry mood induction but does not change the intensity of angry emotions or the associated event-related potential responses to anger-inducing pictures in college-age men who have elevated trait anger. Conclusion Future studies should explore the mechanisms underlying the effect of exercise on preventing angry mood induction, consider alternative anger induction methods that might induce higher levels of angry emotions, and test the effects of chronic exercise training on anger and its expression.

In this study, 15 participants were randomly assigned to honesty or deception groups and were instructed to tell the truth or lie when facing certain stimuli. Meanwhile, event-related potential signals were recorded using a 64-channel electroencephalography cap. Event-related coherence was computed separately in four frequency bands (delta (1-3.5Hz), theta (4-7Hz), alpha (8-13Hz), and beta (14-30 HZ)) for the long-range intrahemispheric electrode pairs (F3P3, F4P4, F3T7, F4T8, F3O1, and F4O2). The results indicated that deceptive responses elicited greater connectivities in the frontoparietal and frontotemporal networks than in the frontooccipital network. Furthermore, the deception group displayed lower values of coherence in the frontoparietal electrode pairs in the alpha and beta bands than the honesty group. In particular, increased coherence in the delta and theta bands on specific left frontoparietal electrode pairs was observed. Additionally, the deception group exhibited higher values of coherence in the delta band and lower values of coherence in the beta band on the frontotemporal electrode pairs than did the honesty group. These data indicated that the active cognitive processes during deception include changes in ensemble activities between the frontal and parietal/temporal regions.

Here, we show that the Nc ERP component, known to reflect frequency-related attentional and/or memory processes, is a good candidate to investigate infant recognition memory. Previous paradigms have only investigated the effect of frequency during on-line stimulus presentation, but not during stimulus encoding. In this paper, we present a novel method for measuring the neural correlates of recognition memory and the 'degree' of familiarity in 10- to 12-month-old infants. During a familiarization phase, two images were presented frequently, while another two images were presented infrequently to the infants. In the test phase, the infrequent familiar, the frequent familiar, and the novel stimuli, were all presented with equal probability. We found larger Nc amplitudes following the familiar stimuli compared to the novel ones. The 'degree' of familiarity, on the other hand, did not modulate the Nc amplitude. These results can only be explained with memory-related processes, since in our paradigm the on-line presentation frequency did not vary. Furthermore, the lack of familiarization frequency effect suggests that the Nc might be a neural correlate of declarative memory.

Various studies have performed Guilty Knowledge Test or Concealed Information Test by creating a mock crime scenario to identify changes in brain potential. In this study, an individual's behavior during lying is analyzed and a new scenario is developed for Concealed Information Test. This work involves a mock crime scenario using an EEG acquisition device for 10 participants. Data acquisition has been performed by placing 16 electrodes on the subjects' scalp. For this experiment, the subject has to recognize faces of some known and unknown personalities among 10 images flashed. These images behave as stimulus for the subject which generate corresponding brain responses. Various feature extraction approaches such as statistical, time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency domain are applied to the 16- channel EEG data. For classifying a subject as guilty or innocent, five classifiers have been applied on subject-wise EEG data. Moreover, the classifiers' ranking is considered based on the performance of classifiers. An ensemble framework is developed by aggregating the results of the best three classifiers out of the tested five classifiers. The classifiers' results are aggregated using a weighted voting approach and have been compared with popular conventional approaches using various classification performance measures. Results present a comparative performance of different feature extraction approaches and classifiers using subject-wise single-trial EEG data. The wavelet approach performs better for EEG data of most of the subjects. A comparison between base classifiers and ensemble framework is provided with the ensemble approach outperforming over the base classifiers. Further proposed framework is compared with some existing approaches, and a highest accuracy of 92.4% has been achieved.

Specifically, the link between neural activity in the auditory pathway measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) markers of pure tone processing in the P1, N1, P2, and N4 components is not well established. In this study, we used single-trial EEG-fMRI as a multi-modal fusion approach to integrate concurrently acquired EEG and fMRI data, in order to understand the spatial and temporal aspects of the pure tone processing pathway. Data were recorded from 33 subjects who were presented with stochastically alternating pure tone sequences with two different frequencies: 200 and 6400 Hz. Brain network correlated with trial-to-trial variability of the task-discriminating EEG amplitude was identified. We found that neural responses responding to pure tone perception are spatially along the auditory pathway and temporally divided into three stages: (1) the early stage (P1), wherein activation occurs in the midbrain, which constitutes a part of the low level auditory pathway; (2) the middle stage (N1, P2), wherein correlates were found in areas associated with the posterodorsal auditory pathway, including the primary auditory cortex and the motor cortex; (3) the late stage (N4), wherein correlation was found in the motor cortex. This indicates that trial-by-trial variation in neural activity in the P1, N1, P2, and N4 components reflects the sequential engagement of low- and high-level parts of the auditory pathway for pure tone processing. Our results demonstrate that during simple pure tone listening tasks, regions associated with the auditory pathway transiently correlate with trial-to-trial variability of the EEG amplitude, and they do so on a millisecond timescale with a distinct temporal ordering.

The majority of ASD patients suffer not only from ASD itself but also from its neuropsychiatric comorbidities. Alterations in brain structure, synaptic development, and misregulation of neuroinflammation are considered risk factors for ASD and neuropsychiatric comorbidities. Electroencephalography has been developed to quantitatively explore effects of these neuronal changes of the brain in ASD. The pineal neurohormone melatonin is able to contribute to neural development. Also, this hormone has an inflammation-regulatory role and acts as a circadian key regulator to normalize sleep. These functions of melatonin may play crucial roles in the alleviation of ASD and its neuropsychiatric comorbidities. In this context, this article focuses on the presumable role of melatonin and suggests that this hormone could be a therapeutic agent for ASD and its related neuropsychiatric disorders.

Many individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) consume drugs to relieve physical and/or emotional pain, a pattern that may increasingly result in death. The field of addiction research lacks a comprehensive understanding of physiological and neural mechanisms instantiating this cycle of Negative Reinforcement in OUD, resulting in limited interventions that successfully promote abstinence and recovery. Given the urgency of the opioid crisis, the present review highlights faulty brain circuitry and processes associated with OUD within the context of the Three-Stage Model of Addiction (1). This model underscores Negative Reinforcement processes as crucial to the maintenance and exacerbation of chronic substance use together with Binge/Intoxication and Preoccupation/Anticipation processes. This review focuses on cross-sectional as well as longitudinal studies of relapse and treatment outcome that employ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRs), brain stimulation methods, and/or electroencephalography (EEG) explored in frequency and time domains (the latter measured by event-related potentials, or ERPs). We discuss strengths and limitations of this neuroimaging work with respect to study design and individual differences that may influence interpretation of findings (e.g., opioid use chronicity/recency, comorbid symptoms, and biological sex). Lastly, we translate gaps in the OUD literature, particularly with respect to Negative Reinforcement processes, into future research directions involving operant and classical conditioning involving aversion/stress. Overall, opioid-related stimuli may lessen their hold on frontocingulate mechanisms implicated in Preoccupation/Anticipation as a function of prolonged abstinence and that degree of frontocingulate impairment may predict treatment outcome. In addition, longitudinal studies suggest that brain stimulation/drug treatments and prolonged abstinence can change brain responses during Negative Reinforcement and Preoccupation/Anticipation to reduce salience of drug cues, which may attenuate further craving and relapse. Incorporating this neuroscience-derived knowledge with the Three-Stage Model of Addiction may offer a useful plan for delineating specific neurobiological targets for OUD treatment.

Modulations in structural and functional MRI were found after only 1 h of BCI training. Two different types of BCI (based on motor imagery or visually evoked potentials) were employed and analyses showed that the brain plastic changes are spatially specific for the respective neurofeedback. This spatial specificity promises tailored therapeutic interventions (e.g. for stroke patients). A brain-computer-interface (BCI) allows humans to control computational devices using only neural signals. However, it is still an open question, whether performing BCI also impacts on the brain itself, i.e. whether brain plasticity is induced. Here, we show rapid and spatially specific signs of brain plasticity measured with functional and structural MRI after only 1 h of purely mental BCI training in BCI-naive subjects. We employed two BCI approaches with neurofeedback based on (i) modulations of EEG rhythms by motor imagery (MI-BCI) or (ii) event-related potentials elicited by visually targeting flashing letters (ERP-BCI). Before and after the BCI session we performed structural and functional MRI. For both BCI approaches we found increased T1-weighted MR signal in the grey matter of the respective target brain regions, such as occipital/parietal areas after ERP-BCI and precuneus and sensorimotor regions after MI-BCI. The latter also showed increased functional connectivity and higher task-evoked BOLD activity in the same areas. Our results demonstrate for the first time that BCI by means of targeted neurofeedback rapidly impacts on MRI measures of brain structure and function. The spatial specificity of BCI-induced brain plasticity promises therapeutic interventions tailored to individual functional deficits, for example in patients after stroke.

A new approach to quantifying the EEG during walking: Initial evidence of gait related potentials and their changes with aging and dual tasking	EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Gait cycle; Gait related potentials (GRP); Dual task	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MOTOR-PERFORMANCE; ATTENTIONAL COST; OLDER-ADULTS; VARIABILITY; P300; CUES; ACTIVATION; COMPONENT	Background: The electroencephalogram (EEG) can be a useful tool to investigate the neurophysiology of gait during walking. Our aims were to develop an approach that identify and quantify event related potentials (ERPs) during a gait cycle and to examine the effects of aging and dual tasking on these gait related potentials (GRPs). Methods: 10 young and 10 older adults walked on a treadmill while wearing a wireless 20-channels EEG and accelerometers on the ankles. Each heel strike extracted from the accelerometers was used as an event to which the electrical brain activity pattern was locked. The subjects performed usual and dual task walking that included an auditory oddball task. GRPs amplitude and latency were computed, and a new measure referred to as Amplitude Pattern Consistency (APC) was developed to quantify the consistency of these GRP amplitudes within a gait cycle. The results were compared between and within groups using linear mixed model analysis. Results: The electrical pattern during a gait cycle consisted of two main positive GRPs. Differences in these GRPs between young and older adults were observed in Pz and Cz. In Pz, older adults had higher GRPs amplitude (p = 0.006, p = 0.010), and in Cz lower APC (p = 0.025). Alterations were also observed between the walking tasks. Both groups showed shorter latency during oddball walking compared to usual walking in Cz (p = 0.040). In addition, the APC in Cz was correlated with gait speed (r = 0.599, p = 0.011) in all subjects and with stride time variability in the older adults (r = - 0.703, p = 0.023). Conclusions: This study is the first to define specific gait related potentials within a gait cycle using novel methods for quantifying waveforms. Our findings show the potential of this approach to be applied broadly to study the EEG during gait in a variety of contexts. The observed changes in GRPs with aging and walking task and the relationship between GRPs and gait may suggest the neurophysiologic foundation for studying walking and for developing new approaches for improving gait.

Implications of Gender Composition and Physical Intimacy on Evaluation of Images Tested for Advertising	COMMUNICATION RESEARCH REPORTS			English	Article						Advertising; Cognition; Electroencephalography; Emotion; Gender	HOMOSEXUAL IMAGERY; ADVERTISEMENTS; ERP; PERCEPTION; BRAND; SEX	Drawing upon the theoretical framework of social identity theory and literature on physical intimacy, consumer neuroscience, and social cognitive and affective neuroscience, responses to images featuring same-gender and other-gender pairs are explored through examination of self-reported attitudes and neural activity associated with attention, memory, and emotion. Under the pretense of pretesting the effectiveness of images to be used in a national advertising campaign, participants viewed still images while neuroelectric brain responses were recorded. Each image featured two women, two men, or a man and a woman presented in positions of physical intimacy. Results indicated that event-related brain potentials (ERPs) associated with attention did not differ overall based on couple composition. However, ERPs associated with working memory and emotion were enhanced when processing images with two men. Preference for these images was reflected in self-reported attitudes.

Yet they rely on partly overlapping neural substrates. Their independence was studied using an auditory paradigm. Method: Continuous EEG was recorded in 16 adults and event-related potentials (ERPs) were analyzed in a new dichotic listening - Go/Nogo task. Attention was directed either to the right dominant ear (forced-right blocks [FR]) or to the left ear (forced-left blocks [FL]). The Go/Nogo task required a motor response only to the standard word played to the selected ear; the nonselected ear was simultaneously presented with the same word (Go condition) or with a deviant (Incongruent Go condition). In the Nogo condition, a deviant was presented to the selected ear while the standard was played to the nonselected ear. Effortful interference suppression was expected only in the FL blocks to override the automatic processing of distractors in the dominant ear. Results: When no effortful interference suppression was necessary (FR blocks) in the Nogo condition, the N2 and P3 increase probably reflected two subcomponents of response inhibition (response restraint and response cancellation) and the P2 decrease probably reflected an early inhibitory mechanism (sensory gating). When effortful interference suppression was necessary (FL blocks), there was no Nogo-N2 (i.e., no response restraint). Interference suppression (Incongruent Go condition minus Go condition) also increased the N2 and P3, but did not modulate the P2. Conclusions: This new paradigm confirms the partial overlap between response inhibition and effortful interference suppression and points out specific features of their subcomponents.

This study applied the electroencephalogram (EEG) technique to investigate the emotion recognition ability in 31 deaf children and 30 hearing controls with facial emotion recognition task. Results from behavioral task showed that deaf children exhibited lower accuracy compared to hearing controls. As for EEG analysis, results showed that deaf children showed diminished activation in the early (N1, P1), middle (N170) and late stages (late positive potential, LPP) compared to hearing controls. In addition, for brain oscillation, alpha band (400-800 ms) also revealed a reduced desynchronization in deaf children. The present findings seem to indicate that the deficit during facial emotion recognition ability among deaf children might be due to the impairments in visual processing, attention and emotional semantic distribution ability during facial emotion recognition processing.

The research on the special multisensory integration has a very important role in the study of human perception, learning and memory. In this study, EEG data of subjects from single sensory area and multi-sensory joint areas will be obtained by cross-sensory stimulation experiments. After the analysis from the time, frequency and spatial domains, the features of cross-sensory information enhancement are extracted. The brain areas where information exchanges exist will be determined. By designing the experiments (single-sensory sustained attention task, sSAT and multi-sensory sustained attention task, mSAT), we obtain induced brain waves, and analyze human EEG information from which we extract ERP (Event Related Potential) component and conduct discriminatory analysis. Then we study the reaction mechanism of the brain. Using behavioral analysis, ERP time domain analysis and time-frequency analysis technology, we compare the results of two kinds of experiments (sSAT and mSAT) to explore the physiological mechanism of sustained attention. On this basis of analyzing subjects' individual differernces, an effective neurofeedback training method will be established to activate the various functional areas of the brain, which provides a theoretical basis for development of instruments to enhance perception and improve the living conditions of the populations whose sensory perception is decreased. This study has enormous social value.

Exploration of the Impact of Brief Noninvasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation on EEG and Event-Related Potentials	NEUROMODULATION			English	Article						EEG; evoked responses; neurochemistry; vagal nerve stimulation	AUDITORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; CENTRAL SEROTONERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; VAGUS NERVE; LOUDNESS DEPENDENCE; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; LOCUS-COERULEUS; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; GABAERGIC MODULATION; INTENSITY DEPENDENCE	Objectives The primary objective of this study was to explore the impact of noninvasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation (nVNS) on brain electrophysiology, as assessed through spontaneous resting-state EEG and stimulus-driven event-related potentials (ERPs). Methods A hand-held transcutaneous stimulator was placed on the neck over the main branch of the left vagus (active condition) or more laterally over neck muscles (sham condition), with two 120-sec long bursts of stimulation applied over a five-minute period. For each of eight neurotypical subjects, prior to stimulation, and then again beginning at 15, 120, and 240 min post-stimulation, ten minutes of background EEG data were collected, along with a series of ERPs-N100 auditory sensory-gating; the N1/P2 loudness dependent auditory evoked responses (LDAER); mismatch negativity; P300a; and P300b. Each subject participated in active and sham stimulation sessions. Results Brief nVNS had a significant (p < 0.05), and in some cases prolonged (>2 hours), impact on the spontaneous EEG (decreased theta and alpha, and increased beta and gamma), and on sensory gating, LDAER, and P300b evoked responses. Based on prior literature, these specific observations may reflect nVNS-induced modulation of particular neurotransmitter systems including those for GABA (gamma power and frequency); acetylcholine (sensory gating); serotonin (LDAER); and noradrenaline (P300b). Conclusions Brief nVNS leads to changes in a sub-set of resting-state and event-related electrophysiologic indices of brain activity. These changes are believed to be mediated by vagal afferent projections to the nucleus of the solitary tract, which in turn regulates several neurotransmitter systems through known direct and indirect neuroanatomic pathways.

Some studies, considering affective facial expressions to study emotion processing, demonstrated emotion recognition difficulties in MS patients. Objective: We investigated the impact of MS on the emotional-behaviour rating and neurophysiological response (Event Related Potentials-ERP) through a battery of affective visual stimuli selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Methods: Twenty patients with diagnosis of Relapsing Remitting MS (RRMS) and 20 Healthy Controls (HC) matched by age, gender and education were enrolled. Each of them, after a neuropsychological assessment, were asked to evaluate arousal and valence of affective visual stimuli. Results: Our results showed higher P300 amplitudes in RAMS patients than HC group for pleasant and unpleasant images. Moreover, RAMS patients showed lower Reaction Time (RT) respect HC in valence rating. No other effect did emerge between groups. Conclusion: Our study shows early compensatory cerebral mechanisms in RAMS patients throughout emotional information processing, particularly for unpleasant and pleasant stimuli. We hypothesize that this compensatory cerebral mechanism reduces the behavioural dissimilarity between patients and HC.

Investigating the association between parity and the maternal neural response to infant cues	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Parity; mothers; parenting; EEG/ERPs; infant faces; infant cries	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PARENTAL STATUS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; MOTHERS; BEHAVIOR; FACES; BASES; PERCEPTION; EXPERIENCE; COMPONENT	Understanding the maternal neural response to infant affective cues has important implications for parent-child relationships. The current study employed event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine patterns in mothers' responses to infant affective cues, and evaluated the influence of maternal experience, defined by parity (i.e., the number of children a mother has) on ERP responses. Eighty-three mothers, three months postpartum, viewed photographs of displays of infant emotional faces (sad or happy) and listened to infant cries of different distress levels and a control tone. Maternal neural response was modulated by the emotional content of the auditory stimulus, as indexed by the N100 amplitude and latency. However, response to infant faces was not modulated by the emotional content of the stimuli as indexed by the N170. Neither N100 nor N170 were affected by parity. Maternal engagement with auditory stimuli, as indexed by the P300, was modulated by the emotional content of the cry and was affected by parity. A similar parity effect was observed for the P300 response to infant faces. Results suggest that parity may play an important role at later stages of maternal infant cue perception.

However, the mechanisms underlying these changes are not well understood. One reason for this is that so far only very few studies considered the effects of specific meditation practices. We thus investigated the effects of engaging in one specific form of mindfulness meditation for a brief time period on behavioral and neural indicators of inhibitory control and metacognition. Performance on the Go/No-Go task and concurrent neural activity (EEG) was assessed before and after participants engaged in 3 weeks of mindful breath awareness meditation. Compared to a waitlist control group, meditation training enhanced the N2 event-related potential in No-Go trials and the error-related negativity (ERN) after error responses. As these two components reflect conflict and response monitoring, respectively, our results support the notion that mindfulness meditation improves metacognitive processes. The changes in the ERN were correlated with the accumulated amount of meditation time, highlighting the importance of meditation practice. Furthermore, meditation improved a behavioral marker of impulsive responding, indicating the relevance of mindfulness-based approaches for supporting health-related behaviors that are associated with deficits in impulsive control, such as substance abuse or over-eating. This study demonstrated that investigating one particular meditation practice rather than complex mindfulness-based interventions can contribute to a deeper understanding of mindfulness meditation mechanisms.

Thirty-two EEG channel were recorded in a sample of 19 young adult subjects while performing a CCPP, in which a cue indicated (validly or invalidly) the position of an incoming auditory target. Three different types of blocks with validities of 50%, 64%, and 88%, respectively, were presented. Estimates of prior expectation and surprise were obtained on a trialby-trial basis from participants' responses, using a computational model implementing Bayesian learning. These two values were correlated on a trial-by-trial basis with the EEG values in all the electrodes and time bins. Therefore, a Spearman correlation metrics of the relationship between Bayesian parameters and the EEG was obtained. We report that the surprise parameter was able to classify the different validity blocks. Furthermore, the prior expectation parameter showed a significant correlation with the EEG in the cue-target period, in which the Contingent Negative Variation develops. Finally, in the post-target period the surprise parameter showed a significant correlation in the latencies and electrodes in which different event-related potentials are induced. Our results suggest that Bayesian parameters are coded in the EEG signals; and namely, the CNV would be related to prior expectation, while the post-target components P2a, P2, P3a, P3b, and SW would be related to surprise. This study thus provides novel support to the idea that human electrophysiological neural activity may implement a (Bayesian) predictive processing scheme.

The main aim of high-resolution EEG is source localization with methods that have become increasingly robust and precise. However, high-resolution EEG also allows a spatial analysis of EEG and evoked potentials on the scalp level, thereby identifying topographic features of the scalp potential field. Their value in understanding the dynamics of large-scale networks of the human brain and as markers for neuropsychiatric diseases has been increasingly demonstrated. This chapter discusses the advantages and limitations of such spatial analysis methods and the information that can be gained from them. It also shows that the spatial frequency of the scalp potential field is higher than previously assumed and discusses the consequences regarding the number of channels required to properly capture these spatial frequencies.

The cerebellum influences internal forward models that play a role in cognitive control, but whether these processes are dysfunctional in CA is unclear. Here, we examined sensory predictive coding processes and response adaptation in CA and healthy controls (HC) using behavioral tests with concomitant EEG recordings. N = 23 patients and N = 29 age- and sex-matched HC were studied. Sensory prediction coding was tested with an auditory distraction paradigm and error-related behavioral adaptation with a visual flanker task. As neurophysiological markers we studied different event-related potentials: the P3a for orientation of attention; the N2 and the error-related negativity (ERN) for cognitive adaptation processes/consequences of response errors; error-related positivity (Pe) for error-awareness; the mismatch negativity (MMN) for sensory predictive coding; and reorientation negativity (RON) for reorientation after unexpected events. Overall reaction times were slower in patients compared to HC, but error rates did not differ. Both in patients and HC, P3a amplitudes were larger in distraction trials, but the P3a amplitude was smaller in patients compared to HC. The MMN as well as behavioral and EEG-correlates of response adaptation (ERN/N2) did not differ between groups, while the Pe was attenuated in patients. During sensory predictive coding, RON amplitudes were significantly larger in HC compared to patients. In HC, but not in patients, RON amplitudes were also larger in deviant compared to frequent trials. Processes generating internal forward models are largely intact in genetically determined CA, whereas updating of mental models and error awareness are disturbed in these patients.

To date, however, the effects of social feedback on attentional and perceptual processes remain unclear. In this study, participants were asked to judge the hues of distinct, or ambiguously coloured stimuli, and to indicate their confidence ratings. Alleged social feedback was then provided, either endorsing or disputing the participants' responses. Participants were then presented the stimulus a second time and given the option to reconsider their decision. Behavioural findings showed that confidence levels decreased both with task difficulty and with conflicting social feedback. Event-related potential data showed greater P2 and N2 amplitudes for ambiguous squares compared to distinct squares upon initial stimulus presentations, compatible with heightened attention. Moreover, a decreased P300 was found for ambiguous stimuli, consistent with an increase in metacognitive activity. After social feedback, an early-late positive potential between 270 and 370 ms continued to distinguish ambiguous from distinct stimuli. More importantly, after 400 ms, the late positive potential distinguished endorsed from disputed stimuli. These results reveal that social feedback, while decreasing effects linked to uncertainty, gives rise to later processes associated with enhanced motivational significance of the stimulus following divergence from social approval.

When at rest, our mind wanders from thought to thought in distinct mental states. Despite the marked importance of ongoing mental processes, it is challenging to capture and relate these states to specific cognitive contents. In this work, we employed ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and high-density electroencephalography (EEG) to study the ongoing thoughts of participants instructed to retrieve self-relevant past episodes for periods of 22sec. These task-initiated, participant-driven activity patterns were compared to a distinct condition where participants performed serial mental arithmetic operations, thereby shifting from self-related to self-unrelated thoughts. BOLD activity mapping revealed selective enhanced activity in temporal, parietal and occipital areas during the memory compared to the mental arithmetic condition, evincing their role in integrating the re-experienced past events into conscious representations during memory retrieval. Functional connectivity analysis showed that these regions were organized in two major subparts, previously associated to "scene-reconstruction" and "self-experience" subsystems. EEG microstate analysis allowed studying these participant-driven thoughts in the millisecond range by determining the temporal dynamics of brief periods of stable scalp potential fields. This analysis revealed selective modulation of occurrence and duration of specific microstates in the memory and in the mental arithmetic condition, respectively. EEG source analysis revealed similar spatial distributions of the sources of these microstates and the regions identified with fMRI. These findings imply a functional link between BOLD activity changes in regions related to a certain mental activity and the temporal dynamics of mentation, and support growing evidence that specific fMRI networks can be captured with EEG as repeatedly occurring brief periods of integrated coherent neuronal activity, lasting only fractions of seconds.

This hypersensitivity manifests through differential patterns of emotional information processing and has been demonstrated in behavioral and neurophysiological experimental paradigms. However, the majority of research has been focused on adult patients with PTSD. To examine possible differences in underlying neurophysiological patterns for adolescent patients with PTSD after childhood sexual and/or physical abuse (CSA/CPA), ERP correlates of emotional word processing in 38 healthy participants and 40 adolescent participants with PTSD after experiencing CSA/CPA were studied. The experimental paradigm consisted of a passive reading task with neutral, positive (e.g., paradise), physically threatening (e.g., torment), and socially threatening (i.e., swearing, e.g., son of a bitch) words. A modulation of P3 amplitudes by emotional valence was found, with positive words inducing less elevated amplitudes over both groups. Interestingly, in later processing, the PTSD group showed augmented early late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes for socially threatening stimuli, while there were no modulations within the healthy control group. Also, region-specific emotional modulations for anterior and posterior electrode clusters were found. For the anterior LPP, highest activations have been found for positive words, while socially and physically threatening words led to strongest modulations in the posterior LPP cluster. There were no modulations by group or emotional valence at the P1 and EPN stage. The findings suggest an enhanced conscious processing of socially threatening words in adolescent patients with PTSD after CSA/CPA, pointing to the importance of a disjoined examination of threat words in emotional processing research.

Oxytocin Enhances the Neural Efficiency of Social Perception	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ERP; EEG; face perception; oxytocin; emotion perception	INTRANASAL OXYTOCIN; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; EMOTIONAL FACES; HUMAN BRAIN; TIME-COURSE; AMYGDALA REACTIVITY; RECOGNITION MEMORY; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; EYE-GAZE; ERP	Face perception is a highly conserved process that directs our attention from infancy and is supported by specialized neural circuitry. Oxytocin (OT) can increase accuracy and detection of emotional faces, but these effects are mediated by valence, individual differences, and context. We investigated the temporal dynamics of OT's influence on the neural substrates of face perception using event related potentials (ERPs). In a double blind, placebo controlled within-subject design, 21 healthy male adults inhaled OT or placebo and underwent ERP imaging during two face processing tasks. Experiment 1 investigated effects of OT on neural correlates of fearful vs. neutral facial expressions, and Experiment 2 manipulated point-of-gaze to neutral faces. In Experiment 1, we found that OT reduced N170 latency to fearful faces. In Experiment 2, N170 latency was decreased when participant gaze was directed to the eyes of neutral faces; however, there were no OT-associated effects in response to different facial features. Findings suggest OT modulates early stages of social perception for socially complex information such as emotional faces relative to neutral. These results are consistent with models suggesting OT impacts the salience of socially informative cues during processing, which leads to downstream effects in behavior. Future work should examine how OT affects neural processes underlying basic components of social behavior (such as, face perception) while varying emotional expression of stimuli or comparing different characteristics of participants (e.g., gender, personality traits).

Electroencephalogram (EEG) collected during imagination of limb movement is used as an input for Brain computer interface (BCI) systems to translate the imagination into a command. We have studied the effect of continues hand movement imagination on the event related potentials in the brain. The goal of this paper is to investigate whether continues imagination of hand movement can cause continues effect in the event related potential. For this purpose, a set of experiments were designed and performed to collect 180 trials of hand movement imagination for 3 subjects. We utilized independent component analysis (ICA) to separate the sources related to continues hand movement imagination. The statistical methods including Ansaribradley and analysis of variance (ANOVA) are used to select the components/ sources with maximum correlation to the hand movement imagination task. It is shown that although power in both alpha and beta bands decrease by movement imagination, alpha band can differentiate continues imagination vs. non-imagination better than beta band. Besides that, we have found an improvement in the event related synchronization and desynchronization over different sessions for all subjects, which shows effect of training on improving the imagination of the task.

The present study sought to compare the automatic visual attention mechanisms in three psychiatric disorders considered to distribute along the continuum of psychosis severity: schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD). To this end, the visual P1 event-related potential component, a cortical correlate of automatic visual attention, was measured during an ecological task based on visual word pair presentation. Methods Four samples of participants, 18 SCZ, 20 BD, 28 MDD, and 30 healthy controls, were recruited and submitted to the same procedure and stimuli. The P1 evoked by visual word presentation was recorded through a 38-electrode electroencephalography cap. Words were presented on a computer screen serially as pairs, and participants had to decide whether they rhymed or not. Results P1 was larger at posterior sites in SCZ compared with BD, healthy control, and MDD participants. BD patients showed the lowest P1 compared with all other groups. Positive Pearson's correlations were found in SCZ patients between P1 amplitude on left posterior sites and both hallucination severity and worse task performance. Conclusion The three investigated psychiatric samples showed different automatic visual attention patterns: SCZ patients exhibited the greatest cognitive impairment correlated with the amplitude of P1, MDD patients revealed a normal component, and BD showed a compensated euthymic response different from results of past literature in untreated patients.

Emotion Sensitivity of the Error-Related Negativity in Hoarding Individuals	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Hoarding; EEG; Error-related negativity; Emotion	STRESS SCALES DASS; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; NEURAL MECHANISMS; ANXIETY DISORDER; BRAIN ACTIVITY; DEPRESSION; RESPONSES; VALIDATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY	Emerging research suggests that hoarding individuals display atypical activation in their anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Hemodynamic studies have found a biphasic pattern of ACC activity in hoarding individuals that appears sensitive to possession-related decision-making. Electrophysiological studies suggest that hoarding individuals display a blunted error-related negativity (ERN); an event-related potential originating from the ACC that indexes error-detection. These neural abnormalities may reflect an error sensitivity in hoarding individuals as they acquire and discard, however it may also reflect the hyper-emotionality often reported by individuals who hoard. The present study aimed to examine the emotional sensitivity of the error-related negativity in hoarding individuals outside a possession-related context. Seventeen hoarding individuals and 16 healthy controls underwent continuous electroencephalography (EEG) as they completed Go/No-Go (GNGT) tasks design to elicit the ERN. Identical GNGT tasks were completed both before and after watching a negative mood induction video, and self-reported distress was measured throughout. Neither group displayed any neural effect of the negative mood induction, however the hoarding group displayed a pattern of blunted ERN consistent with previous research. This study provides additional evidence that hoarding individuals display blunted indices of error-detection outside possession-related decision-making. Future research could explore if this reflects a pathophysiology shared with other psychiatric disorders that feature a blunted ERN, and if error-detection is also abnormal as hoarding individuals acquire and discard their possessions.

A recent good candidate to create a robust identity authentication system is based on brain signals recorded with electroencephalograms (EEG). In this paper, EEG-based brain signals of 56 channels, from event-related potentials (ERPs), are used for Subject identification. The ERPs are from positive or negative feedback-related responses of a P300-speller system. The feature extraction part was done with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) extracting 2 intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) per channel, that were selected based on the Minkowski distance. After that, 4 features are computed per IMF; 2 energy features (instantaneous and teager energy) and 2 fractal features (Higuchi and Petrosian fractal dimension). Support vector machine (SVM) was used for the classification stage with an accuracy index computed using 10-folds cross-validation for evaluating the classifier's performance. Since high-density EEG information was available, the well-known backward-elimination and forward-addition greedy algorithms were used to reduce or increase the number of channels, step by step. Using the proposed method for subject identification from a positive or negative feedback-related response and then identify the subject will add a layer to improve the security system. The results obtained show that subject identification is feasible even using a low number of channels: E.g., 0.89 of accuracy using 5 channels with a mixed population and 0.93 with a male-only population.

The present study tested patients with lesions encompassing the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG; including Brodmann areas 44 and 45) to further investigate this cognitive function, notably by using non-verbal material, implicit investigation methods, and by enhancing potential remaining function via dynamic attending. Patients and healthy matched controls were exposed to an artificial pitch grammar in an implicit learning paradigm to circumvent the potential influence of impaired language processing. Methods Patients and healthy controls listened to pitch sequences generated within a finite-state grammar (exposure phase) and then performed a categorization task on new pitch sequences (test phase). Participants were not informed about the underlying grammar in either the exposure phase or the test phase. Furthermore, the pitch structures were presented in a highly regular temporal context as the beneficial impact of temporal regularity (e.g. meter) in learning and perception has been previously reported. Based on the Dynamic Attending Theory (DAT), we hypothesized that a temporally regular context helps developing temporal expectations that, in turn, facilitate event perception, and thus benefit artificial grammar learning. Results Electroencephalography results suggest preserved artificial grammar learning of pitch structures in patients and healthy controls. For both groups, analyses of event-related potentials revealed a larger early negativity (100-200 msec post-stimulus onset) in response to ungrammatical than grammatical pitch sequence events. Conclusions These findings suggest that (i) the LIFG does not play an exclusive role in the implicit learning of artificial pitch grammars, and (ii) the use of non-verbal material and an implicit task reveals cognitive capacities that remain intact despite lesions to the LIFG. These results provide grounds for training and rehabilitation, that is, learning of non-verbal grammars that may impact the relearning of verbal grammars.

Validation of a multidirectional locomotive dual-task paradigm to evaluate task-related differences in event-related electro-cortical activity	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Event-related potentials; Dual-task; Walking; Locomotion	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; WALKING; P300; ERP; INTERFERENCE; BRAIN; EEG; COMPONENT; SYSTEM; GAIT	A fundamental aspect of everyday function is the ability to simultaneously execute both cognitive and motor tasks. The ability to perform such tasks is commonly assessed using a dual-task paradigm that has the capacity to manipulate both cognitive and motor components of an action. Dual-task performance provides an opportunity to obtain an insight into how cognitive and motor function are affected during natural tasks (e.g., locomotion). The following study aimed to determine the effectiveness of using a goal-directed multidirectional locomotor task to measure differences in task-related (tasks of increasing difficulty) electro-cortical activity. In the single-task condition participants walked around a grid-based track, performing directional changes at each intersection in response to a sensory stimulus. In the dual-task condition participants performed the same primary task while performing a simultaneous memory recall task. Behavioural differences in trial completion time and electro-cortical activity were identified in relation to the posterior N2 and P3 component mean amplitudes. The results showed that, while performing a higher-level cognitive task during walking (dual-task), interference arises in a shared system that influences neural mechanisms involved in attention and selection for action, and later cognitive processes recruited in working memory and cognitive control. This study extends previous work and shows that performing a more complex cognitive task while walking, elicits interference effects sensitive to higher-level cognitive processes, and takes the next step towards measurement of electro-cortical activity within naturalistic environments.

Classification performances of Decision Trees, logistic regression, random forest, Support Vector Machines and XGBoost methods are evaluated. In this context, EEG was collected during the presentation of two different stimulus. The resulting feature set is given as an input to decision trees, logistic regression, random forest, support vector machines, and xgboost classifiers. Due to the limited test data obtained, synthetic Minority oversampling technique(SMOTE) was applied to the data and classification was performed with the updated dataset. As a result of the study, 91% accuracy was obtained for the training dataset in random forest and XGBoost classification methods. For the test set xgboost_tuned has a 62% accuracy and 71% F1 value. To conclude, superior results were found from other classifiers using the xgboost classification method.

This is arguably not due to a lack of information that lies in EEG recordings but mainly on account of methodological issues. In many cases, particularly in clinical, pediatric and aging populations, the EEG has a high degree of artifact contamination and the quality of EEG recordings often substantially differs between subjects. Although there exists a variety of standardized preprocessing methods to clean EEG from artifacts, currently there is no method to objectively quantify the quality of preprocessed EEG. This makes the commonly accepted procedure of excluding subjects from analyses due to exceeding contamination of artifacts highly subjective. As a consequence, P-hacking is fostered, the replicability of results is decreased, and it is difficult to pool data from different study sites. In addition, in large-scale studies, data are collected over years or even decades, requiring software that controls and manages the preprocessing of ongoing and dynamically growing studies. To address these challenges, we developed Automagic, an open-source MATLAB toolbox that acts as a wrapper to run currently available preprocessing methods and offers objective standardized quality assessment for growing studies. The software is compatible with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard and hence facilitates data sharing. In the present paper we outline the functionally of Automagic and examine the effect of applying combinations of methods on a sample of resting and task-based EEG data. This examination suggests that applying a pipeline of algorithms to detect artifactual channels in combination with Multiple Artifact Rejection Algorithm (MARA), an independent component analysis (ICA)-based artifact correction method, is sufficient to reduce a large extent of artifacts.

In the current work, we examined the time course of enhanced attention to contingently salient information in a nonspatial WM task using event related brain potentials (ERPs). In line with previous work, we predicted that the encoding of contingently salient stimuli would be associated with an enhancement of cognitive control processes rather than low-level salience detection. The results of this study supported this hypothesis, evidenced by a posterior P3 component of greater amplitude for contingently salient stimuli relative to stimuli of a control color, which is thought to reflect enhanced attention to information that matches a target held in WM. However, P3 amplitude during encoding was unrelated to subsequent memory accuracy. As an exploratory follow up on these results, we conducted a regression analysis including beliefs about ability to focus attention as a moderator, which interacted with P3 amplitude to predict WM recall of salient letters. Furthermore, source localization analyses implicated a significant contribution of regions in the salience network to the detection of target stimuli, but only frontal control regions showed a greater response to salient than control letters. Thus, the results of this experiment suggest that participants enhance cognitive control during the encoding of contingently salient stimuli, but that the relationship between this neural process during encoding and subsequent benefits to WM recall might depend on individual differences in attentional focus.

Neurophysiological correlates of visuospatial attention and the social dynamics of gaze processing	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Gaze cueing; PCA; Social cognition; Spatial attention	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EYE GAZE; SPATIAL ATTENTION; JOINT ATTENTION; VISUAL SCANPATH; ERP COMPONENTS; AUTISM; INHIBITION; DISSOCIATION; PERCEPTION	The reflexive orienting response triggered by nonpredictive gaze cues is thought to be driven by a dedicated social neural network responsible for directing attention toward socially salient information. However, atypical processing of eye gaze using concomitant perceptual features has been proposed to underlie attentional orienting in groups with impairments in social cognition. Here, we examined the neurophysiological indices of visuospatial attention during a spatial cueing task, considering individual variability in social cognition in typically developing individuals, and the relative salience of social gaze and perceptual motion cues. We found enhanced neural activation to incongruent cues, wherein modulation of the N2b serves as a marker of the allocation of attention in the spatial domain. Our findings suggest the social gaze cue is less salient for those with greater autistic traits. An attentional bias toward perceptual motion cues correlated with greater social anxiety and alexithymia, and thus may reflect reduced sensitivity to social stimuli. These results provide evidence for likely neurophysiological mechanisms underlying gaze cueing and offer insight into the use of qualitatively different cognitive mechanisms used to access social information. Such paradigms provide potential insight into normative orienting responses reported in atypical groups and would benefit investigations of gaze following abilities in clinical populations.

The emergence of such functional specialization in the human cortex represents a pivotal developmental process, which provides a basis for targeted and efficient information processing. For example, functional specialization to print in the left vOT is an important prerequisite for fluent reading. However, it remains unclear, which processes initiate the preferential cortical activations to characters arising in the vOT during child development. Using a multimodal neuroimaging approach with preschool children at familial risk for developmental dyslexia, we demonstrate how varying levels of expertise modulate the neural response to single characters, which represent the building blocks of print units. The level of expertise to characters was manipulated firstly through brief training of false-font speech-sound associations and secondly by comparing characters for which children differed in their level of familiarity and expertise accumulated through abundant exposure in their everyday environment. Neural correlates of character processing were tracked with simultaneous high-density electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging in a target detection task. We found training performance and expertise-dependent modulation of the visual event-related potential around 220 ms (N1) and the corresponding vOT activation. Additionally, trained false-font characters revealed stronger functional connectivity between the left fusiform gyrus (FFG) seed and left superior parietal/lateral occipital cortex regions with higher training performance. In sum, our results demonstrate that learning artificial-character speech-sound associations enhances activation to trained characters in the vOT and that the magnitude of this activation and the functional connectivity of the left FFG to the parieto-occipital cortex depends on learning performance. This pattern of results suggests emerging development of the reading network after brief training that parallels network specialization during reading acquisition.

Tracking the spatiotemporal fast (similar to 100ms) transient networks remains challenging due to a limited understanding of neural activity dynamics as well as a lack of relevant sophisticated methodologies. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to identify simultaneously distinct EEG microstates and their corresponding microstate functional connectivity (mu FC) networks in which each mu FC network is associated with a distinguished connectivity pattern of recurrent neuronal activity. Approach. The introduced approach is based on a multivariate Gaussian hidden Markov model (MGHMM) to decompose the sensor-space stochastic multi-subject event-related potential (ERP) into quasi-stable EEG microstates. Raw trial segments whose time windows belong to a corresponding segmented EEG microstate are then concatenated for measuring their mu FC using the time-averaged phase-locking value. Illustration of this method is evaluated with synthetic data for which ground-truth microstate dynamics arc known. Furthermore, we apply the method to identify EEG microstates and corresponding mu FC networks in publicly available EEG data measured from visual cognitive tasks. Finally, we compare the MGHMM method with conventional dynamic FC (dFC) approaches using clustering-based K-means and time sliding windows, which conversely segregate the macrostate FC matrices across times into 'FC-states'. Main results. By using the MGHMM approach, we reveal: (1) EEG microstates, (2) mu FC networks, (3) the associations of EEG microstate networks and their corresponding mu FC networks dynamically modulated in publicly available EEG cognitive tasks, and (4) compared dFC performances between our proposed mu FC approaches and 'FC-states' segmented by clustering-based K-means and time sliding windows. Significance. Evidence of significant improvements of microstate correlations (p-value < 0.05) and improved tendency of FC distinction (p-value = 0.064) over reported methods with simulated and realistic data will make this approach a preferred methodology to study dynamic brain networks and guarantee its use for further clinical applications.

Standardized music therapy with and without acclimatization, to improve EEG data acquisition in young children with and without disability	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; Event-related potential; Acclimatization; Child; Sensory; Cerebral palsy	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INFANTS; ANXIETY	Introduction: In young children, EEG data acquisition during stimulation tasks is difficult due to anxiety, movement and behaviorally-related interruptions, especially in those with disabilities. New method: We used standardized music therapy (MT) protocols with and without acclimatization, during and prior to time-locked EEG with a published tactile testing protocol. Our prospective study leveraged a larger trial in children with/without cerebral palsy aged 7-27 months. Group1 received no preparation, Group2 received 15-minute MT prior to the EEG session, Group3 received the same as Group2 plus a rubber cap for home practice. All groups received MT procedural support during the EEG session. Sessions were stopped/started to acquire a full dataset. Trials were reviewed using a two-step artifact detection strategy by specialists masked to group allocation. Results: 64 patients were included, 20 each in Groups 2 and 3, and 24 in Groupl. Average age was 16.08 +/- 6.33 months. All (100%) of children had data of sufficient quality and quantity for outcomes measurement without a second testing visit. There were no differences in useable trials by procedural group, disability status, age or stimulus condition. EEG recording time was shorter in Group3 vs. 1 (p = 0.02) and more patients in Groupl required repeat trials compared to Groups2 and 3 (p = 0.04 for both). Comparison with old method: Our new methods resulted in no attrition from data loss, an improvement compared to published similar studies with data loss 30-55%. Acclimatization had minimal effects. Conclusion: In children under 3, MT protocols result in high rates of EEG data acquisition, decrease behaviorally-related interruptions and session acquisition time. This method is successful for typically developing children and those with cerebral palsy.

Whether and how these methodological choices affect emotion-sensitive components of the event-related brain potentials (ERPs) is yet unclear. Therefore, this pre-registered study examined ERP modulations to close-up full-coloured and grey-scaled faces as well as cutout fearful and neutral facial expressions, while attention was directed to no-face oddballs. Results revealed no interaction of face naturalness and emotion for any ERP component, but showed, however, large main effects for both factors. Specifically, fearful faces and decreasing face naturalness elicited substantially enlarged N170 and early posterior negativity amplitudes and lower face naturalness also resulted in a larger P1.This pattern reversed for the LPP, showing linear increases in LPP amplitudes with increasing naturalness. We observed no interaction of emotion with face naturalness, which suggests that face naturalness and emotion are decoded in parallel at these early stages. Researchers interested in strong modulations of early components should make use of cutout grey-scaled faces, while those interested in a pronounced late positivity should use close-up coloured faces.

J	Siswandari, Y; Bode, S; Stahl, J				Siswandari, Yohana; Bode, Stefan; Stahl, Jutta			Performance monitoring beyond choice tasks: The time course of force execution monitoring investigated by event-related potentials and multivariate pattern analysis	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; Force monitoring; Multivariate pattern classification analysis (MVPA); Motor control; Force production; Even-related potential	BRAIN POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; REWARD PREDICTION; ERROR-DETECTION; NEGATIVITY; COMPONENTS	Accurate force production is an essential motor function which, in most cases, requires continuous performance monitoring. Unlike choice-response tasks with two response alternatives, the accuracy in a force production paradigm is defined as an area between an upper and lower limit on the force continuum. In the present study, we investigated the neural mechanisms underlying force production. We used a force production task in which the participants (n = 48) were asked to exert a brief force pulse within a specific force range. This allowed: (1) investigation of action monitoring activity during force execution using response-locked and feedback-locked event-related potential (ERP) components known to be involved in error monitoring; (2) multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) for ERPs. We found that the different force production ranges (characterised as too low, correct, and too high with respect to the target force range) showed no clear error-specific variations in the ERP components of interest. MVPA, on the other hand, allowed for successful classification, not only between the correct and the incorrect outcome conditions, but also between the two incorrect outcome conditions. This suggests that the classifier identified neural patterns reflecting the force magnitude rather than the correctness of a response. Moreover, additional support-vector regression (SVR) analyses showed that single-trial response parameters (i.e. peak force and time-to-peak) could be decoded from the brain activity pattern starting from 140 ms (for peak force) and 270 ms (for time-to-peak) before the response onset. These results indicate that the motor program defined the magnitude and timing of the force pulse before response execution, while the correctness of that response (in relation to the "default force" required) was not yet foreshadowed in neural signals. Finally, this study presents the first evidence of a post-error force adjustment mechanism, for which participants produced a higher force in trials after under-producing the required force, and a lower force in trials after over-producing the required force.

However, its specific role in attentional processing remains unclear, which is partly attributable to the low temporal resolution of non-invasive neuroimaging techniques. This study aims to examine the spatio-temporal dynamics of visual target processing using intracranial EEG recorded directly from the insula. Eight epileptic patients (four women, age 18-44years) completed a three-stimulus visual oddball task during the extraoperative invasive intracranial EEG (iEEG) monitoring of their drug-resistant seizures. Depth electrodes were implanted in ten insular lobes (5 left and 5 right) and provided a total of 59 recording contacts in the insula. Event-related potentials (ERPs) and high-gamma-band responses (GBRs) were processed offline. Permutation analyses were performed to compare ERP signals across conditions during the P300 (225-400) interval, and modulations of GBRs (70-150Hz) were computed for separate 100ms time windows (from 0 to 1000ms post-stimulus) and compared across conditions using non-parametric Wilcoxon test. Target stimuli were associated with a P300 (250-338ms) component for 39% of contacts implanted in the aI, most probably reflecting voluntary attentional processing. Amplitude was significantly greater for target than for standard stimuli for all of these contacts, and was greater than for novel stimuli for 72%. In the posterior insula (pI), 16% of contacts showed preferential responses to target stimulus in the P300 interval. Increased GBRs in response to targets were observed in 53% of aI contacts (from approximate to 200 to 300ms) and in 43% of pI contacts (from approximate to 400 to 500ms). This study is the first to characterize the spatio-temporal dynamics of visual target processing in the insula using iEEG. Results suggest that visual targets elicit a P300 in the aI which corresponds in latency to the P3b component, suggesting that this region is involved in top-down processing of task-relevant information. GBRs to visual targets occur earlier in the aI than in the pI, further characterizing their respective roles in voluntary attentional processing.

In recent decades, researchers have shown a greater interest in inhibiting the response. Response inhibition is considered an operationalization of certain aspects of impulsivity and compulsivity. Impulsivity is commonly defined as a tendency to act by impulses, acts performed immediately and without voluntary control, while compulsivity is the tendency to repeat a specific behavior and to be unable to inhibit the behavior even when it is no longer appropriate. Due to the importance of inhibiting the response in everyday life, many neuropsychological models have been developed to test inhibitory performance. In this experiment, subjects were asked to respond to a visual stimulus (i.e., a square or circular figure), but withheld this response to irrelevant stimuli (i.e., alarm sound). Therefore, in this study, we developed a new classification model of brain activities under response inhibition using functional connectivity. In this proposed model, we classified the electroencephalography (EEG) signals of successful-stop and failed-stop trials. In this study, we used parametric (LDA, QDA) and non-parametric (PARZENDC, KNNC) classification algorithms to investigate the accuracy of this system. First, the EEG signals acquired during the successful-stop and failed-stop trials, after that, we measured the functional connectivity between seven brain regions, included F3-F4, F4-O1, F4-T8, T7-O1, T7-T8, C3-CZ and C4CZ by phase-locked value (PLV) method. These seven regions of interest covered the entire human brain. These functional connectivity values were used as an input feature for the proposed classification model. Our novel classification system achieved 88% accuracy with QDA. These new findings revealed that this model can be considered to classify the EEG signals of successful-stop and failed-stop trials during response inhibition.

The secondary goal was to test the differences between children with and without ADHD on ERP and Go/No-Go behavioral measures. A total of twenty-nine participants (M age = 7.14 years; 52% male; 41.4% white) recruited from the IBBS efficacy study comparing IBBS to Treatment-As-Usual (TAU) completed a Go/No-Go task before and after treatment as brain activity was recorded using EEG. Thirty-four matched healthy controls (HC) completed the same EEG procedures at a single time point. Following treatment, the Go P3 latency was significantly earlier for the IBBS group relative to the TAU group. No treatment effects were found on any behavioral measures. Prior to treatment, there was a significant difference between the ADHD group and HC group for the N2 difference wave. Children with ADHD also showed slower reaction times on behavioral measures. Although this pilot study did not reveal robust treatment effects, it suggests that IBBS may prevent the worsening of attentional systems in the brain and larger studies are needed for replication purposes.

Previous research has either addressed the neural correlates of empathy for pain or social exclusion, but no study has examined empathy for physical and psychological (social) pain simultaneously. Forty-seven participants completed our novel "Social Interaction Empathy Task" during electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. Participants had to observe and rate the intensity of physical and psychological pain in social interactions from a first-and third-person perspective. At the behavioral level, subjects did not differentiate between the perspectives and rated physically painful scenarios as more painful than psychologically painful and neutral interactions. Psychologically painful pictures were also rated as more painful than neutral pictures. Analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs) revealed an early and a late response with a higher ERP response to physical and psychological pain compared to neutral interactions. Moreover, a significant difference emerged between the two dimensions of painful interactions. Furthermore, we found that the activity over frontal regions for discrimination of painful interactions was lateralized to the right hemisphere. Moreover, we detected significant correlations with the self-rated perspective taking ability. This suggests the psychological and physical pain qualities are processed differently but both are related to empathic traits. We further suggest that the right hemisphere may be specifically involved in the processing of empathy-related tasks.

Dynamics of movement-related cortical potentials and sensorimotor oscillations during palmar grasp movements	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; ERD; grasp; MRCP	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; COMMUNICATION; POWER	Movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP) and sensorimotor oscillatory electroencephalographic (EEG) activity (event-related desynchronization/synchronization-ERD/ERS) provide complementary information of the associated motor activity. The aim of this study was to provide comparative spatio-temporal analysis of both EEG phenomena associated with palmar grasping motions including hand opening and closing phases. Nine healthy participants were instructed to perform self-paced, right hand grasping movements. EEG was recorded from 28 sites synchronous with electromyography (EMG) of wrist/fingers extensors and flexors. Statistical analysis of the EEG data revealed significant differences (p < .05) between the idle state (baseline) and motor preparation/execution periods in majority of recorded channels. The earliest statistical significance in MRCPs was observed for channel FC3 at -460.9 ms, while the earliest significant ERD was observed at 164.1 ms for channel C3. MRCP and ERD/ERS topographies in our study are in line with the results of previous studies comparing MRCP and ERD/ERS spatio-temporal patterns during upper limb movements, however, results of our study show that MRCP significant differences compared to the baseline appear in most channels earlier than ERD (on average 613.6 +/- 191.5 ms earlier). This implies an advantage of MRCP signals for grasping movements' prediction, which is in contrast to previous reports. Moreover, combined spatio-temporal information on MRCP and ERD/ERS presented in this paper may serve for future optimization of grasp movement prediction/detection hybrid algorithms in the context of restorative brain-computer interface technology.

Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis has been an important tool in neuroscience with applications in neuroscience, neural engineering (e.g. Brain-computer interfaces, BCI's), and even commercial applications. Many of the analytical tools used in EEG studies have used machine learning to uncover relevant information for neural classification and neuroimaging. Recently, the availability of large EEG data sets and advances in machine learning have both led to the deployment of deep learning architectures, especially in the analysis of EEG signals and in understanding the information it may contain for brain functionality. The robust automatic classification of these signals is an important step towards making the use of EEG more practical in many applications and less reliant on trained professionals. Towards this goal, a systematic review of the literature on deep learning applications to EEG classification was performed to address the following critical questions: (1) Which EEG classification tasks have been explored with deep learning? (2) What input formulations have been used for training the deep networks? (3) Are there specific deep learning network structures suitable for specific types of tasks? Approach. A systematic literature review of EEG classification using deep learning was performed on Web of Science and PubMed databases, resulting in 90 identified studies. Those studies were analyzed based on type of task, EEG preprocessing methods, input type, and deep learning architecture. Main results. For EEG classification tasks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, deep belief networks outperform stacked auto-encoders and multi-layer perceptron neural networks in classification accuracy. The tasks that used deep learning fell into five general groups: emotion recognition, motor imagery, mental workload, seizure detection, event related potential detection, and sleep scoring. For each type of task, we describe the specific input formulation, major characteristics, and end classifier recommendations found through this review. Significance. This review summarizes the current practices and performance outcomes in the use of deep learning for EEG classification. Practical suggestions on the selection of many hyperparameters are provided in the hope that they will promote or guide the deployment of deep learning to EEG datasets in future research.

It would be of great clinical value to identify objective markers for these diseases based on behavioral or neurological manifestations. Deficient response inhibition has been reported in both SCH and OCD; however, it is unclear if common or distinct neural abnormalities underlie this impairment. Methods: To address this question, we compared Stop signal task performance and associated event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related oscillation (ERO) among 24 SCH patients, 25 OCD patients, and 27 healthy controls (HCs). Results: In successful Stop trials, both SCH and OCD patients showed prolonged Stop signal response time, reduced ERP-P3 component amplitude, and weaker theta-band synchronization compared to HCs, while there were no significant differences between patient groups. In unsuccessful Stop trials, however, SCH patients demonstrated significantly lower P3 amplitudes and weaker theta-band activity than OCD patients. In addition, Stop accuracy rate in SCH patients was negatively correlated with Positive subscale score of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Conclusions: These results provide evidence that impaired response inhibition in SCH and OCD arises from common underlying neural processing abnormalities. However, the lower P3 amplitude and weaker theta-band activity in SCH patients in unsuccessful Stop trials suggest distinct neural activity patterns related to error processing. These differences in ERPs and ERO may provide clues to unique neurological abnormalities in SCH and provide objective measures for differential diagnosis.

Distinct Neural Processes for Memorizing Form and Meaning Within Sentences	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						sentence repetition; language production; working memory; syntax; semantics; ERP; slow wave; mental rehearsal	VERBAL WORKING-MEMORY; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; LANGUAGE PRODUCTION; LONG-TERM; SERIAL-RECALL; STRATEGY USE; WORD-LENGTH; EEG; POTENTIALS; ACTIVATION	In order to memorize sentences we use both processes of language comprehension during encoding and processes of language production during maintenance. While the former processes are easily testable via controlled presentation of the input, the latter are more difficult to assess directly as language production is typically initiated and controlled internally. In the present event-related potential (ERP) study we track subvocal rehearsal of sentences, with the goal of studying the concomitant planning processes with the help of a silent cued-production task. Native German participants read different types of sentences word-by-word, then were prompted by a visual cue to silently repeat each individual word, in a rehearsal phase. In order to assess both local and global effects of sentence planning, we presented correct sentences, syntactically or semantically violated sentences, or random word order sequences. Semantic violations during reading elicited an N400 effect at the noun violating the selectional restrictions of the preceding verb. Syntactic violations, induced by a gender incongruency between determiner and noun, led to a P600 effect at the same position. Different ERP patterns occurred during the silent production phase. Here, semantically violated sentences elicited an early fronto-central negativity at the verb, while syntactically violated sentences elicited a late right-frontal positivity at the determiner. Random word order was accompanied by long-lasting slow waves during the production phase. The findings are consistent with models of hierarchical sentence planning and further indicate that the ongoing working memory processes are qualitatively distinct from comprehension mechanisms and neurophysiologically specific for syntactic and lexical-semantic level planning. In conclusion, active working memory maintenance of sentences is likely to comprise specific stages of sentence production that are indicated by ERP correlates of syntactic and semantic planning at the phrasal and clausal level respectively.

Using linear mixed models on single trials we showed that humorous target words elicited a larger Left Anterior Negativity (LAN), sustained in time and followed by a positive shift involving P600 and Late Positive Complex (LPC) components. In the time-frequency domain, humor was associated with a power decrease in the beta-band of the EEG. Furthermore, participants' Autism-spectrum Quotient correlated with the size of the LAN, suggesting that social skills may affect humor comprehension during the early processing phase. Our results describe a sequence of events where incongruity detection (associated with the LAN) precedes a composite set of mechanisms serving resolution and acting in parallel: the sustained LAN might reflect the search for an alternative script, while the P600 might index inferential processes arriving at the resolution and the updating of the discourse model. The processing differences associated with the LPC and the changes in beta power may reflect a later stage of more elaborative and reflective processing (where the receiver reflects upon the joke's solution) and the abandonment of the current discourse model.

ERP evidence for immediate use of common ground during online reference resolution	COGNITION			English	Article						Language comprehension; Perspective taking; Common ground; Referential ambiguity; Visual world; Nref effect	PERSPECTIVE-TAKING; EYE-MOVEMENTS; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; MUTUAL KNOWLEDGE; TIME-COURSE; DISCOURSE; EEG; AMBIGUITY; TRACKING; DOMAINS	Recent evidence on the time-course of conversational perspective taking is mixed. Some results suggest that listeners rapidly incorporate an interlocutor's knowledge during comprehension, while other findings suggest that listeners initially interpret language egocentrically. A key finding in support of the egocentric view comes from visual-world eye-tracking studies listeners systematically look at potential referents that are known to them but unknown to the speaker. An alternative explanation is that eye movements might be driven by attentional processes that are unrelated to referent identification. To address this question, we assessed the time course of perspective taking using event-related potentials (ERP). Participants were instructed to select a referent from a display of four animals (e.g., "Click on the brontosaurus with the boots") by a speaker who could only see three of the animals. A competitor (e.g., a brontosaurus with a purse) was either mutually visible, visible only to the listener, or absent from the display. Results showed that only the mutually visible competitor elicited an ERP signature of referential ambiguity. Critically, ERPs exhibited no evidence of referential confusion when the listener had privileged access to the competitor. Contra the egocentric hypothesis, this pattern of results indicates that listeners did not consider privileged competitors to be candidates for reference. These findings are consistent with theories of language processing that allow socio-pragmatic information to rapidly influence online language comprehension. The results also suggest that eye-tracking evidence in studies of online reference resolution may include distraction effects driven by privileged competitors and highlight the importance of using multiple measures to investigate perspective use.

The merit of such a correction scheme has been demonstrated in both active (e.g. motor imagery) and reactive (e.g. P300) BCIs. Here, we investigated the effect of ErrP-guided error correction in a three-class, active BCI based on cognitive rather than motor imagery tasks using electroencephalography (EEG). Ten able-bodied adults participated in three sessions of data collection. For each participant, a ternary BCI differentiated among idle state and two personally selected cognitive tasks (e.g. mental arithmetic, counting, word generation, and figure rotation). Real-time feedback of the BCI decision was displayed to the participant following each task. EEG data after feedback onset were used to detect ErrPs and correct the BCI's output in the case of detected errors. ErrP-based error correction modestly but significantly improved the average online task classification accuracy (+7%) as well as the information transfer rate (+0.9 bits/min) of the ternary BCI across participants. Our findings support further study of ErrPs in active BCIs based on cognitive tasks.

Differing rates of hemispheric maturation could be linked to the proposed functional specialization of the hemispheres in which the left auditory cortex engages in analysis of precise timing information whereas the right auditory cortex focuses on analysis of sound frequency. Here the auditory change detection process for rapidly presented tone-pairs was examined in a longitudinal sample of infants at the age of 6 and 12 months using EEG. The ERP response related to change detection of a frequency contrast, its estimated source strength in the auditory areas, as well as time-frequency indices showed developmental effects. ERP amplitudes, source strength, spectral power and inter-trial phase locking decreased across age. A differential lateralization pattern emerged between 6 and 12 months as shown by inter-trial phase locking at 2-3 Hz; specifically, a larger developmental change was observed in the right as compared to the left hemisphere. Predictive relationships for the change in source strength from 6 months to 12 months were found. Six-month predictors were source strength and phase locking values at low frequencies. The results show that the infant change detection response in rapidly presented tone pairs is mainly determined by low frequency power and phase-locking with a larger phase-locking response at 6 months predicting greater change at 12 months. The ability of the auditory system to respond systematically across stimuli is suggested as a marker of maturational change that leads to more automatic and fine-tuned cortical responses.

Faces, voices and bimodal emotionally congruent or incongruent face-voice pairs were randomly presented. The EEG was recorded while participants were instructed to detect sad emotional expressions in either faces or voices while ignoring all stimuli with another emotional expression and sad stimuli of the task irrelevant modality. Participants processed congruent sad face-voice pairs more efficiently than sad stimuli paired with an incongruent emotion and performance was higher in congruent bimodal compared to unimodal trials, irrespective of which modality was task-relevant. Event-related potentials (ERPs) to congruent emotional face-voice pairs started to differ from ERPs to incongruent emotional face-voice pairs at 180 ms after stimulus onset: Irrespectively of which modality was task-relevant, ERPs revealed a more pronounced positivity (180 ms post-stimulus) to emotionally congruent trials compared to emotionally incongruent trials if the angry emotion was presented in the attended modality. A larger negativity to incongruent compared to congruent trials was observed in the time range of 400-550 ms (N400) for all emotions (happy, neutral, angry), irrespectively of whether faces or voices were task relevant. These results suggest an automatic interaction of emotion related information.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven successful as function approximators and have therefore been used for classification problems including electroencephalography (EEG) signal decoding for brain-computer interfaces (BCI). Artificial neural networks, however, are considered black boxes, because they usually have thousands of parameters, making interpretation of their internal processes challenging. Here we systematically evaluate the use of CNNs for EEG signal decoding and investigate a method for visualizing the CNN model decision process. Approach. We developed a CNN model to decode the covert focus of attention from EEG event-related potentials during object selection. We compared the CNN and the commonly used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier performance, applied to datasets with different dimensionality, and analyzed transfer learning capacity. Moreover, we validated the impact of single model components by systematically altering the model. Furthermore, we investigated the use of saliency maps as a tool for visualizing the spatial and temporal features driving the model output. Main results. The CNN model and the LDA classifier achieved comparable accuracy on the lower-dimensional dataset, but CNN exceeded LDA performance significantly on the higher-dimensional dataset (without hypothesis-driven preprocessing), achieving an average decoding accuracy of 90.7% (chance level = 8.3%). Parallel convolutions, tanh or ELU activation functions, and dropout regularization proved valuable for model performance, whereas the sequential convolutions, ReLU activation function, and batch normalization components reduced accuracy or yielded no significant difference. Saliency maps revealed meaningful features, displaying the typical spatial distribution and latency of the P300 component expected during this task. Significance. Following systematic evaluation, we provide recommendations for when and how to use CNN models in EEG decoding. Moreover, we propose a new approach for investigating the neural correlates of a cognitive task by training CNN models on raw high-dimensional EEG data and utilizing saliency maps for relevant feature extraction.

However, biomarker discovery through data fusion is challenging since it requires extracting interpretable and reproducible patterns from data sets, consisting of shared/unshared patterns and of different orders. For example, multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) signals from multiple subjects can be represented as a third-order tensor with modes: subject, time, and channel, while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data may be in the form of subject by voxel matrices. Traditional data fusion methods rearrange higher-order tensors, such as EEG, as matrices to use matrix factorization-based approaches. In contrast, fusion methods based on coupled matrix and tensor factorizations (CMTF) exploit the potential multi-way structure of higher-order tensors. The CMTF approach has been shown to capture underlying patterns more accurately without imposing strong constraints on the latent neural patterns, i.e., biomarkers. In this paper, EEG, fMRI, and structural MRI (sMRI) data collected during an auditory oddball task (AOD) from a group of subjects consisting of patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls, are arranged as matrices and higher-order tensors coupled along the subject mode, and jointly analyzed using structure-revealing CMTF methods [also known as advanced CMTF (ACMTF)] focusing on unique identification of underlying patterns in the presence of shared/unshared patterns. We demonstrate that joint analysis of the EEG tensor and fMRI matrix using ACMTF reveals significant and biologically meaningful components in terms of differentiating between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls while also providing spatial patterns with high resolution and improving the clustering performance compared to the analysis of only the EEG tensor. We also show that these patterns are reproducible, and study reproducibility for different model parameters. In comparison to the joint independent component analysis (jICA) data fusion approach, ACMTF provides easier interpretation of EEG data by revealing a single summary map of the topography for each component. Furthermore, fusion of sMRI data with EEG and fMRI through an ACMTF model provides structural patterns; however, we also show that when fusing data sets from multiple modalities, hence of very different nature, preprocessing plays a crucial role.

Mild Effect of Nalmefene on Alcoholic Cue-Induced Response Invigoration in Alcohol Use Disorder Without Accompanying Changes in Electrophysiological Signatures of Early Visual Processing and Executive Control	FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						nalmefene; alcohol use disorder; response inhibition; incentive salience; event-related potentials; Go/NoGo task	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DOPAMINE RELEASE; ERP COMPONENTS; FRONTAL-LOBE; DEPENDENCE; ADDICTION; STIMULI; CORTEX; ABUSE; TASK	Nalmefene is approved for as-needed pharmacological treatment in alcohol use disorder (AUD) by the European Medicines Agency. While the cellular effects of nalmefene have been thoroughly investigated, data are very limited on how this agent influences neural signals associated with inhibitory control and the visual analysis of environmental cues. This double-blind crossover study assessed the behavioral and neural effects of acute nalmefene administration in patients diagnosed with AUD. In experiment 1, we validated our experimental paradigm (electroencephalography combined with a modified Go/NoGo task using images of alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks as prime stimuli) in 20 healthy adults to ensure that our protocol is suitable for assessing the behavioral and neural aspects of executive control. In experiment 2, we recruited 19 patients with AUD, and in a double-blind crossover design, we investigated the effects of nalmefene versus placebo on task performance (response accuracy, the sensitivity index, and reaction times), visual responses to appetitive cues (occipital P1, N1, and P2 components), and electrophysiological markers of conflict detection and response inhibition (frontal N2 and P3 waveforms). Under placebo, patients produced faster reaction times to alcohol-primed Go stimuli, an effect that was weak despite being statistically significant. However, the effect of alcoholic cues on the speed of response initiation disappeared after receiving nalmefene. We found no placebo versus nalmefene difference regarding our patients' ability to accurately inhibit responses to NoGo stimuli or for occipital and frontal event-related potentials. Our results suggest that nalmefene might be potent in reducing the vigor to act upon alcoholic cues in AUD patients, but this effect is most probably mediated via subcortical (rather than cortical) neural circuits.

Patients with schizophrenia often display a reduction of mismatch negativity (MMN), which is a stimulus-change specific event-related brain potential. Do the EGF model animals also exhibit the MMN reduction as schizophrenic patients do? This study addressed this question to verify the pathophysiological validity of this model. Neonatal rats received repeated administration of EGF or saline and were grown until adulthood. Employing the odd-ball paradigm of distinct tone pitches, tone-evoked electroencephalogram (EEG) components were recorded from electrodes on the auditory and frontal cortices of awake rats, referencing an electrode on the frontal sinus. The amplitude of the MMN-like potential was significantly reduced in EGF-treated rats compared with saline-injected control rats. The wavelet analysis of the EEG during a near period of tone stimulation revealed that synchronization of EEG activity, especially with beta and gamma bands, was reduced in EGF-treated rats. Results suggest that animals exposed to EGF during a perinatal period serve as a promising neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia.

Recent reports suggest that attention modulates the shared processing of music and language, but the time-course of the effects of attention on music and language syntax processing are yet unclear. In this EEG study we vary top-down attention to language and music, while manipulating the syntactic structure of simultaneously presented musical chord progressions and garden-path sentences in a modified rapid serial visual presentation paradigm. The Early Right Anterior Negativity (ERAN) was observed in response to both attended and unattended musical syntax violations. In contrast, an N400 was only observed in response to attended linguistic syntax violations, and a P3/P600 only in response to attended musical syntax violations. Results suggest that early processing of musical syntax, as indexed by the ERAN, is relatively automatic; however, top-down allocation of attention changes the processing of syntax in both music and language at later stages of cognitive processing.

Neuropsychologists report that up to 40% of individuals undergoing evaluations for TBI may be malingering neurocognitive deficits for a compensatory reward. The memory recognition test of malingering detection is effective but can be coached behaviorally. There is great need to develop a novel neural based method for discriminating fake from true brain injury. Here we test the hypothesis that decision making of faking memory deficits prolongs frontal neural responses. We applied an advanced method measuring decision latency in milliseconds for discriminating true TBI from malingerers who fake brain injury. To test this hypothesis, latencies of memory-related brain potentials were compared among true patients with moderate or severe TBI, and healthy age-matched individuals who were assigned either to be honest or faking memory deficit. Scalp signals of electroencephalography (EEG) were recorded with a 32-channel cap during an Old/New memory recognition task in three age- and education-matched groups: honest (n = 12), malingering (n = 15), and brain injured (n = 14) individuals. Bilateral fractional latencies of late positive ERP at frontal sites were compared among the three groups under both studied (Old) and non-studied (New) memory recognition conditions. Results show a significant difference between the fractional latencies of the late positive component during recognition of studied items in malingerers (averaged latencies = 396 ms) and the true brain injured subjects (mean = 312 ms) in the frontal sites. Only malingers showed asymmetrical frontal activity compared to the two other groups. These new findings support the hypothesis that that additional frontal processing of malingering individuals is measurably different from those of actual patients with brain injury. In contrast to our previous reported method using difference waves of amplitudes at frontal to posterior midline sites during new items recognition (Vagnini et al., 2008), there was no significant latency difference among groups during recognition of New items. The current method using delayed left frontal neural responses during studied items reached sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 79% in detecting malingers from true brain injury.

Often, numerical stimuli are used to examine switching between task rules. Based upon functional neuroanatomical considerations we hypothesize that the ability to efficiently perform task switching varies depending on the cognitive operations performed with these numerical stimuli during task switching (magnitude vs parity judgments). We use a system-neurophysiological approach combining EEG and event-related potential (ERP) recordings with temporal data decomposition and source localization methods. We show that task switching processes are more demanding during parity judgments, compared to magnitude judgments. This, however, was only the case when task switching processes were triggered by external sensory stimuli, but not when memory-based processes had to be used during task switching. After accounting for intra-individual variability in the EEG data, the neurophysiological data showed that these effects were due to very specific subprocesses reflecting processes to update task sets and stimulus-response mappings during task switching. Source reconstructions show that left inferior and superior parietal areas (BA40 and BA7) were associated with these processes. The data show how different numerical operations differentially affect cognitive flexibility processes. Especially parity judgments exacerbate processes to update and reconfigure task sets during task switching in parietal areas. These findings are a valuable contribution to further reflections on the theories developed to date in task switching. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Chemosensory Event-Related Potentials in Response to Nasal Propylene Glycol Stimulation	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						olfaction; EEG; chemosensory response; trigeminus; olfactometer; propylene glycol; 1.2 propanediol	INTRANASAL TRIGEMINAL FUNCTION; CEREBRAL ACTIVATION; RECOGNITION MEMORY; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; CARBON-DIOXIDE; BRAIN; PATTERN; INTEGRATION; DYNAMICS; REFLEX	Propylene glycol, also denoted as 1.2 propanediol (C3H8O2), often serves as a solvent for dilution of olfactory stimuli. It is supposed to serve as a neutral substance and has been used in many behavioral and electrophysiological studies to dilute pure olfactory stimuli. However, the effect of propylene glycol on perception and on neuronal responses has hitherto never been studied. In this study we tested by means of a threshold test, whether a nasal propylene glycol stimulation is recognizable by humans. Participants were able to recognize propylene glycol at a threshold of 42% concentration and reported a slight cooling effect. In addition to the threshold test, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) during nasal propylene glycol stimulation to study the neuronal processing of the stimulus. We used a flow olfactometer and stimulated 15 volunteers with three different concentrations of propylene glycol (40 trials each) and water as a control condition (40 trials). To evaluate the neuronal response, we analyzed the event-related potentials (ERPs) and power modulations. The task of the volunteers was to identify a change (olfactory, thermal, or tactile) in the continuous air flow generated by the flow olfactometer. The analysis of the ERPs showed that propylene glycol generates a clear P2 component, which was also visible in the frequency domain as an evoked power response in the theta-band. The source analysis of the P2 revealed a widespread involvement of brain regions, including the postcentral gyrus, the insula and adjacent operculum, the thalamus, and the cerebellum. Thus, it is possible that trigeminal stimulation can at least partly account for sensations and brain responses elicited by propylene glycol. Based on these results, we conclude that the use of high propylene glycol concentrations to dilute fragrances complicates the interpretation of presumed purely olfactory effects.

The hypothesis was that dream recall will produce an increased activation of fronto-limbic areas during an emotional task. Thirty-seven women were recruited and randomly assigned to two groups. Both groups were exposed to a visual task with emotional images (positive vs. negative) presented in two stages (T0 and T1). Between T0 and T1, in the experimental group, women were asked to recall and report a dream; whereas, in the control group, they were asked to report their work experiences. Electroencephalography data were continuously recorded in each participant, except during the personal report session. Event-related potential analyses showed an interaction effect of Time (T0 vs. T1) x Condition (positive vs. negative) x Group (experimental vs. control) in temporo-parietal montage at P100; and Condition x Hemisphere x Group in frontal montage from 200 to 1,000 ms. Standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography results showed an increased activation of the fronto-limbic areas and a decreased activation of the anterior middle frontal gyrus and temporo-parietal junction at T1 compared with T0 in the experimental group. Conversely, in the control group, a decreased activation in limbic areas was found. Dream recall was associated with an increased intensity of the limbic and temporal circuits during emotional exposition, suggesting that dream recall seems to favor an emotional response.

Age differences in electrocortical reactivity to fearful faces following aversive conditioning in youth	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Attention bias; Conditioning; Children; Event-related potential; Development; Late positive potential	ATTENTIONAL BIASES; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; CHILDRENS DEPRESSION; PUPILLARY REACTIVITY; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EMOTIONAL FACES; BRAIN DYNAMICS; THREAT; ANXIETY; RISK	Although biases in the processing of affectively salient stimuli are thought to increase risk for psychopathology across the lifespan, questions remain regarding how these biases develop. The current study tested an aversive conditioning model for the development of children's sensitivity in detecting fearful faces at varying levels of emotional intensity and their facilitated attention to fearful faces assessed via the late positive potential (LPP) event-related potential component. Participants (N = 144, ages 7-11 years) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: an active training condition in which an 85-dB white noise burst was paired with fearful faces, an active control condition in which the white noise was presented randomly throughout the task, and a no-sound condition. Children completed a separate task in which they viewed happy, sad, and fearful child faces at varying levels of emotional intensity while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Although there were no conditioning group differences in children's sensitivity in detecting facial displays of emotion, there were group differences in LPP magnitude that were moderated by children's age. Among younger children, those in the active conditioning group exhibited smaller LPP amplitudes to high-intensity fearful faces than children in the control groups. However, among older youth, those in the active conditioning group exhibited larger LPP amplitudes to high-intensity fearful faces than children in the	[Burkhouse, Katie L.] Univ Illinois, Dept Psychiat, Chicago, IL 60608 USA; [Owens, Max] Univ S Florida, Dept Psychol, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [James, Kiera; Gibb, Brandon E.] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Psychol, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA		Burkhouse, KL (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Psychiat, Chicago, IL 60608 USA.	kburkho@uic.edu	Owens, Max/AFL-5804-2022; Gibb, Brandon E/ABE-7440-2021; Burkhouse, Katie/GOK-0301-2022	Owens, Max/0000-0002-6914-1851	National Institute of Mental Health [MH113793, MH098060-02]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH [K23MH113793] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER	National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))	This work was supported by a National Institute of Mental Health grant (MH098060-02) awarded to B.

Finding the P3 in the P600: Decoding shared neural mechanisms of responses to syntactic violations and oddball targets	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						ERP; Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA); Language; Syntax; P3; P600; Domain specificity	BRAIN POTENTIALS; FACE PERCEPTION; POSITIVE SHIFT; LANGUAGE; SPECIFICITY; TUTORIAL; DYNAMICS; LATENCY; REVEAL; MEMORY	The P600 Event-Related Brain Potential, elicited by syntactic violations in sentences, is generally interpreted as indicating language-specific structural/combinatorial processing, with far-reaching implications for models of language. P600 effects are also often taken as evidence for language-like grammars in non-linguistic domains like music or arithmetic. An alternative account, however, interprets the P600 as a P3, a domain-general brain response to salience. Using time-generalized multivariate pattern analysis, we demonstrate that P3 EEG patterns, elicited in a visual Oddball experiment, account for the P600 effect elicited in a syntactic violation experiment P3 pattern-trained MVPA can classify P600 trials just as well as P600-trained ones. A second study replicates and generalizes this finding, and demonstrates its specificity by comparing it to face- and semantic mismatch-associated EEG responses. These results indicate that P3 and P600 share neural patterns to a substantial degree, calling into question the interpretation of P600 as a language-specific brain response and instead strengthening its association with the P3. More generally, our data indicate that observing P600-like brain responses provides no direct evidence for the presence of language-like grammars, in language or elsewhere.

Distraction by salient objects can be reduced by suppressing the location where they are likely to appear. The question we addressed here was whether suppression of frequent distractor locations is already implemented beforehand, in anticipation of the stimulus. Using EEG, we recorded cortical activity of human participants searching for a target while ignoring a salient distractor. The distractor was presented more often at one location than at any other location. We found reduced capture for distractors at frequent locations, indicating that participants learned to avoid distraction. Critically, we found evidence for "proactive suppression" as already "prior to display onset," there was enhanced power in parieto-occipital alpha oscillations contralateral to the frequent distractor location-a signal known to occur in anticipation of irrelevant information. Locked to display onset, ERP analysis showed a distractor suppression-related distractor positivity (P-D) component for this location. Importantly, this P-D was found regardless of whether distracting information was presented at the frequent location. In addition, there was an early P-D component representing an early attentional index of the frequent distractor location. Our results show anticipatory (proactive) suppression of frequent distractor locations in visual search already starting prior to display onset.

However, they do not transmit the acoustic signal with sufficient fidelity, leading to difficulties in recognizing emotions in voice and in music. The study aimed to explore the neurophysiological bases of these limitations. Design: Twenty-two adults (18 to 70 years old) with CIs and 22 age-matched controls with normal hearing participated. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in response to emotional bursts (happy, sad, or neutral) produced in each modality (voice or music) that were for the most part correctly identified behaviorally. Results: Compared to controls, the N1 and P2 components were attenuated and prolonged in CI users. To a smaller degree, N1 and P2 were also attenuated and prolonged in music compared to voice, in both populations. The N1-P2 complex was emotion-dependent (e.g., reduced and prolonged response to sadness), but this was also true in both populations. In contrast, the later portion of the response, between 600 and 850 ms, differentiated happy and sad from neutral stimuli in normal hearing but not in CI listeners. Conclusions: The early portion of the ERP waveform reflected primarily the general reduction in sensory encoding by CI users (largely due to CI processing itself), whereas altered emotional processing (by CI users) could be found in the later portion of the ERP and extended beyond the realm of speech.

In the context of sequential cognitive flexibility, the "backward inhibition (BI) effect" has been studied quite extensively. Here we ask whether there are age-related differences between adolescents and adults to overcome BI and what system-neurophysiological mechanisms underlie these modulations. This was examined using a system neurophysiological study procedure combining event-related potentials data with source localization and EEG signal decomposition methods. We show that sequential cognitive flexibility, and the ability overcome backward inhibition, is inferior in adolescents compared with adults. Accounting for intra-individual variability in the neurophysiological data, this data suggest that two partly inter-related processes underlie the differences between adolescents than adults to overcome backward inhibition: One process refers to the suppression of the inhibitory effect of the n-1 trial on the n-2 trial during perceptual categorization of incoming information that is associated with right inferior frontal regions.

M/EEG analysis of naturalistic stories: a review from speech to language processing	LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						M/EEG; language; speech; naturalistic stimuli; auditory perception	SELECTIVE AUDITORY ATTENTION; REGRESSION-BASED ESTIMATION; TEMPORAL RECEPTIVE WINDOWS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BASE-LINE CORRECTION; HIGH-PASS FILTERS; NEURAL RESPONSES; INCORRECT CONCLUSIONS; CORTICAL ENTRAINMENT; BRAIN POTENTIALS	M/EEG research using naturally spoken stories as stimuli has focused largely on speech and not language processing. The temporal resolution of M/EEG is a two-edged sword, allowing for the study of the fine acoustic structure of speech, yet easily overwhelmed by the temporal noise of variation in constituent length. Recent theories on the neural encoding of linguistic structure require the temporal resolution of M/EEG, yet suffer from confounds when studied on traditional, heavily controlled stimuli. Recent methodological advances allow for synthesising naturalistic designs and traditional, controlled designs into effective M/EEG research on naturalistic language. In this review, we highlight common threads throughout the at-times distinct research traditions of speech and language processing. We conclude by examining the tradeoffs and successes of three M/EEG studies on fully naturalistic language paradigms and the future directions they suggest.

The guiding working model which was pragmatically selected for investigation was the established and widely used Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) modeling architecture from cognitive science. The anatomo-functional circuitry covered by ACT-R is validated by MRI-based neuroscience research. The present experimental data was obtained from a cognitive neuropsychology study involving preschool children (aged 4-6), which measured their visual selective attention and word comprehension behaviors. The collection and analysis of Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) from the EEG data allowed for the identification of sources of electrical activity known as dipoles within the cortex, using a combination of computational tools (Independent Component Analysis, FASTICA; EEG-Lab DIPFIT). The results were then used to build neurocognitive models based on Python ACT-R such that the patterns and the timings of the measured EEG could be reproduced as simplified symbolic representations of spikes, built through simplified electric-field simulations. The models simulated ultimately accounted for more than three-quarters of variations spatially and temporally in all electrical potential measurements (fit of model to dipole data expressed as R-2 ranged between 0.75 and 0.98; P < 0.0001). Implications for practical uses of the present work are discussed for learning and educational applications in non-clinical and special needs children's populations, and for the possible use of non-experts (teachers and parents).

Multimodal exploration of non-motor neural functions in ALS patients using simultaneous EEG-fNIRS recording	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); non-motor dysfunction; electroencephalogram (EEG); functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS); multimodal frameworks	AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; HEMODYNAMIC ACTIVITY; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; IMPAIRMENT; COMMUNICATION; POTENTIALS; PATTERNS; SCALE; STATE; P300	Objective. Despite the high prevalence of non-motor impairments reported in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), little is known about the functional neural markers underlying such dysfunctions. In this study, a new dual-task multimodal framework relying on simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) recordings was developed to characterize integrative non-motor neural functions in people with ALS. Approach. Simultaneous EEG-fNIRS data were recorded from six subjects with ALS and twelve healthy controls. Through a proposed visuo-mental paradigm, subjects performed a set of visuo-mental arithmetic operations. The data recorded were analyzed with respect to event-related changes both in the time and frequency domains for EEG and de/oxygen-hemoglobin level (HbR/HbO) changes for fNIRS. The correlation of EEG spectral features with fNIRS HbO/HbR features were then evaluated to assess the mechanisms of ALS on the electrical (EEG)-vascular (fNIRS) interrelationships. Main results. We observed overall smaller increases in EEG delta and theta power, decreases in beta power, reductions in HbO responses, and distortions both in early and later EEG event-related potentials in ALS subjects compared to healthy controls. While significant correlations between EEG features and HbO responses were observed in healthy controls, these patterns were absent in ALS patients. Distortions in both electrical and hemodynamic responses are speculated to be associated with cognitive deficits in ALS that center primarily on attentional and working memory processing. Significance. Our results highlight the important role of ALS non-motor dysfunctions in electrical and hemodynamic neural dynamics as well as their interrelationships. The insights obtained through this study can enhance our understanding of the underlying non-motor neural processes in ALS and enrich future diagnostic and prognostic techniques.	[Borgheai, S.

A rather new emerging concept of this syndrome suggests that it is a disorder of purposeful actions, in which sensory processes and their relation to motor responses (actions) play a particularly important role. Thus, this syndrome might be conceived as a condition of altered 'perception-action binding'. In the current study, we test this novel concept in the context of inhibitory control. Methods We examined N = 35 adolescent GTS patients and N = 39 healthy controls in a Go/Nogo-task manipulating the complexity of sensory information triggering identical actions; i.e. to inhibit a motor response. This was combined with event-related potential recordings, EEG data decomposition and source localization. Results GTS patients showed worse performance compared to controls and larger performance differences when inhibitory control had to be exerted using unimodal visual compared to bimodal auditory-visual stimuli. This suggests increased binding between bimodal stimuli and responses leading to increased costs of switching between responses instructed by bimodal and those instructed by unimodal stimuli. The neurophysiological data showed that this was related to mechanisms mediating between stimulus evaluation and response selection; i.e. perception-action binding processes in the right inferior parietal cortex (BA40). Conclusions Stimulus-action inhibition binding is stronger in GTS patients than healthy controls and affects inhibitory control corroborating the concept suggesting that GTS might be a condition of altered perception-action integration (binding); i.e. a disorder of purposeful actions.

Measuring brand association strength with EEG: A single-trial N400 ERP study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SEMANTIC MEMORY; COMPONENT; REFLECT; WORDS	Companies need to ensure that customers perceive their brands as intended, with strong and unique associations, when facing a competitive market. Traditionally, brand associations are measured using conventional techniques such as surveys and questionnaires albeit both conscious and unconscious factors can influence the collected data and the outcome of a campaign. Neuromarketing can shed light on how the customer's brain processes marketing stimuli. We report here on an EEG study aimed at gauging mental associations with brands. We focus on the N400 event-related potential, an EEG component most strongly elicited in response to a concept unrelated to a preceding concept. We considered two video on demand brands, Netflix and Rex& Rio, and selected a set of words grouped in 4 categories that were either related (Television, Relaxation, and Price), in varying degrees, or unrelated (Unrelated) to the said brands. The experiment started with both brands' TV commercials, as a common reference for our participants. We then applied a semantic priming paradigm in which a brand logo ("prime") was followed by a word ("target"), and the strength of the N400 response to the word used as an inverted measure of the association strength with the brand logo. We clustered N400 responses to identify, for each brand, natural groups of associated words. As a result, for Netflix the cluster with the smallest N400 responses (i.e., strongest associations) consisted of words related to Television but for Rex& Rio it consisted of words related to Relaxation. We also evaluated the relationship between the two brands and determined which associations they share or which ones not. It turned out that associations related to Relaxation and Television distinguish the two brands. Interestingly, survey data did not show any difference between the two brands as they were equally associated with Television and Relaxation. These findings show that our N400 technique can reveal brand associations, and natural categories thereof, that would otherwise go unnoticed when using conventional surveys.

Mental processing comparison between past and future employing a novel EEG analysis based on radiated EM field estimation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Inverse problem; Magnetic multiple dipole model; Delta waves; EEG; ERP; Mental processing	MEMORY; NUMBER; SKULL	Background: The inverse problem solution in the field of ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG) analysis has been addressed in the scientific literature for many decades, utilizing either mathematical techniques for measurement fitting or pure ElectroMagnetic (EM) methods involving complex head models for the prediction of the near field. New method: A novel radiated EM field estimation analysis scheme is proposed for EEG analysis, based on the determination of a grid of equivalent distributed EM sources with equal magnetic moments, in order to compute the extrapolated far field. A Pattern Search approach is adopted to minimize the Mean Absolute Relative Error between the EM near field created by the source grid and the EM field extracted by the measurements. Results: The application of the method on a subject's brain activity recordings in the context of "Protagoras" mental-auditory experiment demonstrates the capability of the proposed scheme to compare the subject's concentration differences between the limit of present and past versus the limit of present and future. Comparison with existing methods: The proposed method combines features from different existing methods, both in terms of mathematical and EM theory techniques, in order to extend their capabilities and transform the conventional analysis of EEG recordings to a far field radiation basis. Conclusions: The treatment of the brain as an equivalent far field radiator can be a useful and promising new perspective to the established analysis of EEG recordings arising from brain activity during mental processing.

Effects of the Video-feedback intervention to promote positive parenting and sensitive discipline on mothers' neural responses to child faces: A randomized controlled ERP study including pre- and post-intervention measures	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ERP; N170; RCT; parenting; intervention; face processing	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TIME-COURSE; BRAIN; ATTACHMENT; EMOTION; LPP; REAPPRAISAL; RECOGNITION; PERCEPTION; MODULATION	Parenting interventions have proven to be effective in enhancing positive parenting behavior and child outcomes. However, the neurocognitive mechanisms explaining the efficacy remain largely unknown. We tested effects of the Video-feedback Intervention to promote Positive Parenting and Sensitive Discipline (VIPP-SD) on mothers' neural processing of child faces. Our primary focus was on the N170 and the secondary focus on the LPP. We expected the intervention to enhance the amplitudes of both ERP components in response to emotional compared to neutral faces. A total of 66 mothers visited the lab for two identical sessions separated by 4.28 months (SD = 0.86) during which a random 33% of the mothers received the VIPP-SD. During both pre- and post-intervention sessions, mothers' electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in response to photographs of children's neutral, happy and angry facial expressions were acquired. In contrast to our expectations, we found smaller (less negative) N170 amplitudes at post-test in the intervention group. There was no intervention effect on the LPP, although overall LPP amplitudes were more positive for neutral and angry compared to happy faces. Our study shows that the N170 is affected by the VIPP-SD, suggesting that the intervention promotes efficient, less effortful face processing.

Electrophysiological evidence for the integral nature of tone in Mandarin spoken word recognition	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Mandarin Chinese; Language processing; N400; PMN; Event-related potentials; EEG/ERP	TIME-COURSE; INFORMATION; CONTEXT; CHINESE; MODEL	Current models of spoken word recognition have been predominantly based on studies of Indo-European languages. As a result, less is known about the recognition processes involved in the perception of tonal languages (e.g., Mandarin Chinese), and the role of lexical tone in speech perception. One view is that words in tonal languages are processed phonologically through individual segments, while another view is that they are processed lexically as a whole. Moreover, a recent study claimed to be the first to discover an early phonological processing stage in Mandarin (Huang et al., 2014). There seems to be a lack of investigations concerning tonal languages, as no clear conclusions have been reached about the nature of tonal processes, or a model of spoken word recognition that best incorporates lexical tone. The current study addressed these issues by presenting 18 native Mandarin speakers with aural sentences with medial target words. These either matched or mismatched the preceding visually presented sentences with medial target words (e.g, /jia1/home). Violation conditions involved target words that differed in the following ways: tone violation, where only the tone was different (e.g., /jia4/"price"), onset violation, where only the onset was different (e.g., /xia1/"shrimp"), and syllable violation, where both the tone and the onset were different (e.g., /tang2/"candy"). We did not find evidence for an early phonological processing stage in Mandarin. Instead, our findings indicate that Mandarin syllables are processed incrementally through phonological segments and that tone is strongly associated with lexical access. These results are discussed with respect to modifications for existing models in spoken word recognition to incorporate the processes involved with tonal language recognition.

Such sensory phenotyping is important to screen for genetic or aging effects on vision in preclinical mouse models. Thus, a standardized EEG-like approach for the assessment of sensory evoked potentials in mice is desirable. New method: We describe a method to obtain the topographical distribution of flash evoked VEPs with 32-channel thin-film EEG electrode arrays in anesthetized mice. Further, we provide suggestions for the optimal choice of adequate digital filtering, referencing, and stimulus parameters for fast and reliable assessment of VEP parameters and distribution. Results: 32-channel thin-film electrodes provided clear information on the VEP topography across the skull. Re referencing, such as bipolar, common average, and local average montages could be used to further refine the information on VEP topography. A balanced choice of digital high-pass filter, signal averaging and stimulus rate allowed to minimize measurement duration and at the same time assured good VEP signal-to-noise ratio. Comparison with existing methods: Subdermal electrodes or single skull screws provide only limited topographical information of the VEP. Assessment of VEPs with 32-channel thin-film electrodes can provide comparable signal quality with superior spatial resolution and standardized topographical and hemispheric information of VEP distribution. Conclusions: EEG-like thin-film electrodes are an efficient tool for fast, comprehensive sensory phenotyping with topographical information in mice. This is a step towards the use of standardized mouse EEG to characterize EEG biomarkers in mouse models of human diseases.

Thirty-two university students participated in the experiment. The N1 and P2 components were results that indicated selective attention at an early stage; their amplitudes were proportional to the cognitive loads. The experiment results revealed that the main effect of learning environment was significant. The N1 and P2 components had larger amplitudes and indicated higher cognitive loads in the presentation slides-based environment than in the VR-based environment. The main effect of spatial ability was also significant. The N1 and P2 amplitudes evoked in the high spatial ability (HSA) learners were smaller than those evoked in the low spatial ability (LSA) learners, indicating that the LSA learners possessed fewer cognitive resources and bore relatively high cognitive loads. The interaction effect of learning environment and spatial ability was significant. Larger P2 amplitude was observed in LSA learners in the presentation slides-based environment than in the VR-based environment, implying that VR facilitates the reduction of cognitive loads in LSA learners. The P2 amplitude detected in HSA learners did not show any significant difference in both learning environments, indicating that the VR-based learning environment did not enhance their learning. This result supports the ability-as-compensator hypothesis to a certain extent.

The reduced level of independence and mobility of a person can affect their quality of life. So, with rehabilitation program, it is expected that motor skills and cognitive function of stroke patients can be restored. This study focused on designing an integrated therapeutic device by using stationary cycles with the principle of mirror neurons and equipped with qEEG signal analysis for parameters comparison before and after therapy. Channels EEG used are F3, F4, C3, Cz, C4, P3, Pz, and P4 according to the rules of localization 10-20 Ref. The device also designed as a robotic system controlled by the movement intentions detected from EEG signals before the actual movement occurs. The Event-Related Potential (ERP) phenomenon mu waves were used to recognize the movement intentions. The device has been tested on normal subjects. To train the movement intention algorithm, the subject were asked to cycle and stop at prescribed time by audio command. qEEG parameters were displayed through a monitor for realtime observation by physical therapist. This research is part of the design process of the stroke therapy system which will then be tested in several stroke patients. Therapy programs for post-stroke patients using this device are expected to increase mobility of the affected limb by stroke.

Our objective is to reveal the temporal characteristics of attentional disengagement from emotional facial cues in depression. Methods. - We recruited 22 depressed patients and 22 healthy controls to participate in a cued target-response task with emotional facial expressions (happy, natural, and sad) as cues and three types of cue-target intervals (CTIs: 350 ms, 1000 ms, and 1500 ms). Both behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) data were collected from each subject while performing the task. Then, both behavioral results and event-related potentials (ERPs) were analyzed across groups (depressed patients and normal controls), emotional types of facial cues (happy, natural, and sad), and CTIs. Results. - Both depressed patients and healthy controls had shorter response times in the conditions of CTI = 1000 ms and 1500 ms than in the condition of CTI = 350 ms but had no significant difference in response time between the conditions of CTI =1000 ms and CTI = 1500 ms. The contingent negative variation (CNV), a well-documented ERP marker of cue-induced expectation of the forthcoming target, clearly appeared about 1000 ms following cue onset for normal controls and 1300 ms following cue onset for depressed patients. Statistical analysis by repeated-measures Anova showed that a main group effect exists for the average amplitudes of ERPs at electrode Cz 930 ms after cue onset, while there was no main effect of cue or interaction effect between cue and group. Discussion. - These results suggest that normal controls complete their attentional disengagement from emotional facial expression between 350 ms to 1000 ms after cue offset, while depressed patients complete their attentional disengagement later than that of normal controls but earlier than 1500 ms from the perspective of CNV onset, though the two groups have no significant difference in response time in the conditions of CTI = 1000 ms and CTI = 1500 ms respectively.

The Time Course of Dorsal and Rostral-Ventral Anterior Cingulate Cortex Activity in the Emotional Stroop Experiment Reveals Valence and Arousal Aberrant Modulation in Patients with Schizophrenia	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Emotion-cognition; Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; Rostral-ventral anterior cingulate cortex; Arousal; Valence	PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS; NEGATIVE-SYNDROME-SCALE; NEURAL DIATHESIS; STRESS MODEL; COGNITION; DOPAMINE; CORTISOL; METAANALYSIS; DYSFUNCTION; RESPONSES	This paper aims to investigate the temporal dynamics within the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the rostral-ventral (rv) ACC during the interaction of emotional valence and arousal with cognitive control in patients with Schizophrenia (SZ). Although cognitive deficits in SZ are highly relevant and emotional disturbances are common, the temporal relationship of brain regions involved in the interaction of emotional and cognitive processing in SZ is yet to be determined. To address this issue, the reaction time (RT), event-related potential (ERP) and temporal dynamics of the dACC and rvACC activity were compared between SZ subjects and healthy controls (HC), using a modified emotional Stroop experiment (with factors namely congruence, arousal and valence). EEG was recorded with 64 channels and source localisation was performed using the sLORETA software package. We observed slower initial increase and lower peaks of time course activity within the dACC and rvACC in the SZ group. In this particular group, the dACC activity during late negativity was negatively correlated with a significantly higher RT in the high arousal conflict condition. In contrast to HC subjects, at the N450 window, there was no significant valence (ERP and rvACC ROI) modulation effect in the SZ subjects. Using high density EEG and source localisation, it was possible to distinguish various disturbances within the dACC and rvACC in patients with SZ, during emotion-cognition processing.	[Feroz, F.

Impressions of HIV risk online: Brain potentials while viewing online dating profiles	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Online dating; Risk perception; HIV; EEG; Intuition; Affect	ANTERIOR TEMPORAL-LOBES; NEGATIVITY BIAS; PARTNERS; FACE; ATTRACTIVENESS; PERCEPTIONS; KNOWLEDGE; INTERNET; BEHAVIOR; HEALTH	There is an increasing trend to use online dating to meet potential partners. Previous studies in off-line contexts indicate that people may judge the risk of sexually transmitted infections based on a person's appearance. Online dating profiles commonly present profile pictures and verbal self-descriptions. To examine the integration of verbal and visual risk information, the current event-related potential (ERP) study used a simulated dating platform in which verbal-descriptive information (low vs. high verbal risk) was presented, followed by a photograph (low vs. high visual risk). Results indicated main effects of verbal and visual risk. Specifically, high-risk compared with low-risk verbal profiles elicited a relative negative shift over occipitoparietal sensor sites between 260 ms and 408 ms. Furthermore, a sustained occipital negativity (132-500 ms) and central positivity (156-272 ms) was observed for high as compared with low visual risk profiles. There was also evidence for the integration of verbal and visual risk formation, as indicated by distinct positive ERP shift occurred between 272 ms and 428 ms over anterior temporal regions when a high-risk photograph was preceded by high-risk verbal information. This suggests that verbal-descriptive information is integrated with visual appearance early in the processing stream. The distinct response for high verbal and visual information extends the notion of an alarm function ascribed to risk perception by demonstrating integration about multiple sources. Simulating online dating platforms provides a useful tool to examine intuitive risk perception.

Effect of locomotor demands on cognitive processing	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ELECTROCORTICAL ACTIVITY; MOTOR INTERFERENCE; LOAD CARRIAGE; TASK DEMANDS; EEG; WALKING; PERFORMANCE; POTENTIALS; ARTIFACTS; EXERCISE	Understanding how brain dynamics change with dual cognitive and motor tasks can improve our knowledge of human neurophysiology. The primary goals of this study were to: (1) assess the feasibility of extracting electrocortical signals from scalp EEG while performing sustained, physically demanding dual-task walking and (2) test hypotheses about how the P300 event-related potential is affected by walking physical exertion. Participants walked on a treadmill for an hour either carrying an empty rucksack or one filled with 40% of their body weight. During the walking conditions and during a seated control condition, subjects periodically performed a visual oddball task. We recorded scalp EEG and examined electrocortical dynamics time-locked to the target stimulus. Channel-level event-related potential analysis demonstrated that it is feasible to extract reliable signals during long duration loaded walking. P300 amplitude was reduced during loaded walking versus seated, but there was no effect of time on task. Source level activity and frequency analysis revealed that sensorimotor, parietal, and cingulate brain areas all contributed to the reduced P300 amplitude during dual-task walking. We interpret the results as supporting a prioritization of cortical resources for walking, leading to fewer resources being directed toward the oddball task during dual-task locomotion.	[Bradford, J.

Attentional processes in typically developing children as revealed using brain event-related potentials and their source localization in Attention Network Test	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; EXECUTIVE ATTENTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; CONFLICT; SYSTEM; FMRI; EEG; PERMUTATION; INTEGRATION	Attention-related processes include three functional sub-components: alerting, orienting, and inhibition. We investigated these components using EEG-based, brain event-related potentials and their neuronal source activations during the Attention Network Test in typically developing school-aged children. Participants were asked to detect the swimming direction of the centre fish in a group of five fish. The target stimulus was either preceded by a cue (centre, double, or spatial) or no cue. An EEG using 128 electrodes was recorded for 83 children aged 12-13 years. RTs showed significant effects across all three sub-components of attention. Alerting and orienting (responses to double vs non-cued target stimulus and spatially vs centre-cued target stimulus, respectively) resulted in larger N1 amplitude, whereas inhibition (responses to incongruent vs congruent target stimulus) resulted in larger P3 amplitude. Neuronal source activation for the alerting effect was localized in the right anterior temporal and bilateral occipital lobes, for the orienting effect bilaterally in the occipital lobe, and for the inhibition effect in the medial prefrontal cortex and left anterior temporal lobe. Neuronal sources of ERPs revealed that sub-processes related to the attention network are different in children as compared to earlier adult fMRI studies, which was not evident from scalp ERPs.

This work addresses how these mechanisms deal with different levels of temporal complexity, here the number of distinct durations in rhythmic patterns. We use electroencephalography (EEG) to relate the mismatch negativity (MMN), a proxy of neural prediction error, to a measure of information content of rhythmic sequences, the Shannon entropy. Within each of three conditions, participants listened to repeatedly presented standard rhythms of five tones (four inter-onset intervals) and of a given level of entropy: zero (isochronous), medium entropy (two distinct interval durations), or high entropy (four distinct interval durations). Occasionally, the fourth tone was moved forward in time that is it occurred 100 ms (small deviation) or 300 ms early (large deviation). According to the predictive coding framework, high-entropy stimuli are more difficult to model for the brain, resulting in less confident predictions and yielding smaller prediction errors for deviant sounds. Our results support this hypothesis, showing a gradual decrease in MMN amplitude as a function of entropy, but only for small timing deviants. For large timing deviants, in contrast, a modulation of activity in the opposite direction was observed for the earlier N1 component, known to also be sensitive to sudden changes in directed attention. Our results suggest the existence of a fine-grained neural mechanism that weights neural prediction error to the complexity of rhythms and that mostly manifests in the absence of directed attention.

Proprioceptive and tactile afferent feedback following limb muscle contractions is associated with somatotopic EEG responses. Involuntary contractions of respiratory muscles, primarily the diaphragm-hiccups -are also frequent throughout the human perinatal period during active behavioural states. Here we tested whether diaphragm contraction provides afferent input to the developing brain, as following limb muscle contraction. Methods: In 13 infants on the neonatal ward (30-42 weeks corrected gestational age), we analysed EEG activity (18-electrode recordings in six subjects; 17-electrode recordings in five subjects; 16-electrode recordings in two subjects), time-locked to diaphragm contractions (n = 1316) recorded with a movement transducer affixed to the trunk. Results: All bouts of hiccups occurred during wakefulness or active sleep. Each diaphragm contraction evoked two initial event-related potentials with negativity predominantly across the central region, and a third event-related potential with positivity maximal across the central region. Conclusions: Involuntary contraction of the diaphragm can be encoded by the brain from as early as ten weeks prior to the average time of birth. Significance: Hiccups-frequently observed in neonates-can provide afferent input to developing sensory cortices in pre-term and full-term infants.

This impairment could be due to task switching which involves activation of the present task and the inhibition of the previous task. However, the relative contributions of these processes and their brain activity have not yet been studied. We addressed this gap by asking participants to discriminate the orientation of an oncoming human shape in a virtual environment while they were: i) walking on a treadmill, or ii) texting while walking on a treadmill. Participants' performance (i.e., correctly identifying if a walker would pass them to their left or right) and electroencephalography (EEG) data was collected. Unsurprisingly, we found that participants performed better while they were only walking than when texting while walking. However, we also found that the diminished performance is differently related to task set inhibition and task set activation in the two conditions. The alpha oscillations, which can be used as an index of task inhibition, have a significantly different relation to performance in the two conditions, the relation being negative when subjects are texting. This may indicate that the more inhibition is needed, the more the performance is affected by texting. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the brain signature of task switching in texting while walking. This finding is the first step in identifying the source of impaired judgment in texting pedestrians and in finding viable solutions to reduce the risks.

Single-arm, open-label, dose escalation phase I study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of transcranial direct current stimulation with electroencephalography biomarkers in paediatric disorders of consciousness: a study protocol	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						transcranial direct current stimulation; tDCS; brain injuries; child; electroencephalography	NONINVASIVE BRAIN-STIMULATION; ALTERED STATES; CHILDREN; TDCS; COMA	Introduction Children with disorders of consciousness (DOC) represent the highest end of the acquired brain injury (ABI) severity spectrum for survivors and experience a multitude of functional impairments. Current clinical management in DOC uses behavioural evaluation measures and interventions that fail to (1) describe the physiological consequences of ABI and (2) elicit functional gains. In paediatric DOC, there is a critical need to develop evidence-based interventions to promote recovery of basic responses to improve rehabilitation and aid decision-making for medical teams and caregivers. The purpose of this investigation is to examine the safety, tolerability and feasibility of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in children with DOC. Methods and analysis This study is an open-label dose escalation trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and feasibility of tDCS in 10 children (5-17 years) receiving inpatient rehabilitation for DOC. This study will follow a modified rule-based design, allowing for intrapatient escalation, where a cohort of patients will be assigned to an initial tDCS current of 0.5 or 1 mA based on participant's head circumference and according to the safety data available in other paediatric populations. The subsequent assignment of increased current (1 or 2 mA) according to the prespecified rules will be based on the clinical observation of adverse events in the patients. The study will include up to three, 20min sessions of anodal tDCS (sham, 0.5 or 1 mA, 1 or 2 mA) applied over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The primary outcomes are adverse events, pain associated with tDCS and intolerable disruption of inpatient care.

Socioeconomic status and neural processing of a go/no-go task in preschoolers: An assessment of the P3b	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Socioeconomic status; Income; Executive function; P3b; ERP; Preschool	INHIBITORY CONTROL; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; FAMILY INCOME; CHILDREN; KINDERGARTEN; ENVIRONMENT; MECHANISMS; BEHAVIOR; SOCIETY	While it is well established that lower socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with poorer executive functioning (EF), how SES relates to the neural processing of EF in childhood remains largely unexplored. We examined how household income and parent education related to amplitudes of the P3b, an event-related potential component, during one EF task. We assessed the P3b, indexing inhibition and attention allocation processes, given the importance of these skills for academic success. Children aged 4.5-5.5 years completed a go/no-task, which assesses inhibitory control and attention, while recording EEG. The P3b was assessed for both go trials (indexing sustained attention) and no-go trials (indexing inhibition processes). Higher household income was related to larger P3b amplitudes on both go and no-go trials. This was a highly educated sample, thus results indicate that P3b amplitudes are sensitive to household income even within the context of high parental education. Findings build on the behavioral literature and demonstrate that SES also has implications for the neural mechanisms underlying inhibition and attention processing in early childhood.

However, the effects of short-term fasting upon brain functioning are still unclear. We aimed to evaluate the effect of skipping breakfast on cognitive processing by studying the electrical brain activity of young healthy indiviouals while performing several working memory tasks. Accordingly, the behavioral results and evert-related brain potentials (ERPs) of 20 healthy university students (10 males) were obtained and compared through analysis of variances (ANOVAs), during the performance of three n-back working memory (AVM) tasks in two morning sessions on both normal (after breakfast) and 12-hour fasting conditions. Significantly fewer correct responses were achieved during fasting, mainly affecting the higher WM load task. In addition, there were prolonged reaction times with increased task difficulty, regardless of breakfast intake. ERP showed a significant voltage decrement for N200 and P300 during fasting, while the amplitude of P200 notably increased. The results suggest skipping breakfast oisturbs earlier cognitive processing steps, particularly attention allocation, early decoding in working memory, and stimulus evaluation, and this effect increases with task difficulty.

Mental workload of young and older adults gauged with ERPs and spectral power during N-Back task performance	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; P300-ERP; N-Back task; Alpha theta bands; Mental workload; Young older adults	WORKING-MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ALPHA SYNCHRONIZATION; P300; EEG; AGE; ATTENTION; LOAD; P3A; OSCILLATIONS	Mental workload has been shown to correlate with alpha and theta band power but only few EEG studies focused on the relation between these bands and Event Related Potentials (ERPs), more specifically the P300 component. We report on an EEG study on mental workload where not only young but also older adults performed an N-Back task. Participants watched a sequence of visual pictures and indicated whether the current picture was the same as the one shown N pictures before. We considered N = 4 difficulty levels and analyzed the relation between these and P300 amplitude and theta and alpha band power, and also examined the effect of age, level of education, work activities, and task accuracy. Our results revealed a decrease in P300 amplitude and alpha band activity for higher difficulty levels for young adults in the parietal region. However, for older adults, fatigue played a more important role than we could anticipate as the alpha band power increased for the highest task difficulty level, and since performance accuracy also decreased, it could even be a sign of task disengagement. Beside alpha band, theta band activity showed a positive correlation with task difficulty level for both young and older adults. Additionally, we found higher P300 amplitudes for young adults compared to older adults, in line with their higher performance accuracies and lower reaction times. In conclusion, we showed that P300 amplitude and alpha and theta bands power provide complementary information for judging mental workload during N-Back performance for young and older subjects and for detecting mental fatigue and task disengagement.

Objective: We evaluated the effect of S-ketamine on affective dimension of pain using EEG and behavioral measures. The hypothesis was that S-ketamine would be more effective than placebo, both within and between groups, to attenuate the EEG signal elicited by target and non-target words. Methods: This double-blind parallel placebo-controlled study enrolled 24 healthy male volunteers between 19 and 40 years old. They were randomized to receive intravenous S-ketamine (n = 12) at a plasmatic concentration of 60 ng/ml or placebo (n = 12). Participants completed a computerized oddball paradigm containing written words semantically related to pain (targets), and non-pain related words (standard). The volunteers had to classify the words either as "positive," "negative" or "neutral" (emotional valence judgment). The paradigm consisted in 6 blocks of 50 words each with a fixed 4:1 target/non-target rate presented in a single run. Infusion started during the interval between the 3rd and 4th blocks, for both groups. EEG signal was registered using four channels (Fz, Pz, Pz, and Oz, according to the 10-20 EEG system) with a linked-earlobe reference. The area under the curve (AUC) of the N200 (interval of 100-200 ms) and P300 (300-500 ms) components of event-related potentials (ERPs) was measured for each channel. Results: S-ketamine produced substantial difference (delta) in the AUC of grand average ERP components N200 (P = 0.05) and P300 (P = 0.02) at Pz during infusion period when compared to placebo infusion for both targets and non-targets. S-ketamine was also associated with a decrease in the amount of pain-related words judged as negative from before to after infusion [mean = 0.83 (SD = 0.09) vs. mean = 0.73 (SD = 0.11), respectively; P = 0.04]. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that S-ketamine actively changed the semantic processing of written words. There was an increase in electrophysiological response for pain-related stimuli and a decrease for standard stimuli, as evidenced by the increased delta of AUCs. Behaviorally, S-ketamine seems to have produced an emotional and discrimination blunting effect for pain-related words.

The current review will discuss research examining brain abnormalities in clinical and genetic high risk for psychosis using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) focusing on structural brain abnormalities, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) focusing on the integrity of white matter tracks, functional MRI focusing on functional brain abnormalities, and EEG and event related potential (ERP) methodologies focusing on indices of cognitive dysfunction in CHR. Studies conducted across these different methodologies sought to identify brain regions and brain processes that would distinguish between those high risk individuals who converted to psychosis versus those who did not. In addition, in some of the studies, the distinction was made between individuals who converted to psychosis, those who did not, and those individuals who remained clinically symptomatic while not converting to psychosis. The brain regions most often identified as abnormal in this subject group were the brain areas often found abnormal in schizophrenia, including frontal and temporal regions. Similarly, several cognitive processes often found to be abnormal in schizophrenia have been also found impaired in CHR.

However, it has also been reported that the association between condom use intentions and behavior is, at best, often weak. Furthermore, embarrassment associated with purchasing condoms and negotiating their use has been shown to negatively impact the frequency of condom use. Using electroencephalography to analyze P300 event-related potential components known to measure early attention allocation, we examined electrophysiological evidence of early attention disengagement for embarrassing health information. Forty young adults34 females and six malesparticipated in an adapted version of Posner's visual cueing paradigm. All were high in intention to use condoms, but half were intention-behavior consistent and half were intention-behavior inconsistent. Compared to intention-behavior consistent participants, those with intention-behavior inconsistency showed a reduced P300 component when attending to a visual target opposite to the field in which embarrassing self-relevant health information was presented, indicating more efficient early attention disengagement from such embarrassing health information. In conclusion, our electrophysiological data suggest that high intention alone may be not sufficient to predict adolescents' condom use behavior.	[Brull, Phil; Kessels, Loes T. E.; Ruiter, Robert A.

Effect of suvorexant on event-related oscillations and EEG sleep in rats exposed to chronic intermittent ethanol vapor and protracted withdrawal	SLEEP			English	Article						alcohol; EEG; event-related oscillations; suvorexant; slow-wave sleep	OREXIN RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS; CLINICAL-PRACTICE GUIDELINE; ADMISSION PREDICTS RELAPSE; TREAT ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE; REM-SLEEP; PHARMACOLOGICAL-TREATMENT; AMERICAN ACADEMY; CHRONIC INSOMNIA; PHASE-LOCKING; DOUBLE-BLIND	Study Objectives Insomnia is a prominent complaint in patients with alcohol use disorders (AUD). However, despite the importance of sleep in the maintenance of sobriety, treatment options for sleep disturbance associated with a history of AUD are currently limited. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that suvorexant, a dual Hct/OX receptor antagonist, normalizes sleep in patients with primary insomnia; yet, its potential for the treatment of sleep pathology associated with AUD has not been investigated in either preclinical or clinical studies. Methods This study employed a model whereby ethanol vapor exposure or control conditions were administered for 8 weeks to adult rats. Waking event-related oscillations (EROs) and EEG sleep were evaluated at baseline before exposure and again following 24 hr of withdrawal from the exposure. Subsequently, the ability of vehicle (VEH) and two doses (10, 30 mg/kg IP) of suvorexant to modify EROs, sleep, and the sleep EEG was investigated. Results After 24 hr following EtOH withdrawal, the ethanol-treated group had increases in waking ERO and activity, more fragmented sleep (shorter duration and increased frequency of slow wave (SW) and rapid eye movement [REM] sleep episodes), and increased and power in REM and SW sleep. Suvorexant induced a dose-dependent decrease in the latency to REM and SW sleep onsets but also produced REM and SW sleep fragmentation and increased energy in waking EROs when compared with VEH. Conclusions Taken together, these studies suggest that suvorexant has overall sleep-promoting effects, but it may exacerbate some aspects of sleep and EEG pathology.

J	Liao, WY; Zhang, Y; Peng, XZ				Liao, Wanying; Zhang, Yi; Peng, Xiaozhe			Neurophysiological effect of exposure to gossip on product endorsement and willingness-to-pay	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Product endorsement; Social influence; EEG; Gossip; Celebrity; Consumer neuroscience	WORD-OF-MOUTH; SOCIAL MEDIA; PURCHASE INTENTIONS; TIME-COURSE; CELEBRITY; BRAIN; INFORMATION; IMPACT; COMMUNICATION; CREDIBILITY	With the proliferation of social networking sites, it is common to encounter gossip and product endorsement from different social influences (friends, strangers or celebrities) in the same context. This research examines gossip as a facilitator of reputational social exchange, and shows that exposure to gossip moderates the social influence of product endorsement. Participants read positive and negative gossip about different endorsers, and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during product endorsement. Behavioral results indicate that gossip about a close friend or celebrity (relative to a stranger) and positive (vs. negative) gossip increase consumer willingness-to-pay following product endorsement respectively. ERP results reveal two distinct ERP components following exposure to gossip. During the late stage (350-500 ms) of product endorsement, exposure to gossip about a close friend (relative to celebrity or a stranger) and negative (relative to positive) gossip each elicited a distinctively larger N400 response. During the later stage (500-700 ms), positive (versus negative) gossip elicited a larger LPP during friend endorsement relative to celebrity endorsement. The findings illustrate the motivational significance of gossip about friends from a social learning perspective. We also discuss the marketing implications for friend endorsement versus celebrity endorsement.

Evidence for intact stimulus-specific neural adaptation for visual objects in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder: An ERP study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BACKWARD-MASKING; MAGNOCELLULAR CONTRIBUTIONS; PERCEPTUAL CLOSURE; RECOGNITION; MECHANISMS; DEFICITS; COGNITION; DYNAMICS; AREAS	People with schizophrenia (SZ) or bipolar disorder (BD) experience dysfunction in visual processing. Dysfunctional neural tuning, in which neurons and neuronal populations are selectively activated by specific features of visual stimuli, may contribute to these deficits. Few studies have examined this possibility and there are inconsistent findings of tuning deficits in the literature. We utilized an event-related potential (ERP) paradigm to examine neural adaptation for visual objects, a measure of neural tuning whereby neurons respond less strongly to the repeated presentation of the same stimulus. Seventy-seven SZ, 53 BD, and 49 healthy comparison participants (HC) were examined. In three separate conditions, pictures of objects were presented repeatedly: the same object (SS), different objects from the same category (e.g., two different vases; SD), or different objects from different categories (e.g., a barrel and a clock, DD). Mass-univariate cluster-based permutation analyses identified electrodes and time-windows in which there were significant differences between the SS vs. DD and the SD vs. DD conditions. Mean ERP amplitudes were extracted from these clusters and analyzed for group differences. Results revealed a significant condition difference over parieto-occipital electrodes for the SS-DD comparison between 109-164 ms and for the SD-DD comparison between 78-203 ms, with larger amplitudes in the DD compared to either SS or SD condition. However, there were no significant differences in the pattern of results between groups. Thus, while we found neural adaptation effects using this ERP paradigm, we did not find evidence of group differences. Our results suggest that people with SZ or BD may not exhibit deficits in neural tuning for processing of visual objects using this EEG task with rapidly presented stimuli. However, the results are inconsistent with other studies using different methodologies (e.g., fMRI, behavioral tasks) that have found tuning deficits in people with schizophrenia.

Whereas the FRN has previously been linked to reward prediction error (RPE), the P3b has been conceived as reflecting motivational or attentional processes following the early processing of the RPE, including action value updating. However, it remains unclear whether these two consecutive neurophysiological effects depend on the direction of the unexpectedness (better- or worse-than-expected outcomes; signed RPE) or instead only on the degree of unexpectedness irrespective of direction (i.e., unsigned RPE). To address this question, we devised an experiment in which we manipulated the objective reward probability and the subjective reward expectancy (via instructions) in a factorial within-subject design and explored amplitude changes of the FRN and the P3b. A 64-channel EEG was recorded while 32 participants performed a speeded go/no-go task in which evaluative feedback based on the reward probability either violated expectancy (thereby creating a RPE) or did not. This violation corresponded either to better- or worse-than-expected events. Results showed that the FRN was larger when RPE occurred than when it did not, but irrespective of the direction of this violation. Interestingly, in these two conditions, action value was updated for the positive feedback selectively, as shown by the P3b amplitude. These results obey a two-stage model of PM assuming that unsigned RPE is first rapidly detected (FRN level) before the positive feedback's value is updated selectively (P3b effect).

Antipsychotic drugs do not sufficiently improve cognitive functions. In this study, an analysis of previous studies on cognitive functions using event-related potentials in schizophrenia patients was conducted on the basis of available publications (Pubmed, Scopus). The studies indicate numerous deviations at various stages of information processing in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia when compared to healthy subjects, and this justifies the need for the development of new methods influencing the bioelectric brain activity in cognitive rehabilitation of these patients. EEG Biofeedback is a method which could be used for rehabilitation of cognitive functions in schizophrenia patients. Despite it being used in practice, the importance of EEG Biofeedback as a rehabilitation influence on cognitive functions in schizophrenia has not been fully ascertained. This paper analyses the results of previous studies on the effect of EEG Biofeedback therapy on cognitive functions as a possible method to be used in the rehabilitation of schizophrenia patients. Currently, the body of research that may prove the value of this method in the rehabilitation of patients with schizophrenia appears to be insufficient, and there is no scientific evidence from randomized studies for the usefulness of EEG Biofeedback in schizophrenia treatment. At the moment, the recommendation of this method in the cognitive rehabilitation of patients is a therapeutic experiment. The researchers, on the basis of an analysis of clinical cases, currently propose that EEG Biofeedback is conducted in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia by experienced practitioners, paying particular attention to strengthening alpha in the right parietal region.

Hence, it is essential to develop methods to effectively detect and extract the clean EEG data during encephalogram recordings. Several methods have been proposed to remove artifacts, but the research on artifact removal continues to be an open problem. This paper tends to review the current artifact removal of various contaminations. We first discuss the characteristics of EEG data and the types of different artifacts. Then, a general overview of the state-of-the-art methods and their detail analysis are presented.

Despite showing medium clinical effect sizes for anxiety disorders, underlying neural-cognitive mechanisms of change remain unclear. We used visual mismatch negativity (vMMN), an event-related potential sensitive to violations of learned statistical contingencies, to assess therapy-related contingency extraction processes in healthy participants and in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD). We then assessed whether vMMN amplitude predicts ABM treatment outcome. MethodsA modified version of the dot-probe task was used to elicit vMMN, in which 80% of trials were standard and 20% were deviant. In study 1, 30 healthy adults were randomly assigned to one of two ABM conditions: one in which threat-congruent targets were deviant trials and threat-incongruent targets were standard trials, and another in which the contingency was reversed. Electroencephalography (EEG) was continuously measured and vMMN analyzed. In study 2, 38 patients with SAD underwent six sessions of ABM therapy. We tested whether rule extraction in the ABM task, indicated by vMMN amplitude, predicts treatment outcome. ResultsvMMN clearly emerged over prespecified scalp locations indicating contingency extraction during ABM (study 1). vMMN amplitude predicted clinical improvement after ABM therapy, uniquely accounting for 7% and 14.4% of the variance in clinician-rated and self-reported posttreatment SAD symptoms, respectively. ConclusionsvMMN emerges as a neural marker for contingency learning in ABM, suggesting a significant role for contingency extraction processes in the clinical efficacy of this therapy.

The time course of different surround suppression mechanisms	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						surround suppression; electroencephalography; event-related potential; spatial context; dichoptic	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; CLASSICAL RECEPTIVE-FIELD; MACAQUE V1; AREAS V1; ATTENTION; CONTRAST; SEGREGATION; COMPONENTS; RESPONSES; NEURONS	What we see depends on the spatial context in which it appears. Previous work has linked the suppression of perceived contrast by surrounding stimuli to reduced neural responses in early visual cortex. This surround suppression depends on at least two separable neural mechanisms, "low-level" and "higher level," which can be differentiated by their response characteristics. We used electroencephalography to demonstrate for the first time that human occipital neural responses show evidence of these two suppression mechanisms. Eighteen adults (10 women, 8 men) each participated in three experimental sessions, in which they viewed visual stimuli through a mirror stereoscope. The first session was used to identify the C1 component, while the second and third comprised the main experiment. Event-related potentials were measured in response to center gratings either with no surround or with surrounding gratings oriented parallel or orthogonal, and presented in either the same eye (monoptic) or the opposite eye (dichoptic). We found that the earliest component of an event-related potential (C1; similar to 60 ms) was suppressed by surrounding stimuli, but that suppression did not depend on surround configuration. This suggests a suppression mechanism that is not tuned for relative orientation acting on the earliest cortical response to the target. A later response component (N1; similar to 160 ms) showed stronger suppression for parallel and monoptic surrounds, consistent with our earlier psychophysical results and a second form of suppression that is binocular and orientation tuned. We conclude that these two forms of surround suppression have distinct response time courses in the human visual system, which can be differentiated using electrophysiology.

Aims: The present study was designed to test if healthy subjects and Fibromyalgia (FM) patients, both evaluated by Laser Evoked Potentials (LEPs) and Event-Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP), might reveal the empathic response to the partner's nociceptive stimulation. Methods: The emphatic nociceptive paradigm was recorded through 64 channels EEG and laser stimulation of the right hand in a shared visual open setting (Open Condition) or in a blind setting (Blind condition) where the subjects didn't receive visual information about partner nociceptive condition. Twenty one healthy subjects and 19 FM patients were evaluated in pairs. All subjects were tested by the Empathy for Pain Scale (EPS). Results: The averaged LEPs were similar between patients and controls in the different conditions. In attendance of the partner's stimulation, FM patients desynchronized the same fronto-central regions as before own stimulation, while healthy subjects shared the other's pain by activating scalp areas compatible with visual attention. These EEG features were more represented in subjects with higher EPS scores. Conclusions: While empathic features of healthy subjects seemed influenced by the specific visual attentional task, patients expressed an EEG pattern compatible with somatosensory circuits activation in the expectation of own and other's pain. The visual empathic involvement in other's noxious stimulation could evoke a different EEG response depending upon the experience of chronic pain.

There is evidence to suggest that a hypnotic state may help patients to better achieve tasks of motor imagination, which is central in the rehabilitation protocols after a stroke. However, the hypnosis techniques could also alter activity in the motor cortex. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of hypnosis on the EEG signal during a movement or an imagined movement is poorly investigated. In particular, how event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS) patterns would be modulated for different motor tasks may provide a better understanding of the potential benefits of hypnosis for stroke rehabilitation. To investigate this purpose, we recorded EEG signals from 23 healthy volunteers who performed real movements and motor imageries in a closed eye condition. Our results suggest that the state of hypnosis changes the sensorimotor beta rhythm during the ERD phase but maintains the ERS phase in the mu and beta frequency band, suggesting a different activation of the motor cortex in a hypnotized state.

In this study, we examined whether individual variability in impulsivity and reward-related mechanisms is associated with higher level of engagement in risky behaviours and vulnerability to maladaptive outcomes and whether this relationship is mediated by cognitive control ability. A community sample of adolescents, young adults, and adults (age = 15-35 years) completed self-report measures and behavioural tasks of cognitive control, impulsivity, and reward-related mechanisms, and self-reported level of maladaptive outcomes. Behavioural, event-related potential (ERP), and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) measures of proactive control were derived from a task-switching paradigm. Adolescents, but not young adults, reported higher levels of impulsivity, reward-seeking behaviours and maladaptive outcomes than adults. They also had lower cognitive control ability, as measured by both self-report and task-based measures. Consistent with models of risk-taking behaviour, self-reported level of cognitive control mediated the relationship between self-reported levels of impulsivity and psychological distress, but the effect was not moderated by age. In contrast, there was no mediation effect of behavioural or EEG-based measures of cognitive control. These findings suggest that individual variability in cognitive control is more crucial to the relationship between risk-taking/impulsivity and outcomes than age itself. They also highlight large differences in measurement between self-report and task-based measures of cognitive control and decision-making under reward conditions, which should be considered in any studies of cognitive control.

The experiment consisted of two phases: 1) image recognition and 2) attention evaluation. In phase 1, the mean response time was 547 ms vs. 633 ms to faces and scenes, respectively. In phase 2, the mean response time was 667 ms vs. 706 ms to face and scene categories, respectively. We analyzed the event-related time-frequency representation of faces and scenes and the causal relationship between object recognition and the motor response associated with category selection using the brain connectivity based on Granger causality. The developed experimental protocols and connectivity evaluation methods may provide insights for a better understanding of the neural processes for object recognition and category selection.

While it seems obvious that the impact of interfering emotional information critically depends on how deeply this interfering information is processed, it is still unknown what cognitive subprocesses are most affected by manipulating the depth of processing of emotionally interfering information. We examine these aspects integrating neurophysiological (EEG) and source localization data with pupil diameter data as an indirect index of the norepinephrine (NE) system activity. We show that when processing depth of interfering emotional stimulus dimensions is increased, emotional Stroop effects become stronger. The EEG data show that this was associated with modulations of decision-making processes, as reflected by the P3 event-related potential. Notably, the integration with pupil diameter data suggests that these decision processes were modulated by the NE system, especially when the depth of processing of interfering emotional stimulus dimensions was increased. This likely reflects gain modulation processes to facilitate processing of complex interfering, emotional information. The source localization results suggest that regions in the parietal (BA7) and insular cortex (BA13) are associated with these modulatory effects. The results suggest that overcoming more complex emotional interference triggers engagement of the norepinephrine system (indexed by pupil diameter) to facilitate action control mechanisms in a time-specific manner when deeper processing of emotional stimulus dimensions is required.

Fluent music readers show selectively higher activity to musical notes than to other visually similar patterns in both the retinotopic and higher-level visual areas and both very early (e.g., C1) and later (e.g., N170) visual event-related potential (ERP) components. This is different from domains such as face and letter perception, of which the neural expertise marker is typically found in the higher-level ventral visual areas and later (e.g., N170) ERP components. An intriguing question concerns whether the visual skills and neural selectivity observed in music-reading experts are a result of the effects of extensive visual experience with musical notation. The current study aimed to investigate the causal relationship between visual experience and its neural changes with musical notation. Novices with no formal musical training experience were trained to visually discriminate between note patterns in the laboratory for 10-26 hr such that their performance was comparable with fluent music readers. The N170 component became more selective for musical notes after training. Training was not, however, followed by changes in the earlier C1 component. The findings show that visual training is enough for causing changes in the responses of the higher-level visual areas to musical notation while the engagement of the early visual areas may involve additional nonvisual factors.

Interpersonal representations of touch in somatosensory cortex are modulated by perspective	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Somatosensory; Vicarious touch; Empathy; Perspective; EEG; ERPs	VICARIOUS TACTILE PERCEPTION; 3RD-PERSON PERSPECTIVES; POSTERIOR PARIETAL; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PAIN; EMPATHY; BODY; COMMON; STIMULATION; FEEL	Observing others being touched activates similar brain areas as those activated when one experiences a touch oneself. Event-related potential (ERP) studies have revealed that modulation of somatosensory components by observed touch occurs within 100 ms after stimulus onset, and such vicarious effects have been taken as evidence for empathy for others' tactile experiences. In previous studies body parts have been presented from a first person perspective. This raises the question of the extent to which somatosensory activation by observed touch to body parts depends on the perspective from which the body part is observed. In this study (N = 18), we examined the modulation of somatosensory ERPs by observed touch delivered to another person's hand when viewed as if from a first person versus a third person perspective. We found that vicarious touch effects primarily consist of two separable components in the early stages of somatosensory processing: an anatomical mapping for touch in first person perspective at P45, and a specular (mirror like) mapping for touch in third person perspective at P100. This is consistent with suggestions that vicarious representations exist to support predictions for one's own bodily events, but also to enable predictions of a social or interpersonal kind, at distinct temporal stages.

Predicting the fate of basketball throws: an EEG study on expert action prediction in wheelchair basketball players	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Expertise; Action prediction; Action observation	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; ACTION ANTICIPATION; FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION; MOTOR EXPERTISE; ERRORS; OSCILLATIONS; INFORMATION; PERCEPTION; EXPERIENCE; COMPONENTS	The ability to anticipate and detect changes in human movement helps people to modify their behaviors in ever changing environments. Studies indicate that expertise modulates observation of domain-specific actions in sports-a process that is crucial for adapting rapidly to a new situation, often before awareness of environmental changes is achieved. Here, we explored the electrophysiological underpinnings of wheelchair basketball players predicting the fate of free throws performed by wheelchair basketball athletes. We performed electroencephalography (EEG) in semi-professional wheelchair players with different degrees of expertise (players) and in ambulant, non-expert people (controls) while they observed movie stimuli of a free throw that could land inside or outside the basket. On each trial, participants were asked to predict the outcome of the throw. For each group, event-related potentials (ERPs) were averaged as a function of condition, using only the trials that were correctly predicted. Results show that compared to controls, expert players exhibit a greater negative amplitude of oCNV over Pz (an observational contingent negative variation-like waveform which is considered a marker of action effect prediction) during the wrist movement preceding the ball release (the last 100 ms of the shot), which carries the most crucial kinematic information regarding the fate of the throw. Our data provide further support to the view that functional modulation of the action observation network is associated with expertise.	[Ozkan, D. G.; Aglioti, S.

J	Lunghi, M; Piccardi, ES; Richards, JE; Simion, F				Lunghi, Marco; Piccardi, Elena Serena; Richards, John E.; Simion, Francesca			The neural correlates of orienting to walking direction in 6-month-old infants: An ERP study	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						biological motion; cortical source analysis; ERPs; social stimuli; visuospatial orienting	BIOLOGICAL-MOTION; VISUAL-ATTENTION; PERCEPTION; REFLEXIVE; CUES; ACTIVATION; COGNITION; SPEEDS; BRAIN; MODEL	The ability to detect social signals represents a first step to enter our social world. Behavioral evidence has demonstrated that 6-month-old infants are able to orient their attention toward the position indicated by walking direction, showing faster orienting responses toward stimuli cued by the direction of motion than toward uncued stimuli. The present study investigated the neural mechanisms underpinning this attentional priming effect by using a spatial cueing paradigm and recording EEG (Geodesic System 128 channels) from 6-month-old infants. Infants were presented with a central point-light walker followed by a single peripheral target. The target appeared randomly at a position either congruent or incongruent with the walking direction of the cue. We examined infants' target-locked event-related potential (ERP) responses and we used cortical source analysis to explore which brain regions gave rise to the ERP responses. The P1 component and saccade latencies toward the peripheral target were modulated by the congruency between the walking direction of the cue and the position of the target. Infants' saccade latencies were faster in response to targets appearing at congruent spatial locations. The P1 component was larger in response to congruent than to incongruent targets and a similar congruency effect was found with cortical source analysis in the parahippocampal gyrus and the anterior fusiform gyrus. Overall, these findings suggest that a type of biological motion like the one of a vertebrate walking on the legs can trigger covert orienting of attention in 6-month-old infants, enabling enhancement of neural activity related to visual processing of potentially relevant information as well as a facilitation of oculomotor responses to stimuli appearing at the attended location.

Research suggests that event-related potentials (ERPs) reflect neurodegenerative processes in AD and might qualify as neurophysiological AD markers. Objectives: First, to examine which ERP component correlates the most with AD severity, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Then, to analyze the temporal change of this component as AD progresses. Methods: Sixty-three subjects (31 with possible, 32 with probable AD diagnosis) were recruited as part of the cohort study Prospective Dementia Registry Austria (PRODEM). For a maximum of 18 months patients revisited every 6 months for follow-up assessments. ERPs were elicited using an auditory oddball paradigm. P300 and N200 latency was determined with regard to target as well as difference wave ERPs, whereas P50 amplitude was measured from standard stimuli waveforms. Results: P300 latency exhibited the strongest association with AD severity (e.g., r = -0.512, p < 0.01 at Pz for target stimuli in probable AD subjects). Further, there were significant Pearson correlations for N200 latency (e.g., r = -0.407, p = 0.026 at Cz for difference waves in probable AD subjects). P50 amplitude, as measured by different detection methods and at various scalp sites, did not significantly correlate with disease severity neither in probable AD, possible AD, nor in both subgroups of patients combined. ERP markers for the group of possible AD patients did not show any significant correlations with MMSE scores. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons between baseline and 18-months follow-up assessment revealed significant P300 latency differences (e.g., p < 0.001 at Cz for difference waves in probable AD subjects). However, there were no significant correlations between the change rates of P300 latency and MMSE score. Conclusions: P300 and N200 latency significantly correlated with disease severity in probable AD, whereas P50 amplitude did not. P300 latency, which showed the highest correlation coefficients with MMSE, significantly increased over the course of the 18 months study period in probable AD patients. The magnitude of the observed prolongation is in line with other longitudinal AD studies and substantially higher than in normal ageing, as reported in previous trials (no healthy controls were included in our study).

In this context, the application of new technologies to monitor driver's conditions becomes essential to detect anomalous driver behaviour and to identify near miss accidents. Near miss accidents are unplanned events that did not result in injury, illness, or damage but had the potential to do so. In dangerous goods transport by road, few accidents are reported but their consequences may be very relevant. So, the automatic detection of near miss accident may constitute an important resource to improve risk analysis. Specifically, the fundamental hypothesis of our research is that in a near miss accident, the driver's physiological conditions vary. Among them, due to either the emotion or the fear due to a miss accident, the driver's brain shows a variation which could be detected in real time. In this paper, an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based driver control system (EEG-DCS) is presented to monitor the driver brain activities. This study investigates the driver's behaviour and reaction when he/she is exposed to unexpected acoustic or visual external event which perturbs a car driving session in a virtual simulated scenario. The EEG Enobio cap with eight electrodes is used to perform EEG driver's monitoring. Signals related to alpha waves in the EEG signals have been evaluated in time and frequency domain The analysis has clearly demonstrated that the changes in driver's brain wave activities, visualized in the EEG, are significantly correlated to external events causing an unexpected fear to the driver.

Conversely, both behavioral and neurological evidence supporting subjective cognitive control impairments in insomnia remain remarkably scarce and inconclusive. To investigate this discrepancy, the present study used next to behavioral measures, event-related potentials (ERPs) to assess proactive control and reactive control in insomnia. Methods Individuals with insomnia disorder (n = 18) and good sleeper controls (GSC; n = 15) completed the AX-continuous performance task, while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. This task required participants to maintain specific cue-information active to prepare an adequate response to a subsequent probe, which allowed us to measure participants' reliance on both proactive and reactive control. Results The results indicate that, although ID show a comparable level of performance as GSC, they show a reduced proactive engagement of cue-induced maintenance and response preparation processes (as reflected by the P3b and the contingent negative variation components). Moreover, in contrast to GSC, ID fail to engage reactive control (as indexed by the P3a component) to overcome invalid response tendencies. Conclusions This study provides neurological evidence for impairments in cognitive control functioning in insomnia. As such, our study contributes to a better understanding of the discrepancy between the commonly reported cognitive impairments in insomnia and the scarce objective evidence supporting these cognitive complaints.

Participants included 86 mothers of infants. Maternal sensitivity was coded from video-recorded distress and play interactions; mothers' event-related potentials (ERPs) to child emotional expressions were measured from EEG activity recorded during a categorization task. Latent profile analysis of mothers' P200 and late positive potential (LPP) responses to crying and laughing child expressions identified three latent profiles, characterized by enhanced or attenuated responses to crying and laughing expressions at early and late stages of processing. Mothers' probability of being assigned to the "attenuated to distress" profile, characterized by undifferentiated early and late response to infant emotional expressions, was associated with reduced maternal sensitivity. Probability of being assigned to this profile was also correlated with sociodemographic risk. Profiles of maternal neural response to infant emotional expressions may enhance our understanding of the phenomenology of insensitive caregiving.

Since it has been shown that LC enhances discrimination of acoustic stimuli and the associated electroencephalographic (EEG) waves, such as event related potentials (ERPs) P300, we set a protocol aimed to verify whether trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) may be utilized for improving acoustic discrimination of different tones. In two separate experiments, we evaluated P300 ERPs elicited by an acoustic oddball paradigm performed before and after TNS or sham-TNS, respectively. The ultimate purpose of this evaluation is to verify whether it is possible to exploit TNS as a treatment in subjects with disorders of consciousness.	[Fantozzi, M. P.

It is unclear, however, whether reduced MMN amplitudes to speech sound deviants are observed within the first 5 years of the illness. The present study investigated MMNs elicited by across-vowel (phoneme) change in early schizophrenia (ESZ; Experiment 1) as well as chronic schizophrenia (CSZ; Experiment 2). In both experiments, clinical and control participants were presented the Finnish phoneme /e/ (standard; P = .90) and the Finnish phoneme /o/ (deviant; P = .10) within an oddball paradigm. In experiment 2 we report significantly reduced MMN amplitudes in CSZ relative to HCs, but no differences were found when comparing ESZ and HC in experiment 1. Additionally, in our clinical samples, MMN amplitudes were correlated with symptom scores. These findings suggest that early detection of phonetic change may be impaired in chronic schizophrenia, but not early in the progression of the illness. As MMN reductions only emerged in patients with a longer course of illness, and appeared to change with symptom severity, this suggests a dynamic change in the early auditory processing of language over time in schizophrenia.

There is a large variation between individuals in how long stable percepts endure, on average, between switches, but the underlying neural basis of this individual difference in perceptual dynamics remains obscure. Here, we show that in one widely studied multistable paradigm-binocular rivalry-perceptual stability in individuals is predicted by the frequency of their neural oscillations within the alpha range (7-13 Hz). Our results suggest revising models of rivalry to incorporate effects of neural oscillations on perceptual alternations, and raise the possibility that a common factor may influence dynamics in many neural processes.

However, our understanding about the effects of PD on the underlying neural mechanisms of motor function has remained elusive. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between PD pathology and neurological deficits in planning and execution mechanisms of motor timing during speech production and limb movement. We used a combination of behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) measures to characterize motor timing deficits in patients with PD compared with a neurologically intact matched control group during randomized speech vowel vocalization and button press motor reaction time tasks in response to temporally predictable and unpredictable sensory stimuli. Behavioral results indicated slower motor reaction times in PD regardless of motor modality or temporal predictability of sensory stimuli. In addition, our analysis indicated that slower motor reaction times in PD were correlated with pathological attenuation of neural activities within the right precentral and inferior frontal cortex only before the onset of speech production and limb movement. These findings highlight the role of a right-lateralized prefrontal cortical network in motor planning and its relationship with PD pathology during speech and limb movement timing control. Based on these data, we suggest that pathological attenuation of neural activities within this network is a neurophysiological biomarker of general and modality non-specific motor timing deficits in PD. We propose that this right-lateralized prefrontal network is a potential candidate for targeted treatment of speech and limb motor timing disorders in patients with PD.

The well-documented EEG "signature" of preparation for a task switch-a protracted positive-polarity modulation over the posterior scalp-has thus far not been reported in language switching, and the interpretation of previously reported effects of preparation on language switching performance is complicated by confounding factors. In an experiment using event-related potentials (ERPs) and an optimized picture-naming paradigm that addressed these confounds the language was specified by an auditory cue on every trial and changed unpredictably. There were two key manipulations. First, the cue-stimulus interval allowed either generous (1.500 ms) or little (100 ms) opportunity for preparation. Second, to explore the interplay between bottom-up and top-down language selection, we compared a highly transparent and familiar "supercue"-the name of the language spoken in that language to a relatively opaque cue (short speeded-up fragment of national anthem). Preparation for a switch elicited a brain potential strongly reminiscent of the posterior switch positivity documented in task switching. As previously shown in task switching, its amplitude inversely predicted the performance "switch cost." demonstrated by our ERP analyses contingent on reaction time (RT). This overlap in the electrophysiological correlates of preparing to switch tasks and languages suggests domain-general processes for top-down selection of task-set and language for production. But, the surprisingly small language switch cost following the supercue in the short CSI suggests that rapid and (possibly automatic) bottom-up selection-not typically observed in task switching-may also occur.

This paper will summarize recent work that has investigated changes in oscillatory activity and event-related potentials with Electro/Magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) in participants at high-risk for the development of schizophrenia, highlighting disruptions in sensory and cognitive operations prior to the onset of the syndrome. Changes in EEG/MEG-data are consistent with evidence for alterations in Glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission as disclosed by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and brain stimulation, indicating changes in Excitation/Inhibition balance parameters prior to the onset of psychosis. Together these data emphasize the importance of research into neuronal dynamics as a crucial approach to establish functional relationships between impairments in neural circuits and emerging psychopathology that together could be fundamental for early intervention and the identification of novel treatments for emerging psychosis.

Collaborating with others may or may not result in higher task performance than if one were to complete the task alone (i.e., a collective benefit). A recent study on collective benefits in perceptual decision-making showed that dyad members with similar individual performances attain collective benefit. However, little is known about the physiological basis of these results. Here, we replicate this earlier work and also investigate the neurophysiological correlates of decision-making using EEG. In a two-interval forced-choice task, co-actors individually indicated presence of a target stimulus with a higher contrast and then indicated their confidence on a rating scale. Viewing the individual ratings, dyads made a joint decision. Replicating earlier work, we found a positive correlation between the similarity of individual performances and collective benefit. We analyzed event-related potentials (ERPs) in three phases (i.e., stimulus onset, response and feedback) using explorative cluster mass permutation tests. At stimulus onset, ERPs were significantly linearly related to our manipulation of contrast differences, validating our manipulation of task difficulty. For individual and joint responses, we found a significant centro-parietal error-related positivity for correct versus incorrect responses, which suggests that accuracy is already evaluated at the response level. At feedback presentation, we found a significant late positive fronto-central potential elicited by incorrect joint responses. In sum, these results demonstrate that response- and feedback-related components elicited by an error-monitoring system differentially integrate conflicting information exchanged during the joint decision-making process.

Yet, perhaps due to its complexity, surprisingly little is known about the neural basis of this fundamental ability. Here, we examined EEG waveforms evoked by different types of relations, conveyed by pairs of images. Subjects were presented with the pairs, that were either associatively related, abstractly related or unrelated, and judged if they were related or not. Evidence for a gradual modulation of the amplitude of the N400 and late negativity was found, such that unrelated pairs elicited the most negative amplitude, followed by abstractly-related pairs and lastly associatively-related ones. However, this was confined to first encounter with the pairs, and a different, more dichotomous pattern was observed when the pairs were viewed for the second time. Then, no difference was found between associatively and abstractly related pairs, while both differed from unrelated pairs. Notably, when the pairs were sequentially presented, this pattern was found mostly in right electrodes, while it appeared both in left and right sites during simultaneous presentation of the pairs. This suggests that while two different mechanisms may be involved in generating predictions about an upcoming related/unrelated stimulus, online processing of associative and abstract semantic relations might be mediated by a single mechanism. Our results further support claims that the N400 component indexes multiple cognitive processes that overlap in time, yet not necessarily in neural generators.

Athletic performance is affected by emotional state. Athletes may underperform in competition due to poor emotion regulation. Movement speed plays an important role in many competition events. Flexible control of movement speed is critical for effective athletic performance. Although behavioral evidence showed that negative emotion can influence movement speed, the nature of the relationship remains controversial. Thus, the present study investigated how negative emotion affects movement speed and the neural mechanism underlying the interaction between emotion processing and movement control. Methods. The present study combined electroencephalography (EEG) technology with a cued-action task to investigate the effect of negative emotion on movement speed. In total, 21 undergraduate students were recruited for this study. Participants were asked to perform six consecutive action tasks after viewing an emotional picture. Pictures were presented in two blocks (one negative and one neutral). After the participants completed a set of tasks (neutral of negative), they were subjected to complete a 9-point self-assessment manikin scale. Participants underwent EEG while performing the tasks. Results. At the behavior level, there was a significant main effect of emotional valence on movement speed, with participants exhibiting significantly slower movements in the negative emotional condition than in the neutral condition. EEG data showed increased theta oscillation and larger P1 amplitude in response to negative than to neural images suggesting that more cognitive resources were required to process negative than neutral images. EEG data also showed a larger late CNV area in the neutral condition than in the negative condition, which suggested that there was a significant decrease in brain activation during action tasks in negative emotional condition than in the neural. While the early CNV did not reveal a significant main effect of emotional valence. Conclusion. The present results indicate that a negative emotion can slow movement, which is largely due to negative emotional processing consuming more resources than non-emotional processing and this interference effect mainly occurred in the late movement preparation phase.

Predicting task-general mind-wandering with EEG	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Mind-wandering; Spontaneous thought; Single-trial ERP; EEG; Support vector machine; Sustained attention to response task; Alpha oscillations	WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY; CONTINUOUS WAVELET TRANSFORM; THOUGHT; BRAIN; DYNAMICS; FLUCTUATIONS; MECHANISM; NETWORK; STATES; THETA	Mind-wandering refers to the process of thinking task-unrelated thoughts while performing a task. The dynamics of mind-wandering remain elusive because it is difficult to track when someone's mind is wandering based only on behavior. The goal of this study is to develop a machine-learning classifier that can determine someone's mind-wandering state online using electroencephalography (EEG) in a way that generalizes across tasks. In particular, we trained machine-learning models on EEG markers to classify the participants' current state as either mind-wandering or on-task. To be able to examine the task generality of the classifier, two different paradigms were adopted in this study: a sustained attention to response task (SART) and a visual search task. In both tasks, probe questions asking for a self-report of the thoughts at that moment were inserted at random moments, and participants' responses to the probes were used to create labels for the classifier. The 6 trials preceding an off-task response were labeled as mind-wandering, whereas the 6 trials predicting an on-task response were labeled as on-task. The EEG markers used as features for the classifier included single-trial P1, N1, and P3, the power and coherence in the theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8.5-12 Hz) bands at PO7, Pz, PO8, and Fz. We used a support vector machine as the training algorithm to learn the connection between EEG markers and the current mind-wandering state. We were able to distinguish between on-task and off-task thinking with an accuracy ranging from 0.50 to 0.85. Moreover, the classifiers were task-general: The average accuracy in across-task prediction was 60%, which was above chance level. Among all the extracted EEG markers, alpha power was most predictive of mind-wandering.

Dissociating the effect of flavor and nicotine in smokeless tobacco products using electroencephalography: The case of wintergreen flavors	ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS			English	Article						EEG; Nicotine; Flavor; Time-frequency decomposition; Smokeless tobacco; Addiction	CIGARETTE-SMOKING; BAND OSCILLATIONS; ODDBALL PARADIGM; CHEWING-GUM; P300; EEG; ALPHA; GAMMA; DEPRIVATION; INHIBITION	The increased consumption of tobacco products in recent years has been linked, among other factors, to the presence of added flavors. Although flavors are important in explaining consumption, their effects in the brain have until now been unexplored. In the present study, we investigated how electrophysiology can serve to dissociate the effects of nicotine and flavor. Participants attended 4 sessions (2-by-2 factorial design, with flavor and nicotine as within-subject factors), in each session an oddball task was performed before and after smokeless tobacco consumption. We explored the dissociation of neural responses to flavor and nicotine. While event-related potentials did not show modulation due to flavors, time-frequency showed a flavor-nicotine dissociation. Low-frequency activity (delta, theta and alpha) showed only effects of nicotine, and high-frequency activity (betal, beta2 and gamma) showed effects only susceptible to flavor. Flavors in smokeless tobacco not only made the product more desirable but also triggered the allocation of cognitive resources. This long-lasting effect of flavor may enhance the addictive potential of the tobacco product. Further research is being developed to determine the precise role of flavors in contributing to addiction. This is the first study investigating the neural effects of flavor (specifically wintergreen) in smokeless tobacco products. By understanding the effects of flavors in the brain we can explain the precipitants of tobacco consumption behaviors, and the addictive potential of flavors. Regulators will be able to determine if and in which amount flavors should be allowed in tobacco products.

Valdes			Which Reference Should We Use for EEG and ERP practice?	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Review						REST reference; Average reference; Linked-mastoids reference; Laplacian; Bipolar reference	REFERENCE ELECTRODE; LAPLACIAN ESTIMATE; AVERAGE REFERENCE; SCALP POTENTIALS; CURRENT-DENSITY; HEAD; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; DIPOLE; ZERO; LOCALIZATION	Which reference is appropriate for the scalp ERP and EEG studies? This unsettled problem still inspires unceasing debate. The ideal reference should be the one with zero or constant potential but unfortunately it is well known that no point on the body fulfills this condition. Consequently, more than ten references are used in the present EEG-ERP studies. This diversity seriously undermines the reproducibility and comparability of results across laboratories. A comprehensive review accompanied by a brief communication with rigorous derivations and notable properties (Hu et al. Brain Topogr, 2019. 10.1007/s10548-019-00706-y) is thus necessary to provide application-oriented principled recommendations. In this paper current popular references are classified into two categories: (1) unipolar references that construct a neutral reference, including both online unipolar references and offline re-references. Examples of unipolar references are the reference electrode standardization technique (REST), average reference (AR), and linked-mastoids/ears reference (LM); (2) non-unipolar references that include the bipolar reference and the Laplacian reference. We show that each reference is derived with a different assumption and serves different aims. We also note from (Hu et al. 2019) that there is a general form for the reference problem, the no memory' property of the unipolar references, and a unified estimator for the potentials at infinity termed as the regularized REST (rREST) which has more advantageous statistical evidence than AR. A thorough discussion of the advantages and limitations of references is provided with recommendations in the hope to clarify the role of each reference in the ERP and EEG practice.

The impact of bilateral eye movements on behavioral and neural responses during the Attention Network Test	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Bilateral eye-movements; Inconsistent handedness; Attention Network Test; N100; P200	INTERHEMISPHERIC INTERACTION; SACCADE EXECUTION; TARGET DETECTION; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; EEG COHERENCE; TOP-DOWN; MEMORY; HANDEDNESS; EMDR; RETRIEVAL	Bilateral eye movements (EMs) have been associated with enhancements in episodic memory and creativity. We explored the influence of EMs on behavior and event related potential (ERP) responses during the Attention Network Test (ANT). Participants completed ANT trials after bilateral EMs or a center-fixation control manipulation. We examined condition (EM, control) and handedness (consistent, inconsistent) differences for overall task performance, as well as alerting, orienting, and executive attention networks. Behaviorally, there was a trend for inconsistent-handed participants to display faster RTs across cue types, and greater accuracy for no cue, double, and center cue trials when compared to consistent handers, yet consistent handers garnered greater improvements in behavior following altering and orienting cues than inconsistent handers. Although there were no behavioral differences between EM and control conditions, target-locked N100 and P200 ERPs were weaker in the EM than control condition for all cue types, except spatial cues for which there were no differences between groups. Because stronger N100 and P200 responses have been linked to increased selective attention, we speculate that ERP differences between EM and control conditions, in the absence of behavioral differences, may indicate that participants exposed to EMs required less selective attention to successfully complete the task.

Appraisals of pain intensity from 10 other individuals were presented before the participants received identical electrical pain stimulation themselves. In reality, the presented other's pain appraisals, with either low or high in mean and variance, were generated by the experimenter, and were randomly paired with the subsequent electrical stimulation at either low or high intensity. Specifically, the mean and variance of others' pain appraisals were manipulated to induce participants' expectation and certainty to the upcoming pain. Subjective ratings of pain intensity and electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to the electrical stimulation, as well as anticipatory EEG activities measured prior to the onset of electrical stimulation, were compared. Results showed that the mean and variance of others' pain appraisal modulated the subjective pain ratings and the affective-motivational P2 responses elicited by the electrical stimulation, as well as anticipatory sensorimotor alpha-oscillation measured before the onset of pain stimulation. When the mean of others' pain appraisal was low, higher variance suppressed the sensorimotor alpha-oscillations and enhanced subsequent pain perception. In contrast, when the mean was high, the higher variance enhanced sensorimotor alpha-oscillations and suppressed subsequent pain perception. These results demonstrated that others' pain appraisals can modulate both of the anticipation and perception of first-hand pain. It also suggested that the top-down modulation of others' pain appraisals on pain perception could be partially driven by the different brain states during the anticipation stage, as captured by the prestimulus sensorimotor alpha-oscillations.

As a new kind of drug, methamphetamine (meth) spreads rapidly among people, and its number of users has ranked second in the world. In recent years, more and more studies have been conducted on meth users using EEG signals. However, most of the current studies have only performed ERP analysis and psychological tests on meth patients. In this study, 40 subjects were asked to receive specific stimuli and give correct feedback, and their EEG signals were recorded in the process. Statistical analysis showed that the differences in the extracted features between the two groups were significant. The electrode pairs with significant difference between the two groups were selected as the classification features, and the accuracy rate of recognition could reach more than 70 percent.

Much research effort has been undertaken to evaluate the usefulness of neurophysiological (EEG) data to aid this diagnostic process. In the current study, we applied deep learning methods on event-related EEG data to examine whether it is possible to distinguish ADHD patients from healthy controls using purely neurophysiological measures. The same was done to distinguish between ADHD subtypes. The results show that the applied deep learning model (EEGNet) was able to distinguish between both ADHD subtypes and healthy controls with an accuracy of up to 83%. However, a significant fraction of individuals could not be classified correctly. It is shown that neurophysiological processes indicating attentional selection associated with superior parietal cortical areas were the most important for that. Using the applied deep learning method, it was not possible to distinguish ADHD subtypes from each other. This is the first study showing that deep learning methods applied to EEG data are able to dissociate between ADHD patients and healthy controls. The results show that the applied method reflects a promising means to support clinical diagnosis in ADHD. However, more work needs to be done to increase the reliability of the taken approach.

A varying sample of familiar faces is necessary to disentangle image-level from person-level processing. We investigated the time course of face identity processing using a multivariate electroencephalography analysis. Participants saw ambient exemplars of celebrity faces that differed in pose, lighting, hairstyle, and so forth. A name prime preceded a face on half of the trials to preactivate person-specific information, whereas a neutral prime was used on the remaining half. This manipulation helped dissociate perceptual- and semantic-based identification. Two time intervals within the post-face onset electroencephalography epoch were sensitive to person identity. The early perceptual phase spanned 110-228 msec and was not modulated by the name prime. The late semantic phase spanned 252-1000 msec and was sensitive to person knowledge activated by the name prime. Within this late phase, the identity response occurred earlier in time (300-600 msec) for the name prime with a scalp topography similar to the FN400 ERP. This may reflect a matching of the person primed in memory with the face on the screen. Following a neutral prime, the identity response occurred later in time (500-800 msec) with a scalp topography similar to the P600f ERP. This may reflect activation of semantic knowledge associated with the identity. Our results suggest that processing of identity begins early (110 msec), with some tolerance to image-level variations, and then progresses in stages sensitive to perceptual and then to semantic features.

To date, only few studies have investigated whether this deficit in PD is reflected in reduced mismatch negativity (MMN), an event-related potential indexing preattentive sensitivity to unexpected stimulus changes. We tested 35 patients affected by PD and 42 matched healthy controls in an oddball paradigm, using frequency and duration deviant stimuli to measure auditory MMN. PD patients displayed reduced duration MMN amplitudes in comparison to healthy controls. No group differences were detected for duration MMN latency, as well as frequency MMN indices. Results support the notion of reduced larly with regard to the preattentive processing of sound duration deviants. Additionally, our findings are in line with clinical studies reporting divergent deficits in preattentive processing of frequency and duration deviants. (C) 2019 S.

Evoked Potentials Investigations of Deficit Versus Nondeficit Schizophrenia: EEG-MEG Preliminary Data	CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						coherence source imaging; P300; sensory gating; P50; N100; P200	NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; BIOLOGICAL MARKERS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; ABNORMALITIES; IMPAIRMENT; DIAGNOSIS; SUBTYPE	Heterogeneity of schizophrenia is a major obstacle toward understanding the disorder. One likely subtype is the deficit syndrome (DS) where patients suffer from predominantly negative symptoms. This study investigated the evoked responses and the evoked magnetic fields to identify the neurophysiological deviations associated with the DS. Ten subjects were recruited for each group (Control, DS, and Nondeficit schizophrenia [NDS]). Subjects underwent magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) testing while listening to an oddball paradigm to generate the P300 as well as a paired click paradigm to generate the mid-latency auditory-evoked responses (MLAER) in a sensory gating paradigm. MEG-coherence source imaging (CSI) during P300 task revealed a significantly higher average coherence value in DS than NDS subjects in the gamma band (30-80 Hz), when listening to standard stimuli but only NDS subjects had a higher average coherence level in the gamma band than controls when listening to the novel sounds. P50, N100, and P3a ERP amplitudes (EEG analysis) were significantly decreased in NDS compared with DS subjects. The data suggest that the deviations in the 2 patient groups are qualitatively different. Deviances in NDS patients suggest difficulty in both early (as in the gating paradigm), as well as later top-down processes (P300 paradigm). The main deviation in the DS group was an exaggerated responsiveness to ongoing irrelevant stimuli detected by EEG whereas NDS subjects had an exaggerated response to novelty.

We recently proposed an adaptation of the ASR method using Riemannian geometry (rASR) and found that rASR outperforms ASR in terms of artifact correction capabilities and speed. In our previous investigation we focused on event-related potentials and eye-blink artifacts, in this analysis we extend our recent work by evaluating the performance of rASR in preserving a well-studied oscillation (alpha) while correcting muscle artifacts captured in the EEG data recorded with sparse electrode coverage. We use EEG data recorded with behind-the-ear electrodes (cEEGrid) and find that rASR preserves the power of the alpha frequency band while correcting the muscle artifacts in the EEG data successfully.

Inhibition-related differences between tic-free and tic-related obsessive-compulsive disorder: evidence from the N2 and P3	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Obsessive-compulsive disorder; Tic disorders; EEG; Electroencephalography; N2; P3; Response inhibition	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; STOP-SIGNAL; TOURETTE-SYNDROME; GO/NOGO TASK; COGNITIVE FLEXIBILITY; MOTOR INHIBITION; PERFORMANCE; GILLES; HYPERACTIVITY	Tic-related OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) was introduced as an OCD subtype in the DSM-5 based mainly on family and clinical data that showed differences between OCD in dependence of accompanying tics. Little is known, however, regarding neurocognitive differences between subtypes. We used the stop-signal task to examine whether differences exist in response inhibition between OCD patients without tics (n = 21), patients with tic-related OCD (n = 12), and 21 healthy controls. The groups were carefully matched for gender, age and level of education. The stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) and inhibition-related N2 and P3 were used to examine behavioral and neural correlates of response inhibition and inhibition-related processes. In the SSRT, no difference was found between groups. P3 amplitude was larger in tic-free compared to tic-related OCD and healthy controls. No group differences were found in the N2 amplitude. For tic-related OCD, SSRT data indicate intact response inhibition, and P3 data indicate intact neural aftereffects of inhibition like the evaluation of the outcome. This is similar to what is found in patients with TD and may, thus, be interpreted as a support for shared mechanisms in relation to TD. In OCD, alterations in P3 amplitude indicate hyperactivity in the evaluation of the outcome of the inhibition process. This is in line with hyperactivity generally found in performance monitoring in OCD.

Predicting Clinical Gains and Side Effects of Stimulant Medication in Pediatric Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder by Combining Measures From qEEG and ERPs in a Cued GO/NOGO Task	CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ADHD; stimulants; predictions; ERPs; qEEG	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; INDEPENDENT COMPONENTS; METHYLPHENIDATE; CHILDREN; PERFORMANCE; ARTIFACTS; SYSTEM; ADULTS	Objectives. The study aim was to develop 2 scales: predicting clinical gains and risk of acute side effects of stimulant medication in pediatric attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), combining measures from EEG spectra, event-related potentials (ERPs), and a cued visual GO/NOGO task. Methods. Based on 4-week systematic medication trials, 87 ADHD patients aged 8 to 17 years were classified as responders (REs, n = 62) or non-REs (n = 25), and belonging to the side effects (SEs, n = 42) or no-SEs (n = 45) groups. Before starting the trial, a 19-channel EEG was registered twice: Test 1 (T1) without medication and T2 on a single dose of stimulant medication a few days before the trial. EEG was registered T1 and T2: 3 minutes eyes-closed, 3 minutes eyes-open, and 20 minutes cued GO/NOGO. EEG spectra, ERPs, omissions, commissions, reaction time (RT), and RT variability were computed. Groups were compared at T1 and T2 on quantitative EEG (qEEG), ERPs and behavioral parameters; effect sizes (d) were estimated. Variables with d > 0.5 were converted to quartiles, multiplied by corresponding d, and summed to obtain 2 global scales. Results. Six variables differed significantly between REs and non-REs (T1: theta/alpha ratio, P3NOGO amplitude. Differences T2-T1: Omissions, RT variability, P3NOGO, contingent negative variation [CNV]). The global scale d was 1.86. Accuracy (receiver operating characteristic) was 0.92. SEs and no-SEs differed significantly on 4 variables. (T1: RT, T2: novelty component and alpha peak frequency, and RT changes. Global scale d = 1.08 and accuracy = 0.78. Conclusion. Gains and side effects of stimulants in pediatric ADHD can be predicted with high accuracy by combining EEG spectra, ERPs, and behavior from baseline and single-dose tests. identifier: NCT02695355.

There is evidence that with regard to trigeminal perception, PD-related olfactory dysfunction is different from other olfactory disorders. More specifically, trigeminal sensitivity, when measured behaviorally, was unimpaired in PD patients as opposed to patients with non-Parkinsonian olfactory dysfunction (NPOD). We sought to investigate the trigeminal pathway by measuring electrophysiological recordings from the nasal epithelium and EEG-derived event-related potentials in response to a specific trigeminal stimulus in 21 PD patients and compare them to 23 patients with NPOD and 25 controls (C). The peripheral trigeminal response, as measured by the negative-mucosa potential, showed no difference between patients with PD and controls whereas PD patients showed faster responses than patients with NPOD, the latter having shown slower and larger responses than controls (18 PD, 14 NPOD, 20 C). The central trigeminal response, as measured by event-related potentials, revealed larger early component response in PD patients compared to patients with NPOD (15 PD, 21 NPOD, 23 C). As expected, psychophysical olfactory testing showed impaired olfactory function in both groups of patients as opposed to controls. Discriminant analysis revealed a model that could predict group membership for 80% of participants based on the negative-mucosa potential latency, olfactory threshold and discrimination tests. These results provide novel insights into the pattern of trigeminal activation in PD which will help to differentiate PD-related olfactory loss from NPOD, a crucial step towards establishing early screening batteries for PD including smell tests.

One of these technologies is a vibro-kinetic motion scat, which provides high fidelity haptic feedback perfectly synchronized with the movie scenes. This article investigates the effect of this technology on product placement memorization. Using electroencephalography to measure implicit memorization and a brand recognition task to measure explicit memorization, we studied the difference between an artistically enhanced high fidelity vibro-kinetic feedback cinema experience and a traditional audiovisual cinematic experience. Results of a within-subject experiment suggest that there is no difference between these two conditions for explicit memorization. However, for implicit memorization, the high fidelity vibro-kinetic experience produces increased frontal amplitude on the P3 component of the event-related potential, whereas the classical audio-visual cinematic experience produces increased parietal amplitude on the P3 component of the event related potential. This suggests that the high fidelity vibro-kinetic experience has an implicit effect on a spectator's memorization, which is in line with prior research in that it points to the creation of a stronger associative network leading to more complete memories.

We present a custom portable EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) that exploits Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) induced with an oddball experimental paradigm to control the infotainment menu of a car. A preliminary evaluation of the system was performed on 10 participants in a standard laboratory setting and while driving on a closed private track. The task consisted of repeated presentations of 6 different menu icons in oddball fashion. Subject-specific models were trained with different machine learning approaches on cerebral data from either only laboratory or driving experiments (in-lab and in-car models) or a combination of the two (hybrid model) to classify EEG responses to target and non-target stimuli. All models were tested on the subjects' last in-car sessions that were not used for the training. Analysis of ERPs amplitude showed statistically significant (p < 0.05) differences between the EEG responses associated with target and non-target icons, both in the laboratory and while driving. Classification Accuracy (CA) was above chance level for all subjects in all training configurations, with a deep CNN trained on the hybrid set achieving the highest scores (mean CA = 53 +/- 12 %, with 16 % chance level for the 6-class discrimination). The ranking of the features importance provided by a classical BCI approach suggests an ERP-based discrimination between target and non-target responses. No statistical differences were observed between the CAs for the in-lab and in-car training sets, nor between the EEG responses in these conditions, indicating that the data collected in the standard laboratory setting could be readily used for a real driving application without a noticeable decrease in performance. However, refining the model with real-world data might be beneficial. While there is still room for improvement, the results demonstrate the feasibility of a brain-based control of the car infotainment while driving.

It is widely accepted that segments are the primary units used in Indo-European languages. However, it is controversial what the functional units (syllables or segments) in Chinese spoken word production are. In the present study, Mandarin Chinese speakers named pictures while ignoring distractor words presented simultaneously, which shared atonal syllables, bodies or rhymes, or were unrelated with the name of the target pictures. Behavioral results showed that naming latencies in the 3 phonologically-related conditions were significantly shorter than those associated with the unrelated condition. EEG data indicated that the syllable-related condition modulated event-related potentials (ERPs) in a time window of 320-500 ms, the body-related condition modulated ERPs from 370-420 ms, while the rhyme-related condition modulated ERPs from 400-450 ms. The starting points for evident syllable, body, and rhyme priming effects were 322 ms, 368 ms, and 408 ms (by the Guthrie & Buchwald method) or 340 ms, 372 ms and 403 ms (by the jackknife procedure), respectively. Our findings provide a relative temporal course of syllable and segment encoding in Chinese spoken naming: Syllables are retrieved before segments, and constitute the primary processing units during the early stage of word-form encoding.

Based on these observations, here we isolate specific neural signatures for the rapid categorization of each of 5 basic expressions, i.e., when they are directly discriminated from all other facial expressions. Scalp EEG was recorded in 15 participants presented with pictures alternating at a rapid 6 Hz rate (i.e., one fixation/face, backward- and forward-masked). In different stimulation sequences, an expressive (angry, disgusted, happy, fearful, or sad) or a neutral face arose every 5 pictures (i.e., at 6/5 = 1.2 Hz), among pictures of the same individual expressing the other emotions randomly. Frequency-domain analysis indicated a robust (i.e., recorded in every individual participant) and objective (i.e., at the predefined 1.2 Hz frequency and its harmonics) expression-specific brain response over occipito-temporal sites for each emotion and neutrality. In this context of variable expressions, while neural responses to the different expressions (Anger, Disgust, Happiness, Sadness) were dissimilar qualitatively, a much larger specific signature for neutral faces as compared to facial expressions was found. Interestingly, Fear also elicited a strong contrasted response with other facial expressions, associated with a specific neural signature over ventral occipito-temporal sites. Collectively, these findings reveal that specific EEG signatures for different facial expressions can be isolated in the human brain, pointing to partially different neural substrates. In addition, they provide support for a strong and highly selective neural response to fear at the system-level, in line with the importance of this emotional expression for biological survival.

Brain vital signs detect concussion-related neurophysiological impairments in ice hockey	BRAIN			English	Article						quantified electroencephalography; cognitive evoked potentials; event-related potentials	WHITE-MATTER; IMPACTS	There is a growing demand for objective evaluations of concussion. We developed a portable evoked potential framework to extract brain vital signs' using electroencephalography. Brain vital signs were derived from well established evoked responses representing auditory sensation (N100), basic attention (P300), and cognitive processing (N400) amplitudes and latencies, converted to normative metrics (six total). The study evaluated whether concussion-related neurophysiological impairments were detected over the duration of ice hockey seasons using brain vital signs. Forty-seven Tier III, Junior A, male ice hockey players were monitored over two seasons. Twelve sustained concussions after baseline testing then completed post-injury and return-to-play assessments. Twenty-three were not diagnosed with a concussion during the season and completed both baseline and post-season testing. Scores were evaluated using a repeated-measures analysis of variance with post hoc two-tailed paired t-tests. Concussion resulted in significantly increased amplitude and delayed latency scores for all six brain vital signs (P < 0.0001). Importantly, significant changes at return-to-play were also detected in basic attention (P300) amplitude, indicating persistent subclinical impairment. In the non-concussed group, there was also a significant change between baseline and post-season (P = 0.0047), with specific decreases in cognitive processing (N400) speed (P = 0.011) and overall total score (P = 0.002).

Brain computer interface (BCI) can detect a user's intention and provide them with brain state-dependent feedback to assist with patient rehabilitation. We investigated the effects of a combined BCI-AO game on power of mu band attenuation in stroke patients. Nineteen patients with subacute stroke were recruited. A BCI-AO game provided real-time feedback to participants regarding their attention to a flickering action video using steady-state visual-evoked potentials. All participants watched a video of repetitive grasping actions under two conditions: (1) BCI-AO game and (2) conventional AO, in random order. In the BCI-AO game, feedback on participants' observation scores and observation time was provided. In conventional AO, a non-flickering video and no feedback were provided. The magnitude of mu suppression in the central motor, temporal, parietal, and occipital areas was significantly higher in the BCI-AO game than in the conventional AO. The magnitude of mu suppression was significantly higher in the BCI-AO game than in the conventional AO both in the affected and unaffected hemispheres. These results support the facilitatory effects of the BCI-AO game on mu suppression over conventional AO.

Having your cake and eating it too: Flexibility and power with mass univariate statistics for ERP data	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; ERP; mass univariate; multiple comparisons; power; replicability; statistics	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; BRAIN POTENTIALS/FIELDS; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; SCALP DISTRIBUTIONS; PERMUTATION TESTS; P VALUES; EEG; REPLICABILITY; PREVALENCE; PSYCHOLOGY	ERP studies produce large spatiotemporal data sets. These rich data sets are key to enabling us to understand cognitive and neural processes. However, they also present a massive multiple comparisons problem, potentially leading to a large number of studies with false positive effects (a high Type I error rate). Standard approaches to ERP statistical analysis, which average over time windows and regions of interest, do not always control for Type I error, and their inflexibility can lead to low power to detect true effects. Mass univariate approaches offer an alternative analytic method. However, they have thus far been viewed as appropriate primarily for exploratory statistical analysis and only applicable to simple designs. Here, we present new simulation studies showing that permutation-based mass univariate tests can be employed with complex factorial designs. Most importantly, we show that mass univariate approaches provide slightly greater power than traditional spatiotemporal averaging approaches when strong a priori time windows and spatial regions are used. Moreover, their power decreases only modestly when more exploratory spatiotemporal parameters are used. We argue that mass univariate approaches are preferable to traditional spatiotemporal averaging analysis approaches for many ERP studies.

Identifying neurobiological markers that are associated with the onset or course of this disorder in childhood and adolescence is important for early recognition and intervention and, potentially, for the prevention of illness onset. In this systematic review, 68 longitudinal neuroimaging studies, from 34 unique samples, that examined the association of neuroimaging markers with onset or changes in paediatric depression published up to 1 February 2019 were examined. These studies employed different imaging modalities at baseline; structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), functional MRI (fMRI) or electroencephalography (EEG). Most consistent evidence across studies was found for blunted reward-related (striatal) activity (fMRI and EEG) as a potential biological marker for both MDD onset and course. With regard to structural brain measures, the results were highly inconsistent, likely caused by insufficient power to detect complex mediating effects of genetic and environmental factors in small sample sizes. Overall, there were a limited number of samples, and confounding factors such as sex and pubertal development were often not considered, whereas these factors are likely to be relevant especially in this age range.

BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						event-related potentials (ERPs); P300; aggression; startle reflex modulation (SRM); self-report; emotion	SOCIAL DESIRABILITY BIAS; EMOTION; P300; ATTENTION; BEHAVIOR; IMPULSIVENESS; STIMULI	Increased violence and aggressive tendencies are a problem in much of the world and are often symptomatic of many other neurological and psychiatric conditions. Among clinicians, current methods of diagnosis of problem aggressive behaviour rely heavily on the use of self-report measures as described by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition (DSM-5) and International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10). This approach does not place adequate emphasis on objective measures that are potentially sensitive to processes not feeding into subjective self-report. Numerous studies provide evidence that attitudes and affective content can be processed without leading to verbalised output. This exploratory study aimed to determine whether individuals in the normal population, grouped by self-reported aggression, differed in subjective versus objective affective processing. Participants (N = 52) were grouped based on their responses to the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory. They were then presented with affect-inducing images while brain event-related potentials (ERPs) and startle reflex modulation (SRM) were recorded to determine non-language-based processes. Explicit valence and arousal ratings for each image were taken to determine subjective affective effects. Results indicated no significant group differences for explicit ratings and SRM. However, ERP results demonstrated significant group differences between the 'pleasant' and 'violent' emotion condition in the frontal, central and parietal areas across both hemispheres. These findings suggest that parts of the brain process affective stimuli different to what conscious appraisal comes up with in participants varying in self-reported aggression.

Furthermore, the precise neuro-cognitive mechanisms underlying stress effects on episodic encoding in humans are largely unknown. To address these questions, in the present study we recorded EEG activity while male participants encoded neutral, negative and positive words, each paired with another word that was always neutral. Immediately before encoding, half of the participants experienced a psychosocial stressor, the Trier Social Stress Test, while the other half underwent a control procedure. Twenty-four hours later, participants completed separate item and associative recognition tests. Pre-learning stress enhanced item recognition accuracy for the positive, but not for the negative words. By contrast, there was no evidence for stress effects on associative recognition. The increase in item recognition was accompanied by a higher familiarity-, but not recollection-, based item retrieval of positive and neutral, but not negative words. Crucially, in the event-related potential (ERP) stress affected the amplitude of the frontal slow wave in general, and the frontal slow wave subsequent memory effect for positive words in specific, and the subsequent memory effect was correlated with cortisol levels after the stress manipulation. Our results suggest that positive words are encoded more elaboratively under stress, leading to a higher likelihood of subsequent item retrieval. An interaction of cortisol with frontal-lobe dependent control processes as well as a shift in attentional biases may contribute to this stress-induced modulation of episodic encoding.

Search asymmetry in a serial auditory task: Neural source analyses of EEG implicate attention strategies	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Auditory search asymmetry; P3a; P3b; Ventral attention network; Dorsal attention network; Functional connectivity	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; VISUAL-SEARCH; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; COMPONENTS; DYNAMICS; P300; GENERATORS	Here we report a detailed analysis of the fast network dynamics underlying P3a and P3b event-related potential (ERP) subcomponents generated during an unconventional serial auditory search paradigm. We dissect the electroencephalographic (EEG) data from an earlier study of ours, using a variety of advanced signal processing techniques, in order to discover how the brain is processing auditory targets differently when they possess a rare, salient, unpredictable feature not shared with distractors than when targets lack this feature but distractors have it. We find that brain regions associated with the Ventral Attention Network (VAN) are the primary neural generators of the P3a subcomponent in response to feature-present targets, whereas regions associated with the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN), as well as regions associated with detecting auditory oddball stimuli (ODD), may be the primary neural generators of the P3b, in the context of our study, and perhaps in search paradigms in general. Moreover, measurements of the time courses of oscillatory power changes and inter-regional synchronization in theta and low-gamma frequency bands were consistent with the early activation and synchronization within the VAN associated with the P3a subcomponent, and with the later activation and synchronization within the DAN and ODD networks associated with the P3b subcomponent. Implications of these finding for the mechanisms underlying search asymmetry phenomena are discussed.

Yet, only recently the role of sensory mechanisms for response inhibition has been addressed and neurophysiological mechanisms are far from being understood. Here we ask in how far the physical intensity of stimuli is a relevant perceptual factor modulating motor inhibitory control. We investigated how different physical (objective) stimulus and the subjectively perceived stimulus magnitude modulated response inhibition and its neurophysiological correlates. To this end we used a somatosensory GO/NOGO task in combination with EEG recordings and applied temporal signal decomposition and source localization methods. The behavioral (false alarm) data clearly demonstrated that response inhibition performance was worse in the subjective and objective stimulation condition as compared to the reference stimulation condition with higher stimulus magnitude. Despite primary perceptual aspects were manipulated, neurophysiological correlates of lower-level perceptual and attentional selection processes did not explain effects on overt response inhibition behavior. Rather, neurophysiological processes at the response selection level were modulated. These were associated with activation differences in the right inferior frontal gyms and suggest that "braking processes" enabling the inhibition of a to-be-executed motor response were modulated. The modulation of these braking processes depends on objective physical magnitude of incoming sensory information and not the subjectively perceived stimulus magnitude.

For this reason, it is important to find sensitive endophenotypes, which may disentangle the two disorders. The Shine-Through paradigm, a visual backward masking task, is a potential endophenotype for schizophrenia. Masking is strongly deteriorated in schizophrenia patients, which is reflected in reduced EEG amplitudes. Here, we tested whether masking deficits and associated EEG changes are also found in patients with major depressive disorder. First, we replicated previous findings showing that depressive patients exhibit, at most, only weak masking deficits. Second, we found that the EEG amplitudes of depressive patients were reduced compared to controls and slightly increased compared to schizophrenia patients. As a secondary analysis, we compared the performance in the masking paradigm with three cognitive tasks, namely: the Wisconsin card sorting test, a verbal fluency WA and a degraded continuous performance test. Performance in all but the verbal fluency test could discriminate schizophrenia from depression.

Activity in Functional Cortical Networks Temporally Associated with Postural Instability	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						balance control; EEG; perturbation-evoked potential N1; functional connectivity; coherence; graph theory	EVENT-RELATED COHERENCE; BRAIN NETWORKS; TREADMILL WALKING; BALANCE CONTROL; EEG; CONNECTIVITY; POTENTIALS; CORTEX; PHASE; MOTOR	Human bipedal balance control is proposed to be the integrated activity of distributed neural areas. There is growing understanding about the cortical involvement in this highly automated behavior. While evidence exists for cortical activity temporally linked to reactive balance control, little is known about the functional interaction of potential cortical regions. Here, we used functional connectivity and graph theoretical analysis to derive functional cortical networks during reactive balance control from an event-related potential evoked by external perturbation known as the perturbation-evoked potential N1 (PEP N1). Fourteen healthy young adults were subjected to temporally unpredictable postural perturbations using a custom-made lean and release cable system. Electroencephalographic signals were recorded using a 64-channel electrode cap and segmented around perturbation onset. Functional connectivity was analyzed in source-space and sensor-space using coherence measures and functional cortical networks were characterized using graph measures. The results suggest that there might exist a balance control cortical network while standing and rapid, transient, and frequency-specific reorganization occurs in this network during reactive balance control events. This reorganization was characterized by an increased number of short-range connections between neighboring areas and increased strength between connections in delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands during PEP N1 compared to baseline. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the existence of functional cortical networks during reactive balance control with potential implications on assessing impaired balance associated with various neural diseases.

Sustained vigilance is negatively affected by mild and acute sleep loss reflected by reduced capacity for decision making, motor preparation, and execution	SLEEP			English	Article						sleep restriction; arousal; event-related potentials; vigilance; sleepiness; psychomotor	DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP; DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME; PSYCHOMOTOR VIGILANCE; NEUROBEHAVIORAL PERFORMANCE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; EEG; TASK; RESTRICTION; CONSEQUENCES; DEPRIVATION	Study Objectives: The behavioral and cognitive consequences of severe sleep deprivation are well understood. Surprisingly, relatively little is known about the neural correlates of mild and acute sleep restriction on tasks that require sustained vigilance for prolonged periods of time during the day. Methods and Results: Event-related potential (ERP) paradigms can reveal insight into the neural correlates underlying visual processing and behavioral responding that is impaired with reduced alertness, as a consequence of sleep loss. Here, we investigated the impact of reduced vigilance following at-home mild sleep restriction to better understand the associated behavioral consequences and changes in information processing revealed by ERPs. As expected, vigilance was reduced (e.g. increased lapses and response slowing) that increased over the course of the experiment in the "sleep restricted" (5 hr sleep) compared with the "sleep-extension" (9 hr sleep) condition. Corresponding to these lapses, we found decreased positivity of visually evoked potentials in the Sleep Restriction vs. Sleep Extension condition emerging from 316 to 449 ms, maximal over parietal/occipital cortex. We also investigated electrophysiological signs of motor-related processing by comparing lateralized readiness potentials (LRPs) and found reduced positivity of LRPs in the Sleep Restriction vs. Sleep Extension condition at 70-40 ms before, and 115-158 ms after a response was made. Conclusions: These results suggest that even a single night of mild sleep restriction can negatively affect vigilance, reflected by reduced processing capacity for decision making, and dulls motor preparation and execution. Statement of Significance Even a small amount of sleep loss can affect daytime performance, particularly in the face of monotonous tasks. However, relatively little is known about the neural basis of mild and acute sleep restriction. We investigated the electrophysiological correlates and behavioral consequences of only 2 hr of at-home sleep restriction. This amount of sleep loss negatively affected sustained vigilance. Event-related brain potentials showed that sleep loss reduced processing capacity for decision making, motor preparation, and execution. These may serve as an electrophysiological index of drowsiness. Thus, even a seemingly innocuous amount of sleep loss could be hazardous in certain situations (e.g. following daylight savings, in the workplace, and long-haul highway driving). Future studies could employ functional neuroimaging techniques to better understand the brain regions and functional brain connectivity affected by only a small amount of sleep restriction.

The aim of the present study was to explore whether face stimuli can be used in an ERP-based RSVP paradigm to infer recognition of broadly familiar faces. To do this, we explored whether famous faces differentially break into awareness when presented in RSVP and, importantly, whether ERPs can be used to detect these breakthrough events on an individual basis. Our findings provide evidence that famous faces are differentially perceived and processed by participants' brains as compared to novel (or unfamiliar) faces. EEG data revealed large differences in brain responses between these conditions.

This rhythmic oscillatory activity is present during both rest and task performance. The most visible rhythm in the adult human brain is in the band between approximately 8-12 Hz, and is referred to as alpha activity. While sometimes dismissed by neurophysiologists as a nuisance biological artefact, since it often interferes with the recording of event-related potentials (ERPs), there has been an explosion of research linking it to specific functional roles in cognition and behavior over the past two decades. Here, we review some of the research into the functional significance of alpha oscillations with respect to attention and expectation. We focus our discussion on how the amplitude and phase of alpha activity might be involved in the prioritization of relevant sensory input. In addition to summarizing the literature, we also endeavor to provide a critical appraisal as well as highlight limitations and conceptual gaps in the field.

Given the aging society, it is important to understand the neural mechanisms constraining perception in the elderly. In young participants, the state of rhythmic brain activity prior to a stimulus has been shown to modulate the neural encoding and perceptual impact of this stimulus - yet it remains unclear whether, and if so, how, the perceptual relevance of pre-stimulus activity changes with age. Using the auditory system as a model, we recorded EEG activity during a frequency discrimination task from younger and older human listeners. By combining single-trial EEG decoding with linear modelling we demonstrate consistent statistical relations between pre-stimulus power and the encoding of sensory evidence in short-latency EEG components, and more variable relations between pre-stimulus phase and subjects' decisions in longer-latency components. At the same time, we observed a significant slowing of auditory evoked responses and a flattening of the overall EEG frequency spectrum in the older listeners. Our results point to mechanistically consistent relations between rhythmic brain activity and sensory encoding that emerge despite changes in neural response latencies and the relative amplitude of rhythmic brain activity with age.

Building on evidence that information semantically incongruent with its context elicits an N400 response (a prominent negative-going deflection in the ongoing electroencephalogram; EEG), we hypothesized that statements incongruent (relative to congruent) with basic standards of amicable treatment by others (e.g., "Your friend breaks your computer and then laughs [apologizes]") would elicit larger-amplitude N400 responses. EEG was recorded from N = 20 undergraduates while they viewed 106 semantic-dimension and 106 social-dimension sentences. We obtained the classic N400 effect to semantic violations,. but we did not observe greater N400 amplitudes to incongruent than to congruent social-dimension sentences. Our findings of N400 modulation by semantic violations but not social norm violations help clarify potential boundary conditions for eliciting the N400.

When facing a moral conflict that can bring a gain or loss for a decision-maker but a corresponding loss or gain for others, the decision-maker's choice of resolution strategy lies in its relating to gain-loss asymmetry by placing greater utility weight on his or her immediate gains and delayed losses. Although many neuroimaging studies have unveiled the neural mechanisms that underlie moral decision-making, little attention has been paid to the temporal dynamics of how a decision-maker assesses utility weights differently for a moral (or adaptive) choice that will bring loss (or gain) to himself (and others) when the outcome will be realized in the near versus distant future. This study identifies the electrophysiological mechanisms of time-dependent assessment in individuals' moral conflict resolution strategies. Twenty-two participants were given a set of moral dilemmas with time intervals that varied from the near future to the distant future. Participants chose between two conflicting options: a self-interest-seeking immoral choice (adaptive) and a principled moral choice (moral). Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded, and movement-related potentials (MRPs) were analyzed by being response-locked to individual moral choices. Behavioral results showed that participants took more time to respond and were more likely to make adaptive choices under the near-future condition. When the participants faced moral dilemmas, their brain waves manifested medial frontal negativity (MFN) at early stage ERP of 200-400 ms, possibly reflecting an internal moral conflict. Participants then exhibited larger late positive potentials (LPP) under the near-future condition. In addition, greater effort in implementing motor preparation was found under the near-future condition than under the distant future condition, as supported by the larger Bereitschaftspotential (BP) in the anterior areas. Our results illustrate the temporal dynamics of the electrophysiological mechanisms that underlie time-dependent assessments in moral decision-making, as human brains discount the decision utility of the moral outcomes that will occur in the distant future.

J	Menceloglu, M; Grabowecky, M; Suzuki, S				Menceloglu, Melisa; Grabowecky, Marcia; Suzuki, Satoru			Neural, functional, and aesthetic impacts of spatially heterogeneous flicker: A potential role of natural flicker	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; TEMPORAL PROPERTIES; PERCEPTION; ALPHA; FEEDFORWARD; REFLECTS; FEEDBACK; GAMMA; BETA	Spatially heterogeneous flicker, characterized by probabilistic and locally independent luminance modulations, abounds in nature. It is generated by flames, water surfaces, rustling leaves, and so on, and it is pleasant to the senses. It affords spatiotemporal multistability that allows sensory activation conforming to the biases of the visual system, thereby generating the perception of spontaneous motion and likely facilitating the calibration of motion detectors. One may thus hypothesize that spatially heterogeneous flicker might potentially provide restoring stimuli to the visual system that engage fluent (requiring minimal top-down control) and self-calibrating processes. Here, we present some converging behavioral and electrophysiological evidence consistent with this idea. Spatially heterogeneous (multistable) flicker (relative to controls matched in temporal statistics) reduced posterior EEG (electroencephalography) beta power implicated in long-range neural interactions that impose top-down influences on sensory processing. Further, the degree of spatiotemporal multistability, the amount of posterior beta-power reduction, and the aesthetic responses to flicker were closely associated. These results are consistent with the idea that the pleasantness of natural flicker may derive from its spatiotemporal multistability that affords fluent and self-calibrating visual processing.

This paper attempts to identify a possible link between changes in brain blood flow and neuronal activity during microgravity. Middle cerebral artery flow velocity (MCAv) was measured using Doppler ultrasound. Brain cortical activity (i.e., cortical current density) was measured using electroencephalography. Finger blood pressure was recorded and exported to generate beat-by-beat systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), and cerebrovascular conductance index (CVCi). Seventeen participants were evaluated under normal gravity conditions and microgravity conditions, during 15 bouts of 22-s intervals of weightlessness during a parabolic flight. Although MAP decreased and CO increased, MCAv remained unchanged in the microgravity condition. CVCi as the quotient of MCAv and MAP increased in microgravity. Cortical current density showed a global decrease. Our data support earlier data reporting a decrease in the amplitude of event-related potentials recorded during microgravity. However, the general decrease in neural excitability in microgravity seems not to be dependent on hemodynamic changes.

Rationale: The MMN waveform has an increased average delay in ALS. MMN has been attributed to change detection and involuntary attention switching. This therefore indicates pathological impairment of the neural network components which generate these functions. Source localisation can mitigate the poor spatial resolution of sensor-level EEG analysis by associating the sensor-level signals to the contributing brain sources. The functional activity in each generating source can therefore be individually measured and investigated as a quantitative biomarker of impairment in ALS or its sub-phenotypes. Methods: MMN responses from 128-channel electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in 58 ALS patients and 39 healthy controls were localised to source by three separate localisation methods, including beamforming, dipole fitting and exact low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography. Results: Compared with controls, ALS patients showed significant increase in power of the left posterior parietal, central and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (false discovery rate = 0.1). This change correlated with impaired cognitive flexibility (rho = 0.45, 0.45, 0.47, p = .042, .055, .031 respectively). ALS patients also exhibited a decrease in the power of dipoles representing activity in the inferior frontal (left p = 5.16 x 10(-6), right p = 1.07 x 10(-5)) and left superior temporal gyri (p = 9.30 x 10(-6)). These patterns were detected across three source localisation methods. Decrease in right inferior frontal gyrus activity was a good discriminator of ALS patients from controls (AUROC = 0.77) and an excellent discriminator of C9ORF72 expansion-positive patients from controls (AUROC = 0.95). Interpretation: Source localization of evoked potentials can reliably discriminate patterns of functional network impairment in ALS and ALS subgroups during involuntary attention switching. The discriminative ability of the detected cognitive changes in specific brain regions are comparable to those of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Source analysis of high-density EEG patterns has excellent potential to provide non-invasive, data-driven quantitative biomarkers of network disruption that could be harnessed as novel neurophysiology-based outcome measures in clinical trials.

The present work investigates biological indicators of sound processing, (action-) semantic understanding and predictive coding and their correlation with clinical symptoms of ASD. Twenty-two adults with high-functioning ASD and 25 typically developed (TD) participants engaged in an auditory, passive listening, Mismatch Negativity (MMN) task while high-density electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Action and non-action words were presented in the context of sounds, which were either semantically congruent with regard to the body part they relate to or semantically incongruent or unrelated. The anticipatory activity before sound onset, the Prediction Potential (PP), was significantly reduced in the ASD group specifically for action, but not for non-action sounds. The early-MMN-like responses to words (latency: 120 ms) were differentially modulated across groups: controls showed larger amplitudes for words in action-sound compared to non-action contexts, whereas ASD participants demonstrated enlarged early-MMN-like responses only in a pure tone context, with no other modulation dependent on action sound context. Late-MMN-like responses around 560 ms post-stimulus onset revealed body-part-congruent action-semantic priming for words in control participants, but not in the ASD group. Importantly, neurophysiological indices of semantic priming in ASD participants correlated with the extent of autistic traits as revealed by the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ). The data suggest that high-functioning adults with ASD show a specific deficit in semantic processing and predictive coding of sounds and words related to action, which is absent for neutral, non-action, sounds.

Consortium Genomics Schizoph	Decomposing the constituent oscillatory dynamics underlying mismatch negativity generation in schizophrenia: Distinct relationships to clinical and cognitive functioning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Mismatch negativity; Early auditory information processing; COGS-2	FREQUENCY DEVIANTS; DEFICITS; BIOMARKER; MODELS; DYSFUNCTION; PERCEPTION; REDUCTION; MMN	Abnormalities in early auditory information processing (EAIP) contribute to higher-order deficits in cognition and psychosocial functioning in schizophrenia. A passive auditory oddball paradigm is commonly used to evoke event-related potential (ERP) measures of EAIP reflecting auditory sensory registration and deviance detection, including mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a responses. MMN and P3a have been extensively studied in healthy subjects and neuropsychiatric patient populations and are increasingly used as translational biomarkers in the development of novel therapeutics. Despite widespread use, relatively few studies have examined the constituent oscillatory elements and the extent to which sensory registration and deviance detection represent distinct or intercorrelated processes. This study aimed to determine the factor structure and clinical correlates of these oscillatory measures in schizophrenia patients (n = 706) and healthy comparison subjects (n = 615) who underwent clinical, cognitive, and functional characterization and EEG testing via their participation in the Consortium of Genomics in Schizophrenia (COGS-2) study. Results revealed significant deficits in theta-band (4-7 Hz) evoked power and phase locking in patients. Exploratory factor analyses of both ERP and oscillatory measures revealed two dissociable factors reflecting sensory registration and deviance detection. While each factor shared a significant correlation with social cognition, the deviance detection factor had a unique relationship to multiple cognitive and clinical domains. Results support the continued advancement of functionally relevant oscillatory measures underlying EAIP in the development of precognitive therapeutics.	[Hochberger, W. C.; Light, G.

In this study, we used a single-trial electro-encephalography (EEG)-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) coupling method which can analyze neural activity with both high temporal and high spatial resolution and thus assess the generation process of the MMN. We elicited the MMN with an auditory oddball paradigm while recording simultaneous EEG and fMRI. We divided the MMN into five equal-durational phases. Utilizing the single-trial variability of the MMN, we analyzed the neural generators of the five phases, thereby determining the spatiotemporal generation process of the MMN. We found two distinct bottom-up prediction error propagations: first from the auditory cortex to the motor areas and then from the auditory cortex to the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Our results support the regularity-violation hypothesis of MMN generation.

The role of avoidance motivation in the relationship between reward sensitivity and depression symptoms in adolescents: An ERP study	PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH			English	Article						Reward response; Depression; ERP; Approach motivation	FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; BLUNTED NEURAL RESPONSE; BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION; AFFECTIVE-DISORDERS; ANXIETY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; RELIABILITY; ANHEDONIA; SCHEDULE; ANGER	Blunted neural responses to reward in an EEG paradigm (RewP) are associated with vulnerability to depression, but the pathways linking this biomarker to depressive symptoms are unclear. We examined whether the relationship between reward response (RewP mean amplitude and latency) and depression was in part explained by approach-motivated behaviors in adolescents with varying levels of depression. EEG was collected during a game rigged to provide win/loss trials. Longer RewP latency was associated with depression symptoms only when scores on a measure of avoidance motivation were included. These results suggest that treatments targeting avoidance may decrease vulnerability to depressive episodes.

Objective: This study aims at investigating modulations in cortical excitability related to conscious perception and unconscious processing of face stimuli with different visibility levels. Methods: We used TMS-EEG over the right occipital face area (rOFA), or the right premotor cortex (rPMC) as control site, to measure cortical excitability during a backward masking paradigm with individually defined stimuli visibility. Results: Event related potentials showed significant differences for faces compared to houses, and detected faces compared to missed ones, 200 ms post target onset. TMS over rOFA, but not over rPMC, triggered a relative positivity starting 150 ms post target when faces with high visibility were consciously reported. Moreover, rOFA TMS evoked differential responses for high versus low visible faces in conscious and unconscious processing at 290-390 and 180-240 ms, respectively. Conclusion: Results unveiled a causal link between rOFA excitability and late responses related to access to conscious perception, suggesting a critical role of recurrent activity, but distinct components, for consciously perceived stimuli and unconscious face processing.

Bispectrum is developed to overcome the drawback of power spectrum that the estimation of power spectrum discards the phase relationship among frequency components. However, the widely used bispectral features extraction method adds up all bispectral values as one feature, which could lead to the loss of effective information and increase of the sensitivity to non-linear and non-Gaussian noises. Thus, the representative bispectral features extraction method may be inefficient for MI classification. In addition, recent research suggests that the variations of EEG signals could provide more useful underlying information of event-related brain responses. This paper presents an advanced variations based bispectral feature extraction method to improve the performance of MI classification. The proposed method calculates the variations of MI-related EEG signals as input to bispectrum estimation. Besides, a new segmented bispectral sum features are developed to reduce the influence of non-linear and non-Gaussian noises and emphasize the valuable information for MI classification. The dataset collected in our laboratory and BCI Competition IV dataset 2b were adopted to validate the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the power spectrum based methods and the representative bispectral features based methods. Moreover, compared to other state-of-the-art works, our approach also achieves the greater performance for MI classification. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This technology opens promising perspectives to monitor the "brain at work" in complex real-life situations such as while operating aircraft. However, there is a need to benchmark these sensors in real operational conditions. We therefore designed a scenario in which twenty-two pilots equipped with a six-dry-electrode EEG system had to perform one low load and one high load traffic pattern along with a passive auditory oddball. In the low load condition, the participants were monitoring the flight handled by a flight instructor, whereas they were flying the aircraft in the high load condition. At the group level, statistical analyses disclosed higher P300 amplitude for the auditory target (Pz, P4 and Oz electrodes) along with higher alpha band power (Pz electrode), and higher theta band power (Oz electrode) in the low load condition as compared to the high load one. Single trial classification accuracy using both event-related potentials and event-related frequency features at the same time did not exceed chance level to discriminate the two load conditions. However, when considering only the frequency features computed over the continuous signal, classification accuracy reached around 70% on average. This study demonstrates the potential of dry-EEG to monitor cognition in a highly ecological and noisy environment, but also reveals that hardware improvement is still needed before it can be used for everyday flight operations.

Not everyone is susceptible to VIMS and the neural mechanism underlying susceptibility is unclear. This study explored the differences of electroencephalographic (EEG) signatures between VIMS-susceptible and VIMS-resistant groups. Thirty-two-channel EEG data were recorded from 12 VIMS-susceptible and 15 VIMS-resistant university students while they were watching two patterns of moving dots: (1) a coherent rotation pattern (vection-inducing and potentially VIMS-provoking pattern), and (2) a random movement pattern (non-VIMS-provoking control). The VIMS-susceptible group exhibited a significantly larger increase in the parietal N2 response when exposed to the coherent rotating pattern than when exposed to control patterns. In members of the VIMS-resistant group, before vection onset, global connectivity from all other EEG electrodes to the right-temporal-parietal and to the right-central areas increased, whereas after vection onset the global connectivity to the right-frontal area reduced. Such changes were not observed in the susceptible group. Further, the increases in N2 amplitude and the identified phase synchronization index were significantly correlated with individual motion sickness susceptibility. Results suggest that VIMS susceptibility is associated with systematic impairment of dynamic cortical coordination as captured by the phase synchronization of cortical activities. Analyses of dynamic EEG signatures could be a means to unlock the neural mechanism of VIMS.	[Wei, Yue; So, Richard H.

Dereification is juxtaposed to subjective realism, the process of being lost or totally immersed in the contents of one's mind. Excessive subjective realism is a hallmark of several psychiatric disorders. Here, we investigated whether a "mindful" (dereified) compared with an "immersed" (highly subjectively real) attitude, induced by instructions, differentially modulates approach-avoidance tendencies when processing visual stimuli. We presented novices and experienced meditators with neutral and attractive food images under both mindful and immersed states. Then, participants performed an approach-avoidance Task (AAT) during which we obtained behavioral data, salivary volume, EEG recordings, and self-report measures. The approach bias toward attractive food was correlated with N2 amplitude, a marker of response inhibition, and the regulation of this bias by the mindful instruction compared to the immersed instruction was associated with a modulation of the visual N1 amplitude, a marker of early selective attention. Individuals with more expertise in mindfulness meditation engaged in less late affective reappraisal during mindfulness than during immersion, as measured by lower amplitude in the late positive potential (LPP). Additionally, the ERPs sensitive to the AAT manipulation was also associated to self-report measures of subjective realism, food bias, and mindfulness meditation expertise but not to salivation measures. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms by which mindfulness-based interventions could be effective in a range of psychiatric conditions.

J	Adelhofer, N; Beste, C				Adelhoefer, Nico; Beste, Christian			Validity expectancies shape the interplay of cueing and task demands during inhibitory control associated with right inferior frontal regions	BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION			English	Article						Response inhibition; Inferior frontal gyrus; EEG; Source localization	ITERATION DECOMPOSITION RIDE; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; ERP COMPONENTS; NOREPINEPHRINE SYSTEM; LATENCY VARIABILITY; GO/NOGO TASK; MECHANISMS	The neural mechanisms of inhibitory control have extensively been studied, including the effects of demands to engage in inhibitory control and the effects of valid and invalid cueing. Theoretical considerations, however, suggest that the aforementioned factors exert joined effects on response inhibition processes that are further modulated by the subject's experience about the reliability of cue stimuli during response inhibition processes. To examine the underlying neurophysiological processes of these interactive effects we combined EEG signal decomposition with sLORETA source localization. We show that response inhibition performance is modulated by interactive effects between (1) cue information/validity, (2) demands on inhibitory control processes and (3) the subject's experience that cue information is valid/invalid during response inhibition processes. Only if demands on inhibitory control processes are high and when participants acquainted the experience that cue information is very likely to be valid, invalid cue information compromised response inhibition performance. The neurophysiological data show that processes in the N2 time window, likely reflecting braking processes, but not stimulus-related processes during response inhibition, are modulated. It seems that braking processes cannot be sufficiently deployed if cue information that has been experienced to be highly valid turns out to be invalid in situations placing high demands on inhibitory control. Source localization data reveals that the interactive effects of the examined factors specifically modulate processes in the right inferior frontal gyrus (BA47). This provides electrophysiological evidence that the rIFG is a hub region integrating different factors modulating inhibitory control.

It has classically been considered to reflect the attention processing of distracting stimuli. However, novel sounds can lead to behavioral facilitation as much as behavioral distraction. This illustrates the duality of the orienting response which includes both an attentional and an arousal component. Using a paradigm with visual or auditory targets to detect and irrelevant unexpected distracting sounds to ignore, we showed that the facilitation effect by distracting sounds is independent of the target modality and endures more than 1500 ms. These results confirm that the behavioral facilitation observed after distracting sounds is related to an increase in unspecific phasic arousal on top of the attentional capture. Moreover, the amplitude of the early phase of the P3a to distracting sounds positively correlated with subjective arousal ratings, contrary to other event-related potentials. We propose that the fronto-central early phase of the P3a would index the arousing properties of distracting sounds and would be linked to the arousal component of the orienting response. Finally, we discuss the relevance of the P3a as a marker of distraction.

The EEG data comprise six grasp-and-lift events, which are used to investigate the potential of using EEG as input signals with brain computer interface devices for controlling prosthetic devices for upper limb movement. Selected EEG channels are the ones located over the motor cortex, C3, Cz and C4, as well as at the parietal region, P3, Pz and P4. In general, the proposed algorithm includes three main stages, band pass filtering, CSP filtering, and wavelet transform and training on GoogLeNet for feature extraction, feature learning and classification. The band pass filtering is performed to select the EEG signal in the band of 7 Hz to 30 Hz while eliminating artifacts related to eye blink, heartbeat and muscle movement. The CSP filtering is applied on two-class EEG signals that will result in maximizing the power difference between the two-class dataset. Since CSP is mathematically developed for two-class events, the extension to the multiclass paradigm is achieved by using the approach of one class versus all other classes. Subsequently, continuous wavelet transform is used to convert the band pass and CSP filtered signals from selected electrodes to scalograms which are then converted to images in grayscale format. The three scalograms from the motor cortex regions and the parietal region are then combined to form two sets of RGB images. Next, these RGB images become the input to GoogLeNet for classification of the motor EEG signals. The performance of the proposed classification algorithm is evaluated in terms of precision, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy with average values of 94.8%, 93.5%, 94.7%, 94.1%, respectively, and average area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve equal to 0.985. These results indicate a good performance of the proposed algorithm in classifying grasp-and-lift events from EEG signals.

Frontal alpha asymmetry moderates the relations between behavioral inhibition and social-effect ERN	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Behavioral inhibition; EEG; Error-related negativity; Frontal alpha asymmetry	EEG ASYMMETRY; ANXIETY DISORDER; ERROR-DETECTION; TEMPERAMENT; CHILDREN; SYMPTOMS	Behavioral inhibition (BI) is an early temperamental precursor of anxiety disorders, characterized by withdrawal from novel situations. Some but not all young children with BI go on to display anxiety disorders. Neural correlates, such as frontal alpha asymmetry or event-related negativity (ERN), could moderate the relations between early BI and later anxiety. The goal of this longitudinal study was to test frontal alpha asymmetry as a potential moderator of the relation between BI and later anxiety, and of the relation between BI and the social-effect ERN. 100 children were assessed for BI at ages 2 and 3, and we collected EEG during resting state and the social Flanker task at age 12. Frontal alpha asymmetry did not correlate with BI or anxiety, nor did it moderate the relation between early BI and later anxiety. However, frontal alpha asymmetry did moderate the relation between BI and the social-effect ERN. This suggests that, in adolescents who previously manifested BI, a pattern of resting EEG associated with avoidance predicts hypersensitivity to errors in a social context.

Using a prospective, longitudinal design, we found that maternal (N = 89) amplitudes of the late positive potential (LPP) in response to negative stimuli during the second, but not the third, trimester of pregnancy predicted observed and physiological indices of temperamental reactivity in infants at age 4 months. Maternal LPP was positively associated with observed infant fear and negatively associated with frontal EEG asymmetry and cortisol reactivity in infants at age 4 months. Results identify a putative mechanism, early in pregnancy, for the intergenerational transmission of emotional reactivity from mother to infant.

J	Sharma, VV; Thaut, M; Russo, F; Alain, C				Sharma, Vivek V.; Thaut, Michael; Russo, Frank; Alain, Claude			Absolute Pitch and Musical Expertise Modulate Neuro-Electric and Behavioral Responses in an Auditory Stroop Paradigm	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						music; EEG; conflict resolution; event-related potentials; absolute pitch	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; IDENTIFICATION; CHILDREN; INTERFERENCE; PERCEPTION; TIME	Musicians have considerable experience naming pitch-classes with verbal (e.g., Doh, Re, and Mi) and semiotic tags (e.g., musical notation). On the one end of the spectrum, musicians can identify the pitch of a piano tone or quality of a chord without a reference tone [i.e., absolute pitch (AP) or relative pitch], which suggests strong associations between the perceived pitch information and verbal labels. Here, we examined the strength of this association using auditory versions of the Stroop task while neuro-electric brain activity was measured using high-density electroencephalography. In separate blocks of trials, participants were presented with congruent or incongruent auditory words from English language (standard auditory Stroop), Romanic solemnization, or German key lexicons (the latter two versions require some knowledge of music notation). We hypothesized that musically trained groups would show greater Stroop interference effects when presented with incongruent musical notations than non-musicians. Analyses of behavioral data revealed small or even non-existent congruency effects in musicians for solfege and keycodes versions of the Stroop task. This finding was unexpected and appears inconsistent with the hypothesis that musical training and AP are associated with high strength response level associations between a perceived pitch and verbal label. The analyses of eventrelated potentials revealed three temporally distinct modulations associated with conflict processing. All three modulations were larger in the auditory word Stroop than in the other two versions of the Stroop task. Only AP musicians showed significant congruity effects around 450 and 750 ms post-stimulus when stimuli were presented as Germanic keycodes (i.e., C or G). This finding suggests that AP possessors may process alphanumeric encodings as word forms with a semantic value, unlike their RP possessing counterparts and non-musically trained individuals. However, the strength of musical conditional associations may not exceed that of standard language in speech.

However, there are contradictory findings of enhanced reactivity and mood-congruent processing. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of the late positive potential (LPP) can display such blunted or enhanced activity. Due to these contradictory findings, there is a need to clarify the role of the LPP in the emergence and presence of depressive disorders especially in children. We used an emotional Go/NoGo task to investigate modulations of the LPP to emotional (fearful, happy, sad) and calm faces in a sample of children and adolescents (age 11;00-14;11) diagnosed with a depressive disorder according to diagnostic parent interviews (K-SADS-PL) (n=26) compared to a group of age-matched healthy controls (n=26). LPP positivity was attenuated in children and adolescents with a depressive disorder as well as with higher self-reported depressive symptoms, suggesting reduced reactivity to emotional and calm faces. This is the first study to find generally blunted LPP responses in a clinical sample of depressed youth across reporters.

The results call for further prospective studies investigating the course of the LPP before and after the onset of a depressive disorder in youth.

J	Sanger, J				Saenger, Jessica			Can't take my eyes off you - How task irrelevant pictures of food influence attentional selection	APPETITE			English	Article						Attention; Satiety; Food; N1pc; P2; P3; EEG; ERP	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; TIME-COURSE; TOP-DOWN; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; NEURAL BASIS; BOTTOM-UP; MECHANISMS; STIMULI	By means of event-related potentials (ERPs), the present study intended to extend previous findings on how the different processing stages of attentional selection are altered by the participants' motivational state depending on their saturation level. Forty-four normal-weight (mean BMI: 21.34, SD = 1.54), healthy participants aged between 19 and 34 years were assigned to a condition of hunger or satiety. While participants performed a central oddball task, task-irrelevant pictures (food vs. neutral) were presented unilaterally (either left or right from fixation) or bilaterally. Additionally, participants' eating and nutrition behaviour as well as their current level of hunger were assessed by self-reports. The results showed that while on the behavioural level groups did not show any differences in RTs and accuracy, ERPs of hungry participants show an enhanced early parieto-occipital activity 100-200 ms after stimulus onset (N1pc) for food pictures, particularly for high-calorie food. Furthermore, amplitudes of the N1pc co-varied significantly with the participants' subjective feeling of hunger. 200-300 ms after stimulus onset, P2pc in hungry participants reveal a lack of differential processing of the food and neutral stimuli. Between 300 and 400 ms, food pictures were associated with an enlarged centro-parietal positivity (P3) in hungry compared to satiated participants, again especially for high-calorie food stimuli. From the perspective of motivated attention, the results of the present study suggest, that hunger may induce a state of heightened attention for food stimuli, although they were completely irrelevant for the current task. By that, salient food stimuli had an influence on early automatic attentional selection as well as on later and rather intention-driven processes of attentional "de-selection" and stimulus maintenance in normal-weight participants.

The processing of biological motion is unique from the processing of motion of inanimate objects. Presently, there is controversy over whether visual consciousness of biological motion is regulated by visual attention. In addition, the neural mechanisms involved in biological motion-related visual awareness are not known. In the current study, the relationship between visual awareness (aware vs unaware), represented by a point-light walker and biological-motion-based attention, manipulated by a difference in congruence (congruent, incongruent) between the direction of a pre-cue and that of biological motion was explored. The neural mechanisms involved in processing the stimuli were explored through electroencephalography. Both early (50-150 ms, 100-200 ms, and 174-226 ms after target presentation) and late (350-550 ms after target presentation) awareness-related neural processings were observed during a biological motion-based congruency task. Early processing was localized to occipital-parietal regions, such as the left postcentral gyrus, the left middle occipital gyrus, and the right precentral gyrus. In the 174-226-ms-window, the activity in the occipital region was gradually replaced by activity in the parietal and frontal regions. Late processing was localized to frontal-parietal regions, such as the right dorsal superior frontal gyrus, the left medial superior frontal gyrus, and the occipito-temporal regions. Congruency-related processing occurred in the 246-260-ms window and was localized to the right superior occipital gyrus. In summary, due to its complexity, biological motion awareness has a unique neural basis. (C) 2019 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In recent years, much effort has been put into reaching asynchronous management, providing users with the ability to decide when a command should be selected. However, to the best of our knowledge, entropy metrics have not yet been explored. The present study has a twofold purpose: (i) to characterize both control and non-control states by examining the regularity of electroencephalography (EEG) signals; and (ii) to assess the efficacy of a scaled version of the sample entropy algorithm to provide asynchronous control for BCI systems. Ten healthy subjects participated in the study, who were asked to spell words through a visual oddball-based paradigm, attending (i.e., control) and ignoring (i.e., non-control) the stimuli. An optimization stage was performed for determining a common combination of hyperparameters for all subjects. Afterwards, these values were used to discern between both states using a linear classifier. Results show that control signals are more complex and irregular than non-control ones, reaching an average accuracy of 94.40% in classification. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that the proposed framework is useful in monitoring the attention of a user, and granting the asynchrony of the BCI system.

However, it is unclear how precise the timing prediction of sensory feedback is, and how temporal delays between an action and its sensory feedback affect perception. The current study investigated how prediction errors induced by delaying tone onset times affect the processing of sensory feedback in audition. Participants listened to self-generated (via button press) or externally generated tones. Self-generated tones were presented either without or with various delays (50, 100, or 250 ms; in 30% of trials). Comparing listening to externally generated and self-generated tones resulted in action-related P50 amplitude suppression to tones presented immediately or 100 ms after the button press. Subsequent ERP responses became more sensitive to the type of delay. Whereas the comparison of actual and predicted sensory feedback (N1) tolerated temporal uncertainty up to 100 ms, P2 suppression was modulated by delay in a graded manner: suppression decreased with an increase in sensory feedback delay. Self-generated tones occurring 250 ms after the button press additionally elicited an enhanced N2 response. These findings suggest functionally dissociable processes within the forward model that are affected by the timing of sensory feedback to self-action: relative tolerance of temporal delay in the P50 and N1, confirming previous results, but increased sensitivity in the P2. Further, they indicate that temporal prediction errors are treated differently by the auditory system: only delays that occurred after a temporal integration window (similar to 100 ms) impact the conscious detection of altered sensory feedback.

Such influences can work to enhance goal-relevant stimuli and suppress goal-irrelevant stimuli. Here, we combined behavioral testing and electroencephalography (EEG) to examine whether such enhancement and suppression effects arise even when the stimuli are masked from awareness. We used a feature-based spatial cueing paradigm, in which participants searched four-item arrays for a target in a specific color. Immediately before the target array, a nonpredictive cue display was presented in which a cuematched or mismatched the searched-for target color, and appeared either at the target location (spatially valid) or another location (spatially invalid). Cue displays were masked using continuous flash suppression. The EEG data revealed that target-colored cues produced robust N2pc and N-T responses-both signatures of spatial orienting-and distractor-colored cues produced a robust P-D-a signature of suppression. Critically, the cueing effects occurred for both conscious and unconscious cues. The N2pc and N-T were larger in the aware versus unaware cue condition, but the P-D was roughly equivalent in magnitude across the two conditions. Our findings suggest that top-down control settings for task-relevant features elicit selective enhancement and suppression even in the absence of conscious perception. We conclude that conscious perception modulates selective enhancement of visual features, but suppression of those features is largely independent of awareness.

In healthy populations, N400 amplitude is smaller in response to stimuli that are more related to preceding context. This 'N400 semantic priming effect' is thought to reflect activation of contextually related information in semantic memory (SM). N400 semantic priming deficits have been found in schizophrenia, and in patients at clinical high risk (CHR) for this disorder. Because this abnormality in processing relationships between meaningful stimuli could affect ability to navigate everyday situations, we hypothesized it would be associated with real-world functional impairment in CHR patients. Second, we hypothesized it would correlate with global neurocognitive impairment in this group. Methods We measured N400 semantic priming in 35 CHR patients who viewed prime words each followed by a related or unrelated target word, at stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) of 300 or 750 ms. We measured academic/occupational and social function with the global function (GF): Role and Social scales, and cognitive function with the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). Results Decreased N400 semantic priming at the 300-ms SOA correlated with lower GF:Role scores. Decreased N400 semantic priming at the 750-ms SOA correlated with lower MCCB composite scores. Conclusions Deficits in activating contextually related concepts in SM over short time intervals may contribute to functional impairment in CHR patients. Furthermore, N400 priming deficits over longer intervals may be a biomarker of global cognitive dysfunction in this population. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether these deficits are associated with schizophrenia risk within this population.	[Lepock, Jennifer R.; Ahmed, Sarah; Mizrahi, Romina; Bagby, R.

Effects of gamma-hydroxybutyrate on neurophysiological correlates of performance and conflict monitoring	EUROPEAN NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Gamma-hydroxybutryrate; GHB; Error processing; Performance monitoring; Conflict monitoring; EEG	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; PHASE SYNCHRONY; DOPAMINE; FMRI; GHB; PHARMACOKINETICS; PHARMACODYNAMICS; NEURONS; DRUG	Performance and conflict monitoring (PM and CM) represent two essential cognitive abilities, required to respond appropriately to demanding tasks. PM and CM can be investigated using event-related brain potentials (ERP) and associated neural oscillations. Namely, the error-related negativity (ERN) represents a correlate of PM, whereas the N2 component reflects the process of CM. Both ERPs originate in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and PM specifically has been shown to be susceptible to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor activation. Contrarily, the specific effects of GABA(B) receptor (GABA(B)R) stimulation on PM and CM are unknown. Thus, the effects of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB; 20 and 35 mg/kg), a predominant GABA(B)R agonist, on behavioral and electrophysiological correlates of PM and CM were here assessed in 15 healthy male volunteers, using the Eriksen-Flanker paradigm in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Electroencephalographic (EEG) data were analyzed in the time and time-frequency domains. GHB prolonged reaction times, without affecting error rates or post-error slowing. Moreover, GHB decreased ERN amplitudes and associated neural oscillations in the theta/alpha1 range. Similarly, neural oscillations associated with the N2 were reduced in the theta/alpha1 range, while N2 amplitude was conversely increased. Hence, GHB shows a dissociating effect on electrophysiological correlates of PM and CM. Reduced ERN likely derives from a GABA(B)R-mediated increase in dopaminergic signaling, disrupting the generation of prediction errors, whereas an enhanced N2 suggests an increased susceptibility towards external stimuli. Conclusively, GHB is the first drug reported, thus far, to have opposite effects on PM and CM, underlined by its unique electrophysiological signature. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

A Pilot OERP and fNIRS Study	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						OERPs; olfactory perception; haptic perception; fNIRS; delta rhythm; cross-modal perception	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; WORKING-MEMORY; OLFACTION; DORSAL; ODORS; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; STIMULATION; INTEGRATION; HEMOGLOBIN	Cross-modal perception allows olfactory information to integrate with other sensory modalities. Olfactory representations are processed by multisensory cortical pathways, where the aspects related to the haptic sensations are integrated. This complex reality allows the development of an integrated perception, where olfactory aspects compete with haptic and/or trigeminal activations. It is assumed that this integration involves both perceptive electrophysiological and metabolic/hemodynamic aspects, but there are no studies evaluating these activations in parallel. The aim of this study was to investigate brain dynamics during a cross-modal olfactory and haptic attention task, preceded by an exploratory session. The assessment of cross-modal dynamics was conducted through simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) recording, evaluating both electrophysiological and hemodynamic activities. The study consisted of two experimental sessions and was conducted with a sample of ten healthy subjects (mean age 25 +/- 5.2 years). In Session 1, the subjects were trained to manipulate 3D haptic models (HC) and to smell different scents (SC). In Session 2, the subjects were tested during an attentive olfactory task, in order to investigate the olfactory event-related potentials (OERP) N1 and late positive component (LPC), and EEG rhythms associated with fNIRS components (oxyHb and deoxy-Hb). The main results of this study highlighted, in Task 1, a higher fNIRS oxy-Hb response during SC and a positive correlation with the delta rhythm in the central and parietal EEG region of interest. In Session 2, the N1 OERP highlighted a greater amplitude in SC. A negative correlation was found in HC for the deoxy-Hb parietal with frontal and central N1, and for the oxy-Hb frontal with N1 in the frontal, central and parietal regions of interests (ROIs). A negative correlation was found in parietal LPC amplitude with central deoxy-Hb. The data suggest that cross-modal valence modifies the attentional olfactory response and that the dorsal cortical/metabolic pathways are involved in these responses. This can be considered as an important starting point for understanding integrated cognition, as the subject could perceive in an ecological context.

As such, little is known regarding how the temporal dynamics of cognitive processing are influenced during aerobic activity. Here, we aimed to elucidate the influence of aerobic exercise on the temporal dynamics of concurrent visual working memory (VWM) performance. Participants performed a VWM retro-cue task at rest and during aerobic exercise across two postural modalities: seated (using a stationary bicycle) and standing upright (using a treadmill). Three consecutive phases of the VWM processing pipeline were assessed by means of lateralized ERPs: access of VWM representations, response selection, and response execution. Aerobic exercise and upright posture were found to have significant effects on VWM performance, facilitating processing speed in the retro-cue task. This facilitation arose primarily at an intermediary stage between the phases of accessing VWM representations and response selection. Our findings hold implications not only for understanding the influence of aerobic activity on VWM, but also for contemporary models of VWM that are built exclusively on data recorded during stationary, seated conditions.

Method: This report explored the visual processing of individuals with ASD (n = 50) compared with their first-degree relatives (n = 117) using electroencephalogram (EEG), and associated EEG response with specific polymorphisms in the COMT, OXTR, SLC6A4 and DAT1 genes. Results: Polymorphisms in the COMT and OXTR genes were not associated with any specific EEG response; on the other hand, the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism located upstream of SLC6A4 was associated with increased latency of the P1 component of the EEG response, and DAT1 genotype correlated with reduced amplitude of the N170 component in male participants with ASD. Conclusion: These results suggest an interaction between DAT1 genotype and male participants with ASD characterized by reduced cognitive performance when processing faces as measured by EEG. Identifying ASD functional markers and grouping individuals with shared genetic biomarkers or endophenotypes may facilitate greater understanding of the heterogeneity underlying ASD leading to improved diagnosis and treatment of ASD.

High-intensity interval exercise impairs neuroelectric indices of reinforcement-learning	PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Reward positivity; EEG; ERP; Physical activity; Cognitive function; Acute exercise	COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; DECISION-MAKING; TERM-MEMORY; FEEDBACK; REWARD; AROUSAL; BRAIN; TASK	A single bout of high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) improves behavioural measures of cognitive function; however, investigations using event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine the systems that underlie these cognitive improvements are lacking. The reward positivity is a positive-going ERP component that indexes reward processing evoked by 'win' feedback and is a candidate marker of an underlying human reinforcement learning system. While HIIE imps oyes behavioural measures of learning, it is unknown how HIIE affects the amplitude of the reward positivity. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate how HIIE affects reward positivity amplitude in response to reward feedback in university students. Using a single-group randomly assigned counterbalance crossover design, 25 healthy university students performed HIIE and control visits on separate days. Electroencephalographic data was recorded before (pre-intervention) and 10 min after (post-intervention) the intervention period while participants played a novel gambling task. The HIIE intervention consisted of 4 separate body-weight exercises totaling 11 min in duration, including rest. The control visit intervention consisted of quietly watching a nature documentary for 11 min. Heart rate (HR) was measured at the same time intervals in both trials. Analysis revealed that HUE significantly diminished the amplitude of the reward positivity whereas it remained unaffected in the control condition. HR was significantly higher following HIIE compared to control during post-intervention testing. These findings suggest that mechanisms of reinforcement learning are impaired shortly after HIIE cessation, possibly due to persistent, suboptimal arousal as evidenced by elevated HR post-HIIE.

However, previous findings from P300 studies were inconsistent due to the heterogeneity of research methods, which make it difficult to understand the neurobiological significance of them. The aim of this study is to conduct a meta-analysis on P300 in patients with BD. Method: A literature search was conducted using PubMed to identify studies that compared P300 event-related potential between patients with BD and healthy controls (HCs). We analyzed P300 indices such as amplitude and latency of P3a and P3b in auditory or visual paradigms. Further, moderator analyses were conducted to investigate the influence of patient characteristics (i.e. history of psychosis, diagnostic subcategories [BD-I/BD-II], and phase of illness [euthymic, manic, or depressive]) on P300 indices. Result: Out of 124 initial records, we included 30 articles (BD: N = 1331; HCs: N = 1818). Patients with BD showed reduced P3a and P3b amplitude in both paradigms and delayed P3b latency in auditory paradigms compared to HCs. There was no influence on the history of psychosis, diagnostic subcategories, or phase of illness on P300 indices. Limitation: The difference in medication use was difficult to control and it may affect the results. Conclusion: This meta-analysis provides evidence for P300 abnormalities in patients with BD compared to HCs. Our results suggest that P300 may be trait markers rather than state markers in this illness.

Src deficient mice demonstrate behavioral and electrophysiological alterations relevant to psychiatric and developmental disease	PROGRESS IN NEURO-PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						NMDA; Schizophrenia; EEG; MMN; ERP; Social interaction; Working memory	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY DEFICITS; NMDA RECEPTOR HYPOFUNCTION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MUTANT MICE; C-SRC; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DOPAMINE; KETAMINE; AUTISM; OSCILLATIONS	Much evidence suggests that hypofunction of the N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) may contribute broadly towards a subset of molecular, cognitive and behavioral abnormalities common among psychiatric and developmental diseases. However, lithe is known about the specific molecular changes that lead to NMDAR dysfunction. As such, personalized approaches to remediating NMDAR dysfunction based on a specific etiology remains a challenge. Sarcoma tyrosine kinase (Src) serves as a hub for multiple signaling mechanisms affecting GluN2 phosphorylation and can be disrupted by convergent alterations of various signaling pathways. We recently showed reduced Src signaling in post mortem tissue from schizophrenia patients, despite increased MK-801 binding and NMDA receptor complex expression in the postsynaptic density (PSD). These data suggest that Src dysregulation may be an important underlying mechanism responsible for reduced glutamate signaling. Despite this evidence for a central role of Src in NMDAR signaling, little is known about how reductions in Src activity might regulate phenotypic changes in cognition and behavior. As such, the current study sought to characterize behavioral and electrophysiological phenotypes in mice heterozygous for the Src Act gene (Src + / - mice). Src + / - mice demonstrated decreased sociability and working memory relative to Src + / + (WT) mice while no significant differences were seen on locomotive activity and anxiety-related behavior. In relation to WT mice, Src + / - mice showed decreased mid-latency P20 auditory event related potential (aERP) amplitudes, decreased mismatch negativity (MMN) and decreased evoked gamma power, which was only present in males. These data indicate that Src + / - mice are a promising new model to help understand the pathophysiology of these electrophysiological, behavioral and cognitive changes. As such, we propose that Src + / - mice can be used in the future to evaluate potential therapeutic approaches by targeting increased Src activity as a common final pathway for multiple etiologies of SCZ and other diseases characterized by reduced glutamate function.

Reduced late mismatch negativity and auditory sustained potential to rule-based patterns in schizophrenia	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						audition; deviance detection; EEG ERP; novelty	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN RESPONSES; MMN; INFORMATION; REGULARITIES; VIOLATIONS; DEVIANTS; DEFICITS	Complex rule-based auditory processing is abnormal in individuals with long-term schizophrenia (SZ), as demonstrated by reduced mismatch negativity (MMN) to deviants in rule-based patterns and reduced auditory sustained potential (ASP) that appears when grouping tones together. Together, this suggests deficits later in the auditory processing hierarchy in Sz. Here, MMN and ASP were elicited by deviations from a complex zig-zag pitch pattern that cannot be predicted by simple linear rules. Twenty-seven SZ and 26 matched healthy controls (HC) participated. Frequent groups of patterns contained eight tones that zig-zagged in a two-up one-down pitch-based paradigm. There were two deviant patterns: the final tone was either higher in pitch than expected (creating a jump in pitch) or was repeated. Simple MMN to pitch-deviants among repetitive tones was measured for comparison. Sz exhibited a smaller pitch MMN compared to HC as expected. HC produced a late MMN in response to the repeat and jump-deviant and a larger ASP to the standard group of tones, all of which were significantly blunted in SZ. In Sz, the amplitude of the late complex MMN was related to neuropsychological functioning, whereas ASP was not. ASP and late MMN did not significantly correlate in HC or in Sz, suggesting that they are not dependent on one another and may originate within distinct processing streams. Together, this suggests multiple deficits later in the auditory sensory-perceptual hierarchy in Sz, with impairments evident in both segmentation and deviance detection abilities.

Methods: Brand authenticity and logo prominence were used to modulate the social-adjustive function and value-expressive function, respectively. Twenty right-handed healthy female undergraduates and graduates participated in an experiment that has a 2 brand authenticity (genuine/counterfeit) x 2 brand prominence (prominent logo/no logo) design. In the experiment, participators browsed different luxury handbags with different brand authenticity and logo prominence, and then reported their purchase intentions on a fivepoint scale. Meanwhile, EEGs were recorded from the subjects throughout the experiment. In the analysis process, three ERP components, which can, respectively, reflect the cognitive conflict (N200), emotional conflict (N400) and motivational emotional arousal (LPP) during the evaluation of marketing-related stimuli, were mainly focused. Results: For counterfeit brands, the no logo condition elicited significant larger N200 amplitude, marginally significant larger N400 amplitude and significant smaller LPP amplitude than the prominent logo condition. However, for genuine brands, this modulation effect of logo prominence cannot be found. These results imply that consumers' implicit social motivations for purchasing luxury brands come from the satisfaction of at least one social goal. When one goal cannot be satisfied, consumers will more expect the satisfaction of another one. If this expectation is violated, it seems to be unexpected and unacceptable. Thus, greater anticipation conflict (N200) and emotion conflict (N400) will be induced, and the purchase motivation (LPP) cannot be aroused. Conclusion: Consumers' preferences for luxury brands are based on the satisfaction of their social goals. These social goals always coexist and perform as compensation with each other. The dissatisfaction of one social goal would promote their expectation of the satisfaction of another social goal.

Sustaining attention for a prolonged period of time increases temporal variability in cortical responses	CORTEX			English	Article						Sustained attention; Vigilance; Time-on-task; Motivation; EEG	MENTAL FATIGUE; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; PHASE-LOCKING; FRONTAL THETA; ON-TASK; VIGILANCE; MIND	Our ability to stay focused is limited: prolonged performance of a task typically results in mental fatigue and decrements in performance over time. This so-called vigilance decrement has been attributed to depletion of attentional resources, though other factors such as reductions in motivation likely also play a role. In this study, we examined three electroencephalography (EEG) markers of attentional control, to elucidate which stage of attentional processing is most affected by time-on-task and motivation. To elicit the vigilance decrement, participants performed a sustained attention task for 80 min without breaks. After 60 min, participants were motivated by an unexpected monetary incentive to increase performance in the final 20 min. We found that task performance and self reported motivation declined rapidly, reaching stable levels well before the motivation manipulation was introduced. Thereafter, motivation increased back up to the initial level, and remained there for the final 20 min. While task performance also increased, it did not return to the initial level, and fell to the lowest level overall during the final 10 min. This pattern of performance changes was mirrored by the trial-to-trial consistency of the phase of theta (3-7 Hz) oscillations, an index of the variability in timing of the neural response to the stimulus. As task performance decreased, temporal variability increased, suggesting that attentional stability is crucial for sustained attention performance. The effects of attention on our two other EEG measures early P1/N1 event-related potentials (ERPs) and pre-stimulus alpha (9-14 Hz) power did not change with time-on-task or motivation. In sum, these findings show that the vigilance decrement is accompanied by a decline in only some facets of attentional control, which cannot be fully brought back online by increases in motivation. The vigilance decrement might thus not occur due to a single cause, but is likely multifactorial in origin. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Frontal cortex tracks surprise separately for different sensory modalities but engages a common inhibitory control mechanism	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							UNEXPECTED EVENTS; CORTICAL NETWORK; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS; POTENTIALS; SIGNAL; INFORMATION; DISTRACTION; RESPONSES; NOVELTY	The brain constantly generates predictions about the environment to guide action. Unexpected events lead to surprise and can necessitate the modification of ongoing behavior. Surprise can occur for any sensory domain, but it is not clear how these separate surprise signals are integrated to affect motor output. By applying a trial-to-trial Bayesian surprise model to human electroencephalography data recorded during a cross-modal oddball task, we tested whether there are separate predictive models for different sensory modalities (visual, auditory), or whether expectations are integrated across modalities such that surprise in one modality decreases surprise for a subsequent unexpected event in the other modality. We found that while surprise was represented in a common frontal signature across sensory modalities (the fronto-central P3 event-related potential), the single-trial amplitudes of this signature more closely conformed to a model with separate surprise terms for each sensory domain. We then investigated whether surprise-related fronto-central P3 activity indexes the rapid inhibitory control of ongoing behavior after surprise, as suggested by recent theories. Confirming this prediction, the fronto-central P3 amplitude after both auditory and visual unexpected events was highly correlated with the fronto-central P3 found after stop-signals (measured in a separate stop-signal task). Moreover, surprise-related and stopping-related activity loaded onto the same component in a cross-task independent components analysis. Together, these findings suggest that medial frontal cortex maintains separate predictive models for different sensory domains, but engages a common mechanism for inhibitory control of behavior regardless of the source of surprise.

Reduced left-lateralized pattern of event-related EEG oscillations in infants at familial risk for language and learning impairment	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Infants; Auditory processing; Language and learning impairment; EEG/ERP; Neural sources; Time-frequency analysis oscillations	DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; HEMISPHERIC-SPECIALIZATION; CEREBRAL LATERALIZATION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; 2-MONTH-OLD INFANTS; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; CORTICAL RESPONSES; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; GENETIC INFLUENCES	The ability to rapidly discriminate successive auditory stimuli within tens-of-milliseconds is crucial for speech and language development, particularly in the first year of life. This skill, called Rapid Auditory Processing (RAP), is altered in infants at familial risk for language and learning impairment (LLI) and is a robust predictor of later language outcomes. In the present study, we investigate the neural substrates of RAP, i.e., the underlying neural oscillatory patterns, in a group of Italian 6-month-old infants at risk for LLI (FH + , n = 24), compared to control infants with no known family history of LLI (FH - , n = 32). Brain responses to rapid changes in fundamental frequency and duration were recorded via high-density electroencephalogram during a non-speech double oddball paradigm. Sources of event-related potential generators were localized to right and left auditory regions in both FH + and FH - groups. Time-frequency analyses showed variations in both theta (theta) and gamma (gamma) ranges across groups. Our results showed that overall RAP stimuli elicited a more left-lateralized pattern of oscillations in FH - infants, whereas FH + infants demonstrated a more right-lateralized pattern, in both the theta and gamma frequency bands. Interestingly, FH + infants showed reduced early left gamma power (starting at 50 ms after stimulus onset) during deviant discrimination. Perturbed oscillatory dynamics may well constitute a candidate neural mechanism to explain group differences in RAP. Additional group differences in source location suggest that anatomical variations may underlie differences in oscillatory activity. Regarding the predictive value of early oscillatory measures, we found that the amplitude of the source response and the magnitude of oscillatory power and phase synchrony were predictive of expressive vocabulary at 20 months of age. These results further our understanding of the interplay among neural mechanisms that support typical and atypical rapid auditory processing in infancy.

In any pHRC, the intuitiveness of the interaction has always been a priority, so that the operator can comfortably and safely interact with the robot. So far, the intuitiveness has always been described in a qualitative way. In this paper, we suggest an objective way to evaluate intuitiveness, known as prediction error negativity (PEN) using electroencephalogram (EEG). PEN is defined as a negative deflection in event related potential (ERP) due to cognitive conflict, as a consequence of a mismatch between perception and reality. Experimental results showed that the forces exchanged between robot and human during pHRC modulate the amplitude of PEN, representing different levels of cognitive conflict. We also found that PEN amplitude significantly decreases (p < 0.05) when a mechanical resistance is being applied smoothly and more time in advance before an invisible obstacle, when compared to a scenario in which the resistance is applied abruptly before the obstacle. These results indicate that an earlier and smoother resistance reduces the conflict level. Consequently, this suggests that smoother changes in resistance make the interaction more intuitive.

Schizotypy relates to an increased likelihood of perceiving expressed emotion (EE). EE is characterised by criticism, rejection, and emotional overinvolvement and less warmth from a close relative. Neuroimaging studies have found normal frontal lobe activation to EE-criticism in people with high schizotypy. Alternatively, electroencephalography measures emotion processing, such as frontal theta power and occipital alpha power. Frontal theta power responds to cognitive and affective processes and occipital alpha power denotes less consciousness and emotional attention. This study aimed to determine the relation of these electroencephalography responses during criticism and praise to perceived emotional support. Participants (n = 32) representing the full (low-to-high) range of positive schizotypy listened to and rated the self-relevance of EE-like criticism and praise and affectively neutral comments while undergoing electroencephalography. Participants completed self-report measures of schizotypy, depression and anxiety. A subset of those with a high positive schizotypy score (n = 22) completed a measure of perceived EE lack of emotional support. Higher perceived EE - lack of emotional support correlated with lower frontal theta power and lower occipital alpha power during criticism and praise in schizotypal participants. The findings suggest that these neural responses may relate to less perceived emotional support in people with high schizotypy, of which a reduction of frontal theta power denotes less emotional arousal and lower occipital alpha power denotes more alertness to emotional information may relate to less perceived emotional support in people with high schizotypy.

Lateralized Suppression of Alpha-Band EEG Activity As a Mechanism of Target Processing	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha-band; attention; EEG; lateralization; N2pc	VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; WORKING-MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; SEARCH; RESOLUTION; MODULATION; ALLOCATION; RHYTHM	Alpha-band (8 - 12 Hz) EEG activity has been linked to visual attention since the earliest EEG studies. More recent studies using spatial cuing paradigms have shown that alpha is suppressed over the hemisphere contralateral to a to-be-attended location, suggesting that alpha serves as a mechanism of preparatory attention. Here, we demonstrate that alpha also plays a role in active target processing. EEG activity was recorded from a group of healthy male and female human subjects in two visual search experiments. In addition to alpha activity, we also assessed the N2pc event-related potential component, a lateralized transient EEG response that has been tightly linked with the focusing of attention on visual targets. We found that the visual search targets triggered both an N2pc component and a suppression of alpha-band activity that was greatest over the hemisphere contralateral to the target (which we call "target-elicited lateralized alpha suppression" or TELAS). In Experiment 1, both N2pc and TELAS were observed for targets presented in the lower visual field but were absent for upper-field targets. However, these two lateralized effects had different time courses and they responded differently to manipulations of crowding in Experiment 2. These results indicate that lateralized alpha-band activity is involved in active target processing and is not solely a preparatory mechanism and also that TELAS and N2pc reflect a related but separable neural mechanism of visuospatial attention.

Emerging research suggests that a single bout of aerobic exercise can improve cognition, brain function and psychological health. Our aim was to examine the effects of high-intensity exercise on cognitive-performance and brain measures of attention, inhibition and performance-monitoring across a test-battery of three cognitive tasks. Method: Using a randomised cross-over design, 29 young men completed three successive cognitive tasks (Cued Continuous Performance Task [CPT-OX]; Eriksen Flanker Task; four-choice reaction-time task [Fast Task]) with simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) recording before and after a 20-min high-intensity cycling exercise and resting control session. Cognitive-performance measures, EEG power and event-related potential measures, were obtained during the tasks. Random-intercept linear models were used to investigate the effects of exercise, compared to rest, on outcomes. Results: A single bout of exercise significantly (p < 0.05) increased the amplitude of the event-related potential Go P3, but had no effect on the contingent negative variation (CNV), Cue P3 or NoGo P3, during the CPT-OX. Delta power, recorded during the CPT-OX, also significantly increased after exercise, whereas there was no effect on cognitive-performance in this task. Exercise did not influence any cognitive-performance or brain measures in the subsequent Flanker or Fast Tasks. Conclusion: Acute high-intensity exercise improves brain-indices reflecting executive and sustained attention during task performance (Go P3 and delta activity), in the CPT-OX, but not anticipatory attention (Cue P3 and CNV) or response inhibition (NoGo P3) in young-adult men. Exercise had no effect on cognitive-performance or brain measures in the subsequent Flanker and Fast tasks, which may potentially be explained by the time delay after exercise.

Family-centered intervention for preterm infants has shown short- to medium-term developmental benefits; however, the neurological effects of intervention have rarely been explored. Objective. The objectives of this study were to examine the effect of a family-centered intervention program (FCIP) on neurophysiological functions in preterm infants with very low birth weight (VLBW; birth weight of < 1500 g) in Taiwan, to compare the effect of the FCIP with that of a usual-care program (UCP), and to explore the FCIP-induced changes in neurobehavioral and neurophysiological functions. Design. This was a multicenter, single-blind randomized controlled trial. Setting. The study took place in 3 medical centers in northern and southern Taiwan. Participants. Two hundred fifty-one preterm infants with VLBW were included. Intervention. The FCIP group received a family-centered intervention and the UCP group received standard care during hospitalization. Measurements. Infants were assessed in terms of neurobehavioral performance using the Neonatal Neurobehavioral Examination-Chinese version, and their neurophysiological function was assessed using electroencephalography/event-related potentials during sleep and during an auditory oddball task during the neonatal period. Results. The FCIP promoted more mature neurophysiological function than the UCP, including greater negative mean amplitudes of mismatch negativities in the left frontal region in the oddball task in all infants, lower intrahemispheric prefrontal-central coherence during sleep in infants who were small for gestational age, and higher interhemispheric frontal coherence during sleep in those who were appropriate for gestational age. Furthermore, interhemispheric coherence was positively associated with the total neurobehavioral score in preterm infants who were appropriate for gestational age (r = 0.20). Limitations. The fact that more parental adherence strategies were used in the FCIP group than in the UCP group might have favored the intervention effect in this study. Conclusions. Family-centered intervention facilitates short-term neurophysiological maturation in preterm infants with VLBW in Taiwan.

Many strategies have been proposed to reduce the effects of non-neural artefacts, while the activity of neural sources that do not reflect the considered stimulation has been neglected. However discerning such activities from those to be retained is important, but subtle and difficult as most of their features are the same. We propose an automated method based on a combination of a genetic algorithm (GA) and a support vector machine (SVM) to select only the sources of interest. Temporal, spectral, wavelet, autoregressive and spatial properties of independent components (ICs) of EEG are inspected. The method selects the most distinguishing subset of features among this comprehensive fused set of information and identifies the components to be preserved. EEG data were recorded from 12 healthy subjects in a visual evoked potential (VEP) based BCI paradigm and the corresponding ICs were classified by experts to train and test the algorithm. They were contaminated with different sources of artefacts, including electromyogram (EMG), electrode connection problems, blinks and electrocardiogram (ECG), together with neural contributions not related to VEPs. The accuracy of ICs classification was about 88.5% and the energetic residual error in recovering the clean signals was 3%. These performances indicate that this automated method can effectively identify and remove main artefacts derived from either neural or non-neural sources while preserving VEPs. This could have important potential applications, contributing to speed and remove subjectivity of the cleaning procedure by experts. Moreover, it could be included in a real time BCI as a pre-processing step before the identification of the user's intention.

Sleepless and desynchronized: Impaired inter trial phase coherence of steady-state potentials following sleep deprivation	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Sleep deprivation; EEG; Steady-state visual evoked potential (ssVEP); Inter trial phase coherence (ITPC)	PSYCHOMOTOR VIGILANCE; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; THETA ACTIVITY; NEURAL BASIS; EEG; PERFORMANCE; RESPONSES; AMPLITUDE; LOCKING; ALPHA	Sleep loss has detrimental effects on cognitive and emotional functioning. These impairments have been associated with alterations in EEG measures of power spectrum and event-related potentials, however the impact of sleep loss on inter trial phase coherence (ITPC), a measure of phase consistency over experimental trials, remains mostly unknown. ITPC is thought to reflect the ability of the neural response to temporally synchronize with relevant events, thus optimizing information processing. In the current study we investigated the effects of sleep deprivation on information processing by evaluating the phase consistency of steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs) as well as amplitude-based measures of ssVEPs, obtained from a group of 18 healthy individuals following 24 h of total sleep deprivation and after a night of habitual sleep. An ssVEP task was utilized, which included the presentation of dots flickering at 7.5 Hz, along with a cognitive-emotional task. Our results show that ITPC is significantly reduced under sleep deprivation relative to habitual sleep. Interestingly, decreased ITPC under sleep deprivation was associated with decreased behavioral performance in the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), a validated measure of reduced vigilance following a lack of sleep. The results suggest that the capability of the brain to synchronize with rhythmic stimuli is disrupted without sleep. Thus, decreased ITPC may represent an objective and mechanistic measure of sleep loss, allowing future work to study the relation between brain-world synchrony and the specific functional impairments associated with sleep deprivation.

Spatial attention affects the early processing of neutral versus fearful faces when they are task-irrelevant: a classifier study of the EEG C1 component	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Attention; C1 component; Classifiers; MVPA; EEG; Facial expression	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION; FACIAL EXPRESSION; MODULATION; RESPONSES; CAPTURE; THREAT; LOAD; POTENTIALS; DYNAMICS	EEG studies suggest that the emotional content of visual stimuli is processed rapidly. In particular, the C1 component, which occurs up to 100 ms after stimulus onset and likely reflects activity in primary visual cortex V1, has been reported to be sensitive to emotional faces. However, difficulties replicating these results have been reported. We hypothesized that the nature of the task and attentional condition are key to reconcile the conflicting findings. We report three experiments of EEG activity during the C1 time range elicited by peripherally presented neutral and fearful faces under various attentional conditions: the faces were spatially attended or unattended and were either task-relevant or not. Using traditional event-related potential analysis, we found that the early activity changed depending on facial expression, attentional condition, and task. In addition, we trained classifiers to discriminate the different conditions from the EEG signals. Although the classifiers were not able to discriminate between facial expressions in any condition, they uncovered differences between spatially attended and unattended faces but solely when these were task-irrelevant. In addition, this effect was only present for neutral faces. Our study provides further indication that attention and task are key parameters when measuring early differences between emotional and neutral visual stimuli.

Here, by combining electroencephalography (EEG) and fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS), we introduce an ecologically valid, objective and sensitive neural measure of this human individual face recognition function. Natural images of various unfamiliar faces are presented at a fast rate of 6 Hz, allowing one fixation per face, with variable natural images of a highly familiar face identity, a celebrity, appearing every seven images (0.86 Hz). Following a few minutes of stimulation, a high signal-to-noise ratio neural response reflecting the generalized discrimination of the familiar face identity from unfamiliar faces is observed over the occipito-temporal cortex at 0.86 Hz and harmonics. When face images are presented upside-down, the individual familiar face recognition response is negligible, being reduced by a factor of 5 over occipito-temporal regions. Differences in the magnitude of the individual face recognition response across different familiar face identities suggest that factors such as exposure, within-person variability and distinctiveness mediate this response. Our findings of a biological marker for fast and automatic recognition of individual familiar faces with ecological stimuli open an avenue for understanding this function, its development and neural basis in neurotypical individual brains along with its pathology. This should also have implications for the use of facial recognition measures in forensic science.	[Zimmermann, Friederike G.

This study aimed at investigating the beat-to-beat influence of the brain cortex over the heart through a high temporal resolution estimation of brain-heart coupling. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) from 32 scalp positions were recorded at rest for 5 min in 38 participants. To assess beat-to-beat cortical control on vagal activity, the longest and shortest inter-beat intervals (IBIs) were identified for each participant. Then, the EEG activity was time-locked to R waves in the ECG signal and analyzed using a time-frequency approach. Logistic regression models were applied to predict the trial-by-trial occurrence of long and short IBIs from cardiac-related EEG activity. Delta power reduction over prefrontal and frontocentral areas preceding the R-wave increased the probability for a long IBI to occur, as compared to a short one. Moreover, reduced prefrontal delta power preceding the R wave was correlated to higher cardiac vagal control, as reflected by the High Frequency (HF) power of HRV calculated on the whole recording time. The present results support the hypothesis that phasic activation/deactivation of prefrontal areas modulates vagal control of heart rate at rest.

However, EEG signals have a multi-channel structure due to the nature, and this situation increases the data size. Therefore, the working costs of BCIs are increasing. At this stage, reduce the number of electrodes is a solution to reduce the process speed and load in BCI systems. Different techniques are used for this purpose. Some of these are the optimization methods produced by the movement of living beings in nature. In this study, the effects of reduced channels by using Bee Algorithm (BA), Particle Swarm Algorithm (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE), Genetic Algorithm (GA) used in P300 hyphenation systems to reduce the number of electrodes were investigated. As a result of the study, between the accuracy rates obtained with 64 channels and the accuracy rates obtained with channel selecting, (the LS-SVM classifier for User B by B-BA) is seen an about 20% increase. Optimization algorithms are a suitable method to reduce the cost of system operation.

However, the mechanisms underlying adolescent alcohol-associated sleep disturbances and potential targets for therapy remain under investigated. Orexin receptor antagonists may have therapeutic value in the treatment of insomnia, yet the use of this class of drugs in the treatment of sleep disturbances following adolescent alcohol exposure has not been studied. Objectives This study employed a model whereby ethanol vapor exposure occurred for 5 weeks during adolescence (AIE), and waking event-related oscillations (EROs) and EEG sleep were subsequently evaluated in young adult rats. The ability of two doses (10, 30 mg/kg PO) of a dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA-12) to modify sleep, EEG, and EROs was investigated in AIE rats and controls. Results Adolescent vapor exposure was found to produce a fragmentation of sleep, in young adults, that was partially ameliorated by DORA-12. DORA-12 also produced increases in delta and theta power in waking EROs recorded before sleep, and deeper sleep as indexed by increases in delta and theta power in the sleep EEG in both ethanol and control rats. Rats given DORA-12 also fell asleep faster than vehicle-treated rats as measured by a dose-dependent reduction in the latency to both the first slow wave and REM sleep episodes. Conclusions This study showed that DORA-12 can affect the sleep disturbance that is associated with a history of adolescent ethanol exposure and also has several other sleep-promoting effects that are equivalent in both ethanol and control rats.

Electroencephalogram- (EEG-) based brain-computer interface (BCI) has a great potential for motor rehabilitation in stroke patients since the closed loop between motor intention and the actual movement established by BCI can stimulate the neural pathways of motor control. Due to the deficits in the brain, motor intention expression may shift to other brain regions during and even after neural reorganization. The objective of this paper was to study the event-related desynchronization (ERD) topography during motor attempt tasks of the paretic hand in stroke patients and compare the classification performance using different channel-selection strategies in EEG-based BCI. Fifteen stroke patients were recruited in this study. A cue-based experimental paradigm was applied in the experiment, in which each patient was required to open the palm of the paretic or the unaffected hand. EEG was recorded and analyzed to measure the motor intention and indicate the activated brain regions. Support vector machine (SVM) combined with common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm was used to calculate the offline classification accuracy between the motor attempt of the paretic hand and the resting state applying different channel-selection strategies. Results showed individualized ERD topography during the motor attempt of the paretic hand due to the deficits caused by stroke. Statistical analysis showed a significant increase in the classification accuracy by analyzing the channels showing ERD than analyzing the channels from the contralateral sensorimotor cortex (SM1). The results indicated that for stroke patients whose affected motor cortex is extensively damaged, the compensated brain regions should be considered for implementing EEG-based BCI for motor rehabilitation as the closed loop between the altered activated brain regions and the paretic hand can be stimulated more accurately using the individualized channel-selection strategy.

Mismatch negativity reveals plasticity in cortical dynamics after 1-hour of auditory training exercises	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Mismatch negativity; Biomarker; Psychosis; Training; Cognition; Treatment	SCHIZOPHRENIA-PATIENTS; COGNITIVE REMEDIATION; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; PROCESSING DEFICITS; BLIND SEPARATION; BRAIN RESPONSES; P3A; MMN; DEVIANCE; INDEX	Background: Impaired sensory processing contributes to deficits in cognitive and psychosocial functioning in individuals with schizophrenia (SZ). Mismatch Negativity (MMN), an event-related potential (ERP) index of sensory discrimination associated with cognitive and psychosocial functioning, is a candidate biomarker of auditory discrimination and thus possibly of changes following auditory-based Targeted Cognitive Training (TCT). Here we evaluated the acute effect of TCT on cortical processes supporting auditory discrimination. Methods: MMN was assessed in 28 SZ outpatients before and after a single 1-hour (hr) session of "Sound Sweeps," a pitch discrimination task that is a component of the TCT suite of exercises. Independent component (IC) analysis was applied to decompose 64-channel scalp-recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) activity into spatiotemporally stationary sources and their activities. ICs from all patients were pooled to find commonalities in their cortical locations. IC cluster-mean ERPs were evaluated to determine the clusters contributing to the (140-200 ms) MMN difference between responses to deviant and standard tone stimuli respectively. Results: Two frontal IC clusters centered in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) accounted for > 77% of MMN variance across all scalp channels. After 1-hr auditory training, significant suppression of ACC cluster contributions was detected, whereas the OFC cluster contribution was unchanged. Conclusions: Prior to TCT, the MMN response was dominated by EEG effective sources in or near OFC and ACC. However, after 1-hr of auditory-based TCT, a significant attenuation of ACC was observed, whereas OFC contribution to MMN persisted. The present findings support further trials designed to test whether training-related MMN plasticity in the ACC after 1-hr may predict individual patient response to a full course of TCT.

In two experiments, we sought evidence for sensory attenuation (SA) indexed by ERP amplitude reductions for self-induced stimuli when compared to passive viewing of the same images. We assessed if SA is (a) present for both ecological and abstract stimuli (pictures depicting hands or checkerboards), (b) modulated by the degree of stimulus predictability (certain or uncertain action-effect contingencies), and (c) sensitive to laterality of hand movements (dominant or subdominant hand actions). We found reduced occipital responses in the early 77-90 ms time interval (C1 component), irrespective of stimulus type, predictability, or the laterality of hand movements. However, the subsequent P1 component was increased (rather than reduced) for all action-associated stimuli. In addition, this P1 effect was influenced by the degree of stimulus predictability for ecological stimuli only. Finally, the posterior N1 component was not modulated by self-initiated actions. Overall, our findings indicate that movement-related predictive processes attenuate early visual responses. Moreover, we propose that amplitude modulations in the P1 time range reflect the interaction between expectation-based SA and attention-associated amplitude enhancements. These results can have implications for assessing the influence of action-associated predictions on visual processing in psychiatric disorders characterized by aberrant sensory predictions and alterations in hemispheric asymmetry, such as schizophrenia.

They reflect the processing of the stimulus in cortex and have a highly subject-specific morphology. However, we still have an incomplete picture of how event-related fields are generated, what the various waves signify, and why they are so subject-specific. Here, we focus on this problem through the lens of a computational model which describes auditory cortex in terms of interconnected cortical columns as part of hierarchically placed fields of the core, belt, and parabelt areas. We develop an analytical approach arriving at solutions to the system dynamics in terms of normal modes: damped harmonic oscillators emerging out of the coupled excitation and inhibition in the system. Each normal mode is a global feature which depends on the anatomical structure of the entire auditory cortex. Further, normal modes are fundamental dynamical building blocks, in that the activity of each cortical column represents a combination of all normal modes. This approach allows us to replicate a typical auditory event-related response as a weighted sum of the single-column activities. Our work offers an alternative to the view that the event-related field arises out of spatially discrete, local generators. Rather, there is only a single generator process distributed over the entire network of the auditory cortex. We present predictions for testing to what degree subject-specificity is due to cross-subject variations in dynamical parameters rather than in the cortical surface morphology.	[May, Patrick J.

MethodThe sample comprised 23 and nine patients with major depressive disorder with high and low risk for suicide, respectively, and 24 healthy controls. All participants completed the measurements and performed an event-related potential-based analogue of the affective incentive delay task. The event-related potential components previously associated with motivationally salient cue (contingent negative variation, P2, and cue-P3), target (target-P3), and feedback (reward vs. punishment, feedback-related negativity, and feedback-P3) stimuli were examined. ResultsAll inventory scores differed significantly among the high-risk, low-risk, and healthy control groups. During the expectant phase, the main effect of group and interaction between group and condition was significant in the average amplitudes of the cue-P2 component. During the feedback phase, the feedback-P3 elicited by positive feedback had a significant main effect of group and of the interaction between group and condition. Specifically, the feedback-P3 elicited by negative feedback in the punitive condition showed significant positive correlations with the total and subscale scores on the Three-Dimensional Psychological Pain Scale. ConclusionsFeedback-P3 may be an electrobiological component underlying the processing of psychological pain in suicidality.

Here we recorded EEG from people who either had, or had not experienced an OBE in order to investigate the neural dynamics of OBE in the non-clinical population. A screening questionnaire was completed by 551 people, 24% of whom reported having at least one OBE. Participants who were free of any psychiatric or neurological diagnoses, including migraines, were invited to take part in subsequent EEG recording. EEG data were obtained from 19 people who had had an OBE and 20 who had not. Amplitude of the visual P1 ERP deflection and consistency of alpha-band phase locking were significantly reduced in the participants who had had an OBE. We did not find any group differences in resting state power or in visually induced gamma oscillations. These results provide support for the claim that cortical differences, particularly with respect to the timing of visual information processing, may give rise to OBE in clinically healthy individuals. To our knowledge, this study is the first to compare EEG variables obtained from people who have, and have not, had an OBE. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Neural signatures of reward and sensory error feedback processing in motor learning	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						feedback-related negativity; human; motor adaptation; P300; reward	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; PREDICTION ERROR; EXPLICIT STRATEGY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ADAPTATION; NEGATIVITY; CEREBELLAR; IMPLICIT; REINFORCEMENT	At least two distinct processes have been identified by which motor commands are adapted according to movement-related feedback: reward-based learning and sensory error-based learning. In sensory error-based learning, mappings between sensory targets and motor commands are recalibrated according to sensory error feedback. In reward-based learning, motor commands are associated with subjective value, such that successful actions are reinforced. We designed two tasks to isolate reward- and sensory error-based motor adaptation, and we used electroencephalography in humans to identify and dissociate the neural correlates of reward and sensory error feedback processing. We designed a visuomotor rotation task to isolate sensory error-based learning that was induced by altered visual feedback of hand position. In a reward learning task, we isolated reward-based learning induced by binary reward feedback that was decoupled from the visual target. A fronto-central event-related potential called the feedback-related negativity (FRN) was elicited specifically by binary reward feedback but not sensory error feedback. A more posterior component called the P300 was evoked by feedback in both tasks. In the visuomotor rotation task, P300 amplitude was increased by sensory error induced by perturbed visual feedback and was correlated with learning rate. In the reward learning task, P300 amplitude was increased by reward relative to nonreward and by surprise regardless of feedback valence. We propose that during motor adaptation the FRN specifically reflects a reward-based learning signal whereas the P300 reflects feedback processing that is related to adaptation more generally. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We studied the event-related potentials evoked by feedback stimuli during motor adaptation tasks that isolate reward- and sensory error-based learning mechanisms. We found that the feedback-related negativity was specifically elicited by binary reward feedback, whereas the P300 was observed in both tasks. These results reveal neural processes associated with different learning mechanisms and elucidate which classes of errors, from a computational standpoint, elicit the feedback-related negativity and P300.

This study investigated the influence of sleep deprivation on three commonly used emotion regulation strategies (distraction, reappraisal, suppression) in Gross's (1998) process model of emotion regulation. Young healthy adults were randomly assigned to a sleep deprivation group (SD; n = 26, 13 males, age = 20.0 +/- 1.7) or a sleep control group (SC; n = 25, 13 males, age = 20.2 +/- 1.7). Following 24-h sleep deprivation or normal nighttime sleep, participants completed an emotion regulation task, in which they naturally viewed or applied a given emotion regulation strategy towards negative pictures, with electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. A reduction in the centroparietal late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes towards negative pictures from the naturally viewing condition to a regulated condition was calculated as an index of regulatory effects. Comparisons between the two groups indicated that sleep deprivation significantly impaired the regulatory effects of distraction and reappraisal on LPP amplitudes. Suppression did not reduce LPP amplitudes in either group. In addition, habitual sleep quality moderated the effect of sleep deprivation on subjective perception of emotional stimuli, such that sleep deprivation only made good sleepers perceive negative pictures as more unpleasant and more arousing, but it had no significant effect on poor sleepers' perception of negative pictures. Altogether, this study provides the first evidence that sleep deprivation may impair the effectiveness of applying adaptive emotion regulation strategies (distraction and reappraisal), creating potentially undesirable consequences to emotional well-being.

Systematic comparison between a wireless EEG system with dry electrodes and a wired EEG system with wet electrodes	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Wet electrodes; Dry electrodes; Electrophysiology; P3b; Resting state EEG; Single trial classification	UTILITY; MOBILE; BRAIN; P300; MIND	Recent advances in dry electrodes technology have facilitated the recording of EEG in situations not previously possible, thanks to the relatively swift electrode preparation and avoidance of applying gel to subject's hair. However, to become a true alternative, these systems should be compared to state-of-the-art wet EEG systems commonly used in clinical or research applications. In our study, we conducted a systematic comparison of electrodes application speed, subject comfort, and most critically electrophysiological signal quality between the conventional and wired Biosemi EEG system using wet active electrodes and the compact and wireless F1 EEG system consisting of dry passive electrodes. All subjects (n = 27) participated in two recording sessions on separate days, one with the wet EEG system and one with the dry EEG system, in which the session order was counterbalanced across subjects. In each session, we recorded their EEG during separate rest periods with eyes open and closed followed by two versions of a serial visual presentation target detection task. Each task component allows for a neural measure reflecting different characteristics of the data, including spectral power in canonical low frequency bands, event-related potential components (specifically, the P3b), and single trial classification based on machine learning. The performance across the two systems was similar in most measures, including the P3b amplitude and topography, as well as low frequency (theta, alpha, and beta) spectral power at rest. Both EEG systems performed well above chance in the classification analysis, with a marginal advantage of the wet system over the dry. Critically, all aforementioned electrophysiological metrics showed significant positive correlations (r = 0.54-0.89) between the two EEG systems. This multitude of measures provides a comprehensive comparison that captures different aspects of EEG data, including temporal precision, frequency domain as well as multivariate patterns of activity. Taken together, our results indicate that the dry EEG system used in this experiment can effectively record electrophysiological measures commonly used across the research and clinical contexts with comparable quality to the conventional wet EEG system.

We recorded EEGs during event-related fMRI followed by DTI in 15 healthy volunteers and 12 patients with schizophrenia using an omission mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm. Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes were calculated in a region of interest (ROI) analysis, and fractional anisotropy (FA) in the white matter fibers related to each area was compared between groups using tract-specific analysis. Patients with schizophrenia had reduced BOLD activity in the left middle temporal gyrus, and BOLD activity in the right insula and right parahippocampal gyrus significantly correlated with positive symptoms on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and hostility subscores. BOLD activation of Heschl's gyri also correlated with the limbic system, including the insula. FA values in the left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) significantly correlated with changes in the BOLD signal in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG), and FA values in the right ACC significantly correlated with PANSS scores. This is the first study to examine MMN using simultaneous fMRI, EEG, and DTI recording in patients with schizophrenia to investigate the potential implications of abnormalities in the ACC and limbic system, including the insula and parahippocampal gyrus, as well as the STG. Structural changes in the ACC during schizophrenia may represent part of the neural basis for the observed MMN deficits. The deficits seen in the feedback/feedforward connections between the prefrontal cortex and STG modulated by the ACC and insula may specifically contribute to impaired MMN generation and clinical manifestations.

This study analyzed electroencephalographic (EEG) dynamics and body skin temperature as markers of attentional fluctuations in non-sleep deprived subjects during a 45 min Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT). Independent Component Analysis and time-frequency analysis were used to evaluate the EEG data. Results showed a positive association between distal and distal-to-proximal gradient (DPG) temperatures and reaction time (RT); increments in EEG power in alpha-, theta- and beta-band frequencies in parieto-occipital, central-medial and frontal components, were associated with poor performance (slower RT) in the task. This generalized power increment fits with an increased activity in the default mode network, associated with attention lapses. This study highlights the potential use of the PVT as a tool to obtain individual physiological indices of vigilance and fatigue that could be applied to other vigilance tasks typically performed in occupational settings.

Pasco			Psychosocial intervention in at-risk adolescents: using event-related potentials to assess changes in decision making and feedback processing	EUROPEAN CHILD & ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Adolescent; Event-related potential; Intervention; Psychosocial; FRN; LPP	CALLOUS-UNEMOTIONAL TRAITS; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; BRAIN POTENTIALS; ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR; REWARD-PREDICTION; CONDUCT DISORDER; NEGATIVITY FRN; P300 AMPLITUDE; CHILDREN; BAD	Decision making and feedback processing are two important cognitive processes that are impacted by social context, particularly during adolescence. The current study examined whether a psychosocial intervention could improve psychological wellbeing in at-risk adolescent boys, thereby improving their decision making and feedback processing skills. Two groups of at-risk adolescents were compared: those who were relatively new to a psychosocial intervention, and those who had engaged over a longer time period. Electroencephalography was recorded while the young people participated in a modified version of the Taylor Aggression Paradigm. The late positive potential (LPP) was measured during the decision phase of the task (where participants selected punishments for their opponents). The feedback-related negativity (FRN) and P3 components were measured during the task's outcome phase (where participants received win' or lose' feedback). Adolescents who were new to the intervention (the minimal-intervention group) were harsher in their punishment selections than those who had been engaged in the program for much longer. The minimal-intervention group also showed an enhanced LPP during the decision phase of the task, which may be indicative of immature decision making in that group. Analysis of the FRN and P3 amplitudes revealed that the minimal-intervention group was physiologically hypo-sensitive to feedback, compared with the extended-intervention group. Overall, these findings suggest that long-term community-based psychosocial intervention programs are beneficial for at-risk adolescents, and that event-related potentials can be employed as biomarkers of therapeutic change. However, because participants were not randomly allocated to treatment groups, alternative explanations cannot be excluded until further randomized controlled trials are undertaken.	[Pincham, H.

Disruption of function: Neurophysiological markers of cognitive deficits in retired football players	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Concussion; mTBI; Event-related potentials; EEG; Behavioral assessment; Football	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; SPORT-RELATED CONCUSSION; RECURRENT CONCUSSION; CEREBRAL CONCUSSION; P3 AMPLITUDE; NOVELTY P3; DEPRESSION; MISMATCH; HISTORY	Objective: Recent studies demonstrate that sports-related concussions can have negative consequences on long-term brain health. The goal of the present study was to determine whether retired Canadian Football League (CFL) athletes with a history of concussions exhibit alterations in neurocognitive functioning, along with changes in physical, social, and psychological health. Methods: Our study compared nineteen retired CFL athletes' concussion histories to eighteen healthy age-matched controls with no history of concussion. Self-report inventories were used to assess depression, memory, attention, and general health. Neurophysiological markers of cognitive function were evaluated with event-related brain potentials (ERPs) as measured in two protocols: (1) A Mismatch Negativity (MMN) protocol for assessing the automatic early attentional brain mechanism; and, (2) a P300 auditory oddball task for assessing consciously controlled attention. Results: Relative to controls, CFL players exhibited: response delays and reduced amplitudes in neurophysiological responses; overall decreases in cognitive function; and poorer scores on self-reports of physical, social, and psychological health; reflecting problems in all three categories. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that multiple concussions sustained over several years can lead to altered cognitive and psychosocial function. Significance: Neurophysiological markers of conscious and pre-conscious attention provide an objective assessment for evaluating long-term cognitive consequences of concussion.

Developmental differences in the neural correlates supporting semantics and syntax during sentence processing	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						development; EEG; ERP; neural oscillations; semantics; syntax	THETA-POWER INCREASES; LANGUAGE-DEVELOPMENT; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; FRONTAL THETA; EEG-THETA; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; POTENTIALS; CHILDREN; REVEAL	School-aged and adolescent children continue to demonstrate improvements in how they integrate and comprehend real-time, auditory language over this developmental time period, which can have important implications for academic and social success. To better understand developmental changes in the neural processes engaged during language comprehension in this age group, we use electroencephalography to investigate how 8-9 year old, 12-13 year olds, and adults process semantics and syntax in naturally paced, auditory sentences. Participants listened to semantically and syntactically correct and incorrect sentences and were asked to complete an acceptability judgment task. When processing a semantic error, developmental differences were observed in theta, but not the N400, suggesting that the N400 may be too gross a measure to identify more subtle aspects of semantic development that occur in the school years. For the syntactic task, errors resulted in a larger P600 and greater beta decrease than correct sentences, but the amplitude and location of the P600 and amplitude of beta decreases differed as a function of age, suggesting specialization of syntactic skills is ongoing through adolescence. The current findings shed new light on the development of the neural oscillations supporting language comprehension and suggest that the neural substrates underlying semantic processing reach adult-like levels at a younger age than those underlying syntactic processing.

Revisiting mental rotation with stereoscopic disparity: A new apin for a classic paradigm	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						3D; ERP; PLS; MSE; EEG; Depth perception	DEPTH-PERCEPTION; BRAIN; COMPONENT; EEG; RECOGNITION; PERFORMANCE; POTENTIALS; IMAGES; ERP	To understand how the presence of stereoscopic disparity influences cognitive and neural processing, we recorded participants' behavior and scalp electrical activity while they performed a mental rotation task. Participants wore active shutter 3D goggles, allowing us to present stimuli with or without stereoscopic disparity on a trial-by-trial basis. Participants were more accurate and faster when stimuli were presented with stereoscopic disparity. This improvement in performance was accompanied by changes in neural activity recorded from scalp electrodes at parietal and occipital regions; stereoscopic disparity produced earlier P2 peaks, larger N2 amplitudes, and earlier, smaller P300 peak amplitudes. The presence of stereoscopic disparity also produced greater neural entropy at occipital electrode sites, and lower entropy at frontal sites. These findings suggest that the nature of the benefit afforded by stereoscopic disparity occurs at both low-level perceptual processing and higher-level cognitive processing, and results in more accurate and rapid performance.

Altered EEG alpha and theta oscillations characterize apathy in Parkinson's disease during incentivized movement	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Apathy; Parkinson's disease; Motivation; EEG; Oscillations; Alpha; Theta	BASAL GANGLIA; BETA-DESYNCHRONIZATION; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; DEMENTIA; REWARD; POWER; CONNECTIVITY; DEPRESSION	Apathy is a common non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) that is difficult to quantify and poorly understood. Some studies have used incentivized motor tasks to assess apathy, as the condition is often associated with a reduction in motivated behavior. Normally event-related desynchronization, a reduction of power in specific frequency bands, is observed in the motor cortex during the peri-movement period. Also, alpha (8-12 Hz) and theta (4-7 Hz) oscillations are sensitive to rewards that are closely related to motivational states however these oscillations have not been widely investigated in relation to apathy in PD. Using EEG recordings, we investigated the neural oscillatory characteristics of apathy in PD during an incentivized motor task with interleaved rest periods. Apathetic and non-apathetic PD subjects on dopaminergic medication and healthy control subjects were instructed to squeeze a hand grip device for a monetary reward proportional to the subject's grip force and the monetary value attributed to that trial. Apathetic PD subjects exhibited higher alpha and theta powers in the pre-trial baseline rest period compared to non-apathetic PD subjects and healthy subjects. Further, we found that both resting power and relative power in alpha and theta bands during incentivized movement predicted PD subjects' apathy scores. Our results suggest that apathetic PD patients may need to overcome greater baseline alpha and theta oscillatory activity in order to facilitate incentivized movement. Clinically, resting alpha and theta power as well as alpha and theta event-related desynchronization during movement may serve as potential neural markers for apathy severity in PD.

In the present study, the event-related potential and event-related spectral perturbations techniques were used to measure the internal cost of spontaneous deception by having participants perform a sender-receiver task in which they decided whether to send deceptive messages to increase their payoff from the task. Several important main findings emerged from this study. We observed a reward positivity (RewP) after senders sent the message, suggesting an integration of reward with associated cost after response in our task. Furthermore, spontaneous deception decreased the amplitude of the RewP and power in the delta and beta bands, whereas it increased the amplitude of power in the theta band, indicating that deception carried an internal cost that devalued individuals' rewards.

Alpha activity is reported to be attenuated in schizophrenia (SCZ). Understanding the interaction between alpha activity during rest and when cognitively engaged may provide insights into the neural circuitry, which is dysfunctional in SCZ. This study investigated the changes of alpha activity between resting state and cognitive engagement in SCZ patients. Methods Thirty-four SCZ patients and 29 healthy controls (HC) were recruited. EEG was performed in the resting state and during an auditory P300 task. All experimental procedures followed the relevant institutional guidelines and regulations. Results In SCZ, high-frequency alpha activity was reduced in the resting state. High-frequency alpha source density was decreased in both the resting-state and a P300 task condition in patients, compared to HC. HC, but not SCZ patients, showed a reduction in high-frequency alpha source density during the P300 task compared to the resting state. The negative correlation between high-frequency alpha source density in the resting state and positive symptoms was significant. Conclusions High-frequency alpha activity in SCZ patients and its unsuccessful reduction during cognitive processing may be biological markers of SCZ.

However, little is known about the control of voluntary facial emotional expression. We investigated the production and switch of facial expressions of happiness and anger in a response-priming task of 23 Chinese female university students and recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. Results revealed that a frontal-central P2 component demonstrated greater positivity in the invalidly cued condition compared with the validly cued condition. Comparing the two facial emotional expressions, data from the contingent negative variation (CNV) component revealed that happiness and anger did not differ in the motor preparation phase. While data from N2 and P3 showed that switching from anger to happiness elicited larger N2 amplitudes than switching from happiness to anger and switching from happiness to anger elicited larger P3 than switching from anger to happiness. The results revealed that in invalidly cued condition, the inhibition (N2) and reprogramming (P3) cost of anger was greater than that of happiness. The findings indicated that during the switching process, both the inhibition and the reprogramming of anger cost more processing resources than those of happiness.

The neural processes underlying mnemonic binding, however, are not fully understood. Moreover, although acute stress is known to modulate memory, if and how stress changes mnemonic integration across time and space is unknown. To elucidate these issues, we exposed participants to a stressor or a control manipulation shortly before they completed, while electroencephalography was recorded, an encoding task that systematically varied the demands for spatial and temporal integration. Associative memory was tested 24 h later. While early event-related potentials, including the P300 and Late Positive Component, distinguished different levels of spatiotemporal discontinuity, only later Slow Waves were linked to subsequent remembering. Furthermore, theta oscillations were specifically associated with successful mnemonic binding. Although acute stress per se left mnemonic integration largely unaffected, autonomic activity facilitated object memory and glucocorticoids enhanced detail memory, indicative for mnemonic integration. At the neural level, stress amplified the effects of spatiotemporal discontinuity on early information processing. Together, our results indicate that temporal and spatial gaps recruit early neural processes, providing attentional resources. The actual binding success, however, appears to depend on later processes as well as theta power and may be shaped by major stress response systems.

Here, EEG signals elicited by visual and tactile stimuli were recorded while adult participants with and without probable DCD (pDCD) performed a motor task. The task cued reaching movements towards a location in visible peripersonal space as well as an area of unseen personal space. Event-related potentials elicited by visual and tactile stimuli revealed that visual processing was strongly affected by movement preparation in the pDCD group, even more than in controls. However, in contrast to the controls, tactile processing in unseen space was unaffected by movement preparation in the pDCD group. The selective use of sensory information from vision and proprioception is fundamental for the adaptive control of movements, and these findings suggest that this is impaired in DCD. Additionally, the pDCD group showed attenuated motor rhythms (beta: 13-30 Hz) over sensorimotor regions following cues to prepare movements towards unseen personal space. The results reveal that individuals with pDCD exhibit differences in the neural mechanisms of spatial selection and action preparation compared to controls, which may underpin the sustained difficulties they experience. These findings provide new insights into the neural mechanisms potentially disrupted in this highly prevalent disorder.

During the progression of the disease, several cognitive mechanisms deteriorate thus diminishing the patient's quality of life. A primary objective in the cognitive assessment of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients is to find reliable measures utilizing diverse neuroimaging techniques. Moreover, especially relevant in the clinical environment is finding technical approaches that could be applied to individual participants and not only for group analysis. A 64-channel electroencephalographic recording (EEG) was made with thirty participants divided into three groups of equivalent size (N = 10) (healthy control, low-EDSS (1-2.5) and moderate-EDSS (4-6)). Correlation analysis was applied to multiple measures: behavior, neuropsychological tests (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test, 3 seconds (PASAT-3s) and the Symbol Digit Modality Test (SDMT)), Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), even-related potential (P3) and event-related desynchronization (ERD) parameters and the correlation scores between individual participant's P3/ERD maps and the healthy grand average P3/ERDmaps. Statistical analysis showed that diverse parameters exhibited significant correlations. A remarkable correlation was the moderate score found between SDMT and EDSS (r = -0.679, p = 0.0009). However, the strongest correlation was between the value of integrated measures (reaction time, P3 and ERD latency) and EDSS (r = 0.699, p = 0.0006). In regard to correlations for grand average maps between groups, the P3 component exhibited a lower score according to a more deteriorated condition (higher EDSS). In contrast, ERD maps remained stable with an increase of EDSS. Lastly, a Z-transformation of individual values of all variables included in the study exhibited heterogeneity in cognitive alterations in the multiple sclerosis participants.

In older adults, N400 ERP studies have shown less efficient use of context compared to younger adults. Here, we asked whether the mechanisms underlying the N400 effect are the same in terms of predictiveness and congruency in younger and older adults. We used a simple picture-word matching task in which we crossed predictiveness and congruency. Our results indicate a three-way interaction between predictiveness, congruency, and age, in that, younger adults showed an N400 effect only in strongly constrained conditions; whereas, older adults showed an effect in both strongly- and weakly constrained conditions. This interaction was not modulated by language experience or cognitive decline. Our results support either two separate mechanisms (lexical access and integration) that run in parallel and are modulated by age or a common prediction error mechanism that changes with age.

Undergraduate students are faced with increased cognitive demands during the examination period that can lead to a higher level of perceived mental fatigue. The P300 component of the event-related potentials is considered an indicator of cognitive information processing, attention allocation and immediate memory. Variation in the P300 component has been linked to a fluctuation in natural and environmentally induced states. In order to evaluate the effects of sleepiness and the mental fatigue we used visual discrimination task to evoke the P300 potential. Reaction time (RT) to deviant stimuli and number of errors were also recorded. Several features of P300 evoked related potential, such as maximum and minimum amplitude, and latency were extracted to evaluate subject's performance in two sessions: during rested period and tired period. Subjects were placed into two sessions based on the battery of tests aimed to assess their arousal state. Rested state was recorded when subjects did not have any increased mental assignments. Tired state was recorded during their increased mental work overload during exam period. Results show a significantly smaller mean amplitude (p < 0.05) and slower RTs in a tired state.	[Zeba, M.

The Bereitschaftspotential (BP) and lateralized readiness potential (LRP) are movement-related potentials generated by cortical motor areas. We hypothesized that the BP and LRP would be altered in children with ADHD. A group of 17 children with ADHD (mean age: 11.5 +/- 1.9 years) and a control group of 16 typically developing children (mean age: 12.2 +/- 2.0 years) performed movements at self-chosen irregular intervals while a 64-channel DC-EEG was registered. BP and LRP were calculated from the EEG. The ADHD group had significantly lower and on average positive BP amplitudes at Cz. In agreement with age-dependent maturation effects the LRP had a positive polarity in both groups, but lower amplitudes were found in the ADHD group without medication. The control group showed a mid-central negativity and a positivity over motor areas contra-lateral to the side of movement, whereas no negativity over Cz and a more diffuse positivity was found in the ADHD group. LRP group differences diminished after MPH administration as indicated by an interaction between group and time of measurement/medication. The cortical motor system shows altered functioning during movement preparation and initiation in children affected by ADHD. Positive Bereitschaftspotential polarities may represent delayed cortical maturation. Group differences of LRP were pharmacologically modulated by the catecholaminergic agent MPH.

The relative extent to which deficits in P300 amplitudes elicited by auditory and visual oddball stimuli precede psychosis onset during the PRS and predict transition to psychosis, however, remains unclear. Forty-three individuals meeting PRS criteria, 19 schizophrenia patients, and 43 healthy control (HC) participants completed baseline electroencephalography recording during separate auditory and visual oddball tasks. Two subcomponents of P300 were measured: P3b, elicited by infrequent target stimuli, and P3a, elicited by infrequent nontarget novel stimuli. Auditory and visual target P3b and novel P3a amplitudes were reduced in PRS and schizophrenia participants relative to HC participants. In addition, baseline auditory and visual target P3b, but not novel P3a, amplitudes were reduced in 15 PRS participants who later converted to psychosis, relative to 18 PRS non-converters who were followed for at least 22 months. Furthermore, target P3b amplitudes predicted time to psychosis onset among PRS participants. These results suggest that P300 amplitude deficits across auditory and visual modalities emerge early in the schizophrenia illness course and precede onset of full psychosis. Moreover, target P3b may represent an important neurophysiological vulnerability marker of the imminence of risk for psychosis.

Participants listened to story contexts that described two antecedents, and subsequently read a target sentence with a critical noun phrase that lexically matched one antecedent ('old'), matched two antecedents ('ambiguous'), partially matched one antecedent in terms of semantic features ('partial-match'), or introduced another referent (non-anaphoric, 'new'). After each target sentence, participants judged whether the noun referred back to an antecedent (i.e., an 'old/new' judgment), which was easiest for ambiguous nouns and hardest for partially matching nouns. The noun-elicited N400 ERP component demonstrated initial sensitivity to repetition and semantic overlap, corresponding to repetition and semantic priming effects, respectively. New and partially matching nouns both elicited a subsequent frontal positivity, which suggested that partially matching anaphors may have been processed as new nouns temporarily. ERPs in an even later time window and ERPs time-locked to sentence-final words suggested that new and partially matching nouns had different effects on comprehension, with partially matching nouns incurring additional processing costs up to the end of the sentence. In contrast to the ERP results, the time-frequency results primarily demonstrated sensitivity to noun repetition, and did not differentiate partially matching anaphors from new nouns. In sum, our results show the ERP and time-frequency effects of referent repetition during discourse comprehension, and demonstrate the potentially demanding nature of establishing the anaphoric meaning of a novel noun.

They reflect local field potential activity generated by the laminar arrangement of cell-type specific microcircuits interacting brain-wide under the influence of neuromodulators, endogenous processes and cognitive demands. Under neuropathological conditions, the spatiotemporal structure of physiological brain oscillations is disrupted as recorded by electroencephalography and event-relate potentials. Such rhythmopathies can be used to track microcircuit alterations leading not only to transient pathological activities such as interictal discharges and seizures but also to a range of cognitive co-morbidities. Here we review how basic oscillatory modes induced in human brain slices prepared after surgical treatment can help us to understand basic aspects of brain function and dysfunction. We propose to overcome the traditional view of examining human brain slices merely as generators of epileptiform activities and to integrate them in a more physiologically-oriented oscillatory framework to better understand mechanisms of the diseased human brain.

Nevertheless, other compound types, such as Spanish Verb-noun compounds, exhibit morphological particularities such as exocentricity, verb argument structure, and metaphorical features, increasing the attributes that may influence compound processing. We analysed whether these traits influenced Spanish Verb-noun compound processing. A lexical decision task was administrated with electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. Following differences in argument structure and metaphorical traits, three compound types were presented: Agentives, Locatives, and Metaphoricals. Locatives were responded worse and slower than Agentives. Metaphoricals elicited increases in the P300 and P600-like components. Thus, verb argument structure and metaphorical processes influence Spanish Verb-noun compound processing. Similarly to endocentric English Noun-noun compounds, processing Spanish Verb-noun compounds involves specific conceptual operations. These conceptual combinations appear to be determined by the projection of verb argument structure and the mapping and assignation of thematic roles.

Psychophysiological measures may provide added value not captured through behavioral or self-report measures alone. This paper provides a selective review of the psychophysiological measures that can be utilized to assess cognitive states in real-world driving environments. First, the importance of psychophysiological measures within the context of traffic safety is discussed. Next, the most commonly used physiology-based indices of cognitive states are considered as potential candidates relevant for driving research. These include: electroencephalography and event-related potentials, optical imaging, heart rate and heart rate variability, blood pressure, skin conductance, electromyography, thermal imaging, and pupillometry. For each of these measures, an overview is provided, followed by a discussion of the methods for measuring it in a driving context. Drawing from recent empirical driving and psychophysiology research, the relative strengths and limitations of each measure are discussed to highlight each measures' unique value. Challenges and recommendations for valid and reliable quantification from lab to (less predictable) real-world driving settings are considered. Finally, we discuss measures that may be better candidates for a near real-time assessment of motorists' cognitive states that can be utilized in applied settings outside the lab. This review synthesizes the literature on in-vehicle psychophysiological measures to advance the development of effective human-machine driving interfaces and driver support systems.

Since many general processes contribute to explicit behavioural performance in individual face discrimination tasks, isolating a measure of unfamiliar individual face discrimination ability in humans is challenging. In recent years, a fast periodic visual stimulation approach (FPVS) has provided objective (frequency-locked) implicit electrophysiological indices of individual face discrimination that are highly sensitive at the individual level within a few minutes of testing. Here we evaluate the test-retest reliability of this response across scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) recording sessions separated by more than two months, in the same 30 individuals. We found no test-retest difference overall across sessions in terms of amplitude and spatial distribution of the EEG individual face discrimination response. Moreover, with only 4 stimulation sequences corresponding to 4 min of recordings per session, the individual face discrimination response was highly reliable in terms of amplitude, spatial distribution, and shape. Together with previous observations, these results strengthen the diagnostic value of FPVS-EEG as an objective and rapid flag for specific difficulties at individual face recognition in the human population.

Rapid adaptive adjustments of selective attention following errors revealed by the time course of steady-state visual evoked potentials	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Cognitive control; Error monitoring; Event-related potentials; Selective attention; Steady-state visual evoked potentials	MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; NEURAL MECHANISMS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; RESPONSE ERRORS; TASK-RELEVANT; EEG DYNAMICS; CUED SHIFTS; ALPHA; SUPPRESSION; AMPLIFICATION	Directing attention to task-relevant stimuli is crucial for successful task performance, but too much attentional selectivity implies that new and unexpected information in the environment remains undetected. A possible mechanism for optimizing this fundamental trade-off could be an error monitoring system that immediately triggers attentional adjustments following the detection of behavioral errors. However, the existence of rapid adaptive post-error adjustments has been controversially debated. While preconscious error processing reflected by an error-related negativity (Ne/ERN) in the event-related potential has been shown to occur within milliseconds after errors, more recent studies concluded that error detection even impairs attentional selectivity and that adaptive adjustments are implemented, if at all, only after errors are consciously detected. Here, we employ steady-state visual evoked potentials elicited by continuously presented stimuli to precisely track the emergence of error-induced attentional adjustments. Our results indicate that errors lead to an immediate reallocation of attention towards task-relevant stimuli, which occurs simultaneously with the Ne/ERN. Single-trial variation of this adjustment was correlated with the Ne/ERN amplitude and predicted adaptive behavioral adjustments on the post-error trial. This suggests that early error monitoring in the medial frontal cortex is directly involved in eliciting adaptive attentional adjustments.

Being able to overcome such conflicts is a necessary prerequisite in everyday life, because it enables goal-directed behavior. On a conceptual level, different kinds of conflict can be distinguished: conflicts at a stimulus level (S-S conflicts) can be dissociated from stimulus-response (S-R) conflicts. Considering cognitive psychological frameworks, we examined whether simultaneously presented conflicts potentiate each other, or are rather integrated into a single conflict. To assess the neurophysiological mechanisms and functional neuroanatomical structures that are modulated by independent, interfering or integrative processing of conflicts, we use a Simon-Stroop paradigm in combination with EEG recordings and source localization. We show that S-R (Simon) conflict monitoring processes reflected by anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and N2 ERP component modulations are unaffected by simultaneous S-S (Stroop) conflicts. In contrast to that, S-S (Stroop) conflicts, reflected in N450 ERP component and ACC modulations are not processed separately when there is an already existing S-R conflict. Rather, S-S (Stroop) conflicts are likely integrated into previously established S-R conflict resolution and also modulate response selection processes associated with the modulation of the P3 ERP component and dorsolateral prefrontal structures. The results suggest that even though different kinds of conflicts can be distinguished, they can become integrated during neural processing associated with medial frontal areas.

Neural representations of aversive value encoding in pain catastrophizers	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Pain; Brain; EEG; Biomarker; Cognitive; Expectation; Catastrophize; Distress	PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CORTICAL RESPONSES; DEPRESSION; BRAIN; INFORMATION; ACTIVATION; BIOMARKERS; SEVERITY; DISTRESS; SALIENCE	Chronic pain is exacerbated by maladaptive cognition such as pain catastrophizing (PC). Biomarkers of PC mechanisms may aid precision medicine for chronic pain. Here, we investigate EEG biomarkers using mass univariate and multivariate (machine learning) approaches. We test theoretical notions that PC results from a combination of augmented aversive-value encoding ("magnification") and persistent expectations of pain ("rumination"). Healthy individuals with high or low levels of PC underwent an experimental pain model involving nociceptive laser stimuli preceded by cues predicting forthcoming pain intensity. Analysis of EEG acquired during the cue and laser stimulation provided event-related potentials (ERPs) identifying spatially and temporally-extended neural representations associated with pain catastrophizing. Specifically, differential neural responses to cues predicting high vs. low intensity pain (i.e. aversive value encoding) were larger in the high PC group, largely originating from mid-cingulate and superior parietal cortex. Multivariate spatiotemporal EEG patterns evoked from cues with high aversive value selectively and significantly differentiated the high PC from low PC group (64.6% classification accuracy). Regression analyses revealed that neural patterns classifying groups could be partially predicted (R-2 = 28%) from those neural patterns classifying the aversive value of cues. In contrast, behavioural and EEG analyses did not provide evidence that PC modifies more persistent effects of prior expectation on pain perception and nociceptive responses. These findings support the hypothesis of magnification of aversive value encoding but not persistent expression of expectation in pain catastrophizers. Multivariate patterns of aversive value encoding provide promising biomarkers of maladaptive cognitive responses to chronic pain that have future potential for psychological treatment development and clinical stratification.

Reactivation of memory traces in the hippocampus occurs during sharp-wave ripples (SWRs; 140-250 Hz). To better understand the mechanisms underlying high-frequency oscillations and cognitive comorbidities in epilepsy, we evaluated how rigorously identified deep CA1 pyramidal cells (dPCs) discharge during SWRs in control and TLE mice. MethodsWe used the unilateral intraamygdala kainate model of TLE in video-electroencephalography (EEG) verified chronically epileptic adult mice. Local field potential and single-cell recordings were performed using juxtacellular recordings from awake control and TLE mice resting on a spherical treadmill, followed by post hoc identification of the recorded cells. ResultsHippocampal SWRs in TLE mice occurred with increased intraripple frequency compared to control mice. The frequency of SWR events was decreased, whereas the overall frequency of SWRs, interictal epileptiform discharges, and high-frequency ripples (250-500 Hz) together was not altered. CA1 dPCs in TLE mice showed significantly increased firing during ripples as well as between the ripple events. The strength of ripple modulation of dPC discharges increased in TLE without alteration of the preferred phase of firing during the ripple waves. SignificanceThese juxtacellular electrophysiology data obtained from identified CA1 dPCs from chronically epileptic mice are in general agreement with recent findings indicating distortion of normal firing patterns during offline SWRs as a mechanism underlying deficits in memory consolidation in epilepsy. Because the primary seizure focus in our experiments was in the amygdala and we recorded from the CA1 region, these results are also in agreement with the presence of altered high-frequency oscillations in areas of secondary seizure spread.

Therefore, in the present study, we investigated whether affective information can influence executive control in preschool children. We have recorded EEG during a Go/Nogo task where gender of a face served as a Go/Nogo cue and emotional expressions (positive, negative, neutral) were task irrelevant. Negative emotions modulated the magnitude of the conflict effect (Nogo vs. Go) in the N200 relative to neutral control, indicating enhanced cognitive control for negative emotions. Moreover, interpersonal characteristics (e. g., aggressive behavior) correlated with the emotion facilitated inhibitory control as indicated by N200. In addition, Go/Nogo conflict modulated neural responses in children already 100 ms after stimulus onset when paired with socially relevant emotional stimuli. These results show that emotions affect cognitive control in this age group in a valence specific manner.

Research on perceptual decision making has revealed a late event-related EEG potential (the Centro-Parietal Positivity, CPP) to be a correlate of the accumulation of sensory evidence. We tested how this evidence accumulation signal relates to externally presented (physical) and internally experienced (subjective) sensory evidence. Our results show that the known relationship between the physical strength of the external evidence and the evidence accumulation signal (reflected in the CPP amplitude) is mediated by the level of subjective experience of stimulus strength. This shows that the CPP closely tracks the subjective perceptual evidence, over and above the physically presented evidence. We conclude that a remarkably close relationship exists between the evidence accumulation process (i.e. CPP) and subjective perceptual experience, suggesting that neural decision processes and components of conscious experience are tightly linked.

The Impact of Math Anxiety on Working Memory: A Cortical Activations and Cortical Functional Connectivity EEG Study	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Mathematical anxiety; math anxiety; working memory; EEG; cortical functional connectivity	MATHEMATICS ANXIETY; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; BAND OSCILLATIONS; CINGULATE CORTEX; BRAIN; PAIN; RESPONSES; ALPHA; INFORMATION; MODULATION	Mathematical anxiety (MA) is defined as a feeling of tension, apprehension, or fear that interferes with mathematical performance in various daily or academic situations. Cognitive consequences of MA have been studied a lot and revealed that MA seriously affects solving the complex problem due to the corruption of working memory (WM). The corruption of WM caused by MA is well documented in behavioral level, but the involved neurophysiological processes have not been properly addressed, despite the recent attention drawn on the neural basis of MA. This is the second part of our study that intents to investigate the neurophysiological aspects of MA and its implications to WM. In the first study, we saw how MA affects the early stages of numeric stimuli processes as the WM indirectly using event-related potentials in scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. This paper goes one step further to investigate the cortical activations, obtained by the multichannel EEG recordings as well as the cortical functional networks in three WM tasks with increasing difficulty. Our results indicate that the high-math anxious (HMA) group activated more areas linked with negative emotions, pain, and fear, while the low-math anxious (LMA) group activated regions related to the encoding and retrieval processes of the WM. Functional connectivity analysis also reveals that the LMAs' brain has got more structured cortical networks with increased connectivity in areas related to WM, such as the frontal cortex, while the HMAs' brain has a more diffused and unstructured network, superimposing the evidence that the structured processes of WM are corrupted.

While functional imaging (fMRI) can detect resting and activated states of metabolic activity, its use is limited by poor temporal resolution, cost and confounding vascular parameters. By contrast, electrophysiological (e.g. EEG/MEG) recordings provide direct measures of neural activity with excellent temporal resolution, and source localization methodologies can address problems of spatial resolution, permitting measurement of functional activity of brain networks with a spatial resolution similar to that of fMRI. This opens an exciting therapeutic approach focussed on pharmacological and physiological modulation of brain network activity. This review describes current neurophysiological approaches towards evaluating cortical network dysfunction in common neurodegenerative disorders. It explores how modern neurophysiologic tools can provide markers for diagnosis, prognosis, subcategorization and clinical trial outcome measures, and how modulation of brain networks can contribute to new therapeutic approaches.

We investigated the neural dynamics of this decision process by analyzing the neural electrical signals acquired from electroencephalography (EEG) during a value-based action-selection task. In particular, we determined whether sensorimotor beta oscillations, traditionally studied in the context of motor control, are also involved in value-based decision making for actions. Additionally, we examined the involvement of this beta signal relative to other neural signals such as the ERP components P2 and P3, which have been previously identified in reward processing and value computations. Our results from healthy young adults (N = 31), showed a significant decrease in sensorimotor beta power during a decision phase without any motor response, in addition to an action phase when a response was made. The decision-phase beta signal was preceded by the P2/P3b components, and all of these neural signals reliably dissociated the different reward and risk levels, suggesting the encoding of decision variables. Importantly, while the beta signal during both the action and decision phase predicted behavioral performance (i.e., response time) in the action phase, the preceding P2/P3b had no such predictive association with the behavior. Collectively, these results demonstrate a unique contribution of the motor system in value-based decision making for actions, via the translation of motivational information into a motor signal across time.

However, these methods have not been fully adopted in medical practice, specifically to inform clinical diagnosis of neurological disorders. In this paper, some of the benefits and challenges of using these techniques as biomarkers for disease indication and progression are discussed. Examples of baseline EEG (resting state) data acquired with the same system and software from patients diagnosed with four types of neurodegenerative diseases are presented and compared with healthy controls. Overall power spectral density analyses showed clear significant differences in EEG for patient sub-types including enhanced theta power in dementia patients (Alzheimer's and Lewy-body dementia), enhanced beta power in Parkinson's patients (with or without dementia) and reduced Alpha power in Alzheimer's dementia. To assess the discriminating power of resting state EEG spectral measures particularly for differential diagnosis at an individual level, a binary classifier was designed to classify EEG data across conditions after feature dimensionality reduction (PCA). The results were evaluated using the area under classifier's ROC curve (AUC). On average, data acquired during eyes-closed resting state resulted in better classification than eyes-open. The highest classification performance (against healthy control) was obtained for Alzheimer's dementia (AD) and Lewy-body dementia (LBD) with AUC =0.80 in both cases. The least accurate classification results were obtained for Mild Cognitive Impairments (MCI) group. The challenges of using resting state EEG for characterization of MCI is discussed and other examples of EEG biomarkers for MCI based on event-related-potentials in a cognitive test of visual memory are presented. An argument is made for adequate sensitivity/specificity of the current state-of-the-art in data-driven EEG analytics as secondary end-points in clinical trials. However, routine clinical diagnostic at an individual level may require a paradigm shift incorporating techniques of precision medicine and big data analytics. Multi-modal public datasets (including EEG and other imaging/clinical data) and adopting standards/protocols for sharing anonymized data between researchers could likely facilitate development of more reliable biomarkers in clinical practice.

Previous work has shown that neural oscillations will entrain to the beat of the music or rhythmic stimuli. Despite the fact that aging is known to impact both auditory and cognitive processing, little is known about how aging affects neural entrainment to rhythmic stimuli. In this study, younger and older participants listened to isochronous sequences at a slower and faster rate while EEG data was recorded. Steady-state evoked potentials had amplitude peaks at the stimulus rate and its harmonics. Steady-state evoked potentials at the stimulus rate and the first harmonic was attenuated in older adults compared to younger adults. Additionally, no amplitude difference was found for the second and third harmonics in older adults, while there was a decrease in amplitude in younger adults. This age-related decline in the entrainment specificity of the brain responses to the stimulus rate, suggests that aging may decrease the ability to entrain to stimuli in the environment, and further suggests that older adults may be less able to inhibit neural entrainment that is not directly related to the incoming stimulus.

J	Sassenhagen, J; Draschkow, D				Sassenhagen, Jona; Draschkow, Dejan			Cluster-based permutation tests of MEG/EEG data do not establish significance of effect latency or location	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						cluster-based permutation test; EEG; MEG; statistics	BRAIN POTENTIALS/FIELDS; EEG; MEG; DYNAMICS; ERP	Cluster-based permutation tests are gaining an almost universal acceptance as inferential procedures in cognitive neuroscience. They elegantly handle the multiple comparisons problem in high-dimensional magnetoencephalographic and EEG data. Unfortunately, the power of this procedure comes hand in hand with the allure for unwarranted interpretations of the inferential output, the most prominent of which is the overestimation of the temporal, spatial, and frequency precision of statistical claims. This leads researchers to statements about the onset or offset of a certain effect that is not supported by the permutation test. In this article, we outline problems and common pitfalls of using and interpreting cluster-based permutation tests. We illustrate these with simulated data in order to promote a more intuitive understanding of the method. We hope that raising awareness about these issues will be beneficial to common scientific practices, while at the same time increasing the popularity of cluster-based permutation procedures.

Intense and sustained pain reduces cortical responses to auditory stimuli: Implications for the interpretation of the effects of heterotopic noxious conditioning stimulation in humans	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cognition; conditioned pain modulation; event-related potentials; heterotopic noxious conditioning stimulation; pain	NOCICEPTIVE WITHDRAWAL REFLEX; INHIBITORY CONTROLS; ATTENTIONAL MODULATION; COUNTER-STIMULATION; RELIABILITY; INVOLVEMENT; PERCEPTION	Phasic pain stimuli are inhibited when they are applied concomitantly with a conditioning tonic stimulus at another body location (heterotopic noxious conditioning stimulation, HNCS). While the effects of HNCS are thought to rely on a spino-bulbo-spinal mechanism in animals (termed diffuse noxious inhibitory controls, DNIC), the underlying neurophysiology in humans may involve other pathways. In this study, we investigated the role of concomitant supraspinal mechanisms during HNCS by presenting auditory stimuli during a conditioning tonic painful stimulus (the cold pressor test, CPT). Considering that auditory stimuli are not conveyed through the spinal cord, any changes in brain responses to auditory stimuli during HNCS can be ascribed entirely to supraspinal mechanisms. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded during HNCS, and auditory stimuli were administered in three blocks, before, during and after HNCS. Nociceptive withdrawal reflexes (NWRs) were recorded at the same time points to investigate spinal processing. Our results showed that AEPs were significantly reduced during HNCS. Moreover, the amplitude of the NWR was significantly diminished during HNCS in most participants. Given that spinal and supraspinal mechanisms operate concomitantly during HNCS, the possibility of isolating their individual contributions in humans is questionable. We conclude that the net effects of HCNS are not independent from attentional/cognitive influences.

Our aim was to analyze the oscillatory background of these processes and to investigate the connection between the magnocellular pathway deficit and the abnormal facial affect processing. Thirty-nine subjects with schizophrenia and forty socially matched healthy controls subjects were enrolled. A 128 channel EEG was recorded in three experimental tasks: first, participants viewed magnocellular biased low-spatial frequency (LSF) and parvocellular biased high-spatial frequency (HSF) Gabor-patches, then faces and houses were presented and in the third task a facial affect recognition task was presented with happy, sad and neutral faces. Event-related theta (4-7 Hz) synchronization (ERS) (i.e. an increase in theta power) by magnocellular biased stimuli was decreased in patients relative to controls, while no similar differences were found between groups in the parvocellular biased condition. ERS was significantly lower in patients compared to healthy controls both in the face and in the emotion recognition task. Theta ERS to magnocellular biased stimuli, but not to parvocellular biased stimuli, were correlated with emotion recognition performance. These findings indicate a bottom up disruption of face perception and emotion recognition in schizophrenia.

However, cognitive neuroscientific evidence for this conclusion is limited. In the present study, a real-life evaluation circumstance was established in which evaluative comments about college students and their friends were collected. EEG signals of shy and non-shy college students were recorded while they were instructed to judge whether these comments were suitable for evaluating themselves (self-related task) and their friends (friend-related task) and to indicate whether they knew the meaning of the adjectives (baseline task). Shy subjects demonstrated a significantly larger P3 mean amplitude for both self-related and friend-related tasks compared with the baseline task. By contrast, non-shy subjects demonstrated a significantly larger P3 mean amplitude in the self-related task than in the other two tasks. The baseline task results were then subtracted, and the difference in EEG signals revealed that shy subjects were more sensitive to comments about themselves as well as their friends compared with their non-shy counterparts. These findings provide neurophysiological evidence for the interpersonal evaluation sensitivity of shy individuals in the late attention-sensitive stage. Furthermore, excessive involvement in interpersonal evaluations may be a neurocognitive deficit in shy individuals, which may be related to maladaptative cognition.

One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the visual system predicts upcoming input across saccadic eye-movements based on peripheral preview of the saccadic target. We tested this idea using concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking. Participants made cued saccades to peripheral upright or inverted face stimuli that changed orientation (invalid preview) or maintained orientation (valid preview) while the saccade was completed. Experiment 1 demonstrated better discrimination performance and a reduced fixation-locked N170 component (fN170) with valid than with invalid preview, demonstrating integration of pre- and post-saccadic information. Moreover, the early fixation-related potentials (FRP) showed a preview face inversion effect suggesting that some pre-saccadic input was represented in the brain until around 170 ms post fixation-onset. Experiment 2 replicated Experiment 1 and manipulated the proportion of valid and invalid trials to test whether the preview effect reflects context-based prediction across trials. A whole-scalp Bayes factor analysis showed that this manipulation did not alter the fN170 preview effect but did influence the face inversion effect before the saccade. The pre-saccadic inversion effect declined earlier in the mostly invalid block than in the mostly valid block, which is consistent with the notion of pre-saccadic expectations. In addition, in both studies, we found strong evidence for an interaction between the pre-saccadic preview stimulus and the post-saccadic target as early as 50 ms (Experiment 2) or 90 ms (Experiment 1) into the new fixation. These findings suggest that visual stability may involve three temporal stages: prediction about the saccadic target, integration of pre-saccadic and post-saccadic information at around 50-90 ms post fixation onset, and post-saccadic facilitation of rapid categorization.

Neural Evidence of Superior Memory: How to Capture Brain Activities of Encoding Processes Underlying Superior Memory	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						superior memory; event-related potentials; protocol analysis; memory training; digit-span	DELTA BAND ACTIVITY; WORKING-MEMORY; DIGIT MEMORY; THETA; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; COMPONENTS; RETRIEVAL; DYNAMICS	Relatively little attention has been paid to the neural basis of superior memory despite its potential in providing important insight into efforts to improve memory in the general population or to offset age-related cognitive decline. The current study reports a rare opportunity to reproduce and isolate specific neural activities directly associated with exceptional memory. To capture the brain processes responsible for superior memory, we returned to a laboratory task and analytic approach used to explore the nature of exceptional memory, namely, digit-span task combined with verbal protocol analysis. One participant with average memory received approximately 50 h of digit-span training and the participant's digit-span increased from normative (8 digits) to exceptional (30 digits). Event-related potentials were recorded while the participant's digit span increased from 19 to 30 digits. Protocol analysis allowed us to identify direct behavioral indices of idiosyncratic encoding processes underlying the superior memory performance. EEG indices directly corresponding to the behavioral indices of encoding processes were identified. The results suggest that the early attention-related encoding processes were reflected in theta and delta whereas the later attention-independent encoding processes were reflected in time-domain slow-wave. This fine-grained approach offers new insights into studying neural mechanism mediating superior memory and the cognitive effort necessary to develop it.

In P300induced brain-computer interfacing, one often comes across the challenge of modeling uncertainties due to fluctuations in EEG feature values within a specific session and across several sessions of EEG recordings of a specific subject. The relevance of fuzzy systems in this domain thus cannot be undermined. In this paper, the authors propose (a) an interval type-2 fuzzy classifier for detecting P300 occurrences and (b) a feature tuning algorithm for selection of Autoregressive Yule Parameter features of optimal lag-length corresponding to individual electrodes with an aim to maximize a classifier-oriented performance metric. The classifier performance metric is formulated as a simple objective function tailored to the classifier performance in terms of low uncertainty and high classification accuracy. The relationship between the proposed objective function value and classification accuracy is found to be statistically significant over iterations. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 90.8%.

However, for long duration of stimulation, the rhythmic and repetitive aspects of music have often been associated to a trance state. In this study we conceived an auditory monitoring task that allows tracking changes of psychophysical auditory thresholds. Participants performed the task while listening to rhythmically regular and an irregular (scrambled but spectrally identical) music that were presented with an intermittent (short) and continuous (long) type of stimulation. Results show that psychophysical auditory thresholds increase following a Continuous versus Intermittent stimulation and this is accompanied by a reduction of the amplitude of two event-related potentials to target stimuli. These effects are larger with regular music, thus do not simply derive from the duration of stimulation. Interestingly, they seem to be related to a frequency selective neural coupling as well as an increase of network connectivity in the alpha band between frontal and central regions. Our study shows that the idea that rhythmic presentation of sensory stimuli facilitates perception might be limited to short streams, while long, highly regular, repetitive and strongly engaging streams may have an opposite perceptual impact.

J	Singh, AK; Touhara, K; Okamoto, M				Singh, Archana K.; Touhara, Kazushige; Okamoto, Masako			Electrophysiological correlates of top-down attentional modulation in olfaction	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							BRAIN POTENTIALS; LOCALIZATION; RESPONSES; EEG; TOMOGRAPHY; PERCEPTION; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; SYSTEM; CORTEX	The capacity to pay attention is important for the cognitive ability, for example, evaluating an object for its qualities. Attention can selectively prioritize the neural processes that are relevant to a given task. Neuroimaging investigations on human attention are primarily focused on vision to the exclusion of other sensory systems, particularly olfaction. Neural underpinnings of human olfactory attention are still not clearly understood. Here, we combined electroencephalographic measurements of olfactory event related potential with electrical neuroimaging to investigate how the neural responses after inhaling the same odor differ between conditions with varying levels of attention, and, in which brain areas. We examined the neural responses when participants attended to a rose-like odor of phenylethyl alcohol for evaluating its pleasantness versus its passive inhalation. Our results gathered significant evidence for attentional modulation of the olfactory neural response. The most prominent effect was found for the late positive component, P3, of olfactory event related potential within a second from the odor onset. The source reconstruction of this data revealed activations in a distributed network of brain regions predominantly in inferior frontal cortex, insula, and inferior temporal gyrus. These results suggest that the neuronal modulations from attention to olfactory pleasantness may be subserved by this network.

To understand the dynamic interplay between neural activity and spoken language development, we used resting-state EEG recordings to explore the relation between alpha oscillations (7-10 Hz) and oral language ability in 4- to 6-yearold children with typical development (N = 41). Three properties of alpha oscillations were investigated: a) alpha power using spectral analysis, b) flexibility of the alpha frequency quantified via the oscillation's momentto-moment fluctuations, and c) scaling behavior of the alpha oscillator investigated via the long-range temporal correlation in the alpha-amplitude time course. All three properties of the alpha oscillator correlated with children's oral language abilities. Higher language scores were correlated with lower alpha power, greater flexibility of the alpha frequency, and longer temporal correlations in the alpha-amplitude time course. Our findings demonstrate a cognitive role of several properties of the alpha oscillator that has largely been overlooked in the literature.	[Kwok, Elaine Y.

The EEG Theta/Beta Ratio: A marker of Arousal or Cognitive Processing Capacity?	APPLIED PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY AND BIOFEEDBACK			English	Article						EEG; P300; Arousal; Processing; Theta; beta ratio	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY-DISORDER; DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; STIMULANT MEDICATIONS; CHILDREN; P300; ADHD; VALIDATION; SURPRISE; ADDRESS	Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) is the most common psychiatric disorder of childhood and has been extensively researched using EEG technology. Within this literature, one of the most widely examined measures has been the theta/beta ratio. The theta/beta ratio was initially hypothesised to represent the arousal mechanism. However, subsequent research has shown this to be inaccurate and it was hypothesised that the ratio represents cognitive processing capacity. To examine that hypothesis, this study aimed to test the relationship between the P300 and the theta/beta ratio. The P300, absolute alpha and the theta/beta ratio were measured at Fz, Cz and Pz, and correlated in a group of 47 normal adults. A significant positive correlation was found between P300 latency and the theta/beta ratio. No relationship was found between P300 amplitude and the theta/beta ratio. P300 amplitude, but not latency, significantly correlated with alpha power. These results support the hypothesis that the theta/beta ratio is a marker of cognitive processing capacity.

Decoding P300 Variability Using Convolutional Neural Networks	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neural decoding; EEG; deep learning; convolutional neural network; P300	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TASK; AMPLITUDE; P3A; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; LATENCY; UTILITY; INDEX	Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have previously been shown to be useful tools for signal decoding and analysis in a variety of complex domains, such as image processing and speech recognition. By learning from large amounts of data, the representations encoded by these deep networks are often invariant to moderate changes in the underlying feature spaces. Recently, we proposed a CNN architecture that could be applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding and analysis. In this article, we train our CNN model using data from prior experiments in order to later decode the P300 evoked response from an unseen, hold-out experiment. We analyze the CNN output as a function of the underlying variability in the P300 response and demonstrate that the CNN output is sensitive to the experiment-induced changes in the neural response. We then assess the utility of our approach as a means of improving the overall signal-to-noise ratio in the EEG record. Finally, we show an example of how CNN-based decoding can be applied to the analysis of complex data.

Here, we assess whether motor behaviour can be influenced by anticipated homeostatic feeling states induced through different predictable contexts. Participants performed a reward incentive paradigm in which accurate responses increased (gain) or avoided the depletion (averted loss) of a credit score. Across two types of blocks, we varied the predictability of the outcome state. In predictable blocks, a cue signaled a gain, loss or control trial (motor response did not affect the credit score). This allowed participants to anticipate the interoceptive feeling state associated with the outcome. In unpredictable blocks, the cue had no relation to the type of outcome. Thus, participants were unable to anticipate the feeling state it produced. Via EEG, we measured the Heartbeat Evoked Potential (HEP) and the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) as indices of interoceptive and motor processing respectively. In addition, we measured feedback P3 amplitude following outcome presentation and accuracy and reaction times of the required motor response. We observed higher HEP and CNV amplitudes as well as faster and more accurate motor responses in predictable compared to unpredictable outcome blocks. Similarly, feedback-related P3 amplitudes were significantly lower for predictable relative to unpredictable outcomes. Crucially, HEP amplitudes measured prior to feedback predicted feedback-related P3 amplitudes for anticipated outcome events. Results suggest that accurate anticipation of homeostatic feeling states associated with gain, loss or control outcomes facilitates motor execution and outcome evaluation. Findings are hereby the first to empirically assess the link between interoceptive and motor domains and provide primary evidence for a joint processing structure.

A commonly used BCI paradigm is based on the detection of event-related potentials, particularly the P300, immersed in the electroencephalogram (EEG). In order to transfer laboratory-tested BCIs into systems that can be used by at homes, it is relevant to investigate if it is possible to select a limited set of EEG channels that work for most subjects and across different sessions without a significant decrease in performance. In this work, two strategies for channel selection for a single-trial P300 brain computer interface were evaluated and compared. The first strategy was tailored specifically for each subject, whereas the second strategy aimed at finding a subject-independent set of channels. In both strategies, genetic algorithms (GAs) and recursive feature elimination algorithms were used. The classification stage was performed using a linear discriminant. A dataset of EEG recordings from 18 healthy subjects was used test the proposed configurations. Performance indexes were calculated to evaluate the system. Results showed that a fixed subset of four subject-independent EEG channels selected using GA provided the best compromise between BCI setup and single-trial system performance.

To produce sentences and melodies quickly and accurately, individuals must plan upcoming sequence events, as well as monitor outcomes via auditory feedback. We investigated the neural correlates of sequential planning and monitoring processes by manipulating auditory feedback during music performance. Pianists performed isochronous melodies from memory at an initially cued rate while their electroencephalogram was recorded. Pitch feedback was occasionally altered to match either an immediately upcoming Near-Future pitch (next sequence event) or a more distant Far-Future pitch (two events ahead of the current event). Near-Future, but not Far-Future altered feedback perturbed the timing of pianists' performances, suggesting greater interference of Near-Future sequential events with current planning processes. Near-Future feedback triggered a greater reduction in auditory sensory suppression (enhanced response) than Far-Future feedback, reflected in the P2 component elicited by the pitch event following the unexpected pitch change. Greater timing perturbations were associated with enhanced cortical sensory processing of the pitch event following the Near-Future altered feedback. Both types of feedback alterations elicited feedback-related negativity (FRN) and P3a potentials and amplified spectral power in the theta frequency range. These findings suggest similar constraints on producers' sequential planning to those reported in speech production.

To run with the herd or not: Electrophysiological dynamics are associated with preference change in crowdfunding	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Social conformity; Crowdfunding; Event-related potential (ERP); Feedback related negativity (FRN); P300; Single trial analysis	CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; SOCIAL-INFLUENCE; BRAIN RESPONSES; FEEDBACK; CONFORMITY; CHOICE; OTHERS; GAINS	The herd instinct is a common feature of human society and is frequently encountered in a myriad of other human social interaction including entertainment, fashion, and the adoption of new gadgets. Indeed, social influence, taking account of others' actions in one's decisions, is ubiquitous in our daily life. With the growing prevalence of crowdfunding investments, an increasing number of studies are currently focused on how social influences impact such behavior. Moreover, only a few studies have examined its neural correlates and the value of evaluating social influence as a possible predictor of herd behavior especially regarding crowdfunding. The present study aims to parse the neural processing of social influences on crowdfunding investment and examine whether neural signals can be correlated with an individuals' willingness to invest. Our results demonstrate that the greater ones' choice deviates from the overall group judgement, there is a resulting increased deflection of the feedback related negativity (FRN). However, the averaged and single trial analysis reveal that the subsequent P300, rather than the feedback related negativity, reflects the magnitude of social influence on individual behavior. Single trial analysis of the EEG data shows that, in addition to the behavioral manipulation, the deflection of the P300 is a robust signal, which is associated with the behavioral adjustment following an individual's awareness of the group opinion at the trial-by-trial level. The current study freshly extends the growing literature on social influences on decision making stemming from another's action to the new investment possibilities of crowdfunding investment and notably observes that the P300 component at the outcome stage evidently is associated with the behavioral-decision making shift evoked by following the herd.

Detection and Prediction of Microsleeps from EEG using Spatio-Temporal Patterns	2019 41ST ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	41st Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	JUL 23-27, 2019	Berlin, GERMANY				COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERNS; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; SLEEP	A microsleep is a brief lapse in performance due to an involuntary sleep-related loss of consciousness. These episodes are of particular importance in occupations requiring extended unimpaired visuomotor performance, such as driving. Detection and even prediction of microsleeps has the potential to prevent catastrophic events and fatal accidents. In this study, we examined detection and prediction of microsleeps using EEG data of 8 subjects who performed two 1-h sessions of continuous 1-D tracking. A regularized spatio-temporal filtering and classification (RSTFC) method was used to extract features from 5-s EEG segments. These features were then used to train three different linear classifiers: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), sparse Bayesian learning (SBL), and variational Bayesian logistic regression (VBLR). The performance of microsleep state detection and prediction was evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The detection performance measures were AUC(ROC) 0.96, AUC(PR) 0.52, and phi 0.47. As expected, prediction of microsleep states with a 0.25-s ahead prediction time resulted in slightly lower performances compared to the detection. Prediction performance measures were substantially higher than those achieved with log-power spectral features, i.e., AUC(ROC) 0.95 (cf. 0.90), AUC(PR) 0.50 (cf. 0.36), and phi 0.46 (cf. 0.34).

During MI, the mu rhythmical oscillation of cortical neurons is the event-related desynchronization (ERD) subserving the physiological basis of MI-based brain-computer interface. In our work, we investigated the specific brain network reconfiguration from rest idle to MI task states, and also probed the underlying relationship between the brain network reconfiguration and MI related ERD. Findings revealed that comparing to rest state, the MI showed the enhanced motor area related linkages and the deactivated activity of default mode network. In addition, the reconfigured network index was closely related to the ERDs, i.e., the higher the reconfigured network index was, the more obvious the ERDs were. These findings consistently implied that the reconfiguration from rest to task states underlaid the reallocation of related brain resources, and the efficient brain reconfiguration corresponded to a better MI performance, which provided the new insights into understanding the mechanism of MI as well as the potential biomarker to evaluate the rehabilitation quality for those patients with deficits of motor function.

Across two studies, individuals with depression and healthy controls read stimuli that varied in self-relevance while EEG data were recorded. We examined the late positive potential (LPP), an ERP component that captures the dynamic allocation of attention to motivationally salient stimuli. In Study 1, participants read single words in a passive-viewing task. Participants viewed negative, positive, or neutral words that were either normative or self-generated. Exploratory analyses indicated that participants with depression exhibited affective modulation of the LPP for self-generated stimuli only (both positive and negative) and not for normative stimuli; healthy controls exhibited similar affective modulation of the LPP for both self-relevant and normative stimuli. In Study 2, using a separate sample and a different task, stimuli were provided within the context of sentence stems referring to the self or other people. Participants with depression were more likely to endorse negative self-referent sentences and reject positive ones compared to healthy controls. Depressed participants also exhibited an increased LPP to negative stimuli compared to positive or neutral stimuli. Together, these two studies suggest that depression is characterized by relatively increased sensitivity to affective self-relevant stimuli, perhaps in the context of a broader reduction in emotional reactivity to stimuli that are not self-relevant. Thus, depression may be characterized by a more nuanced pattern based on the degree of stimulus self-relevance than either a global decrease or increase in reactivity to affective stimuli.

The most prominent model to explain this effect draws on an internal forward model generating predictions about action outcomes, efference copies, during action planning and initiation. Even though this finding has a long tradition in psychology and neuroscience, several studies have highlighted methodological limitations which open the door for alternative explanations of sensory attenuation effects, most notably in terms of temporal prediction. Here we present an experimental design which carefully controls for this confounding factor. Crucially, we observed the auditory N1 component of the event-related potential to be attenuated for self-generated tones as compared to externally generated tones even when a predictive cue (a bar that is continuously filling up) allows for identical temporal predictability of both events. These findings suggest that voluntary actions do indeed involve a unique, predictive component, affecting the perceptual processing of ensuing events.

Enhanced response inhibition and reduced midfrontal theta activity in experienced Vipassana meditators	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							GO/NO-GO TASK; DISPOSITIONAL MINDFULNESS; EMOTION REGULATION; NEURAL RESPONSES; POSITIVE AFFECT; TIME-COURSE; CONFLICT; MOTOR; PERFORMANCE; ATTENTION	Response inhibition - the ability to suppress inappropriate thoughts and actions - is a fundamental aspect of cognitive control. Recent research suggests that mental training by meditation may improve cognitive control. Yet, it is still unclear if and how, at the neural level, long-term meditation practice may affect (emotional) response inhibition. The present study aimed to address this outstanding question, and used an emotional Go/Nogo task and electroencephalography (EEG) to examine possible differences in behavioral and electrophysiological indices of response inhibition between Vipassana meditators and an experience-matched active control group (athletes). Behaviorally, meditators made significantly less errors than controls on the emotional Go/Nogo task, independent of the emotional context, while being equally fast. This improvement in response inhibition at the behavioral level was accompanied by a decrease in midfrontal theta activity in Nogo vs. Go trials in the meditators compared to controls. Yet, no changes in ERP indices of response inhibition, as indexed by the amplitude of the N2 and P3 components, were observed. Finally, the meditators subjectively evaluated the emotional pictures lower in valence and arousal. Collectively, these results suggest that meditation may improve response inhibition and control over emotional reactivity.

ERPs predict symptomatic distress and recovery in sub-acute mild traumatic brain injury	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						TBI; Executive; Post-concussive; P3a; P3b; EEG	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SPORT-RELATED CONCUSSION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; QUANTITATIVE EEG; NEGATIVE AFFECT; HEAD-INJURY; P300; IDENTIFICATION; ATTENTION	Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) can affect high-level executive functioning long after somatic symptoms resolve. We tested if simple EEG responses within an oddball paradigm could capture variance relevant to this clinical problem. The P3a and P3b components reflect bottom-up and top-down processes driving engagement with exogenous stimuli. Since these features are related to primitive decision abilities, abnormal amplitudes following mTBI may account for problems in the ability to exert executive control. Sub-acute (<2 weeks) mTBI participants (N = 38) and healthy controls (N = 24) were assessed at an initial session as well as a two-month follow-up (sessions 1 and 2). We contrasted the initial assessment to a comparison group of participants with chronic symptomatology following brain injury (N = 23). There were no group differences in P3a or P3b amplitudes. Yet in the sub-acute mTBI group, higher symptomatology on the Frontal Systems Behavior scale (FrSBe), a questionnaire validated as measuring symptomatic distress related to frontal lobe injury, correlated with lower P3a in session 1. This relationship was replicated in session 2. These findings were distinct from chronic TBI participants, who instead expressed a relationship between increased FrSBe symptoms and a lower P3b component. In the sub-acute group, P3b amplitudes in the first session correlated with the degree of symptom change between sessions 1 and 2, above and beyond demographic predictors. Controls did not show any relationship between FrSBe symptoms and P3a or P3b.

Previous studies revealed that children use cognitive reappraisal to downregulate negative emotions. Moreover, the amplitude of late positive potential (LPP) shows a more obvious reduction following neutral interpretations than following negative interpretations. However, whether children can use cognitive reappraisal to regulate positive emotions remains unclear. In the present study, 46 8- to 12-year-old children were asked to reappraise the meaning of pleasant pictures. Electroencephalography (EEG) data were collected during the task. As predicted, LPP amplitudes increased more following reappraisal condition than following pleasant condition. The analysis of spatial-temporal shifting patterns showed that the effect occurred in the earlier window for the posterior region. As time progressed, this effect evidenced a trend from posterior region to the central and anterior regions, especially for the younger children. Furthermore, the greater brain activations occurred in left hemisphere when children upregulated positive emotions which partially supported previous research suggesting that increasing positive emotion engaged primarily left -lateralized prefrontal regions. Taken together, the findings suggest that children can use cognitive reappraisal to upregulate positive emotions.

This paper proposed a brain switch based on code-modulated visual-evoked potential (c-VEP), in which seven 8-bit pseudorandom codes were used to modulate the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. This study optimized and demonstrated the control strategy through an offline and an online experiments. By decoding the brain state continuously with the task-related component analysis (TRCA) algorithm, the brain switch achieved an average reaction time (RT) of 1.72 seconds and an average idle time of 183.53 seconds without false positive events in the online experiment.

However, it is largely unknown whether there are any differences in the nonlinear features of EEGs between guilty and innocent subjects. In this study, we proposed a complexity-based method to distinguish lying from truth telling. A total of 35 participants were randomly divided into two groups, and their EEG signals were recorded with 14 electrodes. Averages for sequential sets of five trials were first calculated for the probe responses within each subject. Next, a common wavelet entropy (WE) measure and an improved one were used to quantify complexity from each five-trial average. The results show that for both measures, the WE values in the guilty subjects are statistically lower than those in the innocent subjects for most of the 14 electrodes. More importantly, using the improved measure, the difference in WE between the two groups of subjects significantly increases for 11 brain regions compared with the values from the common measure. Finally, the highest balanced classification accuracy, 89.64%, is achieved when using the combined WE feature vector in five brain regions from the sites of Pz, P3, C4, Cz, and C3. Our findings indicate that the lying task elicits a more ordered brain activity in some specific brain regions than the task of telling the truth. This study not only demonstrates that improved WE measurements could be a powerful quantitative index for detecting lying but also sheds light on the brain mechanisms underlying deceptive behaviors.

Neurobiological effects of transcranial direct current stimulation in younger adults, older adults and mild cognitive impairment	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Aging; Transcranial direct current stimulation; Transcranial magnetic stimulation-electroencephalography; Cognition; Neurobiology	DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NONINVASIVE BRAIN-STIMULATION; WORKING-MEMORY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MAGNETIC STIMULATION; AGING BRAIN; HEALTHY; TDCS; MOTOR; STATE	Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been investigated as a way to improve motor and cognitive functioning, with largely variable results. Currently, relatively little is known about the neurobiological effects, and possible drivers of variability, in either healthy or clinical populations. Therefore, this study aimed to characterise the neurobiological effects to tDCS in younger adults, older adults and adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and their relationship to cognitive performance. 20 healthy younger adults, 20 healthy older adults and 9 individuals with MCI participated in the study. All completed neuropsychological tasks and TMS-EEG, prior to and following delivery of 20 min of anodal tDCS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). EEG was also recorded during the 2-Back working memory task. Following tDCS, younger adults demonstrated alterations in early TMS-Evoked Potentials (TEPs), namely P30 and P60. Both younger and older adults exhibited a larger task-related N250 amplitude after stimulation, with contrasting relationships to cognitive performance. The MCI group showed no change in TEPs or ERPs over time. Comparisons between the groups revealed differences in the change in amplitude of early TEP (P60) and ERP (N100) peaks between younger and older adults. Our findings indicate that tDCS was able to modulate cortical activity in younger and older healthy adults, but in varying ways. These findings suggest that varied response to tDCS may be related to factors such as age and the presence/absence of cognitive impairment, and these factors should be considered when assessing the effectiveness of tDCS in healthy and pathological aging.

Associated with alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha 7 nAChR) dysfunction and shown to be improved with nicotine and alpha 7 nAChR agonists, SG has recently been shown to be improved in low P50 suppressing SCZ patients following acute CDP-choline treatment. Aims: This pilot study in healthy humans assessed the SG effects of an alpha 7 nAChR strategy combining CDP-choline with galantamine, a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of nAChRs, aimed at increasing and prolonging nicotinic receptor activity. Methods: The combined effect of CDP-choline (500 mg) and galantamine (16 mg) on speech P50 gating indices rP50 (S-2/S-1) and dP50 (S-1-S-2) was examined in 30 healthy participants stratified into low and high baseline P50 suppressors in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and counterbalanced design. Results: In low suppressors, CDP-choline/galantamine (vs. placebo) improved rP50 and dP50 gating, and reduced S(2)P50 amplitudes. No P50 gating effects were observed in high suppressors; however, CDP-choline/galantamine (vs. placebo) increased their S(2)P50 amplitudes. Conclusion: Findings from this pilot study with CDP-choline/galantamine in a healthy, SCZ-like surrogate deficient gating sample are consistent with the association of alpha 7 nAChR mechanisms in SG impairment in SCZ and support further research trials with CDP-choline and galantamine targeting sensory processes.

We investigated the neural per-time point spatial similarity patterns of the scalp electrophysiological (EEG) activity of 30 human participants (male and female) watching a 50 min movie and found that event boundaries triggered the rapid reinstatement of the just-encoded movie event EEG patterns. We also found that the onset of memory reinstatement at boundary onset was accompanied by a left-lateralized anterior negative ERP effect, which likely reflects the detection of a shift in the narrative structure of the movie. A data-driven approach based on Hidden Markov modeling allowed us to detect event boundaries as shifts between stable patterns of brain EEG activity during encoding, and to identify their reactivation during a free recall task. These results provide the first neurophysiological underpinnings for how the memory systems segment a continuous long stream of experience into episodic events.

When neutral is not neutral: Neurophysiological evidence for reduced discrimination between aversive and non-aversive information in generalized anxiety disorder	MOTIVATION AND EMOTION			English	Article						Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD); Event-related potentials (ERPs); Emotion; Anxiety	ANTERIOR CINGULATE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; ERROR-DETECTION; ELECTROCORTICAL RESPONSES; EMOTION DYSREGULATION; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FACE PERCEPTION; NEURAL BASIS; HAPPY FACES	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by a range of cognitive and affective disruptions, such as pathological worry. There is debate, however, about whether such disruptions are specifically linked to heightened responses to aversive stimuli, or due to overgeneralized threat monitoring leading to deficits in the ability to discriminate between aversive and non-aversive affective information. The present study capitalized on the temporal and functional specificity of scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine this question by exploring two targeted neurocognitive responses in a group of adults diagnosed with GAD: (1) visual processing of angry (aversive) versus neutral (non-aversive) faces; and (2) response monitoring of incorrect (aversive) versus correct (non-aversive) responses. Electroencephalography was recorded while 15 adults with GAD and 15 age-matched controls viewed angry and neutral faces prior to individual trials of a flanker task. ERPs to faces were the P1, reflecting attention allocation, the early posterior negativity(EPN), reflecting early affective discrimination, and the N170, reflecting face-sensitive visual discrimination. The error-related negativity(ERN) and positivity (Pe) were generated to incorrect and correct responses. Results showed reduced discrimination between aversive and non-aversive faces and responses in the GAD relative to the control group during visual discrimination (N170) and later-emerging error monitoring (Pe).

However, it is unclear whether a neurophysiological index of emotional reactivity, the late positive potential (LPP), is aberrant in SAD or whether self-reported reappraisal or suppression relates to the LPP during on-line emotion reactivity and reappraisal. Participants with SAD (n = 51) and HC (n = 31) completed an Emotion Regulation Task. Emotion reactivity and regulation were measured via LPP when viewing negative images ('look Negative') and when using a cognitive strategy to reduce negative affect ('Reappraise Negative'). Participants also completed a self-report measure of habitual reappraisal and suppression. SAD participants displayed heightened LPP for 'Look Negative' compared to HC. However, LPP for online reappraisal was comparable between groups. Self-reported suppression predicted the LPP during 'Look Negative' in HC, and there was a trend-level relationship in SAD. LPP findings suggest targeted reappraisal approaches may benefit individuals with SAD.

J	Schindler, S; Vormbrock, R; Kissler, J				Schindler, Sebastian; Vormbrock, Ria; Kissler, Johanna			Emotion in Context: How Sender Predictability and Identity Affect Processing of Words as Imminent Personality Feedback	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						EEG/ERP; social context; anticipation; emotion; language; prediction; virtual communication	SELECTIVE VISUAL-ATTENTION; EARLY CORTICAL RESPONSES; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN DYNAMICS; TIME-COURSE; LANGUAGE; FACES; ANTICIPATION; RELEVANCE; VALENCE	Recent findings suggest that communicative context affects the timing and magnitude of emotion effects in word processing. In particular, social attributions seem to be one important source of plasticity for the processing of effectively charged language. Here, we investigate the timing and magnitude of ERP responses toward positive, neutral, and negative trait adjectives during the anticipation of putative socio-evaluative feedback from different senders (human and computer) varying in predictability. In the first experiment, during word presentation participants could not anticipate whether a human or a randomly acting computer sender was about to give feedback. Here, a main effect of emotion was observed only on the late positive potential (LPP), showing larger amplitudes for positive compared to neutral adjectives. In the second study the same stimuli and set-up were used, but a block-wise presentation was realized, resulting in fixed and fully predictable sender identity. Feedback was supposedly given by an expert (psychotherapist), a layperson (unknown human), and again by a randomly acting computer. Main effects of emotion started with an increased P1 for negative adjectives, followed by effects at the N1 and early posterior negativity (EPN), showing both largest amplitudes for positive words, as well as for the LPP, where positive and negative words elicited larger amplitudes than neutral words. An interaction revealed that emotional LPP modulations occurred only for a human sender. Finally, regardless of content, anticipating human feedback led to larger P1 and P3 components, being highest for the putative expert. These findings demonstrate the malleability of emotional language processing by social contexts. When clear predictions can be made, our brains rapidly differentiate between emotional and neutral information, as well as between different senders. Attributed human presence affects emotional language processing already during feedback anticipation, in line with a selective gating of attentional resources via anticipatory social significance attributions. By contrast, emotion effects occur much later, when crucial social context information is still missing. These findings demonstrate the context-dependence of emotion effects in word processing and are particularly relevant since virtual communication with unknown senders, whose identity is inferred rather than perceived, has become reality for millions of people.

J	Adelhofer, N; Chmielewski, WX; Beste, C				Adelhoefer, Nico; Chmielewski, Witold X.; Beste, Christian			How perceptual ambiguity affects response inhibition processes	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; perception; prefrontal cortex; response inhibition; source localization	ITERATION DECOMPOSITION RIDE; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LATENCY VARIABILITY; DECISION-MAKING; FRONTAL-CORTEX; CODING TEC; STIMULUS; EEG; INFORMATION; INTEGRATION	The ability to inhibit responses is a central requirement for goal-directed behavior but has been dominated by a top-down or cognitive control view. Only recently. the role of bottom-up perceptual factors were focused in research. However, studies usually use clearly distinguishable stimulus categories to trigger response execution or inhibition. In the current study, we present a novel Gabor patch Go/No-go task to induce perceptual ambiguity during response inhibition. To examine the neurophysiological processes in detail, we use EEG recordings and combined temporal EEG signal decomposition methods with source localization analyses. We show that perceptual similarity between Go and No-go trials compromises response inhibition performance. Interestingly, the EEG data show that this is due to a modulation of stimulus-response transition or decision processes, and not purely stimulus-related processes. This was possible by applying a temporal EEG decomposition method. We provide evidence that a prefrontal P2 (pP2) likely reflects decision processes on action execution using stimulus information. These processes were associated with superior and middle prefrontal regions (BA8). When these processes fail, occasions to execute a response become misinterpreted as occasions to inhibit a response. Successful and unsuccessful decisions to inhibit a response under high perceptual ambiguity seem to further depend on how well "what-decisions," supported by neural mechanisms in BA19, can be processed. However, these what-decisions seem to be closely linked to the specification of the required action. Stimulus processing is closely linked to response programming so that response control is already informed when uncertainty with regard to stimulus identity is detected. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study introduces a novel Go/No-go paradigm and shows what neurophysiological subprocesses and functional neuroanatomical are involved during inhibitory control when ambiguous stimulus input is provided. The results show that bottom-up perceptual processes are important to consider during top-down controlled response inhibition. Stimulus processing is closely linked to response programming so that response control is already informed when uncertainty with regard to stimulus identity is detected.

Algorithmic clustering based on string compression to extract P300 structure in EEG signals	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Normalized compression distance; Data mining; Brain computer interface; Similarity; Kolmogorov complexity; Clustering by compression; Dendrogram; Multidimensional projections; Silhouette coefficient	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BCI COMPETITION 2003; VARIABILITY; VALIDATION; ATTENTION; DISTANCE; CORTEX; STATE; WAVE	Background and objectives: P300 is an Event Related Potential control signal widely used in Brain Computer Interfaces. Using the oddball paradigm, a P300 speller allows a human to spell letters through P300 events produced by his/her brain. One of the most common issues in the detection of this event is that its structure may differ between different subjects and over time for a specific subject. The main purpose of this work is to deal with this inherent variability and identify the main structure of P300 using algorithmic clustering based on string compression. Methods: In this work, we make use of the Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) to extract the main structure of the signal regardless of its inherent variability. In order to apply compression distances, we carry out a novel signal-to-ASCII process that transforms and merges different events into suitable objects to be used by a compression algorithm. Once the ASCII objects are created, we use NCD-driven clustering as a tool to analyze if our object creation method suitably represents the information contained in the signals and to explore if compression distances are a valid tool for identifying P300 structure. With the purpose of increasing the level of generalization of our study, we apply two different clustering methods: a hierarchical clustering algorithm based on the minimum quartet tree method and a multidimensional projection method. Results: Our experimental results show good clustering performance over different experiments, showing the structure extraction capabilities of our procedure. Two datasets with recordings in different scenarios were used to analyze the problem and validate our results, respectively. It has to be pointed out that when the clustering performance over individual electrodes is analyzed, higher P300 activity is found in similar regions to other articles using the same datasets. This suggests that our approach might be used as an electrode-selection criteria. Conclusions: The proposed NCD-driven clustering methodology can be used to discover the structural characteristics of EEG and thereby, it is suitable as a complementary methodology for the P300 analysis.

The nature of this phenomenon is not understood: some theories attribute it to low-level visual operations (i.e., parafoveal feature detectors influencing foveal letter detectors), whereas other theories assume that orthographic processing (i.e., letter position coding and word activation) occurs across multiple words in parallel. To arbitrate between these theories, we used electroencephalography to reveal the time course of orthographic spatial integration in a lexical decision task. Foveal target words were flanked on each side by parafoveal words, manipulated across three conditions: repetition flankers (e.g. rock rock rock), unrelated flankers (step rock step) and a no-flanker condition. Linear mixed-effect models were constructed to analyze EEG data on a trial-by-trial basis. Word recognition was worse in the unrelated flanker condition than in the repetition and no-flanker conditions. This behavioral pattern was accompanied by increased negativity in the N250 and N400 windows, associated with the activation of sub-lexical and lexico-semantic representations, respectively. Crucially, the absence of effects prior to 200 ms post-stimulus onset provides evidence against the involvement of low-level visual processes. We conclude that orthographic spatial integration is driven by parallel processing of multiple words, which leads to the activation of a larger set of sub-lexical nodes and more difficult processing at the lexical level when those words are orthographically unrelated.

EEG Can Be Used to Measure Embodiment When Controlling a Walking Self-Avatar	2019 26TH IEEE CONFERENCE ON VIRTUAL REALITY AND 3D USER INTERFACES (VR)			English	Proceedings Paper	26th IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (VR)	MAR 23-27, 2019	Osaka, JAPAN	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE Comp Soc Visualizat & Graph Tech Comm		Virtual reality; mu-rhythm EEG; event-related-potentials; gait rehabilitation; mirror neuron system	VIRTUAL-REALITY; CHRONIC STROKE; MOVEMENT; SENSE; BCI; REHABILITATION; IMITATION; AWARENESS; SYSTEM; AGENCY	It has recently been shown that inducing the ownership illusion and then manipulating the movements of one's self-avatar can lead to compensatory motor control strategies in gait rehabilitation. In order to maximize this effect, there is a need for a method that measures, and monitors embodiment levels of participants immersed in VR to induce and maintain a strong ownership illusion. The objective of this study was to propose a novel approach to measuring embodiment by presenting visual feedback that conflicts with motor control to embodied subjects. Twenty healthy participants were recruited. During experimentations, participants wore an EEG cap and motion capture markers, with an avatar displayed in a HMD from a first-person perspective. They were cued to either perform, watch or imagine a single step forward or to initiate walking on the treadmill. For some of the trials, the avatar took a step with the contralateral limb or stopped walking before the participant stopped (modified feedback). Results show that subjective levels of embodiment correlate strongly with the difference in mu-ERS power over the motor and pre-motor cortex between the modified and non-modified feedback trials.

Obtaining high-quality, reliable VEPs is crucial for the early detection of abnormal development of the central nervous system in at-risk newborns, and for implementing successful early interventions. Recommendations are based on a previous study which showed that when post-conceptional age, polysomnography-identified sleep stages, and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) googles as the luminous source are controlled, no more than 4 repetitions of VEP averages are required to obtain replicable recordings, variability decreases, and reliable VEPs can be obtained. By controlling for these sources of variability and using statistical analyses, we were able to clearly and reliably identify the amplitude and latency of three main components (NII, PII and NIII) present in 100% of newborns (n = 20) during active sleep. Recording VEPs during awake states, quiet sleep and transitional sleep is not recommended because VEP morphology may differ significantly from one average to the next, leading to the risk of misleading clinical prognoses. Moreover, it is easier to obtain VEPs during active sleep because this state can be clearly and reliably identified at this stage of development, sleep cycles are short enough to allow measurements to be taken in a reasonable time, and the method does not require new o expensive equipment.

Considering the overlapping neural circuits between self-pain and other-pain perceptions, the present study investigated how the predictability of forthcoming pain modulates the anticipation and perception of self-pain and other-pain. We used a balanced, within-participant experimental design in which a visual cue indicating the recipient, intensity and predictability of an upcoming painful electrical stimulation was presented before its delivery. Subjective ratings and electroencephalography activities to the anticipation and perception of self-pain and other-pain were recorded and compared between certain and uncertain conditions. Results showed that predictability affected the perception of self-pain and other-pain in a similar manner such that the differences in behavioral ratings and event-related potentials to high-intensity and low-intensity pain were significantly reduced when the intensity was uncertain. The strengths of predictability-induced modulation of self-pain and other-pain perceptions were positively correlated with each other. Furthermore, predictability also modulated the anticipation of both self-pain and other-pain such that pre-stimulus high-frequency a-oscillation power at sensorimotor electrodes contralateral to the stimulation side was maximally suppressed when anticipating certain high-intensity pain. These findings demonstrate that predictability-induced modulation on pain anticipation and perception was similarly applied to both self-pain and other-pain.

Faster gait speeds suppress human auditory electrocortical responses	2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN AND CYBERNETICS (SMC)	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics (SMC)	OCT 06-09, 2019	Bari, ITALY	IEEE			ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; COROLLARY DISCHARGE; SCALP TOPOGRAPHY; EEG; MODULATION; DYNAMICS; PHASE; CONTRIBUTES; POTENTIALS; GENERATION	To study the effects of gait speed on human auditory electrocortical processing, we recruited healthy subjects to walk at a range of speeds while identifying contrasting auditory tones. We used an auditory go/no-go task to detect electrocortical responses while recording high density mobile EEG from subjects who were asked to press or not press a handheld button in response to target sounds. To overcome limitations associated with EEG motion artifact contamination at fast gait speeds, we used mobile dual layer EEG hardware and signal processing methods for artifact removal. Dual layer EEG processing allowed us to identify the involvement of sensory, motor, and cognitive cortical processing centers during the task. Activity from left auditory cortex and anterior cingulate cortex showed spectral power synchronizations in delta, theta, and alpha bands immediately following the auditory tone and this activity peaked approximately 160ms later. Left auditory cortex spectral power desynchronizations in alpha and beta bands occurred within approximately 300ms of the tone and lasted for nearly 350ms. At faster gait speeds, auditory electrocortical responses showed limited spectral power fluctuations and reduced ERP component amplitudes, possibly due to motor-related cortical suppression and selective auditory processing with increased sensory feedback.

One of the most productive areas of interdisciplinary research in this area has been the implementation of biologically-inspired mechanisms in the development of autonomous systems. Specifically, enabling such systems to display adaptive behavior such as learning from good and bad outcomes, has been achieved by quantifying and understanding the neural mechanisms of the brain networks mediating adaptive behaviors in humans and animals. For example, associative learning from aversive or dangerous outcomes is crucial for an autonomous system, to avoid dangerous situations in the future. A body of neuroscience research has suggested that the neurocomputations in the human brain during associative learning involve re-shaping of sensory responses. The nature of these adaptive changes in sensory processing during learning however are not yet well enough understood to be readily implemented into on-board algorithms for robotics application. Toward this overall goal, we record the simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), characterizing one candidate mechanism, i.e., large-scale brain oscillations. The present report examines the use of Functional Source Separation (FSS) as an optimization step in EEG-fMRI fusion that harnesses timing information to constrain the solutions that satisfy physiological assumptions. We applied this approach to the voxel-wise correlation of steady-state visual evoked potential (ssVEP) amplitude and blood oxygen level-dependent imaging (BOLD), across both time series. The results showed the benefit of FSS for the extraction of robust ssVEP signals during simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings. Applied to data from a 3-phase aversive conditioning paradigm, the correlation maps across the three phases (habituation, acquisition, extinction) show converging results, notably major overlapping areas in both primary and extended visual cortical regions, including calcarine sulcus, lingual cortex, and cuneus. In addition, during the acquisition phase when aversive learning occurs, we observed additional correlations between ssVEP and BOLD in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as well as the precuneus and superior temporal gyrus.

This study aimed to assess the possible effect of mobile phone radiation in persons with epilepsy and in normal subjects. Methods: The amplitude and reaction time of auditory event related potentials (P300) and occipital alpha frequency were compared before and after exposure with a 30-minute call in 30 persons with epilepsy and in 30 control subjects. Alpha power was monitored before, during, and after exposure to mobile phone radiation. Moreover, correlations with clinical aspects were analyzed. Results: Increased reaction time and decreased P300 amplitude were more evident in persons with epilepsy. A significant decrease in alpha power was noted in control subjects and persons with epilepsy and was associated with an increased bilateral alpha frequency. In persons with epilepsy, such changes significantly correlated with the time since the last seizure and with the therapy regimen. Conclusions: Thirty-minute exposure to mobile phone radiation has a significant effect on the electrophysiological correlates of cognition, especially in persons with epilepsy.

J	Yang, T; Kim, SP				Yang, Taeyang; Kim, Sung-Phil			Group-Level Neural Responses to Service-to-Service Brand Extension	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brand extension; event-related potential; P300; neuromarketing; EEG decoding	CATEGORIZATION; PRODUCT; CORTEX	Brand extension is a marketing strategy leveraging well-established brand to promote new offerings provided as goods or service. The previous neurophysiological studies on goods-to-goods brand extension have proposed that categorization and semantic memory processes are involved in brand extension evaluation. However, it is unknown whether these same processes also underlie service-to-service brand extension. The present study, therefore, aims to investigate neural processes in consumers underlying their judgment of service-to-service brand extension. Specifically, we investigated human electroencephalographic responses to extended services that were commonly considered to fit well or badly with parent brand among consumers. For this purpose, we proposed a new stimulus grouping method to find commonly acceptable or unacceptable service extensions. In the experiment, participants reported the acceptability of 56 brand extension pairs, consisting of parent brand name (S1) and extended service name (S2). From individual acceptability responses, we assigned each pair to one of the three fit levels: high- (i.e., highly acceptable), low-, and mid-fit. Next, we selected stimuli that received high/low-fit evaluations from a majority of participants (i.e., >85%) and assigned them to a high/low population-fit group. A comparison of event-related potentials (ERPs) between population-fit groups through a paired t-test showed significant differences in the fronto-central N2 and fronto-parietal P300 amplitudes. We further evaluated inter-subject variability of these ERP components by a decoding analysis that classified N2 and/or P300 amplitudes into a high, or low population-fit class using a support vector machine. Leave-one-subject-out validation revealed classification accuracy of 60.35% with N2 amplitudes, 78.95% with P300, and 73.68% with both, indicating a relatively high inter-subject variability of N2 but low for P300. This validation showed that fronto-parietal P300 reflected neural processes more consistent across subjects in service-to-service brand extension. We further observed that the left frontal P300 amplitude was increased as fit-level increased across stimuli, indicating a semantic retrieval process to evaluate a semantic link between S1 and S2. Parietal P300 showed a higher amplitude in the high population-fit group, reflecting a similarity-based categorization process. In sum, our results suggest that service-to-service brand extension evaluation may share similar neural processes with goods-to-goods brand extension.

Yet, most previous studies of the CPP focused exclusively on perceptual decisions with very simple stimuli. In this study, we examined how the dynamics of the CPP depended on the type of decision being made, and whether its slope was related to parameters of an accumulator model of decision making. We show initial evidence that memory- and perceptual decisions about carefully-controlled face stimuli exhibit similar dynamics, but offset by a time difference in decision onset. Importantly, the individual-trial slopes of the CPP are related to the accumulator model's drift parameter. These findings help to further understand the role of the CPP across different kinds of decisions.

The neural correlates of the taste-expectancy relationship were explored through EEG analysis. Using a trial-by-trial cueing paradigm, lingual delivery of 0.05 M or 0.3 M sucrose solutions was preceded by congruent or incongruent visual cues designed to promote anticipation of either a low-sweet or high-sweet solution. When participants were cued to expect low-sweet, but received high-sweet (incongruent cue), intensity ratings for high-sweet decreased. Likewise, expectation of high-sweet increased intensity ratings of low-sweet solutions. Taste-dependent, right central-parietal gustatory ERPs were detected, with greater P1 (associated with greater right insula activation) and P2 peak amplitudes for high-sweet tastes. Valid cue-taste pairings led to specific reduced right-lateralized N400 responses (associated with an attenuation in right insula activation) compared with invalid cue-taste pairings. Finally, P1 amplitudes following invalidly cued low-sweet tastes closely matched those generated by expected high-sweet tastes, and P1 amplitudes for invalidly cued high-sweet tastes resembled those generated by low-sweet tastes. We conclude that, as well as modifying subjective ratings toward the anticipated intensity level, expectations affect cortical activity in a top-down manner to induce bidirectional assimilation in the early perceptual processing of sweet taste and modulate N400 ERP components not previously associated with gustatory stimulation.

However, the resting state paradigm allows an unconstrained fluctuation of brain arousal, which may have profound effects on resting-state fMRI signals and associated connectivity/dynamic metrics. Here, we review current understandings of the relationship between resting-state fMRI and brain arousal, in particular the effect of a recently discovered event of arousal modulation on resting-state fMRI. We further discuss potential implications of arousal-related fMRI modulation with a focus on its potential role in mediating spurious correlations between resting-state connectivity/dynamics with physiology and behavior. Multiple hypotheses are formulated based on existing evidence and remain to be tested by future studies.

However, previous research has failed to identify neural correlates of this striking behavioral difference. Here, we found a clear difference in brain potentials elicited by highly familiar faces versus unfamiliar faces. This effect starts 200 ms after stimulus onset and reaches its maximum at 400 to 600 ms. This sustained-familiarity effect was substantially larger than previous candidates for a neural familiarity marker and was detected in almost all participants, representing a reliable index of high familiarity. Whereas its scalp distribution was consistent with a generator in the ventral visual pathway, its modulation by repetition and degree of familiarity suggests an integration of affective and visual information.

Though previous literature has provided valuable insights about the retrieval practice effect, it is still unclear how emotion arousal influences the retrieval practice effect, and whether the effect would be manifested in recollection or familiarity processes. To answer these questions, in the current study, negative and neutral words were used as stimuli and participants were asked to perform a recognition test or restudy the words after initial study. At the end of the experiment, a final recognition test with involving the remember-know paradigm was shown. Behavioral data were collected with EEG recorded throughout the experiment. The behavioral retrieval practice effect was only found for the neutral but not the negative words. Consistently, significant ERP differences between the restudy and retrieval practice conditions were only found for neutral, but not negative items, which was a component from 700 to 900 ms at left-posterior electrode cluster. Moreover, we found that the effects of emotion arousal on the retrieval practice effect were mainly reflected in the recollection process. These findings provide behavioral and neural evidence that emotion arousal can influence the retrieval practice effect.

However, while a number of studies show that brief bouts of acute exercise can modulate behavioral indices of cognitive control, relatively few studies have attempted to identify the brain activity associated with these changes immediately following exercise. Here, we tested 11 young adults in a crossover design with a Flanker task at rest and immediately (within 2-3 min) following 20 min of acute exercise at 60% of the individual VO(2)max. In order to prevent delayed exercise effects that might confound or dilute immediate effects, a short version of the Flanker task (8 min) was chosen and an EEG was recorded simultaneously. The N2 and P3 ERP components were analyzed in addition to accuracy and response time. The N2 reflects conflict resolution, and the P3 has been linked to stimulus evaluation processes. No effect of exercise was found for behavioral data but P3 peak latencies were shorter following exercise as compared to rest. The N2 amplitude data suggest that exercise seems to prevent a decline in resources of attentional control over time. These data indicate that acute exercise, at a moderate intensity level, speeds up neural processing of attentional control by modulating stimulus evaluation processes immediately following exercise and that exercise helps maintain a steady level of neurocognitive resources.

The brain gives an insight into the various processes underlying our behavior and responses. If an individual is hiding information in the brain, this information can be detected using brain signals. In the present work, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of the subjects are analyzed to detect hidden information in the individuals. After preprocessing the data, wavelet features are extracted. Initially, classification algorithm based on support vector machine (SVM) has been used to identify the subjects hiding the information. Afterwards, k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm has been used to distinguish between the guilty and innocent participants. SVM performs better than kNN and achieves a significant classification accuracy of 80% in identification of the concealed information.

In an auditory target-detection paradigm using EEG, Jongsma and colleagues (2006) showed that the neural response to these implicit regularities results in a reduction of the P-3-N-2 complex. Here, we utilized the same paradigm, this time in both young and old participants, to determine if this EEG signature of implicit learning was altered with age. Behaviorally, both groups of participants showed similar benefits for the presence of temporal regularity, with faster and more accurate responses given when the auditory targets were presented in a temporally regular vs. random pattern. In the brain, the younger adults showed the expected decrease in amplitude of this complex for regular compared to irregular trials. Older adults, in contrast, showed no difference in the amplitude of the P-3-N-2 complex between the irregular and regular condition. These data suggest that, although auditory implicit learning may be behaviorally spared in aging, older adults are not using the same neural substrates as younger adults to achieve this.

According to recent theoretical views, the sensory processing of visceral signals such as one's own heartbeat is determined by top-down predictions about the expected interoceptive state of the body (interoceptive inference). In this EEG study we examined neural responses to heartbeats following expected and unexpected emotional stimuli. We used a modified stimulus repetition task in which pairs of facial expressions were presented with repeating or alternating emotional content, and we manipulated the emotional valence and the likelihood of stimulus repetition. We found that affective predictions of external socially relevant information modulated the heartbeat-evoked potential, a marker of cardiac interoception. Crucially, the HEP changes highly relied on the expected emotional content of the facial expression. Thus, expected negative faces led to a decreased HEP amplitude, whereas such an effect was not observed after an expected neutral face. These results suggest that valence-specific affective predictions, and their uniquely associated predicted bodily sensory state, can reduce or amplify cardiac interoceptive responses. In addition, the affective repetition effects were dependent on repetition probability, highlighting the influence of top-down exteroceptive predictions on interoception. Our results are in line with recent models of interoception supporting the idea that predicted bodily states influence sensory processing of salient external information.

In this study, two different techniques -detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and discrete wavelet packet transform- are combined (DWPT-DFA) for feature extraction. Both approaches are known as self-similarity quantifier techniques. In wavelet technique, mother wavelets play an important role. Herein, A customized mother wavelet utilizing event related desynchronization (ERD) potential patterns are extracted and updated automatically for individual subjects. Also, three predefined mother wavelets are used, and the results are compared with the customized mother wavelet. The predefined mother wavelets are db4, db8 and coiflet 4. The soft margin support vector machine with the generalized radial basis function (SSVM-GRBF) is employed to classify the DWPT-DFA features. For the efficiency of the method, nine subjects have participated to record EEG based on the imaginary hand movements. The ERDs and features are extracted from FC1 and CP6 channels. Results show that the combination of the DWPT and DFA with the personalize ERD mother wavelet gives the best accuracy of 85.33% with p <0.001. Based on the results, we conclude that the DWPT-DFA method using the ERD mother wavelets improves significantly the efficiency of the SSVM-GRBF classifier.

CR-19-0950: Event-related responses to alcohol-related stimuli in Mexican-American young adults: Relation to age, gender, comorbidity and "dark side" symptoms	DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE			English	Article						Mexican American; Event-related oscillations; Alcohol-related stimuli; Comorbidity	TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; VOLTAGE ALPHA EEG; USE DISORDERS; HIGH-RISK; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; ACCULTURATION STRESS; POTENTIAL RESPONSES; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; ANXIETY DISORDERS; SELECT POPULATION	Background: Electrophysiological variables may represent sensitive biomarkers of vulnerability to or endophenotypes for alcohol use disorders (AUD). Methods: Young adults (age 18-30 yrs, n = 580) of Mexican American heritage were assessed with the Semi Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism and event-related oscillations (EROS) generated in response to a task that used pictures of objects, food, and alcohol-related and non-alcohol-related drinks as stimuli. Results: Decreases in energy in the alpha and beta frequencies and higher phase synchrony within cortical brain areas were seen in response to the alcohol-related as compared to the non-alcohol-related stimuli. Differences in ERO energy and synchrony responses to alcohol-related stimuli were also found as a function of age, sex, AUD status and comorbidity. Age-related decreases in energy and increases in synchrony were found. Females had significantly higher energy and lower synchrony values than males. Participants with AUD had higher synchrony values specifically in the beta frequencies, whereas those with a lifetime diagnosis of conduct disorder and/or antisocial personality disorder had lower alpha power and synchrony, and those with any affective disorder had lower ERO energy in the beta frequencies. Those with substance-associated affective "dark-side" symptoms had slower reaction times to the task, lower energy in the beta frequencies, lower local synchrony in the theta frequencies, and higher long-range synchrony in the delta and beta frequencies. Conclusions: These findings suggest that EROs recorded to alcohol-related stimuli may be biomarkers of co-morbid risk factors, symptoms and disorders associated with AUD that also can differentiate those with "dark side symptoms".

Target items were presented in two types of nonword contexts to examine the effects of stimulus list composition and language background. We found similar negative brain responses for regularly and irregularly inflected words, and for productively and non-productively derived words, in the 200-350 ms time window for both participant groups. In the 350-500 ms time window, most negative brain responses were observed for the irregularly inflected verbs. We suggest that the negativities found in the 200-350 ms time window reflect early, form-based processing of complex words. In the 350-500 ms time window, this processing is affected by a discrepancy between orthography and morphology. Different results for the Dutch and Turkish Dutch speakers in the nonword contexts show that, due to their language background, decomposition is more automatized in Turkish-Dutch speakers. Their processing strategy is thus less affected by the manipulation of stimulus list composition. In contrast, decomposition in our Dutch speakers is less automatized and thus more sensitive to the structure of nonwords.

Thus, the ERN is a promising candidate as a psychiatric biomarker. Basic methodological requirements for a biomarker are that their measurements are standardised and reliable. The aim of the present study was to establish ERN acquisition in a reliable, time-efficient and patient-friendly way for use in clinical practice. Methods Healthy subjects performed a speeded Eriksen Flanker Task that increases the number of errors. In a test-retest design (N = 14) with two sessions separated by 28 days we assessed the reliability of the ERN. To ensure external validity, we aimed to replicate previously reported correlation patterns of ERN amplitude with (A) number of errors and (B) negative affect. In order to optimise the clinical use of the task, we determined to which extent the task can be shortened while keeping reliability >0.80. Results We found excellent reliability of the ERN (intraclass correlation coefficients = 0.806-0.947) and replicated ERN correlation patterns. The task can be halved to a patient-friendly length of 200 trials (recorded in 8 min) keeping reliability >0.80. Conclusions The modified task provides reliable and efficient recording of the ERN, facilitating its use as a psychiatric biomarker.

No Evidence that Predictions and Attention Modulate the First Feedforward Sweep of Cortical Information Processing	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						prediction; spatial attention; human electrophysiology; first feedforward; sweep	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; SPATIAL ATTENTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; C1 MODULATION; STRIATE; OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVATION; RESPONSES; SIGNAL	Predictive coding models propose that predictions (stimulus likelihood) reduce sensory signals as early as primary visual cortex (V1), and that attention (stimulus relevance) can modulate these effects. Indeed, both prediction and attention have been shown to modulate V1 activity, albeit with fMRI, which has low temporal resolution. This leaves it unclear whether these effects reflect a modulation of the first feedforward sweep of visual information processing and/or later, feedback-related activity. In two experiments, we used electroencephalography and orthogonally manipulated spatial predictions and attention to address this issue. Although clear top-down biases were found, as reflected in pre-stimulus alpha-band activity, we found no evidence for top-down effects on the earliest visual cortical processing stage (< 80 ms post-stimulus), as indexed by the amplitude of the C1 event-related potential component and multivariate pattern analyses. These findings indicate that initial visual afferent activity may be impenetrable to top-down influences by spatial prediction and attention.

We tested four BCI paradigms: steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP), tactile, visual, and auditory evoked potentials (P300). The proposed criterion for assessing for the possibility of communication are based on the number of correct choices obtained in a given BCI paradigm after a short calibration session, without prior training. In this study users answered 20 simple "yes/no" questions. Fourteen or more correct answers rejected the null hypothesis of random choices at P=0.05. All of the 30 healthy volunteers were able to attain above-chance choices in at least one of the four paradigms. Additionally, we tested the system in clinical settings on a patient recovering from disorders of consciousness, achieving successful communication in 2 out of 3 paradigms. In light of these facts, after a review of the sparse literature, and in the interest of motivating further research, we propose a paraphrase of de Finetti's provocative statement: "BCI illiteracy does not exist".

This is true when elements of the same luminance are matched on either side of the axis (symmetry) and when they have opposite luminance polarity (anti-symmetry). Using electroencephalography, we measured the well-established sustained posterior negativity (SPN) response to symmetry and anti-symmetry. In one task, participants judged the presence or absence of regularity (Regularity Discrimination Task). In another, they judged the presence or absence of rare colored oddball trials (Colored Oddball Task). Previous work has concluded that anti-symmetry is only detected indirectly, through serial visual search of element locations. This selective attention account predicts that the anti-symmetry SPN should be abolished in the Colored Oddball Task because there is no need to search for anti-symmetry. However, this prediction was not confirmed: The symmetry and anti-symmetry SPN waves were not modulated by task. We conclude that at least some forms of anti-symmetry can be extracted from the image automatically, in much the same way as symmetry. This is an important consideration for models of symmetry perception, which must be flexible enough to accommodate opposite luminance polarity, while also accounting for the fact anti-symmetry is often perceptually weaker than symmetry.

However, the neurodynamics of hedonic and eudaimonic reward processing remain unclear. By operationalizing hedonic reward as "win money for oneself" and eudaimonic reward as "win money for charity", the current study used the monetary incentive delay task to parse hedonic and eudaimonic reward dynamics into the anticipatory and consummatory stages while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. 24 participants (12 women) were recruited in this study. The results showed that in the anticipatory stage, the amplitudes evoked by hedonic and eudaimonic reward did not differ during early cue recognition (P2, N2), but they separated during late cue elaboration (cue-P3). In the consummatory stage, hedonic reward elicited a larger FRN effect, but eudaimonic reward elicited a larger fb-P3 effect. In addition, we also used the neural indices of hedonic and eudaimonic reward processing to predict participants' longitudinal changes in well-being (depression and positive emotion) across 6 months as exploratory in nature. Preliminary regression evidence suggested that greater differential amplitude of cue-P3 elicited by eudaimonic reward anticipation versus neutral anticipation positively predicted longitudinal increases in positive emotion. The findings elucidated specific substages of hedonic and eudaimonic reward processing and explored their potential roles in longitudinal changes in well-being.

Yet, not much is known about the mechanisms and brain regions driving the size of subliminally induced conflicts. We hence combined a response conflict paradigm featuring subliminal primes and conscious flankers with in-depth neurophysiological (EEG) analyses, including source localization in a sample of N = 243 healthy subjects. Intra-individual differences in the size of subliminal conflicts were reflected both during early attentional stimulus processing (prime-associated N1 and target-associated P1 and N1 amplitudes) and conflict monitoring (N2 amplitudes). On the neuroanatomical level, this was reflected by activity modulations in the TPJ (BA39, BA40) and V2 (BA18), which are known to be involved in attentional stimulus processing and task set maintenance. In addition to a "standard" analysis of event-related potentials, we also conducted a purely data-driven machine learning approach using support vector machines (SVM) in order to identify neurophysiological features which do not only reflect the size of subliminal conflict, but actually allow to classify/predict it. This showed that only extremely early information processing (about 65 ms after the onset of the prime) was predictive of subliminal conflict size. Importantly, this predictive feature occurred before target information could even be processed and was reflected by activity in the left middle frontal gyrus (BA6) and insula (BA13). We conclude that differences in task set maintenance and potentially also in subliminal attentional processing of task-relevant features, but not conflict monitoring, determine the size of subliminally induced response conflicts.

J	Banon, JA; Martin, C				Banon, Jose Aleman; Martin, Clara			Anticipating information structure: An event-related potentials study of focus assignment via the it-cleft	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Prediction; Information structure; Cleft; Focus; Topic; N400; P600	LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; SYNTACTIC INTEGRATION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; N400 POTENTIALS; UPCOMING WORDS; PREDICTION; ERP; MEMORY; DISCOURSE; AGREEMENT	The present study uses event-related potentials to investigate the role of prediction in the processing of information structure, a domain of language that belongs to the level of the discourse. Twenty-three native speakers of English read short contexts including three Noun Phrases (NPs) (e.g., Either an adviser or an agent can be helpful to a banker), followed by a wh-question that established the discourse role of each referent (In your opinion, which of the two should a banker hire?). The NP that the question was about (banker) was the Topic, and the two NPs that could fill the slot opened by the wh-question (adviser, agent) were the Focus NPs. The participants' brain activity was recorded with EEG while they read the responses to the wh-questions, which differed along two dimensions: (1) the availability of the it-cleft construction (In my opinion, lit is] an agent...), a Focus-devoted device that makes Focus assignment predictable in the response; and (2) the discourse role of the target noun (Focus, Topic), which corresponds to the first referent in the response (In my opinion, lit is] an agent/a banker...). Crucially, we manipulated the phonological properties of the Focus and Topic nouns such that, if the Topic noun began with a consonant (e.g., a banker), both nouns that could fill the slot opened by the wh-question began with a vowel (e.g., an agent, an adviser) (counterbalanced in the overall design). This allowed us to measure effects of prediction at the prenominal article, before the integration of semantic and discourse information took place. The analyses on prenominal articles revealed an N400 effect for articles that were unexpected based on the phonological properties of the Focus nouns, but only in the conditions with the it-cleft. This effect emerged between 250 and 400 ms, with a frontal bias. The analyses on the noun revealed that violations of information structure (i.e., cases where the it-cleft was followed by the Topic noun) yielded a broadly distributed P600 effect, relative to appropriately clefted (i.e., focused) nouns. A similar (but numerically less robust) effect emerged for Topic relative to Focus NPs in the conditions without the it-cleft, suggesting that, in the absence of a constraining cue, comprehenders still assigned Focus to the first referent in the response. Overall, these results suggest that, when reading answers to wh-questions, comprehenders use information structure constraints (i.e., prior context + the it-cleft) to anticipate the form that the response should take (i.e., how information should be packaged).

Neural correlates of facial emotion processing in infancy	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						cortical source analysis; ERPs; infant facial emotion processing	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FEARFUL FACES; EXPRESSIONS; ATTENTION; RESPONSES; EYES; RECOGNITION; PERCEPTION; EMERGENCE; BRAIN	In the present study we examined the neural correlates of facial emotion processing in the first year of life using ERP measures and cortical source analysis. EEG data were collected cross-sectionally from 5- (N = 49), 7- (N = 50), and 12-month-old (N = 51) infants while they were viewing images of angry, fearful, and happy faces. The N290 component was found to be larger in amplitude in response to fearful and happy than angry faces in all posterior clusters and showed largest response to fear than the other two emotions only over the right occipital area. The P400 and Nc components were found to be larger in amplitude in response to angry than happy and fearful faces over central and frontal scalp. Cortical source analysis of the N290 component revealed greater cortical activation in the right fusiform face area in response to fearful faces. This effect started to emerge at 5 months and became well established at 7 months, but it disappeared at 12 months. The P400 and Nc components were primarily localized to the PCC/Precuneus where heightened responses to angry faces were observed. The current results suggest the detection of a fearful face in infants' brain can happen shortly (similar to 200-290 ms) after the stimulus onset, and this process may rely on the face network and develop substantially between 5 to 7 months of age. The current findings also suggest the differential processing of angry faces occurred later in the P400/Nc time window, which recruits the PCC/Precuneus and is associated with the allocation of infants' attention.

This paper presents EEC based analysis of hemispheric activation asymmetry within the beta band (15-28 Hz) when MVF is combined with a target-directed hand motor task in a block design versus a similar task without any target requirements. MVF coupled with target-directed movement was associated with a decrease in hemispheric asymmetry in both preparation and execution phases of movement. These results emphasize the potential importance of incorporating visuomotor goals into the task to maximize the rehabilitation outcomes of MVF-based training activities.

Besides the motor symptoms, tremor, and dysfunction of sensory systems. In the literature, there was limited studies which investigates the basic sensorial processing in PD. Therefore, we aimed to establish the sensorial processing of simple auditory stimulations in naive PD comparing to healthy controls (HC) via delta, theta, and alpha brain oscillatory responses. 12 naive PD and 12 HC participated to the study. Brain responses recorded via the 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) system in an electromagnetically and acoustically isolated room. The auditory stimuli (1500 Hz, 60 dB SPL, 500 ms) were delivered to the subjects via a head-phone. The inter-stimulus interval was ranged between 2.5-4.5 s. The peak-to-peak maximum amplitudes were measured in the delta, theta and alpha frequency bands on 11 electrodes (including the frontal, central and parietal areas) for the statistical analysis in which one-way ANOVA test was employed for the comparisons between PD and HC. For the delta oscillatory responses, PD group has bigger amplitudes in frontal, central and parietal areas in comparison with HC. For the theta and alpha oscillatory responses, PD group has bigger amplitudes in parietal areas in comparison with HC. As a result, amplitudes of brain oscillatory responses in PD group were significantly bigger than the HC. In this context, decreased inhibitory mechanisms of cortical auditory processing due to the dysfunction of the dopaminergic activity may lead the increased evoked responses in PD group.

Alpha modulation during working memory encoding predicts neurocognitive impairment in ADHD	JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						ADHD; working memory; maintenance; visual attention; academic achievement; alpha oscillations; EEG	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ADULT ADHD; DEFICITS; GUANFACINE; CHILDREN; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; OSCILLATIONS; ADOLESCENTS; STIMULANT	Background Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with working memory (WM) deficits. However, WM is a multiprocess construct that can be impaired through several pathways, leaving the source of WM impairments in ADHD unresolved. In this study, we aim to replicate, in an independent sample, previously reported deficits in component processes of WM deficits in ADHD and expand to consider their implications for neurocognitive outcomes. Methods In 119 children (7-14 years old, 85 with ADHD), we used electroencephalography measures to quantify component processes during performance of a spatial working memory task. We quantified stimulus encoding using alpha range (8-12 Hz) power; vigilance by the P2 event-related potential to cues; and WMmaintenance by occipital-alpha and frontal-theta (4-7 Hz) power. These measures were evaluated against metrics of executive function, ADHD symptoms, and academic achievement. Results Encoding alpha-power decreases and cue P2 amplitude were attenuated in ADHD, whereas occipital-alpha power during maintenance was significantly greater in ADHD, consistent with a compensatory response to weak encoding. Weak alpha modulation during encoding was associated with poorer reading comprehension and executive function, as well as enhanced ADHD symptoms. Previously reported effects in frontal-theta power failed to replicate. Conclusions Stimulus encoding, a component process of WM coupled to alpha modulation, is impaired in ADHD, and, unlike WM maintenance or vigilance processes, has implications outside of the laboratory via a relationship with executive function, and, to a weaker extent, reading comprehension.

Parafoveal Previews and Lexical Frequency in Natural Reading: Evidence From Eye Movements and Fixation-Related Potentials	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-GENERAL			English	Article						eye movements; fixation-related potentials; parafoveal-on-foveal effects; preview effects; lexical frequency	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VISUAL WORD RECOGNITION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; INTEGRATING INFORMATION; REGRESSION-ANALYSIS; TIME-COURSE; FOVEAL; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS	Participants' eye movements and electroencephalogram (EEG) signal were recorded as they read sentences displayed according to the gaze-contingent boundary paradigm. Two target words in each sentence were manipulated for lexical frequency (high vs. low frequency) and parafoveal preview of each target word (identical vs. string of random letters vs. string of Xs). Eye movement data revealed visual parafoveal-on-foveal (PoF) effects, as well as foveal visual and orthographic preview effects and word frequency effects. Fixation-related potentials (FRPs) showed visual and orthographic PoF effects as well as foveal visual and orthographic preview effects. Our results replicated the early preview positivity effect (Dimigen, Kliegl, & Sommer, 2012) in the X-string preview condition, and revealed different neural correlates associated with a preview comprised of a string of random letters relative to a string of Xs. The former effects seem likely to reflect difficulty associated with the integration of parafoveal and foveal information, as well as feature overlap, while the latter reflect inhibition, and potentially disruption, to processing underlying reading. Interestingly, and consistent with Kretzschmar, Schlesewsky, and Staub (2015), no frequency effect was reflected in the FRP measures. The findings provide insight into the neural correlates of parafoveal processing and written word recognition in reading and demonstrate the value of utilizing ecologically valid paradigms to study well established phenomena that occur as text is read naturally.

Positive and negative emotional vocalizations (e.g. laughing, crying) and violin musical stimuli digitally extracted from them were used as stimuli. They shared the melodic profile and main pitch/frequency characteristics. Participants listened to vocalizations or music while detecting rare auditory targets (bird tweeting, or piano's arpeggios). EEG was recorded from 128 sites. P2, N400 and Late positivity responses of ERPs were analysed. P2 peak was earlier in response to vocalizations, while P2 amplitude was larger to positive than negative stimuli. N400 was greater to negative than positive stimuli. LP was greater to vocalizations than music and to positive than negative stimuli. Source modelling using swLORETA suggested that, among N400 generators, the left middle temporal gyrus and the right uncus responded to both music and vocalizations, and more to negative than positive stimuli. The right parahippocampal region of the limbic lobe and the right cingulate cortex were active during music listening, while the left superior temporal cortex only responded to human vocalizations. Negative stimuli always activated the right middle temporal gyrus, whereas positively valenced stimuli always activated the inferior frontal cortex. The processing of emotional vocalizations and music seemed to involve common neural mechanisms. Notation obtained from acoustic signals showed how emotionally negative stimuli tended to be in Minor key, and positive stimuli in Major key, thus shedding some lights on the brain ability to understand music.

J	van den Boomen, C; Munsters, NM; Kemner, C				van den Boomen, Carlijn; Munsters, Nicolette M.; Kemner, Chantal			Emotion processing in the infant brain: The importance of local information	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Spatial frequency; Emotion; Development; Event related potential	FEARFUL FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; EYE GAZE; FACE; ATTENTION; PERCEPTION; RECOGNITION; POTENTIALS; ANGRY	Facial expressions provide crucial information for an infant's social and cognitive development. Expressions are discriminated based on specific basic-level information, such as global and local information represented in spatial frequencies. Research in adults suggests that different neural pathways are involved in emotion discrimination, each activated by specific spatial frequency ranges. However, in infants the involvement of spatial frequencies in emotion discrimination is unknown. In the current study we investigated the effect of manipulating spatial frequency information in the face on emotion discrimination. Infants aged 9-10 months (N = 61) viewed happy, fearful, and neutral faces. The faces contained either lower (related to global information) or higher spatial frequencies (related to local information). Brain activity in response to the faces was measured with electroencephalography. Interest was in the effect of emotion and spatial frequency on the amplitude of the N290, P400, and Nc components. Amplitudes of the N290 and P400 components differed between happy versus fearful or neutral faces, although only in the higher, and not the lower, spatial frequency condition. Amplitude of the Nc components differed between happy versus fearful or neutral faces regardless of spatial frequency condition. These results reveal the importance of higher spatial frequencies for emotion discrimination in infants (particularly at the N290 and P400 components). We related these findings to current models on the neural basis of facial-emotion processing.

A Combined EEG-fNIRS Study Investigating Mechanisms Underlying the Association between Aerobic Fitness and Inhibitory Control in Young Adults	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Event-related potentials; Cerebral oxygenation; Physical activity; Executive function; Stroop task	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; STROOP TASK; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; WORD TEST; AGE; CONFLICT	The current evidence suggests that aerobic fitness is associated with inhibitory control of executive functioning in children and older adults. However, the relative contributions of different neurophysiological mechanisms to this relation remain unclear and have not yet been examined in young adults. The present study aimed to compare inhibitory control between high and low-fit young adult men, and to investigate a possible mediation of fitness effects by conflict monitoring (N450 component of event-related potentials) and lateralized oxygenation difference (LOD) in the DLPFC. For the present cross-sectional study, participants with different physical activity levels were recruited and divided into low-fit and high-fit participants based on relative power on the PWC170. A Stroop Color-Word task was administered and combined EEG-fNIRS was simultaneously utilized to assess the N450 and LOD, because these parameters are linked with behavioral performance. The results of the statistical analysis showed that high-fitcompared to low-fit participants showed less Stroop interference and lower negativity of the N450, whereas no difference was found for LOD. Path-analyses further revealed that the relation between aerobic fitness levels and Stroop interference was indirect and mediated by N450. In contrast, LOD was inversely correlated with Stroop interference, but did not explain the relation of aerobic fitness with behavioral performance. The present findings indicate that greater inhibitory control in high- compared to low-fit young men can be explained by more effective conflict monitoring. Moreover, young adults with left-lateralizedDLPFC oxygenation also show higher inhibitory control, but this oxygenation pattern is not influenced by aerobic fitness. (C) 2019 IBRO.

It also explored the neuro-electrical activation that underlies the relationship between acute exercise and cognitive function through the examination of P3b and N1 components of event-related potentials. Design: A counterbalanced, repeated-measures experimental design. Methods: Thirty-five volunteer young adults completed two experimental sessions (i.e., acute aerobic exercise (AE) and resistance exercise (RE), matched in terms of intensity, and one reading session (control). The AE entailed cycling at 60-70% of maximal heart rate reserve for 30 min. In the RE session, participants performed seven exercises with two sets of 8-12 repetitions at 70% of 10-repetition maximum. Each participant's neuro-electrical activation was recorded 30 min after each session while s/he completed the task-switching test. Results: After the 30-min recovery period, both AE and RE elicited shorter response times in global switching (eta(2)(p) = 0.24) and local switching (eta(2)(p) = 0.16) were observed when compared to control. Additionally, larger P3b amplitudes (but not N1 amplitudes) were evident in global switching (eta(2)(p) = 0.15) and local switching (eta(2)(p) = 0.16), regardless of exercise modality. Conclusions: The present findings suggest that acute exercise has positive effects on cognitive function. Exercise-induced alterations during the later stages of mental processing might result in superior performance. There were significant selective benefits in terms of brain function regardless of exercise modality. (C) 2019 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Separate studies have shown that meditation (a) improves attention and (b) reduces sympathetic activity. The present study assessed attention with the P300 and sympathetic activity with heart rate variability (HRV). Forty-seven male subjects (group mean age +/- SD, 21.6 +/- 3.4 years) were assessed in 4 mental states: (a) random thinking, (b) nonmeditative focusing, (c) meditative focusing, and (d) defocused meditation. These were recorded on 4 consecutive days. HRV, respiration, and P300 event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded before and after the sessions. Data were analyzed with repeated-measures analysis of variance followed by post hoc analysis. HRV showed a significant increase in low-frequency (LF) power, decrease in high-frequency (HF) power and an increase in average heart rate based on the average R-R interval after meditative focusing, compared with before. In contrast, the average heart rate decreased after defocused meditation compared with before. There was a significant increase in the P300 peak amplitude after meditative focusing and defocused meditation, with a reduction in peak latency after defocused meditation. These results suggest that after meditation with focusing, there was sympathetic arousal whereas after defocused meditation, there was a decrease in the average heart rate while participants carried out the P300 auditory oddball task sooner.

JA precedes the development of the capacity to attribute mental states to others (i.e., mentalization or theory of mind). The neural mechanisms involved in the development of mentalization are not fully understood. Electroencephalographic recordings were made of children while they watched stimuli on a screen and their interaction with the experimenter was assessed. We tested whether neuronal activity preceding JA correlates with mentalization in typically developing (TD) children and whether this activity is impaired in children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) who evidence deficits in JA and mentalization skills. Both groups exhibited JA behavior with comparable frequency. TD children displayed a higher amplitude of negative central (Nc) event-related potential preceding JA behavior (similar to 500 msec after stimuli presentation), than did the ASD group. Previous to JA behavior, TD children demonstrated beta oscillatory activity in the temporoparietal region, while ASD children did not show an increase in beta activity. In both groups, the beta power correlated with mentalization, suggesting that this specific neuronal mechanism is involved in mentalization, which used during social interaction.

However, there is dearth of knowledge concerning the integration and relative time-course of its responses across different channels, i.e., for auditory, visual, and audiovisual input. Functional neuroimaging data in humans point to a possible role of this region in the multimodal integration of emotional signals, but direct evidence for anatomical and temporal overlap of unisensory and multisensory-evoked responses in amygdala is still lacking. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) and oscillatory activity from 9 amygdalae using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in patients prior to epilepsy surgery, and compared electrophysiological responses to fearful, happy, or neutral stimuli presented either in voices alone, faces alone, or voices and faces simultaneously delivered. Results showed differential amygdala responses to fearful stimuli, in comparison to neutral, reaching significance 100-200 ms post-onset for auditory, visual and audiovisual stimuli. At later latencies, similar to 400 ms post-onset, amygdala response to audiovisual information was also amplified in comparison to auditory or visual stimuli alone. Importantly, however, we found no evidence for either super- or subadditivity effects in any of the bimodal responses. These results suggest, first, that emotion processing in amygdala occurs at globally similar early stages of perceptual processing for auditory, visual, and audiovisual inputs; second, that overall larger responses to multisensory information occur at later stages only; and third, that the underlying mechanisms of this multisensory gain may reflect a purely additive response to concomitant visual and auditory inputs. Our findings provide novel insights on emotion processing across the sensory pathways, and their convergence within the limbic system.

Friction in Passive Tactile Perception Induces Phase Coherency in Late Somatosensory Single Trial Sequences	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; instantaneous phase coherence; single trial sequences; tactile perception	HUMAN SKIN; STABILITY; BRAIN; STIMULATION; RESPONSES; TOUCH	Event related potentials represent a noninvasive means for studying sensory and cognitive processes that occur in response to particular stimuli. Here, we report on a phase measure for estimating single trial interaction of late somatosensory potentials (LSPs) following a tribological well defined mechanical stimulation of the human fingertip. Stimuli are presented via a programmable Braille-display with actively switchable pins which was slid along the apex of the passive fingertip, i.e., the fingertip rested stationarily in a finger holding system with circular opening at the bottom. The event was the raising and the lowering of either one, three, or five lines of pins. Differences were identified by measures based on instantaneous phase synchronization to the stimuli across trials, in particular the wavelet phase synchronization stability (WPSS) measure for single trial sequences of LSPs. In particular, we show that the higher the friction the stronger and more localized the induced phase coherency is. We concluded that the WPSS analysis of single sequences of LSPs represents a reliable method which allows for the quantification of brain responses upon distinct tactile stimuli.

Growing evidence suggests that these therapeutic effects are dependent on the frequency and phase synchrony between SN oscillations and stimulation as well as the task-specific state of the SN during stimulation. However, the development of phase-synchronized non-invasive stimulation has proved challenging until recently. Here, we use a phase-locked pulsed brain stimulation approach to study the effects of two NIBS methods: transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) versus phase-locked transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS), on the SN during an SN activating task. 20 healthy volunteers participated in the study. Each volunteer partook in four sessions, receiving one stimulation type at random (theta-tACS, peak tPCS, trough tPCS or sham) while undergoing a learning game, followed by an unstimulated test based on learned material. Each session lasted approximately 1.5 h, with an interval of at least 2 days to allow for washout and to avoid cross-over effects. Our results showed no statistically significant effect of stimulation on the event related potential (ERP) recordings, resting electroencephalogram (EEG), and the performance of the volunteers. While stimulation effects were not apparent in this study, the nominal performance of the phase-locking algorithm offers a technical foundation for further research in determining effective stimulation paradigms and conditions. Specifically, future work should investigate stronger stimulation and true task-specific stimulation of SN nodes responsible for the task as well as their recording. If refined, NIBS could offer an effective, homebased treatment option.

The present study compared the effects of aerobic and coordinative training on behavioral and neurophysiological measures of inhibitory control. Forty-five children were randomly assigned (1:1:1 ratio) to groups performing aerobic training, coordinative training or assisted homework sessions over 10 weeks. Before and after intervention, all participants completed a Flanker task. The P300 component of event-related potentials elicited from the task was recorded via electroencephalography. Additionally, aerobic fitness and gross-motor skills were assessed using 20 m Shuttle Run and Heidelberg Gross-Motor Test, respectively. Statistical analyses revealed no time by group interactions for the P300 component (amplitude, latency), p = 0.976, eta(2) = 0.007, and behavioral performance (reaction time, accuracy), p = 0.570, eta(2) = 0.045. In contrast, there was a significant group-difference in pre- to post-test changes in aerobic fitness, p = 0.008, eta(2) = 0.246, with greater improvements following aerobic and coordinative training compared to assisted homework sessions. In conclusion, no differences regarding the efficiency of aerobic and coordinative training for the enhancement of inhibitory control were found as both exercise programs failed to elicit changes in speed and accuracy of stimulus evaluation and the allocation of attentional resources.

However, the role of perceptual factors in response inhibition processes is still poorly understood and an underrepresented field of research. In the current study, we focus on the role of conflicts between perceptual stimulus features (so-called S-S conflicts) for response inhibition. We introduce a novel semantic Stroop Condition task and analyze EEG data using source localization and temporal EEG signal decomposition methods to delineate the neural mechanisms how semantic S-S conflicts modulate response inhibition. We show that semantic conflicts enhance response inhibition performance by modulating neural processes relating to conflict resolution mechanisms in the middle and inferior frontal cortex, as well as the ACC. Opposed to that, Stroop-like (S-S) conflicts compromise response execution by affecting decision processes in inferior parietal cortices. The data suggest that when action control processes and their neurophysiological correlates depend on regions specialized in the processing of semantic conflicts, there is an improvement in response inhibition. The results show that Stroop-like semantic conflicts have opposite effects depending on whether a response has to be executed or inhibited. These opposing effects are then also associated with different functional-neuroanatomical structures. The results of the study show mechanisms by which stimulus-related processes influence mechanisms of response control.

This has shed light on the use of EEG for investigating the neuronal processes and effects of olfactory sensory. While there were a few EEG studies using ERP or spectral power analysis, the results are often not converging or lack of generality. This study attempts to explore a potentially more generalized approach by looking into the connectivity patterns in the brain during olfactory sensing. Human olfactory system collects odorants and transduces them into neural signals which are transmitted to the olfactory bulb that connects to the orbitofrontal cortex for further processing. We study connectivity of cortex signal through the coherence analysis on scalp EEG data. We propose a novel protocol for robust olfactory stimulus identification and synchronization experiment. We adopt Magnitude Squared Coherence Estimation for coherence analysis and derived a coherence index (CI) to infer the collaborative effect derived from a region of interest, e.g., left side and right side of scalp. From the 14 subjects' EEG data, we observe the lateralization effect of olfactory processes in the human brain. The results suggest a stronger collaborative effect in the left hemisphere compare to the right side when pleasant stimuli are delivered.

This study aims to integrate eye-tracking metrics and EEG measurements to distinguish and quantify the visual aesthetics of a product. Thirty-two 3D prototypes of LED desk lamp with multiple views were designed to simulate an aesthetic appreciation flow. Eye-tracking and EEG signals were simultaneously recorded when participants were freely browsing each lamp. The evaluation of subjective visual aesthetics was conducted after each browsing. The results demonstrated that fixation time ratio and dwell time ratio significantly differed among the three clusters of visual aesthetic lamps. Meanwhile, average fixation duration only significantly differed between low and high aesthetic lamps and pupil size had no significant variation. Moreover, low aesthetic lamps evoked significantly weakened relative alpha power and enhanced relative gamma power. Thus, the eye-tracking metrics and the EEG measurements can distinguish the visual aesthetics of lamps. Regarding the results of quantification, the integrated multimodal physiological signals achieved an improved and reasonable accuracy. It seems beneficial to integrate multimodal physiological signals involved in different flows of visual aesthetic appreciation in quantifying the visual aesthetics of a product. Relevance to industry: As a premise of attracting consumers' attention, visual aesthetics has been identified as a crucial role in product design and marketing. Thus, thorough research on the variations of multimodal physiological signals involved in information retrieval and processing in appreciation flow can provide a distinction between product visual aesthetics. The quantification method can be utilized by designers in measuring the visual aesthetics of their products.

We investigated whether P300 features in both sensor-level and source-level could be effectively used to classify post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Method: EEG signals were recorded from fifty-one PTSD patients, 67 MDD patients, and 39 healthy controls (HCs) while performing an auditory oddball task. Amplitude and latency of P300 were evaluated, and the current source analysis of P300 components was conducted using sLORETA. Finally, we classified two groups using machine-learning methods with both sensor- and source-level features. Moreover, we checked the comorbidity effects using the same approaches (PTSD-mono diagnosis (PTSDm, n = 28) and PTSD-comorbid diagnosis (PTSDc, n = 23)). Results: PTSD showed significantly reduced P300 amplitudes and prolonged latency compared to HCs and MDD. Moreover, PTSD showed significantly reduced source activities, and the source activities were significantly correlated with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Also, the best classification accuracy at each pair was as follows: 80.00% (PTSD-HCs), 67.92% (MDD-HCs), 70.34% (PTSD-MDD), 82.09% (PTSDm-HCs), 71.58% (PTSDm-MDD), 82.56% (PTSDc-HCs), and 76.67% (PTSDc- MDD). Conclusion: Since abnormal P300 reflects pathophysiological characteristics of PTSD, PTSD patients were welldiscriminated from MDD and HCs when using P300 features. Thus, altered P300 characteristics in both sensorand source-level may be useful biomarkers to diagnosis PTSD.

This event-related synchronization (ERS) and desynchronization (ERD) can be readily recorded non-invasively using magneto-and electro-encephalography (M/EEG). In addition, event-related potentials and fields (i. e., evoked responses) can be elucidated during movement. There is some evidence that the frequency, amplitude and latency of the movement-related ERS/ERD changes with ageing, however the evidence surrounding this topic comes mainly from studies in sample sizes on the order of tens of participants. The objective of this study was to examine a large open-access MEG dataset for age-related changes in movement-related ERS/ERD and evoked responses. MEG data acquired at the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience during cued button pressing was used from 567 participants between the ages of 18 and 88 years. The characteristics movement-related ERD/ERS and evoked responses were calculated for each individual participant. Based on linear regression analysis, significant relationships were found between participant age and some response characteristics, although the predictive value of these relationships was low. Specifically, we conclude that peak beta rebound frequency and amplitude decreased with age, peak beta suppression amplitude increased with age, movement-related gamma burst amplitude decreased with age, and peak motor-evoked response amplitude increased with age. Given our current understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these responses, our findings suggest the existence of age-related changes in the neurophysiology of thalamocortical loops and local circuitry in the primary somatosensory and motor cortices.

Despite extensive investigations conducted to examine the neural sources of N170, there are two issues in prior literature: (a) few studies used individualized anatomy as head model for the cortical source analysis of the N170, and (b) the relationship between the N170 and face-selective regions from fMRI studies is unclear. Here, we addressed these questions by presenting pictures of faces and houses to the same group of healthy adults and recording structural MRI, fMRI, and high-density ERPs in separate sessions. Source analysis based on the participant's anatomy showed that the middle and posterior fusiform gyri were the primary neural sources for the face-sensitive aspects of the N170. Source analysis based on regions of interest from the fMRI revealed that the fMRI-defined fusiform face area was the major contributor to the N170. The current study suggests that the fusiform gyrus is a major neural contributor to the N170 ERP component and provides further insights about the spatiotemporal characteristics of face processing.

Attenuation of alpha activity was found both when the PL display moved towards the to-be-grasped object and when the object was deleted from the video. Before the beginning of the movement of the PL stimuli, only in the presence of the object evoked attenuation of sensorimotor alpha activity was documented, possibly interpreted either as movement prediction or as graspable object perception. Our main findings demonstrate that, during observation of stimuli moving with biological kinematics, the infants' sensorimotor system is activated when the pictorial information is absent or highly reduced, and independently of the presence of the goal-directed object. The possible compensatory function of the sensorimotor system during observation of highly degraded moving stimuli is discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, little is known about how the musicians' brain resolves multimodal conflicts while preparing for musical action. We run an electroencephalographic (EEG) investigation on how visual processing for action (score reading) is affected by preceding task-irrelevant piano sounds, usually associated to the same or to a different action. Presentation of an incongruent sound, 100 msec before a musical score with one single note, reduces Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) associated to score reading (N170) localised in the right temporo-parietal junction, as well as ERPs associated to conflict strength (N2) localised in the anterior cingulate cortex, superior and inferior right frontal cortex. These results suggest that listening to task-irrelevant auditory action effects (musical notes) interferes with both higher-order visual and frontal conflict monitoring processes. We conclude that, in the musicians' brain, the automatic translation of musical sounds into motor plans, spread its effects to visually specific processing as well as strategic and a modal action monitoring mechanisms.

Differential semantic processing in patients with schizophrenia versus bipolar disorder: an N400 study	ACTA NEUROPSYCHIATRICA			English	Article						bipolar disorder; N400; semantics; schizophrenia	AMBIGUITY RESOLUTION; RATING-SCALE; INHIBITION; COMPONENT; LANGUAGE; THOUGHT; MANIA	Objective: Both bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ) are associated with language and thought symptoms that probably reflect a semantic memory-related impairment. We conducted a preliminary study to explore the nature of semantic processing in these disorders, using event-related potentials (ERPs). Methods: Twelve patients with BD, 10 patients with SZ and a matched group of 21 healthy controls (HC) underwent EEG recording while they heard sentences containing homophones or control words and performed a semantic ambiguity resolution task on congruent or incongruent targets. Results: Mean N400 amplitude differed between groups for homophones. Patients with SZ made more resolution errors than HC and exhibited a greater N400 congruity effect in ambiguous conditions than BD. In BD, the opposite N400 congruity effect was observed in ambiguous conditions. Conclusion: Results indicated differences in semantic processing between BD and SZ. Further studies with larger populations are needed in order to develop neurophysiological markers of these disorders.

Identifying evoked potential response patterns using independent component analysis and unsupervised learning	BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS & ENGINEERING EXPRESS			English	Article						ICA; HCT; K-means; ERP; FRN	SPATIAL FILTERS; CONSTRAINED ICA; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; VISUALIZATION; RECORDINGS; EXTRACTION; REMOVAL	Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a pre-processing step widely used in brain studies. One of the most common problems in artifact elimination or brain activity related studies is the ordering and identification of the independent components (ICs). In this work, a novel procedure is proposed which combines ICA decomposition at trial level with an unsupervised learning algorithm (K-means) at participant level in order to enhance the related signal patterns which might represent interesting brain waves. The feasibility of this methodology is evaluated with EEG data acquired with participants performing on the Halstead Category Test. The analysis shows that it is possible to find the Feedback Error Negativity (FRN) Potential at single-trial level and relate its characteristics with the performance of the participant based on their knowledge of the abstract principle underlying the task.

Contrastingly, in Chinese and Japanese the phoneme does not seem to play an important role but rather the syllable (Chinese) and mora (Japanese) are essential. However, despite the lack of behavioral evidence, neurocorrelational studies in Chinese suggested that electrophysiological brain responses (i.e. preceding overt responses) may indicate some significance for the phoneme. We investigated this matter in Japanese and our data shows that unlike in Chinese (for which the literature shows mixed effects), in Japanese both the behavioral and neurocorrelational data indicate an important role only for the mora (and not the phoneme) during the early stages of phonological encoding.

Using multivariate classifiers trained on spectral electroencephalogram (EEG) features, we quantified neural evidence for recognition decisions as a function of time. Classifiers trained on a small portion of the decision period performed similarly to those also incorporating information from previous time points indicating that neural activity reflects an integrated evidence signal. We propose a single-route account of recognition memory that is compatible with contributions from familiarity and recollection signals, but relies on a unitary evidence signal that integrates all available evidence.

However, the very assumptions that underlie traditional baseline also undermine it, implying a reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio. In other words, traditional baseline correction is statistically unnecessary and even undesirable. Including the baseline interval as a predictor in a GLM-based statistical approach allows the data to determine how much baseline correction is needed, including both full traditional and no baseline correction as special cases. This reduces the amount of variance in the residual error term and thus has the potential to increase statistical power.

An electrophysiological analysis of the time course of phonological and orthographic encoding in written word production	LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Handwriting; written production; orthography; phonology; electrophysiology; Chinese	LEXICAL ACCESS; CORTICAL DYNAMICS; SPEECH PRODUCTION; SPOKEN; CHINESE; SINGLE; FACILITATION; HYPOTHESIS; RETRIEVAL; FREQUENCY	Recent evidence suggests that individuals generate written words based on both spelling and sound. The present study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine the relative time course of orthographic and phonological activation. We adopted Chinese as a target language in which spelling and sound are largely dissociated. Native speakers of Chinese Mandarin were presented with coloured pictures and wrote down colour and picture names as adjective-noun phrases. Colour and picture names were either phonologically related, orthographically related, or unrelated. EEG revealed phonological effects in the 200-500 ms time window, starting at 206 ms after picture onset, and orthographic effects in the 300-400 ms time window, starting at 298 ms. The results of our study suggest that activation of phonological codes takes place approximately 100 ms earlier than access to orthographic codes, which provides evidence for phonological encoding as early sources of constraint in written word production.

Conflicting views exist regarding how the competition between a task-related and a threat-related feature is resolved when they co-occur in time and space. Utilizing aversive classical Pavlovian conditioning, we investigated the visuocortical representation of two simultaneously presented, fully overlapping visual stimuli. Isoluminant red and green random dot kinematogram (RDK) stimuli were flickered at distinct tagging frequencies (8.57 Hz, 12 Hz) to elicit distinguishable steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs). Occasional coherent motion events prompted a motor response (task) or predicted a noxious noise (threat). These events occurred either in the green (task cue), the red (threat cue), or in both RDKs simultaneously. In the initial habituation phase, participants responded to coherent motion of the green RDK with a key press, but no loud noise was presented at any time. Here, selective amplification was seen for the task-relevant (green) RDK, and interference was observed when both RDKs simultaneously showed coherent motion. Upon pairing the threat cue with the noxious noise in the subsequent acquisition phase, the threat cue-evoked ssVEP (red RDK) was also amplified, but this amplification did not interact with amplification of the task cue or alter the behavioral or visuocortical interference effect observed during simultaneous coherent motion. Although competing feature conjunctions resulted in interference in the visual cortex, the acquisition of a bias toward an individual threat-related feature did not result in additional cost effects.

Layers of latent effects in cognitive control: An EEG investigation	ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA			English	Article						Cognitive control; Cross-trial dynamics; EEG; Gratton effect; Hand tracking	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; CONFLICT ADAPTATION; FEATURE-INTEGRATION; DYNAMICS; COMPONENT; MODEL; THETA; PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY; TRACKING; TIMES	Recent research demonstrates that two components of reaching behavior - initiation time (the time elapsed from stimulus presentation to movement initiation) and reach curvature (the degree to which a reach movement deviates from a direct path to the selected response) - exhibit distinct cross-trial dynamics in cognitive control tasks, indicating that these components of behavior reflect two dissociable processes underlying cognitive control: a threshold adjustment process involving the inhibition of motor output and a controlled selection process involving the recruitment of top-down resources to support goal-relevant behavior. The current study investigates the extent to which the cross-trial dynamics previously observed in reaching behavior in the Eriksen flanker task are reflected in event-related potentials during standard button-press responses. Candidate EEG measures of the threshold adjustment process (N2 and Pre-LRP amplitudes) failed to reveal the cross-trial dynamics previously observed in initiation times. Slow wave amplitudes exhibited a close correspondence to the cross-trial dynamics observed in reach curvatures, indicating that the measure is sensitive to some functions of the controlled selection process. Further, LFtP slopes presented a close correspondence to the cross-trial dynamics observed in response times, indicating that this measure reflects the combined output of the threshold adjustment process and controlled selection process. The implications of these findings for future research examining the links among behavioral and neural dynamics are discussed.

The goal of this study was to compare neural activity and connectivity during a voluntary movement (VM) paradigm that involved cued eye blinks among children with and without CTDs. Using the precise temporal resolution of electroencephalography (EEG), we used the timing and location of cortical source resolved spectral power activation and connectivity to map component processes such as visual attention, cue detection, blink regulation and response monitoring. We hypothesized that neural activation and connectivity during the cued eye blink paradigm would be significantly different in regions typically associated with effortful control of eye blinks, such as frontal, premotor, parietal, and occipital cortices between children with and without CTD. Method: Participants were 40 children (23 with CTD, 17 age-matched Healthy Control [HC]), between the ages of 8-12 (mean age = 9.5) years old. All participants underwent phenotypic assessment including diagnostic interviews, behavior rating scales and 128-channel EEG recording. Upon presentation of a cue every 3 s, children were instructed to make an exaggerated blink. Results: Behaviorally, the groups did not differ in blink number, latency, or ERP amplitude. Within source resolved clusters located in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, and supplemental motor area, children with CTD exhibited higher gamma band spectral power relative to controls. In addition, significant diagnostic group differences in theta, alpha, and beta band power in inferior parietal cortex emerged. Spectral power differences were significantly associated with clinical characteristics such as tic severity and premonitory urge strength. After calculating dipole density for 76 anatomical regions, the CTD and HC groups had 70% overlap of top regions with the highest dipole density, suggesting that similar cortical networks were used across groups to carry out the VM. The CTD group exhibited significant information flow increase and dysregulation relative to the HC group, particularly from occipital to frontal regions. Conclusion: Children with CTD exhibit abnormally high levels of neural activation and dysregulated connectivity among networks used for regulation and effortful control of voluntary eye blinks.

However, trust is also built through repeated interactions in which an opposite party acts positively towards the subject in a consistent way. The dynamics of cortical activation of this form of interactively-experienced trust is unclear. The current study therefore investigated the electrophysiological response to trust/distrust, arising through interactions in an investment game. Using an ERP paradigm, participants took part in a money game in which they chose to entrust different amounts to fictitious players. Some of these players were associated with the higher probability of a positive outcome (trustworthy behaviour), others were associated with a higher negative outcome (untrustworthy behaviour), and yet others were neutral. Over the course of the game, a strong central positivity emerged between 450 and 650 ms for trustworthy faces, compared to both neutral and untrustworthy players. This time period thus reflects the window during which the trustworthiness of a face is processed, when based on prior interaction. In addition, by evidencing ERP modifications for trustworthy faces alone, these findings suggest that the "default mode" of processing is initially biased towards distrust.

Some view this as evidence against a causal role for consciousness in human decision-making and thus against free-will. But previous work focused on arbitrary decisions-purposeless, unreasoned, and without consequences. It remains unknown to what degree the RP generalizes to deliberate, more ecological decisions. We directly compared deliberate and arbitrary decision-making during a $1000-donation task to non-profit organizations. While we found the expected RPs for arbitrary decisions, they were strikingly absent for deliberate ones. Our results and drift-diffusion model are congruent with the RP representing accumulation of noisy, random fluctuations that drive arbitrary-but not deliberate-decisions. They further point to different neural mechanisms underlying deliberate and arbitrary decisions, challenging the generalizability of studies that argue for no causal role for consciousness in decision-making to real-life decisions.

The behavioural discrepancies and EEG characteristics of advice taking, as affected by the advice distances, were compared. The results showed that the relationship between the modification rate of a decision maker's initial estimation and the advice distance exhibited an inverse U-shaped curve. During the advice evaluation stage, different advice distances induced the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and subsequent P300 components. The amplitude of the FRN increased as the advice distance increased, while the amplitude of P300 in the zero distance condition was significantly larger than those in the intermediate and far distance conditions. These findings indicate that the advice evaluation process of a decision maker is related to conflict perception, prediction error and motivational or affective significance.

Such lures might actually have dual characteristics: Their capturing attention might interfere with target identification, whereas their similarity to T2 might result in positive priming. To test this idea here, T2 was a blue digit among black letters, and lures resembled T2 either by alphanumeric category (black digits) or by salience (blue letters). Same-category lures were expected to prime T2 identification whereas salient lures would impede T2 identification. Results confirmed these predictions, yet the precise pattern of results did not fit our conceptual framework. To account for this pattern, we speculate that lures serve to confuse participants about the order of events, and the major factor distinguishing color lures and digit lures is their confusability with T2. Mechanisms of effects were additionally explored by measuring event-related EEG potentials. Consistent with the assumption that they attract more attention, color lures evoked larger N2pc than digit lures and affected the ensuing T1-evoked N2pc. T2-evoked N2pc was indistinguishably reduced by all kinds of preceding lures, though. Lure-evoked mesio-frontal negativity increased from first to third lures both with digit and color lures and, thereby, might have reflected expectancy for T1.

Bi-Directional Evidence Linking Sentence Production and Comprehension: A Cross-Modality Structural Priming Study	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						cross-modality structural priming; production; comprehension; event-related potentials; sentence processing	PREPOSITIONAL-PHRASE ATTACHMENT; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PERSISTENCE; MECHANISMS; SPEECH; REPETITION; COGNITION; GRAMMAR; SPEAKER	Natural language involves both speaking and listening. Recent models claim that production and comprehension share aspects of processing and are linked within individuals (Pickering and Garrod, 2004, 2013; MacDonald, 2013; Dell and Chang, 2014). Evidence for this claim has come from studies of cross-modality structural priming, mainly examining processing in the direction of comprehension to production. The current study replicated these comprehension to production findings and developed a novel cross-modal structural priming paradigm from production to comprehension using a temporally sensitive online measure of comprehension, Event-Related Potentials. For Comprehension-to-Production priming, participants first listened to active or passive sentences and then described target pictures using either structure. In Production-to-Comprehension priming, participants first described a picture using either structure and then listened to target passive sentences while EEG was recorded. Comprehension-to-Production priming showed the expected passive sentence priming for syntactic choice, but not response time (RT) or average syllable duration. In Production-to-Comprehension priming, primed, versus unprimed, passive sentences elicited a reduced N400. These effects support the notion that production and comprehension share aspects of processing and are linked within the individual. Moreover, this paradigm can be used for the exploration priming at different linguistic levels as well as the influence of extra-linguistic factors on natural language use.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							NECKER-ZENO MODEL; AMBIGUOUS FIGURES; BISTABLE PERCEPTION; BINOCULAR-RIVALRY; MULTISTABLE PERCEPTION; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; VOLUNTARY CONTROL; NEURAL ACTIVITY; SENSORY MEMORY; REVERSAL RATE	During the observation of an ambiguous figure our perception alternates between mutually exclusive interpretations, although the stimulus itself remains unchanged. The rate of these endogenous reversals has been discussed as reflecting basic aspects of endogenous brain dynamics. Recent evidence indicates that extensive meditation practice evokes long-term functional and anatomic changes in the brain, also affecting the endogenous brain dynamics. As one of several consequences the rate of perceptual reversals during ambiguous figure perception decreases. In the present study we compared EEG-correlates of endogenous reversals of ambiguous figures between meditators and non-meditating controls in order to better understand timing and brain locations of this altered endogenous brain dynamics. A well-established EEG paradigm was used to measure the neural processes underlying endogenous perceptual reversals of ambiguous figures with high temporal precision. We compared reversal-related ERPs between experienced meditators and non-meditating controls. For both groups we found highly similar chains of reversal-related ERPs, starting early in visual areas, therewith replicating previous findings from the literature. Meditators, however, showed an additional frontal ERP signature already 160 ms after stimulus onset (Frontal Negativity). We interpret the additional, meditation-specific ERP results as evidence that extensive meditation practice provides control of frontal brain areas over early sensory processing steps. This may allow meditators to overcome phylogenetically evolved perceptual and attentional processing automatisms.

A P300-Based Brain-Computer Interface for Improving Attention	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain-computer interface; neurofeedback; P300; attention; electroencephalography	EEG-NEUROFEEDBACK; P300; BCI; COMMUNICATION; PERFORMANCE; SIGNALS	A Brain-computer Interface (BCI) can be used as a neurofeedback training tool to improve cognitive performance. BCIs aim to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the conventional neurofeedback methods by focusing on the self-regulation of individualized neuromarkers rather than generic ones in a graphically appealing training environment. In this work, for the first time, we have modified a widely used P300-based speller BCI and used it as an engaging neurofeedack training game to enhance P300. According to the user's performance the game becomes more difficult in an adaptive manner, requiring the generation of a larger and stronger P300 (i.e., in terms of total energy) in response to target stimuli. Since the P300 is generated naturally without conscious effort in response to a target trial, unlike many rhythm-based neurofeedback tools, the ability to control the proposed P300-based neurofeedback training is obtained after a short calibration without undergoing tedious trial and error sessions. The performance of the proposed neurofeedback training was evaluated over a short time scale (approximately 30 min training) using 28 young adult participants who were randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the control group. In summary, our results show that the proposed P300-based BCI neurofeedback training yielded a significant enhancement in the ERP components of the target trials (i.e., 150-550 ms after the onset of stimuli which includes P300) as well as attenuation in the corresponding ERP components of the non-target trials. In addition, more centro-parietal alpha suppression was observed in the experimental group during the neurofeedback training as well as a post-training spatial attention task. Interestingly, a significant improvement in the response time of a spatial attention task performed immediately after the neurofeedback training was observed in the experimental group. This paper, as a proof-of-concept study, suggests that the proposed neurofeedback training tool is a promising tool for improving attention particularly for those who are at risk of attention deficiency.

Immediate versus delayed control demands elicit distinct mechanisms for instantiating proactive control	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Cognitive control; Working memory; Task-switching; AX-Continuous Performance Task; EEG; Dot Probe Expectancy	PREDICTS INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; REACTIVE COGNITIVE CONTROL; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; VISUAL WORKING-MEMORY; DELTA BAND ACTIVITY; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURAL MECHANISMS; DUAL MECHANISMS; FRONTAL THETA	Cognitive control is critical for dynamically guiding goal-directed behavior, particularly when applying preparatory, or proactive, control processes. However, it is unknown how proactive control is modulated by timing demands. This study investigated how timing demands may instantiate distinct neural processes and contribute to the use of different types of proactive control. In two experiments, healthy young adults performed the AX-Continuous Performance Task (AX-CPT) or Dot Pattern Expectancy (DPX) task. The delay between informative cue and test probe was manipulated by block to be short (1s) or long (similar to 3s). We hypothesized that short cue-probe delays would rely more on a rapid goal updating process (akin to task-switching), whereas long cue-probe delays would utilize more of an active maintenance process (akin to working memory). Short delay lengths were associated with specific impairments in rare probe accuracy. EEG responses to control-demanding cues revealed delay-specific neural signatures, which replicated across studies. In the short delay condition, EEG activities associated with task-switching were specifically enhanced, including increased early anterior positivity ERP amplitude (accompanying greater mid-frontal theta power) and a larger late differential switch positivity. In the long delay condition, we observed study-specific sustained increases in ERP amplitude following control-demanding cues, which may be suggestive of active maintenance. Collectively, these findings suggest that timing demands may instantiate distinct proactive control processes. These findings suggest a reevaluation of AX-CPT and DPX as pure assessments of working memory and highlight the need to understand how presumably benign task parameters, such as cue-probe delay length, significantly alter cognitive control.

The nasal airways of OSA patients, measured via acoustic rhinometry, could be significantly narrower than healthy subjects and this reduced nasal structure can impair olfactory function. The relationship between nasal structure and olfactory function, assessed via behavioral test results, indicates that there is a high prevalence of nasal airflow problems. Based on these assumptions, the purpose of this study was to carry out an assessment of olfactory perception in OSA patients through the Chemosensory Event-Related Potentials (CSERP), investigating the N1 component and the Late Positive Component (LPC). Twelve OSA patients, non-smokers, were recruited in the Pulmonary Rehabilitation Unit, scored with the Epworth Sleepiness Scales, after Polygraphic Recording, Apnea Hypopnea Index and Body Mass Index evaluation. The control group consisted of twelve healthy controls, non-smokers, recruited as volunteers. Subjects, during an EEG recording, performed an oddball olfactory recognition task based on two scents: rose and eucalyptus. Main results highlighted differences in N1 and LPC between OSA and controls. OSA patients presented faster N1 latencies and greater amplitude. The same trend was found in LPC, where OSA showed decreased latency and increased amplitude during rose stimulation, in the right inferior frontal cortex. and faster latencies in left centroparietal cortex OERP results can suggest an impairment in endogenous components. This result could be the consequence of the exogenous perceptual difficulty highlighted in N1 component. The increased arousal could also be related to the respiratory activity involved during the olfactory task.

Effect of Aging on Change of Intention	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						aging; intention; free-choice; decision making; masked-priming; EEG; LRP; EMG	VISUAL SELECTIVE ATTENTION; AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES; INHIBITORY PROCESSES; MOTOR-RESPONSES; MASKED STIMULI; FREE-CHOICE; TIME-COURSE; MECHANISMS; MODEL; MIND	Decision making often requires making arbitrary choices ("picking") between alternatives that make no difference to the agent, that are equally desirable, or when the potential reward is unknown. Using event-related potentials we tested the effect of age on this common type of decision making. We compared two age groups: ages 18-25, and ages 41-67 on a masked-priming paradigm while recording EEG and EMG. Participants pressed a right or left button following either an instructive arrow cue or a neutral free-choice picking cue, both preceded by a masked arrow or neutral prime. The prime affected the behavior on the Instructed and the Free-choice picking conditions both in the younger and older groups. Moreover, electrophysiological "Change of Intention" (Chol) was observed via lateralized readiness potential (LRP) in both age groups the polarity of the LRP indicated first preparation to move the primed hand and then preparation to move the other hand. However, the older participants were more conservative in responding to the instructive cue, exhibiting a speed-accuracy trade-off, with slower response times, less errors in incongruent trials, and reduced probability of EMG activity in the non-responding hand. Additionally, "Change of Intention" was observed in both age groups in slow RT trials with a neutral prime as a result of an endogenous early intention to respond in a direction opposite the eventual instructing arrow cue. We conclude that the basic behavioral and electrophysiological signatures of implicit Chol are common to a wide range of ages. However, older subjects, despite showing a similar dynamic decision trajectory as younger adults, are slower, more prudent and finalize the decision making process before letting the information affect the peripheral motor system. In contrast, the flow of information in younger subjects occurs in parallel to the decision process.

Categorical representations are apparent within a distributed fronto-temporo-parietal brain network but how this neural circuitry is shaped by experience remains undefined. Here, we asked whether speech and music categories might be formed within different auditory-linguistic brain regions depending on listeners' auditory expertise. We recorded EEG in highly skilled (musicians) vs. less experienced (nonmusicians) perceivers as they rapidly categorized speech and musical sounds. Musicians showed perceptual enhancements across domains, yet source EEG data revealed a double dissociation in the neurobiological mechanisms supporting categorization between groups. Whereas musicians coded categories in primary auditory cortex (PAC), nonmusicians recruited non-auditory regions (e.g., inferior frontal gyrus, IFG) to generate category-level information. Functional connectivity confirmed nonmusicians' increased left IFG involvement reflects stronger routing of signal from PAC directed to IFG, presumably because sensory coding is insufficient to construct categories in less experienced listeners. Our findings establish auditory experience modulates specific engagement and inter-regional communication in the auditory-linguistic network supporting categorical perception. Whereas early canonical PAC representations are sufficient to generate categories in highly trained ears, less experienced perceivers broadcast information downstream to higher-order linguistic brain areas (IFG) to construct abstract sound labels.

However, it has not been completely elucidated how the implicit extraction of second-order nonadjacent transitional probabilities is reflected by neurophysiological processes. Therefore, this study investigated the sensitivity of event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to these probabilistic regularities embedded in a sequence of visual stimuli without providing explicit information on the structure of the stimulus stream. Healthy young adults (N = 32) performed a four-choice RT task that included a sequential regularity between nonadjacent trials yielding a complex transitional probability structure. ERPs were measured relative to both stimulus and response onset. RTs indicated the rapid acquisition of the sequential regularity and the transitional probabilities. The acquisition process was also tracked by the stimulus-locked and response-locked P3 component: The P3 peak was larger for the sequence than for the random stimuli, while the late P3 was larger for less probable than for more probable short-range relations among the random stimuli. According to the RT and P3 effects, sensitivity to the sequential regularity is assumed to be supported by the initial sensitivity to the transitional probabilities. These results suggest that stimulus-response contingencies on the probabilistic regularities of the ongoing stimulus context are implicitly mapped and constantly revised. Overall, this study (1) highlights the role of predictive processes during implicit memory formation, and (2) delineates a potential to gain further insight into the dynamics of implicit acquisition processes.

Previous analyses of the magnetic resonance imaging data from this cohort have shown that similar to 15% of boys with ASD have disproportionate megalencephaly (DM) or brain size to height ratio, that is 1.5 standard deviations above the TD mean. Here, we investigated electrophysiological responses to auditory stimuli of increasing intensity (50-80 dB) in young toddlers (27-48 months old). Analyses included data from 36 age-matched boys, of which 24 were diagnosed with ASD (12 with and 12 without DM; ASD-DM and ASD-N) and 12 TD controls. We found that the two ASD subgroups differed in their electrophysiological response patterns to sounds of increasing intensity. At early latencies (55-115 ms), ASD-N does not show a loudness-dependent response like TD and ASD-DM, but tends to group intensities by soft vs. loud sounds, suggesting differences in sensory sensitivity in this group. At later latencies (145-195 ms), only the ASD-DM group shows significantly higher amplitudes for loud sounds. Because no similar effects were found in ASD-N and TD groups, this may be related to their altered neuroanatomy. These results contribute to the effort to delineate ASD subgroups and further characterize physiological responses associated with observable phenotypes. Autism Res 2019, 12: 1236-1250.

Lay summary Approximately 15% of boys with ASD have much bigger brains when compared to individuals with typical development. By recording brain waves (electroencephalography) we compared how autistic children, with or without big brains, react to sounds compared to typically developing controls. We found that brain responses in the big-brained group are different from the two other groups, suggesting that they represent a specific autism subgroup.

To explore whether there is an alteration of brain functional connectivity (BFC) in patients with OCD during rest, electroencephalogram (EEG) data of healthy controls (HCs) and patients with OCD were collected during rest in both eyes-closed and eyes-open states. Synchronization likelihood and graph theory were applied to construct and analyze brain functional networks of patients with OCD and HCs. Patients with OCD showed abnormal graph-theoretic parameters and impaired small world features in the alpha and beta bands. In addition, the topological analysis consistently showed that the long-range BFC of alpha rhythm was significantly reduced in the bilateral posterior areas in patients with OCD in comparison with HCs, while the BFC in the beta rhythm was significantly increased only in the eyes-open state. The findings suggest that the BFC of patients with OCD show abnormal small-world features and altered topological structure during rest, mainly in alpha and beta bands, which may provide a new insight for the diagnosis and treatment of OCD.

While temporal context effects have been frequently studied in the laboratory, ecologically valid spatial context manipulations are difficult to implement in stationary conditions. We investigated whether the neural correlates of successful encoding (subsequent memory effect) can be captured in a real-world environment. An off-the-shelf Android smartphone was used for wireless mobile EEG acquisition and stimulus presentation. Participants encoded single words, each of which was presented at a different location on a university campus. Locations were approximately 10-12m away from each other, half of them with striking features (landmarks) nearby. We predicted landmarks would improve recall performance. After a first free recall task of verbal stimuli indoors, participants performed a subsequent recall outdoors, in which words and locations were recalled. As predicted, significantly more words presented at landmark locations as well as significantly more landmark than nonlandmark locations were recalled. ERP analysis yielded a larger posterior positive deflection during encoding for hits compared to misses in the 400-800ms interval. Likewise, time-frequency analysis revealed a significant difference during encoding for hits compared to misses in the form of stronger alpha (200-300ms) and theta (300-400ms) power increases. Our results confirm that a vibrant spatial context is beneficial in episodic memory processing and that the underlying neural correlates can be captured with unobtrusive smartphone EEG technology. The advent of mobile EEG technology promises to unveil the relevance of natural physical activity and natural environments on memory. This study is the first to use smartphone mobile EEG to capture neural correlates of successful memory formation in the real world. Participants encoded words at outdoor campus locations while on smartphone EEG recording. Crucially, our encoding setting closely resembled the day-to-day episodic memory experience, by providing a unique temporal and spatial context for every encoding stimulus, thereby overcoming the invariant spatial context of stationary laboratory settings. Further, we were able to explore the positive impact of feature-rich locations (landmarks) on episodic memory performance. The advent of mobile EEG technology promises to unveil the relevance of natural environments on memory.

There are very few BCI studies based on these mobile devices and, to the best of our knowledge, none of them supports networking applications or are focused on an assistive context, failing to test their systems with motor-disabled users. Therefore, the aim of the present study is twofold: (i) to design and develop an asynchronous P300-based BCI system that allows users to control Twitter and Telegram in an Android device; and (ii) to test the usefulness of the developed system with a motor-disabled population in order to meet their daily communication needs. Row-col paradigm (RCP) is used in order to elicitate the P300 potentials in the scalp of the user, which are immediately processed for decoding the user's intentions. The expert system integrates a decision-making stage that analyzes the attention of the user in real-time, providing a comprehensive and asynchronous control. These intentions are then translated into application commands and sent via Bluetooth to the mobile device, which interprets them and provides visual feedback to the user. During the assessment, both qualitative and quantitative metrics were obtained, and a comparison among other state-ofthe-art studies was performed as well. The system was tested with 10 healthy control subjects and 18 motor-disabled subjects, reaching average online accuracies of 92.3% and 80.6%, respectively. Results suggest that the system allows users to successfully control two socializing features of a smartphone, bridging the accessibility gap in these trending devices. Our proposal could become a useful tool within households, rehabilitation centers or even companies, opening up new ways to support the integration of motor-disabled people, and making an impact in their quality of life by improving personal autonomy and self-dependence.

In many cases, noise in visual stimuli plays an active role in brain information processing. Electroencephalogram (EEG) provides an objective mean to measure brain cognition and information processing, and studies on the effect of noise on EEG can help us better understand the mechanisms involved in information processing. Approach. In this study, visual stimuli, consisting of images with different noise levels, were created using the phase-scrambled method. EEG data evoked by these images were then obtained using the rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm and the N-back method was used to induce and assess the fatigue state of subjects. The effect of differing noise modulation levels on EEG in different fatigue states was studied by analyzing the differences in the characteristics of steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP). Main results. The study results demonstrated that an image's noise level had a significant impact on the evoked SSVEP characteristics. The amplitude and time delay of induced SSVEP were effectively enhanced by moderately increasing the noise of the visual stimulus images. Fatigue also appeared to affect SSVEP, and the difference in SSVEP characteristics induced by images with different noise levels decreased when the subject was fatigued. Significance. The conclusions of this study provide insights into the relationship between visual stimuli noise and SSVEP characteristics under different fatigue states. This might provide a basis for the study of the brain's mechanisms in regulating attention resources and the stochastic resonance phenomenon. In addition, this study has the potential to provide an objective method for rapid fatigue detection based on EEG.

However, there is no adequate information on this issue. In this study, auditory event-related potentials and the sensory gating performance were assessed in P50, N100 and P200 waves. Besides, their relationship with cognitive performance in auditory and visual modalities was investigated. Materials & Methods Nineteen normal primary school students (14 boys) were tested in Tehran, Iran from 2017 to 2018. In the auditory modality, the Persian version of the non-word repetition test and monaural selective auditory attention test (mSAAT) were used for assessment of the working memory and selective attention, respectively. In order to evaluate the visual working memory and visual selective attention, Rey-Osterrieth complex figure, selective and divided attention test were used, respectively. A 32-channel EEG system was used for electrophysiological assessment. Results The P50 sensory gating was negatively correlated with the visual selective attention (P=0.034, r=-0.49) and N100 sensory gating was negatively correlated with the auditory working memory (P=0.043, r=-0.48) as well as visual selective attention (P=0.039, r=-0.47). For P200, there was a significant negative relationship with auditory selective attention in the right ear (P=0.034, r=-0.49). Conclusion Sensory gating in children is not a modality-specific phenomenon. Sensory gating in a modality could be associated with cognitive functions in other modalities.

Recently, some investigators have attempted to apply advanced brain signal acquisition systems that allow dynamic brain activities to be measured simultaneously during social interactions. Most studies to date have investigated dyadic interactions, although multilateral interactions are more common in reality. However, it is believed that most studies have focused on such interactions because of methodological limitations, in that it is very difficult to design a well-controlled experiment for multiple users at a reasonable cost. Accordingly, there are few simultaneous acquisition systems for multiple users. In this study, we propose a design framework for an acquisition system that measures EEG data simultaneously in an environment with 10 or more people. Our proposed framework allowed us to acquire EEG data at up to 1 kHz frequency from up to 20 people simultaneously. Details of our acquisition system are described from hardware and software perspectives. In addition, various related issues that arose in the system's development-such as synchronization techniques, system loads, electrodes, and applications-are discussed. In addition, simultaneous visual ERP experiments were conducted with a group of nine people to validate the EEG acquisition framework proposed. We found that our framework worked reasonably well with respect to less than 4 ms delay and average loss rates of 1%. It is expected that this system can be used in various hyperscanning studies, such as those on crowd psychology, large-scale human interactions, and collaborative brain-computer interface, among others.

Electrophysiological indices of anterior cingulate cortex function reveal changing levels of cognitive effort and reward valuation that sustain task performance	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Sustained effort; Reward valuation; Cognitive control; Anterior cingulate cortex; Electrophysiology	FRONTAL-MIDLINE THETA; MENTAL FATIGUE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; FEEDBACK; PREDICTION; DEPRESSION; MOTIVATION; BEHAVIOR; OSCILLATIONS	Successful execution of goal-directed behaviors often requires the deployment of cognitive control, which is thought to require cognitive effort. Recent theories have proposed that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) regulates control levels by weighing the reward-related benefits of control against its effort-related costs. However, given that the sensations of cognitive effort and reward valuation are available only to introspection, this hypothesis is difficult to investigate empirically. We have proposed that two electrophysiological indices of ACC function, frontal midline theta and the reward positivity (RewP), provide objective measures of these functions. To explore this issue, we recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) from participants engaged in an extended, cognitively-demanding task. Participants performed a time estimation task for 2 h in which they received reward and error feedback according to their task performance. We observed that the amplitude of the RewP, a feedback-locked component of the event related brain potential associated with reward processing, decreased with time-on-task. Conversely, frontal midline theta power, which consists of 4-8 Hz EEG oscillations associated with cognitive effort, increased with time-on-task. We also explored how these phenomena changed over time by conducting within-participant multi-level modeling analyses. Our results suggest that extended execution of a cognitively-demanding task is characterized by an early phase in which high control levels foster rapid improvements in task performance, and a later phase in which high control levels were necessary to maintain stable task performance, perhaps counteracting waning reward valuation.

In the last decade, empathy has been a hot topic in cognitive neuroscience for its important role in social interaction. To date, there are a variety of definitions of the term "empathy", such as "a reaction to the observed experiences of another" and "the ability to experience and understand what others feel without confusion between oneself and others". Based on different definitions of empathy, different methodologies have been developed and adopted in the field of empathy research. Valid empathy questionnaires are developed to provide ones' subjective evaluation about their empathy ability (i.e., trait empathy); behavioral paradigms are designed to measure individuals' empathy levels under a specific context (i.e., state empathy); physiological techniques and brain imaging techniques are useful in detecting objective physiological signals related to empathy. However, some findings on empathy are mixed and inconsistent, which might be due to the different definitions and methodologies adopted by each study. To deepen our understanding of empathy and its psychological mechanisms, it is necessary to integrate different methodologies and interpret results from different aspects. To this end, this review first summarized how empathy is typically measured and quantified at different measurement levels with an emphasis on emotional empathy and cognitive empathy, given that existing studies on empathy mainly focus on the two categories and their combination. Specifically, methodologies in empathy research were introduced as followed: (1) Widely-used empathy questionnaires, including the detailed definitions and measurement dimensions; (2) classic experimental materials and behavioral paradigms for measuring emotional empathy and/or cognitive empathy; (3) empathy-related physiological signals detected by facial electromyography, electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Next, we discussed the advantages and disadvantages of each methodology and pointed out the difficulties in compiling findings from studies using different methodologies. For example, different empathy questionnaires applied to the same group may yield contradictory results and the quality of experimental stimulus in the same kind of empathy paradigms potentially influences participants' brain activities. More importantly, the physiological signals (e.g. event-related potential components) recorded in empathy experiments are not "specific" but only "related" to empathy. Then, we suggested that researchers should carefully select appropriate methodologies according to their research needs. For instance, EEG is suitable for exploring empathic processing in the time domain, while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is conducive to pinpoint the specific functions (e.g. self-other discrimination) of empathy-related brain regions. Finally, we proposed that the conceptual framework of empathy should be unified and more naturalistic paradigms should be developed to reveal the interactions among different empathic subprocesses in the future. In conclusion, this review highlights the importance of comparing and combining different methodologies to reveal the underlying mechanisms of empathy, which yields new insights into social interaction.

We asked whether they do so when faced with full-body social interactions, whether emerging representations go beyond basic sensorimotor mirroring, and whether they depend on processing goals and inclinations. In an EEG/ERP study, we presented line-drawn, dyadic interactions with and without affectionate touch. In an explicit and an implicit task, participants categorized images into touch versus no-touch and same versus opposite sex interactions, respectively. Modulations of central Rolandic rhythms implied that affectionate touch displays engaged sensorimotor mechanisms. Additionally, the late positive potential (LPP) being larger for images with as compared to without touch pointed to an involvement of higher order socio-affective mechanisms. Task and sex modulated touch perception. Sensorimotor responding, indexed by Rolandic rhythms, was fairly independent of the task but appeared less effortful in women than in men. Touch induced socio-affective responding, indexed by the LPP, declined from explicit to implicit processing in women and disappeared in men. In sum, this study provides first evidence that vicarious touch from full-body social interactions entails shared sensorimotor as well as socio-affective experiences. Yet, mental representations of touch at a socio-affective level are more likely when touch is goal relevant and observers are female. Together, these results outline the conditions under which touch in visual media may be usefully employed to socially engage observers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An event-related potential named medial frontal negativity (MFN) has been demonstrated to be sensitive to error and gambling loss. In this study, we conducted the sample gambling game, in which subjects decide to choose one from two cards with different bets (big or small bet), and thereby two critical types of reward features: magnitude (small or large) and valence (loss or gain) were investigated. We analyzed the MFN in different feedback conditions to get insight into the differences in individual behaviors between magnitude and valence. Results of this study demonstrated that the MFN is sensitive to reward valence but insensitive to reward magnitude. Particularly, from the perspective of dynamic functional brain network, differences between small and large magnitudes were uncovered; compared to the large condition, the network pattern related to small reward involved the left central lobe (near electrode C3); whereas the large reward involved the left prefrontal lobe (near electrode Fp1) and right medial temporal lobe (near electrode T8).

Is schizotypic maternal personality linked to sensory gating abilities during infancy?	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Event-related potential; Sensory gating; Schizotypy; Infancy	P50; SCHIZOPHRENIA; RISK; INHIBITION; DEFICITS; INDIVIDUALS; CRITERIA; MODELS; SCALES	Schizotypy is a personality dimension within the general population elevated among schizophrenia-spectrum patients and their first-degree relatives. Sensory gating is the pre-attentional habituation of responses distinguishing between important and irrelevant information. This is measured by event-related potentials, which have been found to display abnormalities in schizophrenic disorders. The current study investigated whether 6-month-old infants of mothers with schizotypic traits display sensory gating abnormalities. The paired-tone paradigm: two identical auditory tones (stimulus 1 and stimulus 2) played 500ms apart, was used to probe the selective activation of the brain during 15-minutes of sleep. Their mothers completed the Oxford and Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences-Short Form as an index of schizotypy dimensionality, categorized into: infants of control, and infants of schizotypic, mothers. The findings revealed that although the infants' P50 components displayed significant differences between stimulus 1 and stimulus 2 in the paired-tone paradigm, there was no clear difference between infants of schizotypic and infants of control mothers. In contrast, all mothers displayed significant differences between stimulus 1 and stimulus 2, as observed in the infants, but also significant differences between their sensory gating ability correlated with schizotypy dimensionality. These findings are consistent with sensory processes, such as sensory gating, evidencing impairment in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. The present research supports the idea that first-degree relatives of individuals who identify on this spectrum, within the sub-clinical category, do not display the same deficit at 6 postnatal months of age.

However, whether this applies to the semantic processing of words remains controversial. This work was designed to manipulate simultaneously two sources of cognitive load to study their impact on the depth of parafoveal word processing during a modified visual search task. The participants had to search for target words among parafoveally presented semantic, orthographic or target-unrelated distractor words while their electroencephalogram was recorded. The task-related load was manipulated by either giving target words in advance (literal task) or giving only a semantic clue to define them (categorical task). The foveal load was manipulated by displaying either a word or hash symbols at the centre of the screen. Parafoveal orthographic and semantic distractors had an impact on the early event-related potential component P2a only in the literal task and when hash symbols were displayed at the fovea, i.e., when both the task-related and foveal loads were low. The data show that all sources of cognitive load must be considered to understand how parafoveal words are processed in visual search contexts.

Target word frequency (low, high) and its predictability from prior context (low, high) were manipulated across two-sentence passages. Context sentences were presented in full, followed by word-by-word presentation (300 ms SOA) of target sentences. ERPs were analysed across left-to-right and anterior-to-posterior regions of interest within intervals from 50 to 550 ms post-stimulus. The onset of significant predictability effects (50-80 ms) preceded that of frequency (P1, 80-120 ms), while both main effects were generally sustained through the N400 (350-550 ms). Critically, the frequency-predictability interaction became significant in the P1 and was sustained through the N400, although the specific configuration of effects differed across components. The pattern of findings supports an early, chronometric locus of contextual predictability in recognising words during reading.

We investigated their effects on the processing of subsequent (un)predictable words, and on the quality of word representations in memory. Participants read dialogues with (un)predictable endings that followed a discourse marker (eigenlijk in Experiment 1, inderdaad in Experiment 2) or a control adverb. We found no strong evidence that discourse markers modulated online predictability effects elicited by subsequently read words. However, words following eigenlijk elicited an enhanced posterior post-N400 positivity compared with words following an adverb regardless of their predictability, potentially reflecting increased processing costs associated with pragmatically driven discourse updating. No effects of inderdaad were found on online processing, but inderdaad seemed to influence memory for (un)predictable dialogue endings. These findings nuance our understanding of how pragmatic markers affect incremental language comprehension.

A modified flanker paradigm was used to examine how the probability of conflict modulates ERN and Pe amplitudes in patients with schizophrenia (n = 33) and healthy controls (n = 25). Increased ERN was observed in response to errors on low probability, incongruent trials. No such differences were observed in Pe. While ERN and Pe showed significantly reduced amplitudes in patients relative to controls, patients showed normal condition-dependent ERN and reaction-time modulation. This suggests that while the neural mechanisms generating the ERN and Pe are compromised in schizophrenia, those modulating task performance strategy and neurophysiological responses to errors based on conflict probability are intact.

Forty PD patients and 21 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled. The Starkstein Apathy Scale (SAS) was used to divide the PD patients into apathetic and nonapathetic groups. Cognitive function was evaluated by the forward and backward Digit Span tests, Trail Making Test (TMT), and Word Fluency Test. The participants were required to recognize positive, neutral, and negative emotional faces and engage in an emotion categorization task while EEG was recorded. The time to completion for the TMT (Part A and Part B) from highest to lowest was in the order of apathetic group>nonapathetic group>HC group. Compared with the nonapathetic and HC groups, in the apathetic group, P100 amplitudes were smaller for positive expressions in the right hemisphere and latencies were longer for positive expressions in the left hemisphere, while latencies were longer for neutral expressions bilaterally. Compared with the nonapathetic group, in the apathetic group, N170 amplitudes were attenuated and latencies were delayed for neutral and negative expressions in the right hemisphere. A trend towards larger N170 amplitudes in the right hemisphere than in the left was observed in the nonapathetic and HC groups, but this difference was not significant in the apathetic group. In the apathetic group, bilateral P100 amplitudes elicited by negative expressions were negatively correlated with SAS scores, and SAS scores were positively correlated with Part B of the TMT. N170 amplitudes elicited by negative expressions in the right hemisphere were negatively correlated with SAS in the apathetic group and with Part B of TMT in both PD groups. Our findings suggested that emotional processing was impaired in apathetic PD patients and that the right hemisphere was more sensitive to reflecting this impairment in the early time windows of ERPs.

Remote-sensor automated system for SUDEP (Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy) forecast and alerting Analytic concepts and support from clinical data	PROCEEDINGS OF 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON APPLICATIONS OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS (APPIS 2019)			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Applications of Intelligent Systems (APPIS)	JAN 07-09, 2019	Museo Elder Sci & Technol, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, SPAIN	Univ Groningen, Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Wolfram Res, Gran Canaria Tourism Bur, Gran Canaria Patronato Turismo Off	Museo Elder Sci & Technol	Epilepsy; Convulsive seizures; SUDEP; PGES; Remote sensing; EEG		Rationale: Sudden Unexpected Death from Epilepsy, or SUDEP, is the most catastrophic complication related to the debilitating neurological condition of epilepsy. The two major standing challenges from a clinical perspective that are related to this morbid phenomenon are (1) to establish the overall risk of SUDEP for a particular individual and (2) to elaborate a paradigm for accurate prediction and alerting for an imminent SUDEP event. In addition, as data available for SUDEP cases is sparse, a third challenge is to (3) develop a methodology that can find universal biomarkers reflecting the patient's condition independently of the type of measurements available (EEG, EMG, accelerometer, audio, video). Methods: In our group we have elaborated and tested a computational model based hypothesis relating the slowing of a major clonic seizure to possible post-ictal generalized electrographic suppression (PGES). To apply these findings to available clinical data, the approach proposed here is based on a combination of wavelet analysis and integral transformation techniques. It can be used in video sequences (after optical flow group parameters reconstruction) audio signals, EEG, EMG, accelerometer data and possibly other modalities to produce biomarkers characterizing the evolution of the ictal process independently from the sensor modality and acquisition parameters. To classify the PGES and possibly SUDEP cases we employed both supervised (Support Vector Machine - SVM) and unsupervised (Gaussian mixture model) Results: We found three potential promising biomarkers: final inter-clonic time interval, total seizure duration and goodness of fit of the dominant Radon ridge. These biomarkers can be derived from any of the sensors or the combinations of their data, they are largely independent of the exact measurement modality and therefore offer robust paradigm for diagnostic and safety monitoring implementations. The supervised classifier achieved 99.7% accuracy and the unsupervised produced accuracy of 97.3%. Application: Depending on the implementation environment, the module will be used both off-line for diagnostics or on-line for realtime alerting.

Neurophysiological Activations of Predictive and Non-predictive Exogenous Cues: A Cue-Elicited EEG Study on the Generation of Inhibition of Return	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						inhibition of return; predictive cues; exogenous cuing task; EEG and ERP; intraparietal sulcus	REFLEXIVE ATTENTION; NEURAL BASIS; IOR; FACILITATION; STIMULUS	In cueing tasks, predictive and non-predictive exogenous spatial cues produce distinct patterns of behavioral effects. Although both cues initially attract attention, only nonpredictive cues lead to inhibitory effects (worse performance at the cued location as compared to the uncued location) if the time elapsed between the cue and the target is long enough. However, the process/processes leading to the later inhibitory effect, named inhibition of return (IOR), are still under debate. In the present study, we used cueelicited EEG activations from predictive and non-predictive exogenous spatial cues to further investigate the neural processes involved in IOR. Unlike previous similar studies, we intermixed both types of cues in a block of trials, in an attempt to identify the unique neurophysiological activations associated with the generation of IOR. We found that predictive and non-predictive cues significantly differed in activation just at 400-470 ms post-cue window. Activation was greater for non-predictive cues in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and this activation correlated significantly with IOR effects. These findings support the hypothesis that the posterior parietal cortex plays a crucial role in the generation of IOR.

Neural processing operations of the human brain vary according to the difficulty level of the problem and the intelligence level of individuals. In this study, we used a bimodal system consisting of functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and Electroencephalogram (EEG) to investigate these inter-individual differences. A continuous wave 32-channel fNIRS from OxyMonfNIRS device (Artinis) and 19-channel EEG from (g.tec's company) were utilized to study the oxygenation procedure as well as the electrical activity of the brain when doing the problems of Raven's Progressive Matrix (RPM) intelligence test. We used this information to estimate the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of the individual without performing a complete logical-mathematical intelligence test in a long-time period and examining the answers of people to the questions. After EEG preprocessing, different features including Higuchi's fractal dimension, Shannon entropy values from wavelet transform coefficients, and average power of frequency sub-bands were extracted. Clean fNIRS signals were also used to compute features such as slope, mean, variance, kurtosis, skewness, and peak. Then dimension reduction algorithms such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were applied to select an effective feature set from fNIRS and EEG in order to improve the IQ estimation process. We utilized two regression methods, i.e., Linear Regression (LR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), to extract optimum models for the IQ determination. The best regression models based on fNIRS-EEG and fNIRS presented 3.093% and 3.690% relative error for 11 subjects, respectively.

While accumulating research has elucidated the neural processing of native morphology, much less is known about how second-language (L2) learners acquire and process morphology in their L2. To address this question, we presented native speakers as well as beginning and advanced learners of Finnish with spoken (1) derived words, (2) inflected words, (3) novel derivations (novel combinations of existing stem + suffix), and (4) pseudo-suffixed words (existing stem + pseudo-suffix) in a passive listening EEG experiment. An early (60 msec after suffix deviation point) positive ERP response showed no difference between inflections and derivations, suggesting similar early parsing of these complex words. At 130 msec, derivations elicited a lexical ERP pattern of full-form memory-trace activation, present in the L2 beginners and advanced speakers to different degrees, implying a shift from lexical processing to more dual parsing and lexical activation of the complex forms with increasing proficiency. Pseudo-suffixed words produced a syntactic pattern in a later, 170 240 msec time-window, exhibiting enhanced ERPs compared to well-formed inflections, indicating second-pass syntactic parsing. Overall, the L2 learners demonstrated a gradual effect of proficiency towards L1-like responses. Advanced L2 learners seem to have developed memory traces for derivations and their neurolinguistic system is capable of early automatic parsing. This suggests that advanced learners have already developed sensitivity to morphological information, while such knowledge is weak in beginners. Discrepancies in ERP dynamics and topographies indicate partially differing recruitment of the language network in L1 and L2. In beginners, response differences between existing and novel morphology were scarce, implying that representations for complex forms are not yet well-established. The results suggest successful development of brain mechanisms for automatic processing of L2 morphology, capable of gradually attaining L1-like functionality with increasing proficiency.

RREPs produced by consciously detected vs. undetected loads, near the detection threshold, were compared. Participants (n = 17) were instrumented with EEG and a nasal mask connected to a loading manifold, which presented a range of mid inspiratory resistive loads, plus a control, in a random block design. Participants were cued prior to the stimulus and signalled detection by a button press. There were statistically significant differences in peak-to-peak amplitude of the P1 RREP peak for detected (mean +/- SD; 3.86 +/- 1.45 mu V; P = 0.020) and undetected loads (3.67 +/- 1.27 mu V; P = 0.002) vs. control (2.36 0.81 Of), although baseline-to-peak differences were not significantly different. In contrast peak-to-peak P3 amplitude was significantly greater for detected (5.91 +/- 1.54 mu V; P < 0.001) but not undetected loads (3.33 +/- 0.98 mu V; P = 0.189) vs. control (3.69 +/- 1.46 mu V), with the same pattern observed for baseline-to-peak measurements. The P1 peak, thought to reflect arrival of somatosensory information, appeared to be present in response to both detected and undetected loads, but the later P3 peak, was present for detected loads only. This suggests that for sub-threshold loads sensory information may reach the cortex, arguing against a sub-cortical gating process.

This process requires segregating the speech streams from each other and continuously directing attention to the target stream. We investigated the functional brain networks underlying this ability. Two speech streams were presented simultaneously to participants, who followed one of them and detected targets within it (target stream). The loudness of the distractor speech stream varied on five levels: moderately softer, slightly softer, equal, slightly louder, or moderately louder than the attended. Performance measures showed that the most demanding task was the moderately softer distractors condition, which indicates that a softer distractor speech may receive more covert attention than louder distractors and, therefore, they require more cognitive resources. EEG-based measurement of functional connectivity between various brain regions revealed frequency-band specific networks: (1) energetic masking (comparing the louder distractor conditions with the equal loudness condition) was predominantly associated with stronger connectivity between the frontal and temporal regions at the lower alpha (8-10 Hz) and gamma (30-70 Hz) bands; (2) informational masking (comparing the softer distractor conditions with the equal loudness condition) was associated with a distributed network between parietal, frontal, and temporal regions at the theta (4-8 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) bands. These results suggest the presence of distinct cognitive and neural processes for solving the interference from energetic vs. informational masking.

The Role of Meaning in Visual Memory: Face-Selective Brain Activity Predicts Memory for Ambiguous Face Stimuli	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; face memory; memory; N170; visual memory	LONG-TERM-MEMORY; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; RECOGNITION; OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVATION; ATTENTION; PATTERNS; INSIGHTS; RECALL	How people process images is known to affect memory for those images, but these effects have typically been studied using explicit task instructions to vary encoding. Here, we investigate the effects of intrinsic variation in processing on subsequent memory, testing whether recognizing an ambiguous stimulus as meaningful (as a face vs as shape blobs) predicts subsequent visual memory even when matching the perceptual features and the encoding strategy between subsequently remembered and subsequently forgotten items. We show in adult humans of either sex that single trial EEG activity can predict whether participants will subsequently remember an ambiguous Mooney face image (e.g., an image that will sometimes be seen as a face and sometimes not be seen as a face). In addition, we show that a classifier trained only to discriminate between whether participants perceive a face versus non-face can generalize to predict whether an ambiguous image is subsequently remembered. Furthermore, when we examine the N170, an event-related potential index of face processing, we find that images that elicit larger N170s are more likely to be remembered than those that elicit smaller N170s, even when the exact same image elicited larger or smaller N170s across participants. Thus, images processed as meaningful, in this case as a face, during encoding are better remembered than identical images that are not processed as a face. This provides strong evidence that understanding the meaning of a stimulus during encoding plays a critical role in visual memory.

Cortical dynamics during preparation and execution of reactive balance responses with distinct postural demands	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Balance; Posture; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Independent component analysis (ICA); Mobile brain/body imaging (MOBI)	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; EVENT-RELATED DYNAMICS; CEREBRAL POTENTIALS; UNEXPECTED EVENTS; MUSCLE SYNERGIES; MOTOR CONTROL; LEFT-HANDERS; ALPHA-BAND; EEG ALPHA; MOVEMENT	The contributions of the cerebral cortex to human balance control are clearly demonstrated by the profound impact of cortical lesions on the ability to maintain standing balance. The cerebral cortex is thought to regulate subcortical postural centers to maintain upright balance and posture under varying environmental conditions and task demands. However, the cortical mechanisms that support standing balance remain elusive. Here, we present an EEG-based analysis of cortical oscillatory dynamics during the preparation and execution of balance responses with distinct postural demands. In our experiment, participants responded to backward movements of the support surface either with one forward step or by keeping their feet in place. To challenge the postural control system, we applied participant-specific high accelerations of the support surface such that the postural demand was low for stepping responses and high for feet-in-place responses. We expected that postural demand modulated the power of intrinsic cortical oscillations. Independent component analysis and time-frequency domain statistics revealed stronger suppression of alpha (9-13 Hz) and low-gamma (31-34 Hz) rhythms in the supplementary motor area (SMA) when preparing for feet in -place responses (i.e., high postural demand). Irrespective of the response condition, support-surface movements elicited broadband (3-17 Hz) power increase in the SMA and enhancement of the theta (3-7 Hz) rhythm in the anterior prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and bilateral sensorimotor cortices (Ml/S1). Although the execution of reactive responses resulted in largely similar cortical dynamics, comparison between the bilateral Ml/S1 showed that stepping responses corresponded with stronger suppression of the beta (13-17 Hz) rhythm in the Ml/S1 contralateral to the support leg. Comparison between response conditions showed that feet-in-place responses corresponded with stronger enhancement of the theta (3-7 Hz) rhythm in the PFC. Our results provide novel insights into the cortical dynamics of SMA, PFC, and Ml/S1 during the control of human balance.

However, it remains unclear if this relation can be confirmed for other visuomotor demanding disciplines as well as different age groups. This study aimed to validate previous findings in international elite youth table tennis players to shed light on the generalizability of neural performance determinants across different visuomotor demanding sports and age groups. Methods: Thirty-seven young elite international table tennis players (18 male, 19 female, mean age: 13.5 years) from 23 nations participated in this study. Participants performed a visuomotor reaction task in response to visual motion stimuli presented at two different motion velocity conditions. Visuomotor performance was evaluated by measuring the electromyographic (EMG) onset as well as the VMRT. In addition, a 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) system was used to investigate the stimulus and response-locked event-related potentials (ERPs) in the brain's visual motion sensitive area MT as well as the pre- and supplementary motor cortex indicating the speed of cortical visual and motor information processing, respectively. Correlation and multiple regression analyses identified the neural processes determining visuomotor performance. Results: The VMRT (232 vs. 258 ms, P < 0.001, d = -2.33) and EMG onset (181 vs. 206 ms, P < 0.001, d = -2.14) were accelerated in the fast motion velocity condition which was accompanied by an earlier stimulus-locked N2 (187 vs. 193 ms, P < 0.001, d = -0.80) and later response-locked N2-r (17 vs. -0.1 ms, P < 0.001, d = 1.04). The N2 and N2-r latencies were correlated with EMG onset and VMRT in both velocity conditions and explained between 80% and 90% of the variance in visuomotor reaction speed. Neural processes in BA6 did not differ between stimulus velocity conditions and did not contribute to the regression model. Conclusion: The results validate our previous findings and support the importance of neural visual processes for the visuomotor reaction speed across different visuomotor demanding sports and age groups. This suggests the visual system might be a promising target for specific visual diagnostics and training interventions.

In the 'active' run, subjects chose between three different response options to receive the outcomes. In the 'observational' run, they observed another person's choices and subsequent outcomes. Cluster-based permutation analyses of event-related potential (ERPs) revealed that early processing in the P2 time window reflected outcome salience, differentiating HPOs and MPOs from LPOs, especially for outcomes following own choices, while not distinguishing between HPOs and MPOs. In contrast, processing in later stages, i.e., the typical time windows for feedback-related negativity (FRN) and P300, showed evidence of differential coding of HPOs and MPOs and was also modulated by agency. ERPs clearly differentiated between all three outcome types in the FRN and P300 time windows for outcomes following active but not for observed choices. The present study adds to evidence for modulation of outcome processing by contextual and inter-individual factors. In particular, our findings suggest that subjective preferences are complementarily represented in subjective reward valuation and in motivational value representations indexed by the FRN and the P300.

J	Maier, M; Rahman, RA				Maier, Martin; Rahman, Rasha Abdel			No matter how: Top-down effects of verbal and semantic category knowledge on early visual perception	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Categorical perception; Semantic knowledge; Event-related potentials; Linguistic relativity; Top-down effects	COGNITIVE IMPENETRABILITY; LANGUAGE; COLOR; WORDS; COMPONENT; VISION; FIELD; LATERALIZATION; ACQUISITION; ACTIVATION	Language is assumed to augment human cognition. But can language also affect basic mechanisms of perception, suggesting cognitive penetrability of perception? This idea is highly controversial: linguistic categorization may induce top-down effects on ongoing perceptual processing. Alternatively, such effects may not concern perception proper, but pre-perceptual shifts of attention or downstream processes, such as perceptual judgment. This study provides a critical test of these views by investigating categorical perception (CP) of novel objects in a balanced learning design, controlling for perceptual experience and low-level visual differences. To better understand which linguistic representations induce CP, we manipulated the type of information categories were based on: bare verbal labels, in-depth semantic knowledge, or the combined information from labels associated with semantic knowledge. We used event-related brain potentials (ERPs) derived from the EEG in a visual search task to localize CP effects at perceptual or pre/post-perceptual stages. The results replicated behavioral CP with facilitated visual search when target and distractors belonged to different linguistic categories. ERPs revealed CP effects in the P1 and N1 components, associated with early visual processing. Attentional selection, reflected in the N2, also was influenced by linguistic categories. The N2 and the N400, a measure of high-level semantic processing, were sensitive to the depth of semantic knowledge associated with objects. CP, however, did not differ between category types, suggesting that any linguistic categorization can lead to CP. The findings support cognitive penetrability of perception, with linguistic categories informing perceptual predictions down to the processing of low-level visual features.

To estimate whether the "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders" (DSM) is biologically accurate for the diagnosis of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) using a biological-based classifier built by a special method of multivariate analysis of a large dataset of a small sample (much more variables than subjects), holding neurophysiological, behavioral, and psychological variables. Methods. Twenty typically developing boys and 19 boys diagnosed with ADHD, aged 10-13 years, were examined using the Attentional Network Test (ANT) with recordings of event-related potentials (ERPs). From 774 variables, a reduced number of latent variables (LVs) were extracted with a clustering of variables method (CLV), for further reclassification of subjects using the k-means method. This approach allowed a multivariate analysis to be applied to a significantly larger number of variables than the number of cases. Results. From datasets including ERPs from the mid-frontal, mid-parietal, right frontal, and central scalp areas, we found 82% of agreement between DSM and biological-based classifications. The kappa index between DSM and behavioral/psychological/neurophysiological data was 0.75, which is regarded as a "substantial level of agreement". Discussion. The CLV is a useful method for multivariate analysis of datasets with much less subjects than variables. In this study, a correlation is found between the biological-based classifier and the DSM outputs for the classification of subjects as either ADHD or not. This result suggests that DSM clinically describes a biological condition, supporting its validity for ADHD diagnostics.

Filter theory is part of a scientist's training, yet the impact of filters on interpreting data is not always fully appreciated. This paper reviews the issue and explains what a filter is, what problems are to be expected when using them, how to choose the right filter, and how to avoid filtering by using alternative tools. Time-frequency analysis shares some of the same problems that filters have, particularly in the case of wavelet transforms. We recommend reporting filter characteristics with sufficient details, including a plot of the impulse or step response as an inset.

Being right matters: Model-compliant events in predictive processing	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DYNAMIC CHANGES; COMPONENTS; N400; P3; UNCERTAINTY; MEMORY; ERP; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; RESPONSES; ERROR	While prediction errors (PE) have been established to drive learning through adaptation of internal models, the role of model-compliant events in predictive processing is less clear. Checkpoints (CP) were recently introduced as points in time where expected sensory input resolved ambiguity regarding the validity of the internal model. Conceivably, these events serve as on-line reference points for model evaluation, particularly in uncertain contexts. Evidence from fMRI has shown functional similarities of CP and PE to be independent of event-related surprise, raising the important question of how these event classes relate to one another. Consequently, the aim of the present study was to characterise the functional relationship of checkpoints and prediction errors in a serial pattern detection task using electroencephalography (EEG). Specifically, we first hypothesised a joint P3b component of both event classes to index recourse to the internal model (compared to non-informative standards, STD). Second, we assumed the mismatch signal of PE to be reflected in an N400 component when compared to CP. Event-related findings supported these hypotheses. We suggest that while model adaptation is instigated by prediction errors, checkpoints are similarly used for model evaluation. Intriguingly, behavioural subgroup analyses showed that the exploitation of potentially informative reference points may depend on initial cue learning: Strict reliance on cue-based predictions may result in less attentive processing of these reference points, thus impeding upregulation of response gain that would prompt flexible model adaptation. Overall, present results highlight the role of checkpoints as model-compliant, informative reference points and stimulate important research questions about their processing as function of learning und uncertainty.

Cortical processing of irrelevant somatosensory information from the leg is altered by attention during early movement preparation	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Somatosensory; Gating; Attention; Lower limb; Preparation; Motor	CONCURRENT VIBROTACTILE STIMULATION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; ERP EVIDENCE; COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS; REACTION-TIME; CORTEX; NERVE; MODULATION; VOLUNTARY	The ability to actively suppress, or gate, irrelevant sensory information is needed for safe and efficient walking in sensory-rich environments. Both attention and the late phase of motor preparation alter somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in healthy adults. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of attention on the processing of irrelevant somatosensory information during the early phase of preparation of plantarflexion movements. Young healthy individuals received tibial nerve stimulation while electroencephalography (EEG) recorded SEPs over the Cz electrode. Three conditions were tested in both legs: 1) Rest, 2) Attend To the stimulated limb, and 3) Attend Away from the stimulated limb. In conditions 2 and 3, vibration (80 Hz) was applied over the medial soleus muscle to cue voluntary plantarflexion movements of the stimulated (Attend To) or non-stimulated leg (Attend Away). Only SEPs delivered during early preparation were averaged for statistical analysis. Results demonstrated a main effect of condition for the N40 and N70 indicating that SEP amplitudes in the Attend To condition were smaller than rest (p <= 0.02). For the P50, no interaction effects or main effects were found (p >= 0.08). There was no main effect of leg for any component measured. The results indicate that gating of irrelevant sensory information during early preparation occurs in the leg when attention is directed within the same limb. If attention alters the somatosensory stimuli from a leg movement, then directing attention may affect safe community walking.

The present study examined ASD behavioral and ERP responses to emotional expressions of anger and fear, as conveyed by the face and body. Behavioral results showed significantly faster response times for the ASD than for the typically developing (TD) group when processing fear, but not anger, in isolated face expressions, isolated body expressions, and in the integration of the two. In addition, EEG data for the N170 and P1 indicated processing differences between fear and anger stimuli only in TD group, suggesting that individuals with ASD may not be distinguishing between emotional expressions. These results suggest that ASD children may employ a different neural mechanism for visual emotion recognition than their TD peers, possibly relying on inferential processing.

Testing the role of the posterior cingulate cortex in processing salient stimuli in cannabis users: an rTMS study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG ERP; exteroceptive processes; neuromodulation; posterior cingulate cortex; precuneus	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; DOUBLE-CONE COIL; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DEFAULT-MODE; SMOKING CUES; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; BRAIN-STIMULATION; NEURAL RESPONSE; LONG-TERM	The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus are hubs in the default mode network and play a role in processing external salient stimuli. Accordingly, activation in these regions has been associated with response to salient stimuli using drug cue-reactivity paradigms in substance using populations. These studies suggest that the PCC and precuneus may underlie deficits in processing salient stimuli that contribute toward the development of substance use disorders. The goal of this study was to directly test this hypothesis using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, we used rTMS to target the PCC and precuneus with a double-cone coil at 10 Hz (high frequency) and 1 Hz (low frequency) in 10 adult cannabis users and 10 age- and sex-matched non-using controls. Electroencephalography data were collected before and after rTMS during a modified oddball paradigm with neutral, oddball, self-relevant, and cannabis-related stimuli. Cannabis users exhibited increased amplitude in P3 and faster latencies in the P3, N2, and P2 components in response to self-relevant stimuli compared to controls during baseline that normalized after rTMS. These results suggest that cannabis users exhibited heightened salience to external self-relevant stimuli that were modulated after rTMS. PCC dysfunction in cannabis users may be related to abnormalities in processing salient stimuli, such those during cue-reactivity, and provides a potential target for cannabis use disorder intervention.

J	Ding, JF; Wang, L; Yang, YF				Ding, Jinfeng; Wang, Lin; Yang, Yufang			The influence of emotional words on predictive processing during sentence comprehension	LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Emotional words; prediction; sentence comprehension; EEG	EVENT-RELATED-POTENTIALS; DYNAMIC INFLUENCE; PERCEPTION; RESPONSES; N400; PREACTIVATION; ANTICIPATION; ATTENTION; MEMORY; ALPHA	The current study examined the influence of contexts' emotional arousal on prediction and integration of words during sentence comprehension. In sentence context, we manipulated the emotional arousal of verbs and the predictability of their following neutral nouns. At the anticipatory stage of the upcoming nouns, a larger sustained negativity was elicited in the highly constraining than the weakly constraining sentences for the neutral verbs but not for the emotional verbs. The results reflect reduced processing loads in response to the pre-activation of the highly predictable nouns when the emotional verbs automatically captured sufficient attentional resources. At the integration stage of the nouns, we found reduced N400 and LPC amplitudes for the highly versus weakly predictable nouns in both the emotionally arousing and non-arousing conditions. The findings suggest that the emotional arousal of context interacts with the prediction of upcoming words, but not the integration of the bottom-up inputs.

Participants trained on a categorisation task where some stimuli were predictive (P) of the correct response while others were non-predictive (NP). These stimuli were then used in a dot probe task in which we varied the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between the cues and the target. Participants responded faster to the target when it appeared over a P cue at each SOA. The reaction time advantage towards the P cues increased proportionally with SOA, suggesting that participants were strategically processing the cues. Target-elicited N2pc amplitudes at short SOAs suggested that P cues were preferentially processed, consistent with exploitation. However, the amplitudes at a longer SOA suggested that after the P cues were processed, they were inhibited. This inhibition could bias attention towards other currently ambiguous stimuli, consistent with exploration.

For a sufficient classification performance, user engagement and motivation are critical aspects. Consequently, many paradigms require the user to perform an auxiliary task, such as mentally counting subsets of stimuli or pressing a button when encountering them. In this work, we compare two user tasks, mental counting and button-presses, in a hazard detection paradigm in driving videos. We find that binary classification performance of events based on the electroencephalogram as well as user preference are higher for button presses. Amplitudes of evoked responses are higher for the counting task an observation which holds even after projecting out motor-related potentials during the data preprocessing. Our results indicate that the choice of button-presses can be a preferable choice in such BCIs based on prediction performance as well as user preference.

Unsupervised machine-learning classification of electrophysiologically active electrodes during human cognitive task performance	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; CHANNEL SELECTION; MEMORY FORMATION; MOTOR-IMAGERY; BRAIN; RECORDINGS; POTENTIALS; STIMULI	Identification of active electrodes that record task-relevant neurophysiological activity is needed for clinical and industrial applications as well as for investigating brain functions. We developed an unsupervised, fully automated approach to classify active electrodes showing event-related intracranial EEG (iEEG) responses from 115 patients performing a free recall verbal memory task. Our approach employed new interpretable metrics that quantify spectral characteristics of the normalized iEEG signal based on power-in-band and synchrony measures. Unsupervised clustering of the metrics identified distinct sets of active electrodes across different subjects. In the total population of 11,869 electrodes, our method achieved 97% sensitivity and 92.9% specificity with the most efficient metric.

This, however, implies that the time necessary to detect the brain signals increases and then that the communication rate can be dramatically reduced. A common approach is then at first to estimate an optimal fixed number of responses to be averaged on a calibration data set and then to use this number on the online/testing dataset. In contrast to this strategy, several early stopping methods have been successfully proposed, aiming at dynamically stopping the stimulation sequence when a certain condition is met. We propose an efficient and easy to implement early stopping method that outperforms the ones proposed in the literature, showing its effectiveness on several publicly available datasets recorded from either healthy subjects or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients.

The reviewed studies were retrieved from multiple databases, following the procedures of the Cochrane Collaboration. Of the 205 documents obtained, 49 were selected for further analysis and 31 were considered eligible for inclusion. Furthermore, eight studies were included through manual search. The objectives, sample (age, percentage of male, type of sample), country of origin of the studies, language, design, instruments, and results and main conclusions were extracted from each study. Overall, the results reinforce the idea that psychopathic traits are associated with abnormalities in the way the brain processes environmental emotional information, and that the fundamental cognitive properties related to attention maintain or worsen these abnormalities. In some cases, changes in attention explain, by themselves, the abnormalities in emotional processing. Future studies using neurophysiological paradigms would be a great asset to help differentiate, at a neurocognitive level, the personality structures characterized by pronounced antisocial behavior, in order to improve the understanding of their heterogeneous etiologies.

J	Yang, Q; Paul, K; Pourtois, G				Yang, Qian; Paul, Katharina; Pourtois, Gilles			Defensive motivation increases conflict adaptation through local changes in cognitive control: Evidence from ERPs and mid-frontal theta	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Defensive motivation; Conflict processing; Cognitive control; N2; P3; Mid-frontal theta (MFT)	NEURAL MECHANISMS; NEGATIVE AFFECT; TIME-COURSE; INTEGRATION; ANXIETY; REWARD; COMPONENT; DYNAMICS; EMOTION; INDEXES	Cognitive control is highly dynamic, and liable to variations in the affective state of participants. Recently, we found that defensive motivation, elicited by means of loss-related feedback contingent on task performance, actually increased conflict adaptation at the behavioral level, and hence tightened cognitive control. However, it remains unclear at which stage during stimulus processing this facilitatory effect takes place, and what his electrophysiological manifestation may be. To address this question, in the current study, we compared conflict adaptation between two conditions that differed in the amount of defensive motivation, and recorded 64-channel electroencephalography concurrently. Results showed that conflict adaptation was larger at the behavioral level when defensive motivation was elicited. Interestingly, event-related brain potentials showed that this effect was captured by a systematic amplitude modulation of the conflict-related N2 component, suggesting that defensive motivation could alter conflict processing locally and at an early stage following stimulus onset. In comparison, mid-frontal theta (MFT) power was globally augmented when defensive motivation was elicited, but did not co-vary with conflict adaptation however. Taken together, these neurophysiological results suggest that defensive motivation can exert specific facilitatory effects on cognitive control (N2), which can be dissociated from a more global alteration in information processing that likely reflects unspecific control or even motivational changes (MFT).

J	Giller, F; Beste, C				Giller, Franziska; Beste, Christian			Effects of aging on sequential cognitive flexibility are associated with fronto-parietal processing deficits	BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION			English	Article						Aging; Cognitive flexibility; EEG; Inhibition; Response selection; Parietal cortex; Inferior frontal cortex	RESPONSE-INHIBITION; BACKWARD INHIBITION; ERP COMPONENTS; DECOMPOSITION; VARIABILITY; SYSTEM; MODULATION; MECHANISMS; RESOLUTION; ATTENTION	Albeit cognitive flexibility is well known to decline in aging, it has not been considered that this ability often requires sequential task control. That is, one may re-use tasks that have previously been abandoned in favor of another task. It is unclear whether sequential cognitive flexibility is affected in aging and what neurophysiological mechanisms and functional neuroanatomical structures are associated with these effects. We examined this question in a system neurophysiological study using EEG and source localization in healthy and elderly adults. We show that elderly people reveal deficient sequential cognitive flexibility. Elderly people encounter increased costs to overcome the inhibition of the lately abandoned task set that becomes relevant again and needs to be re-used. The neurophysiological (EEG) data show that differences in sequential cognitive flexibility between young and elderly people emerge as a consequence of two independent, dysfunctional processes: (i) the ability to suppress task-irrelevant information and (ii) the ability to re-implement a previously abandoned task set during response selection. These independent processes were associated with activation differences in inferior frontal and inferior parietal regions. The study reveals a new facet of cognitive flexibility dysfunctions in healthy elderlies.

Manipulating entitativity affects implicit behavioral and neural attentional biases toward gay couples	GROUP PROCESSES & INTERGROUP RELATIONS			English	Article						attentional bias; dot probe; EEG; entitativity; ERPs; homosexual	PERCEIVED ENTITATIVITY; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; OUTGROUP MEMBERS; RACE; PERCEPTION; INGROUP; ERP; THREAT; BRAIN; STEREOTYPES	This study investigated whether attentional bias toward homosexual couples differs as a function of the manipulation of perceived entitativity, the degree to which group members are perceived to share common values and pursue common goals. Across two experiments, heterosexual college students were randomly assigned to read statements that suggested that homosexual and heterosexual couples were either high or low in entitativity. Following this task, 199 participants completed a dot probe task in Experiment 1 and electroencephalogram (EEG) activity was recorded for 74 participants in Experiment 2 to measure the implicit attentional processing that resulted from viewing pictures of gay, lesbian, and straight couples. Results indicated that participants exposed to low entitativity statements directed less behavioral and neural attention toward gay relative to straight couples compared to those exposed to high entitativity statements. Given the apparent malleability of attentional biases, future research should strive to better understand the factors involved in reducing attentional bias, and by extension, discriminatory behaviors toward minority groups.

Yet, inhibitory control includes a multitude of entities (e.g. 'inhibition of interferences' and 'action inhibition'). Examining the interplay between these kinds of inhibitory control provides insights into the architecture of inhibitory control in ADHD. Combining a Simon task and a Go/Nogo task, we assessed the interplay of 'inhibition of interferences' and 'action inhibition'. This was combined with EEG recordings, EEG data decomposition and source localization. Simon interference effects in Go trials were larger in ADHD. At the neurophysiological level, this insufficient inhibition of interferences in ADHD related to the superior parietal cortex. Simon interference effects were absent in action inhibition (Nogo) trials in ADHD, compared to controls. This was supported by bayesian statistics. The power of effects was higher than 95%. The differential effects between the groups were associated with modulations of neurophysiological response selection processes in the superior frontal gyrus. ADHD is not only associated with deficits in inhibitory control. Rather, the organization and architecture of the inhibitory control system is different in ADHD. Distinguishable inhibitory control processes operate on a hierarchical 'first come, first serve' basis and are not integrated in ADHD. This is a new facet of ADHD.

ALD is known to appear as eight clinical types, which sometimes show transitional patterns; childhood cerebral, adolescent cerebral, adult cerebral, adrenomyeloneuropathy, Addison disease, brainstem-cerebellum, female symptomatic, and asymptomatic male types. Accordingly, the early diagnosis and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation treatment of ALD are indispensable, especially for patients with the childhood/adolescent cerebral types because of the devastating nature of their disease. The evaluation and monitoring of the disease onset, the severity and speed of the disease progression, and the nervous system involvement of the disease are necessary for the treatment of symptomatic and preclinical asymptomatic ALD patients. Neurophysiological and neuropsychological procedures are the best methods for this purpose, and the procedures should be noninvasive and performed successively. Electroencephalography, the evaluation of evoked potentials (the auditory brainstem response, visual evoked response and somatosensory evoked response), and event related potentials, and the combination of these tests are informative neurophysiological examinations. The use of the Wechsler Intelligence scale tests for each age range is essential to evaluate and follow ALD patients. The location of the main lesions of ALD with focal and diffuse permeation which cause a variety of concerned focal and diffuse symptoms must also be determined. Appropriate neuropsychological tests to evaluate visual, auditory, language and behavioral functions are also essential.

The neural tides of sleep and consciousness revealed by single-pulse electrical brain stimulation	SLEEP			English	Article						brain waves; human electrocorticography; high-gamma activity; effective connectivity; causal interactions	CORTICOCORTICAL EVOKED-POTENTIALS; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EVENT-RELATED CAUSALITY; EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; IN-VIVO; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; EXCITABILITY; PROPAGATION	Wakefulness and sleep arise from global changes in brain physiology that may also govern the flow of neural activity between cortical regions responsible for perceptual processing versus planning and action. To test whether and how the sleep/wake cycle affects the overall propagation of neural activity in large-scale brain networks, we applied single-pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) in patients implanted with intracranial EEG electrodes for epilepsy surgery. SPES elicited cortico-cortical spectral responses at high-gamma frequencies (CCSRHG, 80-150 Hz), which indexes changes in neuronal population firing rates. Using event-related causality (ERC) analysis, we found that the overall patterns of neural propagation among sites with CCSRHG were different during wakefulness and different sleep stages. For example, stimulation of frontal lobe elicited greater propagation toward parietal lobe during slow-wave sleep than during wakefulness. During REM sleep, we observed a decrease in propagation within frontal lobe, and an increase in propagation within parietal lobe, elicited by frontal and parietal stimulation, respectively. These biases in the directionality of large-scale cortical network dynamics during REM sleep could potentially account for some of the unique experiential aspects of this sleep stage. Together these findings suggest that the regulation of conscious awareness and sleep is associated with differences in the balance of neural propagation across large-scale frontal-parietal networks.

Past research demonstrated disrupted prediction capabilities during sleep in the context of novel, arbitrary auditory sequences, but the availability of overlearned knowledge already stored in long-term memory could still be preserved. We tested the sleeping brain capabilities to detect violations of simple arithmetic facts. Sleeping participants were presented with spoken arithmetic facts such as two plus two is nine and brain responses to correct or incorrect results were recorded in electro and magneto-encephalography. Sleep responses were compared to both attentive and inattentive wakefulness. During attentive wakefulness, arithmetic violations elicited a succession of N400 and P600 effects, whereas no such activations could be recorded in sleep or in inattentive wakefulness. Still, small but significant effects remained in sleep, advocating for a preserved but partial accessibility to arithmetic facts stored in long-term memory and preserved predictions of low-level and already learned knowledge. Those effects were very different from residual activities seen in inattention, highlighting the differences of information processing between the sleeping and the inattentive brain.

Like all methods, they have methodological, analytical, and interpretational limitations; however, the potential gains from using these techniques are far more considerable. We have therefore assembled a succinct yet authoritative collection of articles on the topic of neuroscience in organizational research, to serve as a solid introduction to the methods of neuroscience and what they can accomplish. The special topic is organized into two parts. The first includes a set of accessible reviews of the palette of brain imaging, mapping, and stimulation techniques (fMRI, fNIRS, EEG, MEG, and NIBS) as well as examples of the application of neuroscience methods to various disciplines including economics, marketing, finance, organizational behavior, neuroethology, as well an integrative translational critique on a variety of applications. The second is a collection of articles resulting from a competitive call for submissions that cover various neuroscience topics but also address important methodological and philosophical issues. The articles lay out a roadmap for the effective integration of neuroscientific methods into organizational research.

Catecholamine Modulation of Evidence Accumulation during Perceptual Decision Formation: A Randomized Trial	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; METHYLPHENIDATE; NOREPINEPHRINE; INCREASES; ONSET; ATOMOXETINE; CLONIDINE; CHILDREN; REFLECT	Recent behavioral modeling and pupillometry studies suggest that neuromodulatory arousal systems play a role in regulating decision formation but neurophysiological support for these observations is lacking. We employed a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover design to probe the impact of pharmacological enhancement of catecholamine levels on perceptual decision-making. Catecholamine levels were manipulated using the clinically relevant drugs methylphenidate and atomoxetine, and their effects were compared with those of citalopram and placebo. Participants performed a classic EEG oddball paradigm that elicits the P3b, a centro-parietal potential that has been shown to trace evidence accumulation, under each of the four drug conditions. We found that methylphenidate and atomoxetine administration shortened RTs to the oddball targets. The neural basis of this behavioral effect was an earlier P3b peak latency, driven specifically by an increase in its buildup rate without any change in its time of onset or peak amplitude. This study provides neurophysiological evidence for the catecholaminergic enhancement of a discrete aspect of human decision-making, that is, evidence accumulation. Our results also support theoretical accounts suggesting that catecholamines may enhance cognition via increases in neural gain.

In this study, participants were recruited based on high (HPG; N = 23, 12 males) or low (LPG; N = 23, 12 males) scores on performance goal orientation (PGO). They were asked to work on two tasks: a highly difficult task (Session 1, which induces competence frustration) and another moderately difficult task (Session 2, which provides the opportunity for competence restoration). Electroencephalography was recorded during the tasks to measure reward positivity (RewP). In Session 2, a more pronounced RewP in the win-lose difference wave was observed in the LPG group compared with the HPG group, suggesting that performance-oriented individuals have lower autonomous motivation to win in the task that would help restore their competence. Thus, results of this study suggested that HPG might impede competence restoration and undermine one's autonomous motivation in another irrelevant task following competence frustration.

Target-related parietal P3 and medial frontal theta index the genetic risk for problematic substance use	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						endophenotype; problematic substance use; P3; reaction time variability; theta	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EVENT-RELATED OSCILLATIONS; REACTION-TIME VARIABILITY; EXTERNALIZING PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; BEHAVIORAL DISINHIBITION; POTENTIAL AMPLITUDE; ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR; LIFETIME PREVALENCE; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY ANALYSIS	Theoretical and empirical work suggests that problematic substance use (PSU) is associated with individual differences in prefrontal cortex activity. While research has strongly linked parietal P3 amplitude reduction (P3AR) to genetic risk for problematic substance use, few studies have tested whether prefrontal EEG measures are sensitive to this genetic liability. In addition to P3, oddball target detection tasks elicit medial frontal theta power, reflecting attentional allocation, and parietal delta, indexing decision making or stimulus-response link updating. Midfrontal theta and parietal delta may index neurocognitive processes relevant to PSU beyond P3AR. The present investigation examined the etiological relationship between PSU and P3, frontal theta, and parietal delta in a large twin sample (N = 754). EEG was recorded during a visual oddball task. Greater PSU was associated with reduced target P3 amplitude and midfrontal theta/parietal delta power, and increased mean reaction time and reaction time variability (RTV; indexing attentional fluctuations). P3, theta, and RTV, but not delta or mean RT, explained unique variance in PSU (R-2 = 0.04). Twin biometric modeling indicated a genetic relationship between PSU and P3, theta, and RTV. Theta accounted for distinct genetic variance in PSU beyond P3 and RTV. Together, 23% of the total additive genetic variance in PSU was explained by the three endophenotypes. Results replicate P3AR as an endophenotype and provide support for additional behavioral (RTV) and neurophysiological (midfrontal theta) endophenotypes of PSU. Reduced theta and greater RTV may reflect variations in a prefrontal attentional network that confers genetic risk for substance use problems.

Angry Drivers Take Risky Decisions: Evidence from Neurophysiological Assessment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						anger; driver; event-related potentials; risk sensitivity; decision-making	DRIVING PERFORMANCE; SENSATION SEEKING; REWARD MAGNITUDE; ANGER; AGGRESSION; EMOTION; FEEDBACK; BEHAVIOR; FEAR; POTENTIALS	The present study investigated the risk-taking behaviors of angry drivers, which were coincidentally measured via behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. We manipulated a driving scenario that concerned a Go/No-Go decision at an intersection when the controlling traffic light was in its yellow phase. This protocol was based upon the underlying format of the Iowa gambling task. Variation in the anger level was induced through task frustration. The data of twenty-four drivers were analyzed via behavioral and neural recordings, and P300 was specifically extracted from EEG traces. In addition, the behavioral performance was indexed by the percentage of high-risk choices minus the number of the low-risk choices taken, which identified the risk-taking propensity. Results confirmed a significant main effect of anger on the decisions taken. The risk-taking propensity decreased across the sequence of trial blocks in baseline assessments. However, with anger, the risk-taking propensity increased across the trial regimen. Drivers in anger state also showed a higher mean amplitude of P300 than that in baseline state. Additionally, high-risk choices evoked larger P300 amplitude than low-risk choices during the anger state. Moreover, the P300 amplitude of high-risk choices was significantly larger in the anger state than the baseline state. The negative feedback induced larger P300 amplitude than that recorded in positive feedback trials. The results corroborated that the drivers exhibited higher risk-taking propensity when angry although they were sensitive to the inherent risk-reward evaluations within the scenario. To reduce this type of risk-taking, we proposed some effective/affective intervention methods.

Methods: The electroencephalography activity of 33 children (mean age in final sample: TS (n=10)=10.5 +/- 2.3; control (n = 10) = 10.1 +/- 2.9) was recorded during a visual task consisting of four emotional face cues (anger, happiness, neutral and sadness) followed by a target in congruent or in congruent position with emotional cue. The participants were asked to indicate the target location. Results: The TS patients showed a shorter latency of the P1 and N170 only for anger cues compared to controls. In addition, sLORETA results showed an increased activation in the left occipital area and a decreased activation in the left amygdala, temporal and cingulate for anger cues in TS patients. Coherently, TS patients showed a lower accuracy of response only with anger cue and severity of tics resulted correlated with the event-related potentials data and behavioural responses linked to anger cue. Conclusions: These results suggest that children with TS process emotions (in particular the anger) differently from the controls, and that its regulation seems to have an important role in the cognitive and motor deficits in TS.

Brain Activity During Unilateral Physical and Imagined Isometric Contractions	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						imagery; EEG; isometric; prefrontal cortex; sensorimotor cortex	CROSS-EDUCATION; MOTOR IMAGERY; MENTAL PRACTICE; STRENGTH; MUSCLE; EEG; VOLUNTARY; ACTIVATION; EXERCISE; POWER	By convention, it is believed that the ipsilateral side of the body is controlled by the contralateral side of the brain. Past studies measuring brain activity primarily recorded changes before and after an intervention is performed on one side of the body within one hemisphere (usually the contralateral) of the brain. The purpose of this investigation was to observe the brain activity within the left and right hemispheres of the prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices during physical and imagined, dominant and non-dominant unilateral isometric elbow flexion. Fifteen right hand dominant individuals (six males and nine females) between the ages of 18 and 21 performed four different isometric contractions of their biceps brachii at a preacher curl bench: dominant physical contraction (DomCon), non-dominant physical contraction (NonCon), dominant imagined contraction (DomImagine), and non-dominant imagined contraction (NonImagine). Each contraction was sustained for 5 s followed by 30 s of rest. Motor activity-related cortical potential (MRCP) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) within the right and left hemispheres of the sensorimotor and prefrontal cortices were determined for each condition at 500-1,000 ms and 2,000-2,500 ms after initiation of contraction. MRCP and ERSP were both changed at the 500-1,000 ms time window for all conditions. Changes in the 2,000-2,500 ms window were most consistently observed during physical contractions. While the changes during DomCon occurred in the left (contralateral) side of the brain, the greatest changes observed in MRCP and ERSP occurred in both sides of the brain during the NonCon condition. Further understanding of bilateral changes in brain activity during unilateral tasks is valuable for improving rehabilitation practices through mental and physical exercise.

Cerebral cortical networking for mental workload assessment under various demands during dual-task walking	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Mental workload; EEG functional connectivity; Dual-task walking; Theta networking; Alpha connectivity	RIGHT TEMPOROPARIETAL JUNCTION; CENTRAL EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; BRAIN ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; CORTICOCORTICAL COMMUNICATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; TRANSFEMORAL AMPUTATION; PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; ATTENTIONAL CONTROL; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; VOLUME-CONDUCTION	While several studies have examined attentional reserve (via event-related potentials) and mental effort (via EEG spectral content) from various cortical regions during dual-task walking, none have assessed changes in the magnitude of interregional (cortico-cortical) communication as a measure of mental workload. Therefore, by deploying a traditional montage of electrode sites centered over the motor planning region as well as a more comprehensive graph theory-based approach encompassing the entire scalp, this study aimed to systematically examine changes in the magnitude of functional connectivity underlying cortico-cortical communication to assess changes in mental workload under various levels of challenge. Specifically, the Weighted Phase Lag Index (WPLI) was computed to assess the changes in magnitude of functional connectivity as participants performed a cognitive task under two demands (low and high) and two conditions (seated and walking). The results revealed enhanced fronto-centro-temporo-parietal theta connectivity during dual-task walking relative to being seated as well as a reduced inhibition of fronto-centro-temporo-parieto-occipital alpha networking as the demand on the secondary cognitive task increased. Collectively, these findings may reflect greater recruitment of task relevant processes to respond to increased cognitive-motor demands and thus an elevation of mental workload in an effort to maintain performance under varying levels of challenge. This work has the potential to inform future mental workload assessment applications in patient populations, including those who employ prostheses during cognitive-motor performance under various taskdemands.

Despite our increasing understanding of the neural correlates of dreaming, we know little about the neural correlates of dream affect. Frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) is considered a marker of affective states and traits as well as affect regulation in the waking state. Here, we explored whether FAA during REM sleep and during evening resting wakefulness is related to affective experiences in REM sleep dreams. EEG recordings were obtained from 17humanparticipants (7men) whospent 2 nights in the sleep laboratory. Participants were awakened 5minafter the onset of everyREMstage after which they provided a dream report and rated their dream affect. Two-minute preawakening EEG segments were analyzed. Additionally, 8 min of evening presleep and morning postsleep EEG were recorded during resting wakefulness. Mean spectral power in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) and correspondingFAAwere calculated over the frontal (F4-F3) sites. Results showed thatFAAduring REM sleep, and during evening resting wakefulness, predicted ratings of dream anger. This suggests that individuals with greater alpha power in the right frontal hemisphere may be less able to regulate (i. e., inhibit) strong affective states, such as anger, in dreams. Additionally, FAA was positively correlated across wakefulness and REM sleep. Together, these findings imply that FAA may serve as a neural correlate of affect regulation not only in the waking but also in the dreaming state.

However, few studies have investigated the influence of aggressive traits (i.e., aggressiveness) on cognitive control. In the current study, we investigated the effects of aggressiveness on cognitive control abilities and particularly, on performance monitoring. Thirty-two participants performed a Simon task while electro-encephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) were recorded. Participants were classified as having high and low levels of aggressiveness using the BPAQ questionnaire (Buss and Perry, 1992). EMG recordings were used to reveal three response types by uncovering small incorrect muscular activations in similar to 15% of correct trials (i.e., partial-errors) that must be distinguished from full-error and pure-correct responses. For these three response types, EEG recordings were used to extract fronto-central negativities indicative of performance monitoring, the error and correct (-related) negativities (ERN/Ne and CRN/Nc). Behavioral results indicated that the high aggressiveness group had a larger congruency effect compared to the low aggressiveness group, but there were no differences in accuracy. EEG results revealed a global reduction in performance-related negativity amplitudes in all the response types in the high aggressiveness group compared to the low aggressiveness group. Interestingly, the distinction between the ERN/Ne and the CRN/Nc components was preserved both in high and low aggressiveness groups. In sum, high aggressive traits do not affect the capacity to self-evaluate erroneous from correct actions but are associated with a decrease in the importance given to one's own performance. The implication of these findings are discussed in relation to pathological aggressiveness.

Oscillatory neural networks underlying resting state, attentional control and social cognition task conditions in children with ASD, ADHD and ASD-ADHD	CORTEX			English	Article						Autism spectrum disorder (ASD); Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); Comorbidity; Functional neural networks; EEG	RANGE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES; FRONTAL-CORTEX; EEG COHERENCE; PREVALENCE; DEFICITS; FACES; DESYNCHRONIZATION	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are common and impairing neurodevelopmental disorders that frequently co-occur. The neurobiological mechanisms involved in ASD and ADHD are not fully understood. However, alterations in large-scale neural networks have been proposed as core deficits in both ASD and ADHD and may help to disentangle the neurobiological basis of these disorders and their co-occurrence. In this study, we examined similarities and differences in large-scale oscillatory neural networks between boys aged 8-13 years with ASD (n = 19), ADHD (n = 18), ASD + ADHD (n = 29) and typical development (Controls, n = 26). Oscillatory neural networks were computed using graph-theoretical methods from electroencephalographic (EEG) data collected during an eyes-open resting-state and attentional control and social cognition tasks in which we previously reported disorder-specific atypicalities in oscillatory power and event-related potentials (ERPs). We found that children with ASD showed significant hypoconnectivity in large-scale networks during all three task conditions compared to children without ASD. In contrast, children with ADHD showed significant hyperconnectivity in large-scale networks during the attentional control and social cognition tasks, but not during the resting-state, compared to children without ADHD. Children with co-occurring ASD + ADHD did not differ from children with ASD when paired with this group and vice versa when paired with the ADHD group, indicating that these children showed both ASD-like hypoconnectivity and ADHD-like hyperconnectivity. Our findings suggest that ASD and ADHD are associated with distinct alterations in large-scale oscillatory networks, and these atypicalities present together in children with both disorders. These alterations appear to be task-independent in ASD but task-related in ADHD, and may underlie other neurocognitive atypicalities in these disorders. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Visual and kinesthetic modes affect motor imagery classification in untrained subjects	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; HAND MOVEMENTS; MENTAL-IMAGERY; CORTEX; EEG; REAL; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; EXECUTION	The understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms responsible for motor imagery (MI) is essential for the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and bioprosthetics. Our magnetoencephalographic (MEG) experiments with voluntary participants confirm the existence of two types of motor imagery, kinesthetic imagery (KI) and visual imagery (VI), distinguished by activation and inhibition of different brain areas in motor-related alpha- and beta-frequency regions. Although the brain activity corresponding to MI is usually observed in specially trained subjects or athletes, we show that it is also possible to identify particular features of MI in untrained subjects. Similar to real movement, KI implies muscular sensation when performing an imaginary moving action that leads to event-related desynchronization (ERD) of motor-associated brain rhythms. By contrast, VI refers to visualization of the corresponding action that results in event-related synchronization (ERS) of alpha- and beta-wave activity. A notable difference between KI and VI groups occurs in the frontal brain area. In particular, the analysis of evoked responses shows that in all KI subjects the activity in the frontal cortex is suppressed during MI, while in the VI subjects the frontal cortex is always active. The accuracy in classification of left-arm and right-arm MI using artificial intelligence is similar for KI and VI. Since untrained subjects usually demonstrate the VI imagery mode, the possibility to increase the accuracy for VI is in demand for BCIs. The application of artificial neural networks allows us to classify MI in raising right and left arms with average accuracy of 70% for both KI and VI using appropriate filtration of input signals. The same average accuracy is achieved by optimizing MEG channels and reducing their number to only 13.

EEG spectra and event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to construct an individual neurofeedback protocol and to provide objective monitoring of treatment efficacy. Case study: The patient, a 34-year-old female, was diagnosed with a sphenoid wing meningioma (SOM), which had been successfully operated. Three years later, however, the SOM had overgrown at the optic foramen and extended into the optic canal, and the patient had developed blurred vision. She was repeatedly operated, and recovered well. However, due to the recurrence she developed flashbacks, anxiety and sleep difficulties, such that she was unable to continue working in her profession. The symptoms had been occurring for 4 months. ERPs in a cued NOGO task, along with EEG spectra in the resting state and during task performance were used to assess brain functioning, providing the basis for a neurofeedback protocol. Twenty sessions of individually tailored neurofeedback were performed. The patient experienced a reduction of symptoms, accompanied by normalization of ERPs parameters. Conclusions: The results obtained in this case point to the possible benefits of individually tailored neurofeedback protocols in the treatment of PTSD.

Yet, little longitudinal research has examined ERPs sensitive to emotion across development. We aimed to systematically identify timing and spatial distributions of ERPs sensitive to emotion in a longitudinal sample of youth (N = 62) using principal component analysis (PCA) and evaluate stability and change in emotional responses across development. Participants completed an emotional interrupt paradigm in childhood (M-age = 9.38, SD = 0.42), early adolescence (M-age = 13.03, SD = 0.24), and midadolescence (M-age = 15.16, SD = 0.17). ERPs were recorded to unpleasant, pleasant, and neutral images. Participants were instructed to respond to a target while viewing images. Two components sensitive to emotion emerged across development: P300/early late positive potential (LPP) and late LPP. The P300/early LPP component was characterized by an enhanced positivity for unpleasant compared to pleasant and neutral images. The late LPP was enhanced for both unpleasant and pleasant compared to neutral images, and more positive for unpleasant compared to pleasant images. The components showed moderate to strong stability. Overall LPP magnitude decreased from childhood into adolescence. There was a developmental shift in distributions from occipital sites in childhood to centroparietal sites in midadolescence. Results support use of PCA to inform scoring windows and electrode selection. The shift in distribution may reflect developmental focalization in underlying neural circuitry. Future work is needed using multimodal approaches to further understand the relationship between ERPs and changes in neural circuitry across development.

An optimal balance between challenges and skills triggers the subjective experience of "flow," a focused motivation leading to a feeling of spontaneous joy. The present research investigates the behavioral and neural correlates of a paradigm aimed to assess the players' subjective experience during gameplay. Attentional engagement changes were assessed first at the behavioral level and in a second stage by means of EEG recordings. An auditory novelty oddball paradigm was implemented as a secondary task while subjects played in three conditions: boredom, frustration, and flow. We found higher reaction times and error rates in the flow condition. In a second stage, EEG time domain analysis revealed a significantly delayed response-locked frontocentral negative deflection during flow, likely signaling the reallocation of attentional resources. Source reconstruction analyses showed that the brain regions responsible for the genesis of this negativity were located within the medial frontal cortex. Frequency domain analyses showed a significant power increase only in the alpha band for the flow condition. Our results showed that this alpha power enhancement was correlated with faster reaction times. This suggests that frontal alpha changes recorded as maximal at the midfrontal lines during flow might be related to inhibitory top-down cognitive control processes.

Previous behavioral studies have shown different IFOR-IFOR (II) and EFOR-IFOR (EI) conflict effects and an effect of their interaction. However, the neural mechanism of conflict processing between two FOR-based conflicts is unclear. In the current ERP study, two FOR-based conflicts were manipulated using a two-cannon task to elucidate common and distinct brain mechanisms that underlie FOR-based conflict processing. The behavioral results showed that both conflicts exhibited longer reaction times and larger error rates in the II (180 degrees cannon angle) and EI (target cannon pointed down) incongruent conditions than in the II (0 degrees cannon angle) and EI (target cannon pointed up) congruent conditions and that an interaction existed between the two conflicts. The ERP results indicated that, for both conflicts, more negative N2 amplitudes and less positive P3 amplitudes occurred in the incongruent conditions than in the congruent conditions, and the interactions between the two conflicts during later P3 amplitudes were significant. Time-frequency analysis further indicated that, in the early time window, the II conflict and the EI conflict specifically modulated power in the theta bands and beta bands, respectively. In contrast, in the later time window, both conflicts modulated power in the alpha and beta bands. In summary, our findings provide insights into the potential existence of two specific early conflict monitoring systems and a general late executive control system for FOR-based conflicts.

The theta/beta ratio was previously hypothesised to be an index of arousal, but a number of studies failed to find any association between the ratio and indices of arousal, instead proposing that the theta/beta ratio may actually be indicative of cognitive processing. This hypothesis was tested by Clarke et al using a sample of healthy adults, with results indicating that the theta/beta ratio correlated with a marker of cognitive processing (P300 latency in an auditory oddball task), while P300 amplitude correlated with an arousal marker (alpha power). The aim of this study was to test whether similar results could be found in a sample of 41 adults with the combined type of ADHD. EEGs were recorded during an eyes-closed resting condition and an auditory oddball task. Results demonstrated that the theta/beta ratio correlated significantly with P300 latency. Absolute alpha power did not correlate significantly with P300 amplitude or P300 latency. These results support the hypotheses that the theta/beta ratio is a marker of cognitive processing capacity in both the general population and in participants with ADHD, and that the alpha/arousal linkage is anomalous in ADHD.

When voluntary attention is focused by purely internal decision processes (will), rather than instructions via external cues, we call this willed attention. In prior work, we reported ERP and fMRI correlates of willed spatial attention in trial-by-trial cuing tasks. Here we further investigated the oscillatory mechanisms of willed attention by contrasting the event-related EEG spectrogram between instructional and choice cues. Two experiments were conducted at 2 different sites using the same visuospatial attention paradigm. Consistent between the 2 experiments, we found increases in frontal theta power (starting at 500 ms post cue) for willed attention relative to instructed attention. This frontal theta increase was accompanied by increased frontal-parietal theta-band coherence and bidirectional Granger causality. Additionally, the onset of attention-related posterior alpha power lateralization was delayed in willed attention relative to instructed attention, and the amount of delay was related to the timing of frontal theta increase. These results, replicated across 2 experiments, suggest that theta oscillations are the neuronal signals indexing decision-making in the frontal cortex, and mediating reciprocal communications between the frontal executive and parietal attentional control regions during willed attention.

However, its mechanisms of action remain only partially understood. Objective: In this study we assess the cognitive and physiological effects of anodal tDCS to the DLPFC on executive function in order to understand (1) the role of DLPFC laterality, (2) the physiological dynamics sustaining the modulation of executive function by tDCS, and (3) the impact of state-dependent dynamics. Methods: In a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, we applied anodal tDCS targeting the left vs. right DLPFC vs. sham in 20 healthy individuals (10 males, 10 females). Immediately before and after tDCS, subjects performed the Flanker Task while we measured behavioral (reaction time and accuracy) and neurophysiological (ERP) responses. Specifically, the amplitude of N200, P300, ERN and Pe is compared before and after stimulation. Results: Anodal tDCS to the left DLPFC lead to a significant improvement in reaction time, an increase in P300 amplitude and a decrease in N200 amplitude in a state-dependent manner: baseline ERP amplitudes conditioned the effects of tDCS. Conclusion: Given the role of these ERPs in conflict-related tasks, we speculate that tDCS is modulating the subconstructs of selective attention, conflict monitoring and response inhibition.

Objective: We explored the cortical physiology of SICI and mSI in healthy subjects by TMS-evoked cortical potentials (TEPs). Methods: Single (sp) and paired-pulse (pp) TMS were delivered on the ADM muscle cortical hotspot while recording EEG and EMG. Three conditions were tested: spTMS and ppTMS at rest, and spTMS at the onset of an index finger movement. SICI and mSI were calculated on the ADM motor evoked potential (MEP) and two groups were defined based on the presence of mSI. Average TEPs were calculated for each condition and for five regions of interest. Results: At movement onset we observed a widespread reduction of the inhibitory late component N100 suggesting cortical facilitation associated with motor performance. At motor cortex level, SICI and mSI are associated with similar modulation of TEPs consisting in a reduction of P30 and an increase of N45 amplitude. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that SICI and mSI modulate cortical excitability with shared inhibitory mechanisms.

The neuromodulatory and hormonal effects of transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation as evidenced by salivary alpha amylase, salivary cortisol, pupil diameter, and the P3 event-related potential	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation; Norepinephrine; Alpha amylase; Cortisol; EEG; P3	ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; NOREPINEPHRINE SYSTEM; INHIBITORY CONTROL; LOCUS-COERULEUS; MODULATION; STRESS; COMPONENTS; CLONIDINE; FLOW	Background: Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) is a new, non-invasive technique being investigated as an intervention for a variety of clinical disorders, including epilepsy and depression. It is thought to exert its therapeutic effect by increasing central norepinephrine (NE) activity, but the evidence supporting this notion is limited. Objective: In order to test for an impact of tVNS on psychophysiological and hormonal indices of noradrenergic function, we applied tVNS in concert with assessment of salivary alpha amylase (SAA) and cortisol, pupil size, and electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings. Methods: Across three experiments, we applied real and sham tVNS to 61 healthy participants while they performed a set of simple stimulus-discrimination tasks. Before and after the task, as well as during one break, participants provided saliva samples and had their pupil size recorded. EEG was recorded throughout the task. The target for tVNS was the cymba conchae, which is heavily innervated by the auricular branch of the vagus nerve. Sham stimulation was applied to the ear lobe. Results: P3 amplitude was not affected by tVNS (Experiment 1A: N = 24; Experiment 1B: N = 20; Bayes factor supporting null model = 4.53), nor was pupil size (Experiment 2: N = 16; interaction of treatment and time: p = .79). However, tVNS increased SAA (Experiments 1A and 2: N = 25) and attenuated the decline of salivary cortisol compared to sham (Experiment 2: N = 17), as indicated by significant interactions involving treatment and time (p = .023 and p = .040, respectively). Conclusion: These findings suggest that tVNS modulates hormonal indices but not psychophysiological indices of noradrenergic function. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Warren, C.

Carriers of the deletion have a markedly increased risk for neurodevelopmental brain disorders, including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The high risk of psychiatric disorders associated with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome offers a unique possibility to identify the functional abnormalities that precede the emergence of psychosis. Carriers of a 22q11.2 deletion show a broad range of sensory processing and cognitive abnormalities similar as in schizophrenia, such as auditory and visual sensory processing, response inhibition, working memory, social cognition, reward processing and arithmetic processing. All these processes have a significant negative impact on daily life if impaired and have been studied extensively in schizophrenia using task-based functional neuroimaging. Here, we review task-related functional brain mapping studies that have used electroencephalography or functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify functional alterations in carriers with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome within the above mentioned cognitive and sensory domains. We discuss how the identification of functional changes at the brain system level can advance the general understanding of which neurobiological alterations set the frame for the emergence of neurodevelopmental disorders in the human brain. The task-based functional neuroimaging literature shows conflicting results in many domains. Nevertheless, consistent similarities between 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and schizophrenia have been found for sensory processing, social cognition and working memory. We discuss these functional brain alterations in terms of potential biomarkers of increased risk for psychosis in the general population.

In this paper, we present a shoulder surfing resistant means of entering a graphical password by measuring brain activity. The password is a subset of images displayed repeatedly by rapid serial visual presentation. The occurrence of a password image entails an event-related potential in the electroencephalogram, the P300 response. The P300 response is used to classify whether an image belongs to the password subset or not. We compare individual classifiers, trained with samples of a specific user, to general P300 classifiers, trained over all subjects. We evaluate the permanence of the classification results in three subsequent experiment sessions. The classification score significantly increases from the first to the third session. Comparing the use of natural photos or simple objects as stimuli shows no significant difference. In total, our authentication scheme achieves an equal error rate of about 10%. In the future, with increasing accuracy and proliferation, brain-computer interfaces could find practical application in alternative authentication methods.

The source localisation was computed for each participant. The activity of brodmann areas (BAs) involved in the brain cortical activity of each participant was measured. Then the mean electric charge flowing through particular areas was calculated. The five different machine learning tools (logistic regression, boosted decision tree, Bayes point machine, classic neural network and averaged perceptron classifier) from the Azure ecosystem were trained, and their accuracy was tested in the task of distinguishing standard and target responses in the experiment. The efficiency of each tool was compared, and it was found out that the best tool was logistic regression and the boosted decision tree in our task. Such an approach can be useful in eliminating somatosensory responses in experimental psychology or even in establishing new communication protocols with mildly mentally disabled subjects.

In contrast to previous methods that only allow for the assessment of a few phonetic contrasts, we present a new method that allows us to assess changes in spectral sensitivity across the entire vowel space and create two-dimensional perceptual maps of the infants' vowel development. Infants aged four to eleven months were played long series of concatenated vowels, and the neural response to each vowel change was assessed using the Acoustic Change Complex (ACC) from EEG recordings. The results demonstrated that the youngest infants' responses more closely reflected the acoustic differences between the vowel pairs and reflected higher weight to first-formant variation. Older infants had less acoustically driven responses that seemed a result of selective increases in sensitivity for phonetically similar vowels. The results suggest that phonetic development may involve a perceptual warping for confusable vowels rather than uniform learning, as well as an overall increasing sensitivity to higher-frequency acoustic information.

EEG/ ERP technology was used to carry out experiments and some alarm information designs of a real-time monitoring software system were used as an example to compare the cognitive differences caused by the combination of visual and audio channels' combination. Through the quantitative analysis of indicators such as reaction time, brain wave peak value, and latency, the interface information design and evaluation methods for visual-audio dual channels were developed.

Previous studies uncovered the inefficiency of the dyslexic brain to follow different amplitude modulations in speech. However, it remains to be investigated how the envelope's rise time mediates this neural processing. In this study we examined neural synchronization in students with and without dyslexia using auditory steady-state responses at theta, alpha, beta and low-gamma range oscillations (i.e., 4, 10, 20 and 40 Hz) to stimuli with different envelope rise times. Our results revealed reduced neural synchronization in the alpha, beta and low-gamma frequency ranges in dyslexia. Moreover, atypical neural synchronization was modulated by rise time for alpha and beta oscillations, showing that deficits found at 10 and 20 Hz were only evident when the envelope's rise time was significantly shortened. This impaired tracking of rise time cues may very well lead to the speech and phonological processing difficulties observed in dyslexia. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Method Patients (41 males, 29 females; mean age at implantation 2y 11mo [SD 7.5mo], range 1y 8mo-5y) were divided into the following groups according to preoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging evaluation: mild WML, moderate WML, severe WML, and control. We assessed auditory and speech performance at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months pCI. As well as auditory event-related potentials, topographic maps and electroencephalography source imaging were recorded and analysed at 24 months pCI. Results For children with WML (any level), postoperative auditory or speech performance at 6 months was significantly below that of control participants. After stratification, auditory and speech performance was highly related to WML grading. Auditory or speech performance in mild WML or control groups was comparatively better than the moderate WML and severe WML groups. The recovery rate of speech performance fell behind that of the auditory perception. With the increasing severity of WML, N1 amplitude was significantly smaller with a consistent presentation in the topographic map, which was similar in the mild WML and control group. The dominant auditory centre was activated in the control or mild WML groups, but not in the moderate WML and severe WML groups. Interpretation WML gradually affect auditory and speech development, and electrophysiological performance pCI in prelingually deaf children.

Models developed for adult patients stress a biased processing of food-related stimuli as an important maintaining factor. To our knowledge, however, no EEG study to date investigated the processing of visual food stimuli in children or adolescents with LOC. Adolescents with at least one self-reported episode of LOC in the last four weeks and a matched control group completed a modified Go/NoGo task, with a numerical target or non-target stimulus being presented on one side of the screen and an irrelevant high-calorie food or neutral stimulus being presented on the opposite side. Mean P3 amplitudes were analyzed. In Go trials, the LOC group's mean P3 amplitudes were comparable irrespective of distractor category, while for NoGo trials, mean P3 amplitudes were significantly higher when the distractor was a high-calorie food stimulus. This pattern was reversed in the control group. Results are interpreted in light of Gray's reinforcement sensitivity theory. They might reflect altered processes of behavioral inhibition in adolescents with LOC upon confrontation with visual food stimuli.

However, although the effect of cross-modal interactions for smell have been well investigated, little attention has been paid to the facilitation expressed by haptic interactions with a manipulation of the odorous object's shape. The aim of this research is to investigate whether there is a cortical modulation in a visual recognition task if the stimulus is processed through an odorous cross-modal pathway or by haptic manipulation, and how these interactions may have an influence on early visual-recognition patterns. Ten healthy non-smoking subjects (25 years +/- 5 years) were trained to have a haptic manipulation of 3-D models and olfactory stimulation. Subsequently, a visual recognition task was performed during an electroencephalography recording to investigate the P3 Event Related Potentials components. The subjects had to respond on the keyboard according to their subjective predominant recognition (olfactory or haptic). The effects of haptic and olfactory condition were assessed via linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) of the lme4 package. This model allows for the variance related to random factors to be controlled without any data aggregation. The main results highlighted that P3 increased in the olfactory cross-modal condition, with a significant two-way interaction between odor and left-sided lateralization. Furthermore, our results could be interpreted according to ventral and dorsal pathways as favorite ways to olfactory crossmodal perception.

One of the main candidate as the cortical source of this ERP component is the inferior intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Moreover, previous neuroimaging studies put forth evidence for the presence of a distributed VWM network involving also prefrontal areas and in particular the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Nonetheless, the understanding of the functional role of ACC is still debated. We recorded the high-density EEG in 20 healthy participants undergoing a VWM and a control task. Explorative cluster-based permutation statistics confirmed the posterior memory load dependent CDA modulation, but also identified an additional anterior cluster of electrodes whose amplitude was modulated by memory load. The source reconstruction revealed a memory load dependent activation in the IPS but also in the ACC, suggesting that these two areas might be nodes of a fronto-parietal circuit underlying VWM maintenance. Crucially, parietal and prefrontal areas showed a temporal dissociation, since IPS was more engaged in the early phase of visual information storage while the ACC was more active during the late phase. This pattern suggests a functional dissociation between the parietal cortex, which is involved in encoding and storage of information, and prefrontal areas, subserving cognitive control processes, including the boosting and protection of information from decay. Remarkably, the connection strength between IPS and ACC predicted the individual number of items held in memory. These findings are discussed within the theoretical account of a neural distributed model of VWM. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This synchronicity is also the main underlying mechanism for information integration and processing in the brain. Clinical medicine has found that some of the neurological diseases that are difficult to cure have deficiencies or abnormalities in the whole or local integration processes of the brain. By studying the synchronization capabilities of the brain-network, we can intensively describe and characterize both the state of the interactions between brain regions and their differences between people with a mental illness and a set of controls by measuring the rapid changes in brain activity in patients with psychiatric disorders and the strength and integrity of their entire brain network. This is significant for the study of mental illness. Because static brain network connection methods are unable to assess the dynamic interactions within the brain, we introduced the concepts of dynamics and variability in a constructed EEG brain functional network based on dynamic connections, and used it to analyze the variability in the time characteristics of the EEG functional network. We used the spectral features of the brain network to extract its synchronization features and used the synchronization features to describe the process of change and the differences in the brain network's synchronization ability between a group of patients and healthy controls during a working memory task. We propose a method based on the fusion of traditional features and spectral features to achieve an adjustment of the patient's brain network synchronization ability, so that its synchronization ability becomes consistent with that of healthy controls, theoretically achieving the purpose of the treatment of the diseases. Studying the stability of brain network synchronization can provide new insights into the pathogenic mechanism and cure of mental diseases and has a wide range of potential applications.

MethodsA total of 46 participants (patients along the AD continuum and cognitively normal control subjects) were tested in a personalized, ecologically valid task of orientation relating to the participant's own world in space, time and person under high-density electroencephalography. As a first step, we used evoked potential mapping to search for brain topography correlated with participants' performance in orientating themselves to different places (space), events (time) and people (person) (Experiment 1). We then compared behavioral and electrophysiological changes in patients along the AD continuum (Experiment 2). ResultsWe identified a specific brain topography ("orientation map") that was active for orientation in space, time and person in correlation to participants' performance. Both performance and the map's strength gradually decreased from health to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and from MCI to AD. Another map, immediately preceding the orientation map, showed the longest activity in patients with MCI, significantly more than both patients with AD and cognitively normal controls. InterpretationOur findings demonstrate that the same brain topography accounts for orientation in the different domains of space, time and person and provide a nexus between deterioration in patients' orientation with the aggravation of Alzheimer's disease.

Prediction errors in surface segmentation are reflected in the visual mismatch negativity, independently of task and surface features	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						EEG; visual mismatch negativity; object perception; surface segmentation; roving standard; prediction error	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; BAYESIAN SURPRISE; ILLUSORY CONTOURS; PERCEPTION; ATTENTION; CONTEXT; MMN; COMPLETION; DYNAMICS	The visual system quickly registers perceptual regularities in the environment and responds to violations in these patterns. Errors of perceptual prediction are associated with electrocortical modulation, including the visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) and P2 event-related potential. One relatively unexplored question is whether these prediction error signals can encode higher-level properties such as surface segmentation, or whether they are limited to lower-level perceptual features. Using a roving standard paradigm, a triangle surface appeared either behind (featuring amodal contours) or in front of (featuring real contours) a second surface with hole-like windows. A surface layout appeared for two to five repetitions before switching to the other "deviant" layout; lighting and orientation of stimuli varied across presentations while remaining isoluminant. Observers responded when they detected a rare "pinched" triangle, which occasionally appeared. Cortical activity-reflected in mismatch responses affecting the P2-N2 and P300 amplitudes-was sensitive to a change in stimulus layout, when surfaces shifted position in depth, following several repetitions. Specifically, layout deviants led to a more negative P2-N2 complex at posterior electrodes, and greater P300 positivity at central sites. Independently of these signals of a deviant surface layout, further modulations of the P2 encoded differences between layouts and detection of the rare target stimulus. Comparison of the effect of preceding layout repetitions on this prediction error signal suggests that it is all or none and not graded with respect to the number of previous repetitions. We show that within the visual domain, unnoticed and task-irrelevant changes in visual surface segmentation leads to observable electrophysiological signals of prediction error that are dissociable from stimulus-specific encoding and lower-level perceptual processing.

J	Burnside, R; Fischer, AG; Ullsperger, M				Burnside, Rebecca; Fischer, Adrian G.; Ullsperger, Markus			The feedback-related negativity indexes prediction error in active but not observational learning	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; FRN; methods; reinforcement learning; social learning	MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; NEURAL MECHANISMS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; REWARD; PERFORMANCE; RESPONSES; DOPAMINE; ADAPTATION; DYNAMICS; OUTCOMES	Reinforcement learning (RL) theory states that learning is driven by prediction errors (PEs)-the discrepancy between the predicted and actual outcome of an action. When participants learn from their own actions, PEs correlate with the feedback-related negativity (FRN), but it is not clear if the FRN reflects a PE in observational learning. We use a model-based regression analysis of single-trial event-related potentials to determine if the FRN in observational learning is PE driven. Twenty participants (16 female) learned the stimulus-outcome contingencies for a probabilistic three-armed bandit task. They played in pairs, with the acting and observing player switching every one to three trials. An RL-learning algorithm was fit to participants' choices in the task to extract individual PE estimates for every trial of the experiment. In the acting condition, model-estimated PEs covaried positively with neural signal at electrode FCz, 200-350 ms after outcome presentation, which is a typical time frame for the FRN. There was no PE effect in the observation condition in the same time frame. From 300 ms the outcome correlated negatively with the frontal P300 component at FCz and parietal P300 at Pz. At Pz the effect was greater in the acting than the observing condition. The frontal and parietal P300 components have been linked to attentional reorienting and stimulus value updating, respectively. These findings indicate that observed outcomes undergo processing that is distinguishable from directly experienced outcomes in the time windows of the FRN and P3b but that attention dedicated to the two outcomes types is comparable.

However, traditional MI-BCIs are limited to the motion intention of gross limb, which places many restrictions on their applications. This study proposes a hybrid paradigm based on MI and the steady-state somatosensory evoked potential, with the aim of improving the spatial resolution of MI recognition. Twelve subjects participated in this study. They performed MI tasks under MI and hybrid conditions. In the MI condition, subjects only performed MI tasks, whereas, in the hybrid condition, they received an electrical stimulus while performing the same tasks. Under the hybrid condition, subjects were required not to pay extra attention to the electrical stimulation. The MI task included imagining clenching the right hand and lifting the right forearm. The classifier was built using the filter bank common spatial pattern algorithm and a support vector machine, and online experiments were used to verify the recognition of two MI tasks. During the online experiments, all subjects were able to output different commands at a recognition accuracy far higher than the random level. The average classification accuracy of the hybrid condition reached 76.39%, with a maximum value of 88.34%, which was about 11% higher than that of the MI condition. Moreover, based on offline data, the classification performance using the event-related desynchronization (ERD) feature under the hybrid condition did not differ significantly from that under the MI condition, indicating that the introduction of electrical stimulation did not interfere in the separability of ERD. The proposed paradigm improved the efficiency of decoding multiple MI locations within a single limb. Despite the introduction of external stimuli, users could still drive the new system in the same way as MI in traditional MI-BCI.

The role of perceptual processes during inhibitory control has attracted increased interest. Yet, we are far from an understanding of the mechanisms. One candidate mechanism by which perceptual processes may affect response inhibition refers to "gain control" that is closely linked to the signal-to-noise ratio of incoming information. A means to modulate the signal-to-noise ratio and gain control mechanisms is perceptual learning. In the current study, we examine the impact of perceptual learning (i.e., passive repetitive sensory stimulation) on response inhibition combining EEG signal decomposition with source localization analyses. A tactile GO/NOGO paradigm was conducted to measure action restraint as one subcomponent of response inhibition. We show that passive perceptual learning modulates response inhibition processes. In particular, perceptual learning attenuates the detrimental effect of response automation during inhibitory control. Temporally decomposed EEG data show that stimulus-related and not response selection processes during conflict monitoring are linked to these effects. The superior and middle frontal gyrus (BA6), as well as the motor cortex (BA4), are associated with the effects of perceptual learning on response inhibition. Reliable neurophysiological effects were not evident on the basis of standard ERPs, which has important methodological implications for perceptual learning research. The results detail how lower level sensory plasticity protocols affect higher-order cognitive control functions in frontal cortical structures.

J	Wolff, N; Chmielewski, W; Buse, J; Roessner, V; Beste, C				Wolff, Nicole; Chmielewski, Witold; Buse, Judith; Roessner, Veit; Beste, Christian			Paradoxical response inhibition advantages in adolescent obsessive compulsive disorder result from the interplay of automatic and controlled processes	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						OCD; Response inhibition; Neurophysiology; EEG; Cognitive control	ITERATION DECOMPOSITION RIDE; COGNITIVE CONTROL; LATENCY VARIABILITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FRONTAL-CORTEX; ERP COMPONENTS; NEURAL BASIS; MECHANISMS; SELECTION; STIMULUS	Response inhibition deficits have often been described in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Yet, research on response inhibition in OCD focusses on "top-down" controlled mechanisms, and it has been neglected that response inhibition performance depends on the interplay of controlled and automatic processes during response selection. Based on pathophysiological considerations we test the counterintuitive hypothesis that OCD patients show superior inhibitory control when automatic mechanisms govern processes involved in response inhibition. We examined a group of adolescent OCD patients (n = 27) and healthy controls (n = 27) using a combined Simon-Go/NoGo task. This task is able to examine conjoint effects of automatic and controlled processes during response inhibition. EEG and source localization analyses were applied to examine the underlying neural mechanisms. OCD patients committed fewer false alarms than healthy controls (HC) in the congruent Simon-NoGo condition, which is dominated by automatic response selection mechanisms. On a neurophysiological (EEG) level, these effects were reflected by intensified correlates of 'braking' processes associated with modulation of right inferior prefrontal regions. There is no general response inhibition deficit in adolescent OCD. When considering conjoint effects of automatic and controlled processes during the inhibition of responses paradoxical response inhibition advantages can emerge in OCD. This is likely a result of otherwise pathological fronto-striatal hyperactivity and loss of a situation-specific modulation of response selection mechanisms in OCD.

Distress intolerance moderation of motivated attention to cannabis and negative stimuli after induced stress among cannabis users: an ERP study	ADDICTION BIOLOGY			English	Article						cannabis use disorder; cue reactivity; distress intolerance; late positive potential; mood induction	NATIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGIC SURVEY; MARIJUANA USE; ANXIETY SENSITIVITY; GENERALIZED ANXIETY; SHORT-FORM; TOLERANCE; PREDICTORS; DEPENDENCE; PICTURES; VALIDITY	Prevalence of cannabis use is increasing, but many regular users do not develop cannabis use disorder (CUD); thus, CUD risk identification among current users is vital for targeted intervention development. Existing data suggest that high distress intolerance (DI), an individual difference reflective of the ability to tolerate negative affect, may be linked to CUD, but no studies have tested possible neurophysiological mechanisms. Increased motivated attentional processing of cannabis and negative emotional stimuli as indexed by neurophysiology [i.e. the late positive potential (LPP)], particularly during acute stress, may contribute to CUD among high DI users. Frequent cannabis users with high (n = 61) and low DI (n = 44) viewed cannabis, negative, and matched neutral images during electroencephalography (EEG) recording before and after a laboratory stressor. Cannabis cue-elicited modulation of the 1000- to 3000-milliseconds LPP was larger in high DI users at post-stressor only, although the effect was only robust in the 1000- to 2000-milliseconds window. Further, modulation magnitude in the high DI group covaried with stress-relief craving and some CUD indices in the 400- to 1000-milliseconds and 1000- to 3000-milliseconds windows, respectively. No significant effects of DI on negative stimuli-elicited LPP modulation were found, although inverse associations with some CUD indices were observed. Finally, exploratory analyses revealed some evidence for DI moderation of the relation between subjective stressor reactivity and negative stimuli-elicited LPP modulation such that greater stressor reactivity was associated with blunted versus enhanced modulation in the high and low DI groups, respectively. Negative and cannabis stimuli-elicited LPP modulation appear to index distinct, CUD-relevant neural processes in high DI cannabis users.

Here, we investigate what happens in the brain after simply listening to auditory beats in order to understand more about the automatic internalization of temporal intervals without tapping. Electroencephalograms were recorded while musicians attended to accelerating, decelerating, or steady click sequences. Evoked responses and induced beta power modulations (13-30 Hz) were examined for one beat following the last physical beat of each sequence (termed the silent beat) and compared to responses obtained during physical beats near the sequence endings. In response to the silent beat, P3a was observed with the largest amplitude occurring after accelerations and the smallest after decelerations. Late beta power modulations were also found after the silent beat, and the magnitude of the beta-power suppressions was significantly correlated with the concurrent P3a amplitudes. In contrast, physical beats elicited P2 responses and early beta suppressions, likely reflecting a combination of stimulus-related processing and temporal prediction. These results suggest that the activities observed after the silent beat were not produced via sustained entrainment after the physical beats, but via automatically-formed expectation for an additional beat. Therefore, beta modulations may be generated endogenously by expectation violation, while P3a amplitudes may relate to strength of expectation, with acceleration endings causing the strongest expectations for sequence continuation.

We examined the P300 elicited by viewing infant and adult faces, as well as houses, in women pregnant with their first child and compared their neural responses to women who had at least one child prior to their current pregnancy. We found the P300 amplitude was larger in women pregnant with their first child as compared to pregnant women who had previously had children. This larger P300 was observed in response to all visual stimuli and was not specific to infant faces. Taken together, these findings indicate increased sensitivity toward social and non-social stimuli in pregnancy and indicate the importance of measuring parity in social neuroscience studies of pregnancy and motherhood.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ERGONOMICS			English	Article						Visual alert; Verbal alert; ERP; Eye movement; Traceability analysis	ATTENTION; DESIGN; INHIBITION; POTENTIALS; WORKLOAD; SYSTEM	To explore the behavioural and cognition patterns of fighter pilots under visual and verbal alert conditions, 20 right-handed subjects participated in the experiment after 200 h of flight task training, and ERP technology was used to conduct EEG experiments under four conditions: high time pressure visual alert, low time pressure visual alert, fast speech speed verbal alert, and slow speech speed verbal alert. The results indicated the following: 1) the highest accuracy rate and shortest reaction time could be achieved under the slow speech speed verbal alert condition, indicating that the slow speech speed alert performance was optimal. 2) Subjects in the verbal alert trial showed a "right hemisphere advantage", and the brain function area was located in the right temporal lobes. The speech speed correlated negatively with the latency and amplitude of P80.3) Subjects in the visual alert trial showed a "left hemisphere advantage", and the brain activity was located in the left parietal lobes. 4) The latency of P80 evoked by verbal alert was earlier than that of N140 evoked by visual alert, indicating that a verbal alert causes an earlier attention effect in pilots. Based on the eye movement experiment, the performance of visual and verbal dual-channel alert was significantly higher than that of visual alert.

Facial expressions and social touch, for example, influence affinity and conformity. To understand the interaction between nonverbal and verbal information, we studied how the psychophysiological time-course of semiotics-the decoding of the meaning of a message-is altered by interpersonal touch and facial expressions. A virtual-reality-based economic decision-making game, ultimatum, was used to investigate how participants perceived, and responded to, financial offers of variable levels of fairness. In line with previous studies, unfair offers evoked medial frontal negativity (MFN) within the N2 time window, which has been interpreted as reflecting an emotional reaction to violated social norms. Contrary to this emotional interpretation of the MFN, however, nonverbal signals did not modulate the MFN component, only affecting fairness perception during the P3 component. This suggests that the nonverbal context affects the late, but not the early, stage of fairness perception. We discuss the implications of the semiotics of the message and the messenger as a process by which parallel information sources of "who says what" are integrated in reverse order: of the message, then the messenger.

To assess its role in automatic auditory deviance detection we analyzed the EEG high frequency activity (HFA; 75-145 Hz) and ERPs from 90 intracranial insular channels across 16 patients undergoing pre-surgical intracranial monitoring for epilepsy treatment. Subjects passively listened to a stream of standard and deviant tones differing in four physical dimensions: intensity, frequency, location or time. HFA responses to auditory stimuli were found in the short and long gyri, and the anterior, superior, and inferior segments of the circular sulcus of the insular cortex. Only a subset of channels in the inferior segment of the circular sulcus of the insula showed HFA deviance detection responses, i.e., a greater and longer latency response to specific deviants relative to standards. Auditory deviancy processing was also later in the insula when compared with the superior temporal cortex. ERP results were more widespread and supported the HFA insular findings. These results provide evidence that the human insula is engaged during auditory deviance detection. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It was recently shown that approval of the consequential behavior of driverless cars varied with the number of lives saved and showed interindividual differences, with approval increasing alongside the number of lives saved. In the present study, interindividual differences in individualized moral decision-making at both the behavioral and neural level were investigated using EEG. It was found that alpha event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) and delta/theta phase-locking - intertrial coherence (ITC) and phase-locking value (PLV)- play a central role in mediating interindividual differences in Moral decision-making. In addition, very late alpha activity differences between individualized and shared stimuli, and delta/theta ITC, where shown to be closely related to reaction time and subjectively perceived emotional distress. This demonstrates that interindividual differences in Moral decision-making are mediated neuronally by various markers - late alpha ERSP, and delta/theta ITC - as well as psychologically by reaction time and perceived emotional distress. Our data show, for the first time, how and according to which neuronal and behavioral measures interindividual differences in Moral dilemmas can be measured.

However, AP is acquired and has its function within complex dynamic musical contexts. Here we examined event-related brain responses and underlying cerebral sources to endings of short expressive string quartets, investigating a homogeneous population of young highly trained pianists with half of them possessing true-AP. The pieces ended regularly or contained harmonic transgressions at closure that participants appraised. Given the millisecond precision of ERP analyses, this experimental plan allowed examining whether AP alters music processing at an early perceptual, or later cognitive level, or both, and which cerebral sources underlie differences with non-AP musicians. We also investigated the impact of AP on general auditory cognition. Remarkably, harmonic transgression sensitivity did not differ between AP and non-AP participants, and differences for auditory cognition were only marginal. The key finding of this study is the involvement of amicrostate peaking around 60ms after musical closure, characterizing AP participants. Concurring sources were estimated in secondary auditory areas, comprising the planum temporale, all transgression conditions collapsed. These results suggest that AP is not a panacea to become a proficient musician, but a rare perceptual feature.

Reduced hemispherical asymmetry was found in the sensorimotor and visual areas in expert musicians and athletes compared with non-experts. Moreover, increased expertise with faces, body, and objects resulted in an enhanced engagement of the occipitotemporal cortex (OTC) during stimulus observation. The present study aimed at investigating whether intense and extended practice with dance would result in an enhanced symmetric response of OTC at an early stage of action processing. Expert ballet dancers and non-dancer controls were presented with videos depicting ballet steps during EEG recording. The observation of the moving dancer elicited a posterior N2 component, being larger over the left hemisphere in dancers than controls. The source reconstruction (swLORETA) of the negativity showed the engagement of the bilateral inferior and middle temporal regions in experts, while right-lateralized activity was found in controls. The dancers also showed an early P2 and enhanced P300 responses, indicating faster stimulus processing and subsequent recognition. This evidence seemed to suggest expertise-related increased sensitivity of the OTC in encoding body kinematics. Thus, we speculated that long-term whole-body practice would result in enriched and refined action processing.

Caffeine affects children's ERPs and performance in an equiprobable go/no-go task: Testing a processing schema	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						caffeine; child processing schema; cognitive control processes; equiprobable go; no-go task; principal components analysis (PCA)	RESPONSE-INHIBITION; COMPONENTS; EEG; CONFLICT; AROUSAL; POTENTIALS; ACTIVATION; STIMULI; ALPHA; MOOD	Caffeine's stimulant properties were used to test a proposed processing schema for children's processing stages in the equiprobable auditory go/no-go task. Active control-related ERP components were hypothesized to be differentially enhanced by caffeine. Caffeine (80mg) was administered in a counterbalanced, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of 24 children, aged 8-12years. Four blocks of an equiprobable auditory go/no-go task were completed on each of two occasions, while on or off caffeine. ERP data sets from each condition (caffeine/go, placebo/go, caffeine/no-go, placebo/no-go) were subjected to separate temporal PCAs with extraction and varimax rotation of all components. Caffeine significantly reduced reaction time and go omission errors, and enhanced go PN, N2c, and P3b, and no-go N1-1 and N2b. This selective enhancement of different go/no-go components by caffeine matched the predicted amplification of biomarkers of children's active control processing in this task. Some unexpected findings also support further refinements in the child processing schema. We explored a recently proposed child processing schema for the equiprobable go/no-go task that associates ERP components with the stages of perceptual and cognitive processing in the task. Rather than linking components to the behavioral outcomes, here we used the arousal-as-amplifier effects of a common stimulant, caffeine, in a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over design in children. Selective enhancement of different go/no-go components derived by an optimized principal components analysis approach matched the predicted biomarkers of active control processing, confirming the major elements of the schema. Additional caffeine effects support further clarifications and extensions of the processing schema.

To examine the reproducibility of brain indices of speech sound discrimination and their role in dyslexia, a specific reading difficulty, brain event-related potentials using EEG were measured using the same cross-linguistic passive oddball paradigm in about 200 dyslexics and 200 typically reading 8-12-year-old children from four countries with different native languages. Brain responses indexing speech and non-speech sound discrimination were extremely reproducible, supporting the validity and reliability of cognitive neuroscience methods. Significant differences between typical and dyslexic readers were found when examined separately in different country and language samples. However, reading group differences occurred at different time windows and for different stimulus types between the four countries. This finding draws attention to the limited generalizability of atypical brain response findings in children with dyslexia across language environments and raises questions about a common neurobiological factor for dyslexia. Our results thus show the robustness of neuroscience methods in general while highlighting the need for multi-sample studies in the brain research of language disorders.	[Leppanen, Paavo H.

Facial Recognition Task for the Classification of Mild Cognitive Impairment with Ensemble Sparse Classifier	2019 41ST ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	41st Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	JUL 23-27, 2019	Berlin, GERMANY				ALZHEIMERS ASSOCIATION WORKGROUPS; DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINES; NATIONAL INSTITUTE; DISEASE; RECOMMENDATIONS	Conventional methods for detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) require cognitive exams and follow-up neuroimaging, which can be time-consuming and expensive. A great need exists for objective and cost-effective biomarkers for the early detection of MCI. This study uses a sequential imaging oddball paradigm to determine if familiar, unfamiliar, or inverted faces are effective visual stimuli for the early detection of MCI. Unlike the traditional approach where the amplitude and latency of certain deflection points of event-related potentials (ERPs) are selected as electrophysiological biomarkers (or features) of MCI, we used the entire ERPs as potential biomarkers and relied on an advanced machine-learning technique, i.e. an ensemble of sparse classifier (ESC), to choose the set of features to best discriminate MCI from healthy controls. Five MCI subjects and eight age-matched controls were given the MoCA exam before EEG recordings in a sensory-deprived room. Traditional time-domain comparisons of averaged ERPs between the two groups did not yield any statistical significance. However, ESC was able to discriminate MCI from controls with 95% classification accuracy based on the averaged ERPs elicited by familiar faces. By adopting advanced machine-learning techniques such as ESC, it may be possible to accurately diagnose MCI based on the ERPs that are specifically elicited by familiar faces.

Modulations in Oscillatory Activity of Globus Pallidus Internus Neurons During a Directed Hand Movement Task-A Primary Mechanism for Motor Planning	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						basal ganglia; globus pallidus internus (GPi); beta-band; motor control; movement planning	LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION/SYNCHRONIZATION; NEURAL SPIKING ACTIVITY; BASAL GANGLIA; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; PARKINSONIAN-PATIENTS; MPTP MODEL; CORTEX; DISCHARGE; EEG	Globus pallidus internus (GPi) neurons in the basal ganglia are traditionally thought to play a significant role in the promotion and suppression of movement via a change in firing rates. Here, we hypothesize that a primary mechanism of movement control by GPi neurons is through specific modulations in their oscillatory patterns. We analyzed neuronal spiking activity of 83 GPi neurons recorded from two healthy nonhuman primates executing a radial center-out motor task. We found that, in directionally tuned neurons, the power in the gamma band is significantly (p < 0.05) greater than that in the beta band (a "cross-over" effect), during the planning stages of movements in their preferred direction. This cross-over effect is not observed in the non-directionally tuned neurons. These data suggest that, during movement planning, information encoding by GPi neurons may be governed by a sudden emergence and suppression of oscillatory activities, rather than simply by a change in average firing rates.

Deficient mismatch negativity (MMN) generation is a characteristic finding in SCZ patients and cannabis users. This study therefore examined the effects of CUD on MMN generation in SCZ patients. Methods Twenty SCZ - CUD patients, 21 SCZ+CUD patients, and 20 healthy controls (HC) were included in this study. MMN to frequency and duration deviants was elicited within an auditory oddball paradigm and recorded by 32 channel EEG. Results As expected, SCZ - CUD patients showed reduced frontocentral MMN amplitudes to duration deviants compared to HC. Interestingly, SCZ+CUD patients demonstrated greater MMN amplitudes to duration deviants compared to SCZ - CUD patients at central electrodes with no differences compared to HC. Discussion These results demonstrate that comorbid cannabis use in SCZ patients might be associated with superior cognitive functioning. It can be assumed that the association between cannabis use and better cognitive performance may be due to a subgroup of cognitively less impaired SCZ patients characterized by lower genetic vulnerability for psychosis.

However, the potential interactive effects on physical fitness have not been investigated. Purpose: The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether ADFH individuals with the ApoE-4 genotype show deviant brain event-related neural oscillatory performance and cognitively-related molecular indices. A secondary purpose was to examine the interactive effects on physical fitness. Methods: Blood samples were provided from 110 individuals with ADFH to assess molecular biomarkers and the ApoE genotype for the purpose of dividing them into an ApoE-4 group (n = 16) and a non-ApoE-4 group (n = 16) in order for them to complete a visuospatial working memory task while simultaneously recording electroencephalographic signals. They also performed a senior functional physical fitness (SFPF) test. Results: While performing the cognitive task, the ApoE-4 relative to non-ApoE-4 group showed worse accuracy rates (ARs) and brain neural oscillatory performance. There were no significant between-group differences with regard to any molecular biomarkers (e.g., IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, BDNF, A beta 1-40, A beta 1-42). VO2max was significantly correlated with the neuropsychological performance (i.e., ARs and RTs) in the 2-item and 4-item conditions in the ApoE-4 group and across the two groups. However, the electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations during visuospatial working memory processing in the two conditions were not correlated with any SFPF scores or cardiorespiratory tests in the two groups. Conclusions: ADFH individuals with the ApoE-4 genotype only showed deviant neuropsychological (e.g., ARs) and neural oscillatory performance when performing the cognitive task with a higher visuospatial working memory load. Cardiorespiratory fitness potentially played an important role in neuropsychological impairment in this group.

J	Silva, S; Castro, S				Silva, Susana; Castro, Sao Luis			Structural meter perception is pre-attentive	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Meter; Attention; ERPs	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MUSICAL METER; RESPONSES; RHYTHM; MUSICIANS; IMPLICIT; EXPLICIT; BEAT	A prominent question in timing research is whether meter perception is possible without attention to meter. So far, research has probed attention effects on meter perception with a surface-based approach that may create confounds between meter and rhythm, and not with a structural approach requiring abstraction from surface patterns. The available pattern of findings suggests that different meter dimensions (meter as beat hierarchy vs. meter as regular cycle length) may yield different attention effects: meter as cycle-length regularity may require attention (it is attentive but not pre-attentive), while meter as beat-hierarchy may be pre-attentive. However, it is unknown whether this dissociation prevails under structural meter processing. We examined attention effects on the EEG correlates of structural meter-processing, considering the two dimensions of meter perception: hierarchy and cycle-length. While the results for hierarchy violations were inconclusive, cycle-length violations induced pre-attentive, but not attentive, responses. These pre-attentive responses corresponded to late ERPs (300-600 ms), consistent with deep, structural meter-processing. Our findings highlight the importance of pre-attentive processing in meter perception, and they raise the hypothesis of dissociation between surface- and structure-based meter processing.

We here tested whether interhemispheric functional connectivity and ensuing auditory perception can selectively be modulated by high-density transcranial alternating current stimulation (HD-tACS). For this purpose, we applied multi-site HD-tACS at 40Hz bilaterally with a phase lag of 180 degrees and recorded a 64-channel EEG to study the oscillatory phase dynamics at the source-space level during a dichotic listening (DL) task in twenty-six healthy participants. In this study, we revealed an oscillatory phase signature at 40Hz which reflects different temporal profiles of the phase asymmetries during left and right ear percept. Here we report that 180 degrees-tACS did not affect the right ear advantage during DL at group level. However, a follow-up analysis revealed that the intrinsic phase asymmetries during sham-tACS determined the directionality of the behavioral modulations: While a shift to left ear percept was associated with augmented interhemispheric asymmetry (closer to 180 degrees), a shift to right ear processing was elicited in subjects with lower asymmetry (closer to 0 degrees). Crucially, the modulation of the interhemispheric network dynamics depended on the deviation of the tACS-induced phase-lag from the intrinsic phase asymmetry. Our characterization of the oscillatory network trends is giving rise to the importance of phase-specific gamma-band coupling during ambiguous auditory perception, and emphasizes the necessity to address the inter-individual variability of phase asymmetries in future studies by tailored stimulation protocols.

J	van Moorselaar, D; Slagter, HA				van Moorselaar, Dirk; Slagter, Heleen A.			Learning What Is Irrelevant or Relevant: Expectations Facilitate Distractor Inhibition and Target Facilitation through Distinct Neural Mechanisms	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention; brain; EEG; expectation; inhibition; statistical learning	WORKING-MEMORY; SUPPRESSION; ATTENTION; LOCATION; CORTEX; PROBABILITY; MEG	It is well known that attention can facilitate performance by top-down biasing processing of task-relevant information in advance. Recent findings from behavioral studies suggest that distractor inhibition is not under similar direct control but strongly dependent on expectations derived from previous experience. Yet, how expectations about distracting information influence distractor inhibition at the neural level remains unclear. The current study addressed this outstanding question in three experiments in which search displays with repeating distractor or target locations across trials allowed human observers (male and female) to learn which location to selectively suppress or boost. Behavioral findings demonstrated that both distractor and target location learning resulted in more efficient search, as indexed by faster response times. Crucially, distractor learning benefits were observed without target location foreknowledge, unaffected by the number of possible target locations, and could not be explained by priming alone. To determine how distractor location expectations facilitated performance, we applied a spatial encoding model to EEG data to reconstruct activity in neural populations tuned to distractor or target locations. Target location learning increased neural tuning to target locations in advance, indicative of preparatory biasing. This sensitivity increased after target presentation. By contrast, distractor expectations did not change preparatory spatial tuning. Instead, distractor expectations reduced distractor-specific processing, as reflected in the disappearance of the Pd event-related potential component, a neural marker of distractor inhibition, and decreased decoding accuracy. These findings suggest that the brain may no longer process expected distractors as distractors, once it has learned they can safely be ignored.

Oddball tasks are specific types of experiments in which this nature of the human brain is studied. Detailed mathematical models have been constructed to explain the brain's perception in these tasks. These models consider a subject as an ideal observer who abstracts a hypothesis from the previous stimuli, and estimates its hyper-parameters - in order to make the next prediction. The corresponding prediction error is assumed to manifest the subjective surprise of the brain. While the approach of earlier works to this problem has been to suggest an encoding model, we investigated the reverse model: if the stimuli's surprise is assumed as the cause of the observer's surprise, it must be possible to decode the surprise of each stimulus, for every single subject, given only their neural responses, i.e. to tell how unexpected a specific stimulus has been for them. Employing machine learning tools, we developed a surprise decoding model for binary oddball tasks. We constructed our model using the ideal observer proposed by Meyniel et al. in 2016, and applied it to three datasets, one with visual, one with auditory, and one with both visual and auditory stimuli. We demonstrated that our decoding model performs very well for both of the sensory modalities with or without the presence of the subject's motor response.

A comparison of feature extraction strategies using wavelet dictionaries and feature selection methods for single trial P300-based BCI	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Feature generation and selection; P300	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; COMPETITION 2003; DATA SETS; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; IIB	The P300 component of event-related potentials (ERPs) is widely used in the implementation of brain computer interfaces (BCI). In this context, one of the main issues to solve is the binary classification problem that entails differentiating between electroencephalographic (EEG) signals with and without P300. Given the particularly unfavorable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the single-trial detection scenario, this is a challenging problem in the pattern recognition field. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous experimental studies comparing feature extraction and selection methods for single trial P300-based BCIs using unified criteria and data. In order to improve the performance and robustness of single-trial classifiers, we analyzed and compared different alternatives for the feature generation and feature selection blocks. We evaluated different orthogonal decompositions based on the wavelet transform for feature extraction, as well as different filter, wrapper, and embedded alternatives for feature selection. Accuracies over 75% were obtained for most of the analyzed strategies with a relatively low computational cost, making them attractive for a practical BCI implementation using inexpensive hardware.

Methods: 11 young adults, 10 older adults, and 10 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) performed an auditory oddball task during standing and walking on a treadmill, while wearing a wireless EEG cap. The amplitude and latency of P300 were compared between groups and within conditions using linear mix model analysis. Gait was evaluated using wearable sensors and cognition was assessed using the Color Trail Test. Results: P300 latency became longer during walking in all groups (p = 0.005). During walking, older adults (p = 0.005) and patients with PD (p = 0.001) showed prolonged P300 latency compared to young adults. Significant task by group interaction was found in P300 amplitude (p = 0.008). Patients with PD demonstrated reduced P300 amplitude during walking compared to standing (p = 0.023). Among all subjects, better motor and cognitive performance correlated with shorter P300 latency (r= 0.457, p = 0.014 and r = 0.431, p = 0.040, respectively). Conclusions: These findings provide direct evidence of the physiological recruitment of attentional networks during walking and their impact by ageing and disease. Significance: This study is the first to report on changes in P300 latency and amplitude during dual-task oddball walking in older adults and patients with PD.

However, it remains unclear how elevated math-anxiety modulates brain activity while solving arithmetic problems. In the current study, we recorded electrophysiological responses throughout arithmetic problem solving, both at the period of anticipating an upcoming arithmetic problem and solving an arithmetic problem. Results showed that, after controlling for mathematical performance, people with higher math anxiety tended to show stronger beta band oscillation and P300 amplitude while expecting the arithmetic problems, as well as stronger gamma band activity while solving the arithmetic problems. These results suggest that individuals highly anxious about math might use more attentional resources during the course of anticipating the upcoming arithmetic problems, and showed greater attentional bias toward arithmetic problems during solving arithmetic problems.

However, how the brain integrates nociceptive inputs from different body areas remains unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the cortical integration of bilateral nociceptive inputs evoked by laser heat stimuli. Sixteen healthy volunteers (8 F, 8 M; age: 25.5 +/- 4.3) were recruited to participate in one session during which painful laser stimuli were applied to their hands with 2 Nd:YAP laser systems. Electroencephalographic activity was recorded to measure laser-evoked potentials and event-related spectral perturbations. Twenty nociceptive stimuli were applied in each of the 4 counterbalanced conditions: (1) right hand, (2) left hand, and both hands with (3) attention to the right or (4) attention to the let Compared with unilateral conditions, N2 and P2 peak amplitude as well as gamma oscillation power were decreased in bilateral conditions (P < 0.05), but these effects were not affected by the direction of attention (P > 0.1). By contrast, pain was not significantly different in any condition (P > 0.05). These findings show that although more nociceptive inputs reach the brain with multiple nociceptive stimuli, their sensory representation is decreased while pain perception remains unchanged. These interactions between cerebral processing of nociceptive information from different body regions could support coordinated behavioral responses when pain origins from multiple sources.

Deficits in arithmetic error detection in infants with prenatal alcohol exposure: An ERP study	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG phase synchronization; Prenatal alcohol exposure; Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders; Error detection; Theta; Infants	SOUTH-AFRICA PREVALENCE; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT; CHILDREN; AGE; THETA; ADOLESCENTS; CONSUMPTION; CONTINUUM; ATTENTION	Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is associated with a range of physical, cognitive, and behavioral problems, particularly in arithmetic. We report ERP data collected from 32 infants (mean age = 6.8 mo; SD = 0.6; range = 6.1-8.1; 16 typically developing [TD]; 16 prenatally alcohol-exposed) during a task designed to assess error detection. Evidence of error monitoring at this early age suggests that precursors of the onset of executive control can already be detected in infancy. As predicted, the ERPs of the TD infants, time-locked to the presentation of the solution to simple arithmetic equations, showed greater negative activity for the incorrect solution condition at middle-frontal scalp areas. Spectral analysis indicated specificity to the 6-7 Hz frequency range. By contrast, the alcohol-exposed infants did not show the increased middle-frontal negativity seen in the TD group nor the increased power in the 6-7 Hz frequency, suggesting a marked developmental delay in error detection and/or early impairment in information processing of small quantities. Overall, our research demonstrates that (a) the brain network involved in error detection can be identified and highly specified in TD young infants, and (b) this effect is replicable and can be utilized for studying developmental psychopathology at very early ages.

J	Li, WX; Han, SH				Li, Wenxin; Han, Shihui			Behavioral and electctrophysiological evidence for enhanced sensitivity to subtle variations of pain expressions of same-race than other-race faces	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Empathy; ERP; Pain; Race; P2 amplitude	IMPLICIT ASSOCIATION TEST; MODULATES NEURAL ACTIVITY; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; RACIAL BIAS; INTERGROUP RELATIONSHIPS; EMPATHY; PERCEPTION; EMOTION; BRAIN; DISSOCIATION	Recent research has shown enhanced brain activity in responses to pain expression of same-race than other-race faces. However, due to the stimuli used in electctrophysiological (EEG) research (i.e., photos of static pain expressions) and low temporal resolutions of neural activity reported in functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, it remains unclear how dynamic neural responses to subtle variations of pain expressions are shaped by perceived race in the first few hundreds of milliseconds after face onset. We tested the hypothesis of greater sensitivity to subtle variations of pain expressions of same-race than other-race faces by integrating psychophysical and EEG responses to increasing amount of pixels of pain expressions applied to neutral faces. Experiment 1 found that adults required fewer painful pixels to perceive pain expression of same-race than other-race faces. Experiment 2 showed that the amplitude of a positivity activity at 140-190 ms over the frontal/central electrodes (P2) increased faster in response to the increasing amount of painful pixels of same-race than other-race faces. These results provide evidence for enhanced sensitivity of both subjective feelings and neural responses pertaining to subtle variations of pain expressions of same-race than other-race faces.

However, due to different methodological aspects, it was still not clear whether hypnosis modulates the early sensory processing of the stimuli or if it affects only the later stages of affective processing. In the present study, we measured the EEG activity of subjects with a medium level of hypnotizability while receiving electrical non-painful stimuli on the median nerve in the conditions of awake and hypnosis with suggestions of hypoesthesia. Subjective reports indicated that hypnosis reduced both the sensory and the affective perception of the stimuli. ERP data revealed that hypnosis reduced the activity of both the early (N20) and the late (P100, P150, P250) SEP components. Neuroelectric source imaging further confirmed the top-down hypnotic modulation of a network of brain areas including the SI (N20), SII (P100), right anterior insula (P150) and cingulate cortex (P150/P250). The present study provides neurophysiological evidence to the hypnotic regulation of somatosensory inputs outside of pain, that is since the earliest stage of thalamocortical processing. Also, because present subjects were selected regardless of the level of hypnotizability, inferences from the present study are more generalizable than investigations restricted to high-hypnotizable individuals.

Whereas some studies point towards stronger effects of emotion on concrete words, others claim amplified emotion effects for abstract words. We investigated the interaction of emotion and concreteness by means of fMRI and EEG in a delayed lexical decision task. Behavioral data revealed a facilitating effect of high positive and negative valence on the correct processing of abstract, but not concrete words. EEG data yielded a particularly low amplitude response of the late positive component (LPC) following concrete neutral words. This presumably indicates enhanced allocation of processing resources to abstract and emotional words at late stages of word comprehension. In fMRI, interactions between concreteness and emotion were observed within the semantic processing network: the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG). Higher positive or negative valence appears to facilitate semantic retrieval and selection of abstract words. Surprisingly, a reversal of this effect occurred for concrete words. This points towards enhanced semantic control for emotional concrete words compared to neutral concrete words. Our findings suggest fine-tuned integration of emotional valence and concreteness. Specifically, at late processing stages, semantic control mechanisms seem to integrate emotional cues depending on the previous progress of semantic retrieval.

This study fills this gap by employing an original paradigm, based on a version of the filmic "Kuleshov effect". High-density EEG was recorded while participants watched film sequences consisting of three shots: the close-up of a target person's neutral face (Face_1), the scene that the target person was looking at (happy, fearful, or neutral), and another close-up of the same target person's neutral face (Face_2). The participants' task was to rate both valence and arousal, and subsequently to categorize the target person's emotional state. The results indicate that despite a significant behavioural 'context' effect, the electrophysiological indexes still indicate that the face is evaluated as neutral. Specifically, Face_2 elicited a high amplitude N170 when preceded by neutral contexts, and a high amplitude Late Positive Potential (LPP) when preceded by emotional contexts, thus showing sensitivity to the evaluative congruence (N170) and incongruence (LPP) between context and Face_2. The LPP activity was mainly underpinned by brain regions involved in facial expressions and emotion recognition processing. Our results shed new light on temporal and neural correlates of context-sensitivity in the interpretation of facial expressions.

J	Pu, M; Yu, RJ				Pu, Min; Yu, Rongjun			Post-encoding frontal theta activity predicts incidental memory in the reward context	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article						Subsequent memory effect (SME); Post-encoding; Reward learning; Theta activity; Binding of information	LONG-TERM-MEMORY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; CONSOLIDATION; HIPPOCAMPAL; ACTIVATION; POWER; ANTICIPATION; NEGATIVITY; MECHANISMS	Memories for daily events require that individuals integrate initial fragile traces of events over time. Recent evidence suggests that reward anticipation enhances memory performance and amplifies frontal theta activity for remembered items vs. forgotten items. However, little is known about how incidental rewards after item presentation retrospectively modulate memory and the neural basis of this processing. Here, we used EEG combined with an incidental memory task to study how incidental reward association biased the post-encoding process. In the anticipatory stage, participants saw photos in win, loss and neutral contexts. Each photo was presented in a color frame that indicated the incentive condition (win vs. loss vs. neutral) and participants were asked to make a binary choice to predict whether the photo was associated with the left/right button. Feedback was presented to indicate arbitrary correctness and monetary outcomes. Recognition memory was tested after a short delay. During the encoding phase, left central-parietal theta power predicted subsequent memory performance in the win context. The post-encoding theta power at right central-frontal and central-parietal sites predicted later memory performance only in the win context. The size of frontal post-encoding related theta activity in the win context was correlated with the discriminate accuracy of the test stimulus. Our results suggest that post-encoding theta activity is closely linked to reward-based associative learning, providing evidence of a potential post-encoding mechanism of information binding.

SG, the suppression of irrelevant and redundant stimuli, is measured in a conditioning-testing (S-1-S-2) paradigm eliciting electroencephalography-derived P50 event-related potentials (ERPs), the S-2 amplitudes of which are typically suppressed relative to S-1. Despite extensive reports of nicotine-related improvements and several decades of research, an efficient nicotinic treatment has yet to be approved for SCZ. Following reports of SG improvements in low P50 suppressing SCZ patients and healthy participants with the alpha 7 agonist, CDP-choline, this pilot study examined the combined modulatory effect of CDP-choline (500 mg) and galantamine (16 mg), a nAChR positive allosteric modulator and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, on SG to speech stimuli in twenty-four SCZ patients in a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled design. As expected, in low P50 suppressors CDP-choline/galantamine (vs. Placebo) improved rP50 and dP50 scores by increasing inhibitory mechanisms as reflected by S(2)P50 amplitude reductions. Results also suggest a moderating role for auditory verbal hallucinations in treatment response. These preliminary findings provide supportive evidence for the involvement of alpha 7 nAChR activity in speech gating in SCZ and support additional trials, examining different dose combinations and repeated doses of this optimized and personalized targeted alpha 7 cholinergic treatment for SG dysfunction in subgroups of SCZ patients.

Dietary choline is related to neural efficiency during a selective attention task among middle-aged adults with overweight and obesity	NUTRITIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Nutrition; diet; obesity; cognition; electroencephalography	WHITE-MATTER HYPERINTENSITY; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; ESSENTIAL NUTRIENT; ACETYLCHOLINE; PERFORMANCE	Objectives: Obesity is associated with poorer brain health and cognitive function. However, it is not clear whether specific dietary factors may provide neuroprotective effects among individuals with overweight and obesity. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of choline intake on neurophysiological markers of attentional control among young and middle-aged adults with overweight or obesity. Methods: 146 adults with BMI >= 25 kg/m(2) (34.0 +/- 5.9 years, 57 males) participated in the study. Behavioral performance (accuracy and reaction time) and neuroelectric indices (event-related brain potentials [ERPs]) of attentional inhibition were assessed during a Flanker task. Specifically, the amplitude and latency of the P3 waveform in a central-parietal region of interest (ROI) were used to index attentional resource allocation and information processing speed, respectively. Choline intake and overall diet quality (Healthy Eating Index [HEI-2015]) were assessed using 7-day diet records. Intelligence Quotient was assessed using the Kaufman-Brief Intelligence Test. Regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between habitual dietary choline intake and cognitive outcomes following adjustment of demographic factors, IQ, HEI-2015, and BMI. Results: Choline intake was selectively associated with a lower peak amplitude of the P300 waveform during incongruent trials (beta = -0.25, p = <0.01). No significant relationships were observed for accuracy or reaction time. Discussion: Higher choline intake is associated with more efficient neural processing among adults with overweight and obesity. Intervention are necessary to determine whether choline consumption provides neuroprotective effects for executive function among individuals with elevated weight status.

Event-related potentials such as mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3b are thought to index local and global deviance, respectively. However, it is not clear how these hierarchical levels interact and to what extent attention modulates this interaction. In this EEG study with 17 healthy young adults, we used a hierarchical oddball paradigm with local (sequence-level) and global (block-level) violations in attended and unattended conditions. Amplitude of N2 and P3b were analyzed in a 2*2*2 factorial model (local status, global status, attention condition). We found a significant interaction between the local and global status on the N2 amplitude, while there was no significant three-way interaction with attention, together demonstrating that lower-level prediction error is modulated by detection of higher-order regularity but expressed independently of attention. By contrast, higher-level prediction error, indexed by P3b, was sensitive to global regularity violations if the auditory stream was attended. The results demonstrate the capacity of our auditory perception to preattentively resolve conflicts between different levels of predictive hierarchy even across longer time intervals as indexed by MMN modulation, while P3b represents a different, attention-dependent system.

J	Schmidt-Kassow, M; Thone, K; Kaiser, J				Schmidt-Kassow, Maren; Thoene, Katharina; Kaiser, Jochen			Auditory-motor coupling affects phonetic encoding	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; P300; AMS; Rhythm; Entrainment; Syllable	BEAT SYNCHRONIZATION; ENTRAINMENT; ATTENTION; OSCILLATIONS; PREDICTION; BRAIN; ALPHA; TIME; MODULATION; CHILDREN	Recent studies have shown that moving in synchrony with auditory stimuli boosts attention allocation and verbal learning. Furthermore rhythmic tones are processed more efficiently than temporally random tones ('timing effect'), and this effect is increased when participants actively synchronize their motor performance with the rhythm of the tones, resulting in auditory-motor synchronization. Here, we investigated whether this applies also to sequences of linguistic stimuli (syllables). We compared temporally irregular syllable sequences with two temporally regular conditions where either the interval between syllable onsets (stimulus onset asynchrony, SOA) or the interval between the syllables' vowel onsets was kept constant. Entrainment to the stimulus presentation frequency (1 Hz) and event-related potentials were assessed in 24 adults who were instructed to detect pre-defined deviant syllables while they either pedaled or sat still on a stationary exercise bike. We found larger 1 Hz entrainment and P300 amplitudes for the SOA presentation during motor activity. Furthermore, the magnitude of the P300 component correlated with the motor variability in the SOA condition and 1 Hz entrainment, while in turn 1 Hz entrainment correlated with auditory-motor synchronization performance. These findings demonstrate that acute auditory-motor coupling facilitates phonetic encoding. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Lexico-syntactic features are activated but not selected in bare noun production: Electrophysiological evidence from overt picture naming	CORTEX			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Morphological Processing Conference (MoProc)	JUN 22-24, 2017	SISSA, Trieste, ITALY		SISSA	Morphological processing; Overt speech production; Lexico-syntactic feature; Mandarin Chinese classifiers; ERP	GRAMMATICAL GENDER; TIME-COURSE; PHONOLOGICAL PROCESSES; LANGUAGE PRODUCTION; PHRASE PRODUCTION; SPEECH PRODUCTION; LEMMA RETRIEVAL; WORD PRODUCTION; INTERFERENCE; ACCESS	To produce a word, speakers need to retrieve the lexico-syntactic representation of the word and encode the phonological form for articulation. It is not precisely known yet if a word's syntactic features (e.g., number, gender, etc.) are automatically activated and selected in bare noun production. Cubelli, Lotto, Paolieri, Girelli, and Job (2005) proposed that only in languages that have a complex morphological structure (e.g., Italian), the selection of grammatical gender is required. In languages with a relatively simpler morphological structure, the selection of grammatical gender is by-passed. Here, we investigated this issue further by employing a language with an extremely simple morphological structure, i.e., Mandarin Chinese. Using the picture-word interference paradigm, we manipulated the congruency of the lexico-syntactic classifier feature (comparable to grammatical gender) between the target picture and the superimposed distractor word. We measured participants' naming latencies and their electroencephalogram (EEG). As a result, relative to the classifier-congruent condition, classifier incongruency elicited a stronger N400 effect in the ERP analyses, suggesting the automatic activation of lexico-syntactic features in bare noun production. However, classifier congruency did not affect naming latencies, suggesting that the lexico-syntactic feature is not selected in bare noun naming when it is irrelevant for production.

This perceptual reorganization is related to exposure, and a direct relation has previously been demonstrated between amount of daily language exposure and mismatch response (MMR) amplitude to a native consonant contrast at around one year of age. The present study investigates the same relation between amount of speech exposure and MMR amplitude to a native vowel contrast at four to eight months of age. Importantly, the present study uses spectrally rotated speech in an effort to take general neural maturation into account. The amplitude of the part of the MMR that is tied specifically to speech processing correlates with amount of daily speech exposure, as estimated using the LENA system.

Therefore, investigation of fatigue during longtime usage and its effect on the signal quality are necessary for the use of BCI systems in daily life. In this study, 54 participants used BCI systems for about five hours, and it included the three major BCI paradigms. Participants conducted each paradigm once again at the end of the experiment. We investigated how fatigue changes as the experiment progresses and report the effect of fatigue on signal quality by comparing the first and second sessions. In the result, a significant increase was seen in questionnaire scores as well as in alpha-band power in the resting state. The signal quality decreased slightly in the MI and SSVEP paradigms, but the amplitude of the P300 in the ERP paradigm increased.

J	Kaya, U; Kafaligonul, H				Kaya, Utku; Kafaligonul, Hulusi			Cortical processes underlying the effects of static sound timing on perceived visual speed	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Auditory timing; Perceived speed; Visual apparent motion; Audiovisual interactions; EEG	AUDIOVISUAL TEMPORAL BINDING; CROSS-MODAL INTERACTIONS; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; MOTION PERCEPTION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MODULATION; BRAIN; DISCRIMINATION; SIGNALS; LESIONS	It is well known that the timing of brief static sounds can alter different aspects of visual motion perception. For instance, previous studies have shown that time intervals demarcated by brief sounds can modulate perceived visual speed such that apparent motions with short auditory time intervals are typically perceived as faster than those with long time intervals. Yet, little is known about the principles and cortical processes underlying such effects of auditory timing. Using a speed judgment paradigm combined with EEG recording, we aimed to identify when and where in the cortex auditory timing takes place for motion processing. Our results indicated significant effects of auditory timing over the medial parieto-occipital and parietal, right centro-parietal, and frontal scalp sites. In addition, these effects were not restricted to a single ERP component and we observed both significant changes in early and late components. Therefore, our findings here suggest that auditory timing may take place at both early and late stages of motion processing and its influences on motion perception may be the outcome of the dynamic interplay between different cortical regions. Together with accumulating evidence, these findings also support the notion that audiovisual integration is a multistage process and it may be achieved through more diversified processes than previously thought.

Here, using a novel brain-network connectivity approach, we aimed to examine whether task-based functional connectivity reflects a marker of ADHD remission or an enduring deficit unrelated to ADHD outcome. High-density EEG was recorded in a follow-up of 110 adolescents and young adults with childhood ADHD (87 persisters, 23 remitters) and 169 typically developing individuals during an arrow-flanker task, eliciting cognitive control. Functional connectivity was quantified with network-based graph-theory metrics before incongruent (high-conflict) target onset (pre-stimulus), during target processing (post-stimulus) and in the degree of change between pre-stimulus/post-stimulus. ADHD outcome was examined with parent-reported symptoms and impairment using both a categorical (DSM-IV) and a dimensional approach. Graph-theory measures converged in indicating that, compared to controls, ADHD persisters showed increased connectivity in pre-stimulus theta, alpha, and beta and in post-stimulus beta (all p < .01) and reduced prestimulus/post-stimulus change in theta connectivity (p < .01). In the majority of indices showing ADHD persister-control differences, ADHD remitters differed from controls (all p < .05) but not from persisters. Similarly, connectivity measures were unrelated to continuous outcome measures of ADHD symptoms and impairment in participants with childhood ADHD. These findings indicate that adolescents and young adults with persistent and remitted ADHD share atypical over-connectivity profiles and reduced ability to modulate connectivity patterns with task demands, compared to controls. Task-based functional connectivity impairments may represent enduring deficits in individuals with childhood ADHD irrespective of diagnostic status in adolescence/young adulthood.

Exploring individual and group differences in latent brain networks using cross-validated simultaneous component analysis	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Group component analysis; Multi-subject analysis; Multiway analysis; Parallel factor analysis; Parafac2; Tensor decomposition	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PARALLEL FACTOR-ANALYSIS; BLIND SEPARATION; FMRI DATA; NEOCORTICAL INTERACTIONS; STATISTICAL-MECHANICS; ANALYTIC ROTATION; PARAFAC; EEG; UNIQUENESS	Component models such as PCA and ICA are often used to reduce neuroimaging data into a smaller number of components, which are thought to reflect latent brain networks. When data from multiple subjects are available, the components are typically estimated simultaneously (i.e., for all subjects combined) using either tensor ICA or group ICA. As we demonstrate in this paper, neither of these approaches is ideal if one hopes to find latent brain networks that cross-validate to new samples of data. Specifically, we note that the tensor ICA model is too rigid to capture real-world heterogeneity in the component time courses, whereas the group ICA approach is too flexible to uniquely identify latent brain networks. For multi-subject component analysis, we recommend comparing a hierarchy of simultaneous component analysis (SCA) models. Our proposed model hierarchy includes a flexible variant of the SCA framework (the Parafac2 model), which is able to both (i) model heterogeneity in the component time courses, and (ii) uniquely identify latent brain networks. Furthermore, we propose cross-validation methods to tune the relevant model parameters, which reduces the potential of over-fitting the observed data. Using simulated and real data examples, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach for finding credible components that reveal interpretable individual and group differences in latent brain networks.

Learning to Expect: Predicting Sounds During Movement Is Related to Sensorimotor Association During Listening	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						sensory prediction; sensorimotor association; predictive comparison; TMS; EEG	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY; SENSORY CONSEQUENCES; COROLLARY DISCHARGE; MOTOR REACTIVATION; BASIC RESEARCH; INVERSE MODEL; SUPPRESSION; PERCEPTION; ADAPTATION	Sensory experiences, such as sound, often result from our motor actions. Over time, repeated sound-producing performance can generate sensorimotor associations. However, it is not clear how sensory and motor information are associated. Here, we explore if sensory prediction is associated with the formation of sensorimotor associations during a learning task. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) while participants produced index and little finger-swipes on a bespoke device, generating novel sounds. ERPs were also obtained as participants heard those sounds played back. Peak suppression was compared to assess sensory prediction. Additionally, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used during listening to generate finger-motor evoked potentials (MEPs). MEPs were recorded before and after training upon hearing these sounds, and then compared to reveal sensorimotor associations. Finally, we explored the relationship between these components. Results demonstrated that an increased positive-going peak (e.g., P2) and a suppressed negative-going peak (e.g., N2) were recorded during action, revealing some sensory prediction outcomes (P2: p = 0.050, eta(2)(p) = 0.208; N2: p = 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.474). Increased MEPs were also observed upon hearing congruent sounds compared with incongruent sounds (i.e., associated to a finger), demonstrating precise sensorimotor associations that were not present before learning (Index finger: p < 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.614; Little finger: p < 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.529). Consistent with our broad hypotheses, a negative association between the MEPs in one finger during listening and ERPs during performance of the other was observed (Index finger MEPs and Fz N1 action ERPs; r = -0.655, p = 0.003). Overall, data suggest that predictive mechanisms are associated with the fine-tuning of sensorimotor associations.

We investigated whether the emotional content of recent information might enhance its memory, making it as familiar as information known for a long time. We compared ERPs alternately recorded in response to old and solid information from long term memory (i.e., faces of popular movie stars), to recently acquired emotional information (faces of fictional characters), and to completely new information (faces of previously unknown people). Initially participants familiarized with the fictional police dossiers of 10 victims of dramatic deaths (recent faces), twice a day for seven days before EEG recordings. Recent faces were compared with faces of movie stars and unknown faces in an old/new recognition task. N200 and FN400 responses were affected by face familiarity (with no difference between old and recent faces), while parietal late positivity (LP) was sensitive to temporal recency, being it greater to old than recent faces. Interestingly, LP amplitude was similar for old and recent own-sex faces (victims) that were therefore equally memorable. It is shown that emotional memory can overcome temporal recency thus improving memory recall.

Is this activation driven by the regularity in the image, or can the network recover regularity of an object? We investigated whether the network responds to bilateral symmetry for dynamically occluded shapes, and thus responds to symmetry in the object. The stimulus was an irregular shape partly occluded by a rectangle. After 500 ms, the rectangle was displaced to the other side, occluding the previously visible half, and revealing the other half for 1000 ms. Therefore, no symmetry was present in the image at any point in time. Exp.1 and Exp. 2 used vertical and horizontal axis of reflection, and in Exp.3 there was no occluder. Participants could detect symmetry with > 80% accuracy. More importantly, ERP analysis showed a symmetry-specific response from similar to 300 ms after presentation of the second half of the shape. When integration was made from halves of asymmetric whole shapes (Exp.4), and when symmetry was not task-relevant (Exp.5), no symmetry response was recorded. The results show, for the first time, an electrophysiological evidence of symmetry representation in the brain obtained by assembling information over time into a unitary gestalt. The integration process occurs when observers look for symmetric matches between the parts, and only if these are perceived as belonging to the same object.	[Rampone, Giulia; Makin, Alexis D.

Perceived Gaze Direction Differentially Affects Discrimination of Facial Emotion, Attention, and Gender - An ERP Study	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						gaze direction; attention discrimination; emotion discrimination; gender discrimination; face perception; ERP	EYE GAZE; FACE PERCEPTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS/FIELDS; NEURAL RESPONSES; AVERTED GAZE; EXPRESSIONS; FIXATION; CONTACT; AUTISM; ADULTS	The perception of eye-gaze is thought to be a key component of our everyday social interactions. While the neural correlates of direct and averted gaze processing have been investigated, there is little consensus about how these gaze directions may be processed differently as a function of the task being performed. In a within-subject design, we examined how perception of direct and averted gaze affected performance on tasks requiring participants to use directly available facial cues to infer the individuals' emotional state (emotion discrimination), direction of attention (attention discrimination) and gender (gender discrimination). Neural activity was recorded throughout the three tasks using EEG, and ERPs time-locked to face onset were analyzed. Participants were most accurate at discriminating emotions with direct gaze faces, but most accurate at discriminating attention with averted gaze faces, while gender discrimination was not affected by gaze direction. At the neural level, direct and averted gaze elicited different patterns of activation depending on the task over frontal sites, from approximately 220-290 ms. More positive amplitudes were seen for direct than averted gaze in the emotion discrimination task. In contrast, more positive amplitudes were seen for averted gaze than for direct gaze in the gender discrimination task. These findings are among the first direct evidence that perceived gaze direction modulates neural activity differently depending on task demands, and that at the behavioral level, specific gaze directions functionally overlap with emotion and attention discrimination, precursors to more elaborated theory of mind processes.

We hypothesized that superior pitch discrimination is accompanied by enhanced lateral inhibition, a critical neural mechanism that sharpens the tuning curves of the auditory neurons in the tonotopy. Forty Mandarin-speaking healthy adults completed an auditory EEG experiment in which MMN was elicited by pitch height deviations in both pure and harmonic tones. Their behavioral pitch discrimination was indexed by the difference limens measured using pure and harmonic tones. Behavioral pitch discrimination correlated significantly with the MMN elicited by pure tones, but not by harmonic tones; this could be due to lateral inhibition strongly influencing the MMN elicited by harmonic tones but having less effect on the MMN elicited by pure tones. As lateral inhibition is a neural mechanism for attenuating the amplitude of MMN, our results support the notion that an enhanced lateral inhibition mechanism underlies superior pitch discrimination.

So-called bimodal odors stimulate both the olfactory and trigeminal nerve, and the interaction between these two systems shapes the perception of the odor. However, temporal encoding of these sensory systems during bimodal odor processing has received limited scientific attention.MethodsTo investigate this, we recorded the electrophysiological response in 17 participants to relatively unimodal olfactory (strawberry), trigeminal (l-isopulegol) and strongly bimodal (strawberry and l-isopulegol) stimuli.ResultsERP amplitudes and intensity ratings were significantly bigger for bimodal stimulation, as compared to unimodal stimulations. No significant difference was observed between N1 and P2 response latencies to olfactory and bimodal stimuli while responses to both stimuli showed longer latencies compared to the response of the trigeminal stimulus.ConclusionsResults provide further evidence of interaction between olfactory and trigeminal systems; additional activation of the olfactory system results in more vigorous electrophysiological responses and the experience of higher intensity. In addition, results indicate that the trigeminal system is faster to react to stimulation.ImplicationsThe current study offers a view on the temporal processing of bimodal odorants that are most likely to be encountered in the environment. We link the more vigorous electrophysiological response to a more complex odorant with activation of different neural structures.

However, the waves between the left and right hemispheres elicited by lateral targets usually exhibit a small amplitude difference and strong synchronicity, which may lead to low classification performance. Therefore, the present study explored the feasibility of a multiple correlated components analysis (MCORCA) methods to identify the lateral targets in visual search tasks with a single trial, which could weight the target signals by spatial filters to enlarge the amplitude difference between bilateral hemispheres and extract the linear combinations of multiple channels across trials with an optimal subset of correlated components to avoid the loss of efficient information. The classification rate achieved 82% with a single short-duration trial when using the proposed method with Leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV). The findings demonstrated that the MCORCA-based methods could be used to improve the classification performance for the N2pc-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in visual search.

Blunted neural response to gains versus losses associated with both risk-prone and risk-averse behavior in a clinically diverse sample	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; ERP; psychopathology; reward positivity; risk taking	MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; DECISION-MAKING; ALCOHOL-USE; TAKING PROPENSITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; VULNERABILITY FACTOR; FEEDBACK NEGATIVITY; REWARD SENSITIVITY; TASK BART; DOPAMINE	Reduced responsiveness to reward has been associated with both risk-prone and risk-averse behavior, common features of externalizing and internalizing psychopathology, respectively. Thus, evidence has suggested a potential quadratic relationship (i.e., inverted U) between reward sensitivity and risk-taking propensity. Blunted response to reward compared to loss may therefore demonstrate transdiagnostic utility as it relates to different patterns of maladaptive risk behavior. The current study sought to disentangle the relationship between risk and reward in a clinically diverse sample. In a sample of 210 adults (aged 18-30), the RewP (an ERP indexing differentiation between rewards and losses) was measured during a monetary guessing game, and risk-taking propensity was measured with a behavioral task (i.e., BART) that simulates real-world risk taking. Participants also completed clinical assessments to assess for lifetime psychopathology. Results indicated that there was no linear association between the RewP and risk-taking propensity; however, there was a significant quadratic relationship. Thus, a reduced sensitivity to reward receipt was associated with both risk-prone and risk-averse behavior. There was also a significant quadratic relationship between the RewP and money won during the BART, indicating that being too risk prone or risk averse is disadvantageous and leads to missed reward. Overall, these findings suggested that blunted neural differentiation between gains and losses may contribute to deficits in effectively weighing reward and loss and result in maladaptive risk-taking behavior. These findings support continued examination of reward dysfunction dimensionally in order to better characterize behavioral profiles implicated in clinical phenotypes.

Many preterm children show some form of attention deficits in later life. However, there is ambiguity about the nature and extent of these attention deficits in the literature. Moreover, the majority of studies investigated attention functions in preterm children on a symptom based level or using neuropsychological tasks. In contrast, neurophysiological studies have been comparatively scarce which will be addressed in the current study. Methods: We investigated attention functioning in 27 low risk preterm children and 20 term children of 5-6 years of age by using EEG recording in an attention driven task (oddball task). Results: Compared with term children, preterm children showed no attention deficits on a symptom level, but failed to show an increased oddball P3. Conclusion: Current results suggest subclinical attentional changes in preterm children on the electro-physiological level in contrast to normal performance in attentional behavioral tests. Significance: Our results emphasize to have a closer look at preterm children early in preschool age even though clinically relevant symptoms seem to be absent.

J	Berggren, N; Eimer, M				Berggren, Nick; Eimer, Martin			The Roles of Relevance and Expectation for the Control of Attention in Visual Search	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-HUMAN PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE			English	Article						selective attention; top-down control; visual expectancy; feature-based attention; event-related brain potentials	WORKING-MEMORY; CONTROL SETTINGS; TASK SET; CAPTURE; PROBABILITY; INFORMATION; CONTINGENT; CAPACITY; SALIENCE; FEATURES	Representations of target-defining features (attentional templates) control the allocation of attention during visual search. We investigated whether template-guided attentional selectivity is sensitive not only to the relevance of visual features, but also to expectations about their probability. Search displays could contain a target in an expected (80%) or unexpected (20%) color. They were preceded by spatially uninformative cues that matched either the expected or unexpected target color. These color cues attracted attention, reflected by behavioral spatial cueing effects and by cue-elicited N2pc components obtained via EEG measured during task performance. Critically, these attentional capture effects were identical for both color cues, suggesting that preparatory attentional templates only reflect relevance, and are insensitive to expectations about target color probabilities. In contrast, RTs and N2pc components to search targets in the unexpected color were delayed, showing that expectations modulated the speed of attentional target selection within search displays. This dissociation between the effects of relevance and expectation on attentional preparation versus target selection suggests that these 2 parameters for attentional control are represented differently. Task relevance is likely to be specified at the level of individual features, whereas expectations could be represented in an object-based fashion.

However, evidence in support of embodied semantics-in particular the hypothesised contribution of motor and premotor cortex to the representation of action concepts - is varied. Here, we tested the hypothesis that, consistent with semantic embodiment, sensorimotor cortices will rapidly become active while healthy participants access the meaning of visually-presented motor and non-motor action verbs. Event-related potentials revealed early differential processing of motor and non-motor verbs (164-203 ms) within distinct regions of cortex likely reflecting rapid cortical activation of differentially distributed semantic representations. However, we found no evidence for a specific role of sensorimotor cortices in supporting these representations. Moreover, we observed a later modulation of the alpha band (8-12 Hz) from 555-785 ms over central electrodes, with estimated generators within the left superior parietal lobule, which may reflect post-lexical activation of the object-directed features of the motor action concepts. In conclusion, we find no evidence for a specific role of sensorimotor cortices when healthy participants judge the meaning of visually-presented action verbs. However, the relative contribution of sensorimotor cortices to action comprehension may vary as a function of task goals.

Development of brain functional connectivity and its relation to infant sustained attention in the first year of life	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; RECOGNITION-MEMORY; VISUAL-STIMULI; SMALL-WORLD; ORGANIZATION; EEG; CHILDREN; ATLAS; SYNCHRONIZATION	The study of brain functional connectivity is crucial to understanding the neural mechanisms underlying the improved behavioral performance and amplified ERP responses observed during infant sustained attention. Previous investigations on the development of functional brain connectivity during infancy are primarily confined to the use of functional and structural MRI techniques. The current study examined the relation between infant sustained attention and brain functional connectivity and their development during infancy with high-density EEG recordings. Fifty-nine infants were tested at 6 (N = 15), 8 (N =14), 10 (N = 17), and 12 (N = 13) months. Infant sustained attention was defined by measuring infant heart rate changes during infants' looking. Functional connectivity was estimated from the electrodes on the scalp and with reconstructed cortical source activities in brain regions. It was found that infant sustained attention was accompanied by attenuated functional connectivity in the dorsal attention and default mode networks in the alpha band. Graph theory analyses showed that there was an increase in path length and a decrease in clustering coefficient during infant sustained attention. The functional connectivity within the visual, somatosensory, dorsal attention, and ventral attention networks and graph theory measures of path length and clustering coefficient were found to increase with age. These findings suggest that infant sustained attention is accompanied by distinct patterns of brain functional connectivity. The current findings also suggest the rapid development of functional connectivity in brain networks during infancy.

The neurodevelopment related to conflict control is crucial for the development of cognitive and emotional abilities in children. In the current study, preadolescent children and adults completed the Simon and Stroop tasks in emotional and non-emotional contexts with simultaneous electroencephalography recordings. The behavioral findings showed that adults had faster response speed and better conflict control performance compared to children. Children's accuracy was affected by the emotional context, whereby children had a lower accuracy in the emotional contexts compared to the non-emotional contexts. Adults had similar performances in both contexts. During the neural processes of conflict detection and conflict resolution, children had longer N2 latencies for conflict detection, and devoted more neural efforts with larger P3 amplitudes to execute resolution control on the conflicts than adults. Moreover, both age groups' reaction times (RT) were shorter in the Simon task than in the Stroop task in the non-emotional context, while, RTs were longer in the Simon task than in the Stroop task in the emotional context. Children showed larger P3 responses in the Simon task than in the Stroop task in the emotional contexts, while adults showed no such differences. The current findings demonstrate that children have immature neurodevelopment of conflict control compared to adults, and their cognitive control processes on conflicts were distracted by the emotional contexts. Children's emotional conflict control processes were also affected by the characteristic of conflict types, and they need to devote more neural effort to process Simon-like conflicts than Stroop-like conflicts compared to adults.

J	Sedley, W				Sedley, William			Tinnitus: Does Gain Explain?	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						tinnitus; gain; neurophysiology; electroencephalography; functional imaging; psychophysics	DORSAL COCHLEAR NUCLEUS; ENRICHED ACOUSTIC ENVIRONMENT; EVOKED MAGNETIC-FIELDS; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PRIMARY AUDITORY-CORTEX; SOUND-LEVEL TOLERANCE; HIDDEN HEARING-LOSS; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; NEURAL ACTIVITY	Many, or most, tinnitus models rely on increased central gain in the auditory pathway as all or part of the explanation, in that central auditory neurones deprived of their usual sensory input maintain homeostasis by increasing the rate at which they fire in response to any given strength of input, including amplifying spontaneous firing which forms the basis of tinnitus. However, dramatic gain changes occur in response to damage to the auditory periphery, irrespective of whether tinnitus occurs. This article considers gain in its broadest sense, summarizes its contributory processes, neural manifestations, behavioral effects, techniques for its measurement, pitfalls in attributing gain changes to tinnitus, a discussion of the minimum evidential requirements to implicate gain as a necessary and/or sufficient basis to explain tinnitus, and the extent of existing evidence in this regard. Overall there is compelling evidence that peripheral auditory insults induce changes in neuronal firing rates, synchrony and neurochemistry and thus increase gain, but specific attribution of these changes to tinnitus is generally hampered by the absence of hearing-matched human control groups or insult-exposed non-tinnitus animals. A few studies show changes specifically attributable to tinnitus at group level, but the limited attempts so far to classify individual subjects based on gain metrics have not proven successful. If gain turns out to be unnecessary or insufficient to cause tinnitus, candidate additional mechanisms include focused attention, resetting of sensory predictions, failure of sensory gating, altered sensory predictions, formation of pervasive memory traces and/or entry into global perceptual networks.

Reactivation of Previous Experiences in a Working Memory Task	PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						serial dependence; working memory; ERP decoding; previous trial decoding; open data	REPETITION; STATES; BRAIN; EEG	Recent experiences influence the processing of new information even when those experiences are irrelevant to the current task. Does this reflect the indirect effects of a passively maintained representation of the previous experience, or is this representation reactivated when a new event occurs? To answer this question, we attempted to decode the orientation of the stimulus on the previous trial from the electroencephalogram on the current trial in a working memory task. Behavioral data confirmed that the previous-trial stimulus orientation influenced the reported orientation on the current trial, even though the previous-trial orientation was now task irrelevant. In two independent experiments, we found that the previous-trial orientation could be decoded from the current-trial electroencephalogram, indicating that the current-trial stimulus reactivated or boosted the representation of the previous-trial orientation. These results suggest that the effects of recent experiences on behavior are driven, in part, by a reactivation of those experiences and not solely by the indirect effects of passive memory traces.

Language is a multi- and cross-level phenomenon, with sequential interdependencies and correlations between various lexical dimensions. A recently-developed method allows the analysis of neural time series during natural story comprehension: time-resolved multiple regression. It consists in modelling continuous brain recordings with multiple regression after embedding linguistic features in a temporal-extension matrix (a distributed-lags model). It identifies neural correlates of linguistic processes, accounting for temporal interdependencies - simultaneously for, e.g. acoustics, phonology and semantics. This has resulted in impactful discoveries about how brains process coherent speech, potentially broadening the class of phenomena that can be studied. I discuss the method conceptually, highlight caveats, and relate it to similar as well as to traditional methods, all with a particular consideration for analysing the processing of coherent narratives. In a practical example, the word frequency-dependent N400 effect is estimated from a half-hour continuous narrative.

However, evidence regarding the neural substrates of sad emotion regulation is limited. Women have higher rates for affective disorders than men, but insufficient outcomes assess how aerobic exercises modulate central frontal activation in sad emotion inhibition and resilience among healthy women. This study investigated the effects of aerobic exercise-related brain activity on sad emotion inhibition processing in young women. Sad facial Go/No-Go and neutral Go/No-Go trials were conducted among 30 healthy young women to examine the changes in the N2 component, which reflects frontal inhibition responses, between pre-exercise and post-exercise periods. The first test was performed before aerobic exercise (baseline; 1st) and the second test was performed during an absolute rest period of 90min after exercise. The sad No-Go stimuli that evoked N200 (N2) event-related potential were recorded and analyzed. The results showed that in the sad No-Go trials, N2 activation at the central-prefrontal cortex was significantly attenuated after exercise compared to the baseline N2 activation. Exercise-modulated N2 activation was not observed in the neutral No-Go trials. The behavioral error rates of sad No-Go trials did not differ between the two experiments. A reduced engagement of central-frontal activation to sad No-Go stimuli was shown after exercise. However, behavioral performance was consistent between the two measurements. The findings scope the benefits of the aerobic exercise on the neural efficiency in responding to sad emotion-eliciting cues as well as adaptive transitions reinstatement for regulatory capabilities in healthy young women.

The Role of Neuronal Oscillations in Visual Active Sensing	FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						active sensing; cognition; attention; oscillations; phase reset; eye movement; saccade; predictive coding	GAMMA-BAND SYNCHRONIZATION; WORKING-MEMORY; EYE-MOVEMENTS; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; FIELD POTENTIALS; FRONTAL THETA; CORTEX; PHASE; EEG; ALPHA	Visual perception is most often studied as a "passive" process in which an observer fixates steadily at point in space so that stimuli can be delivered to the system with spatial precision. Analysis of neuronal signals related to vision is generally keyed to stimulus onset, stimulus movement, etc.; i.e., events external to the observer. In natural "active" vision, however, information is systematically acquired by using eye movements including rapid (saccadic) eye movements, as well as smooth ocular pursuit of moving objects and slower drifts. Here we consider the use of alternating saccades and fixations to gather information from a visual scene. The underlying motor sampling plan contains highly reliable information regarding "where" and "when" the eyes will land, this information can be used predictively to modify firing properties of neurons precisely at the time when this "contextual" information is most useful - when a volley of retinal input enters the system at the onset of each fixation. Analyses focusing on neural events leading to and resulting from shifts in fixation, as well as visual events external to the observer, can provide a more complete and mechanistic understanding of visual information processing. Studies thus far suggest that active vision may be a fundamentally different from that process we usually study with more traditional passive viewing paradigms. In this Perspective we note that active saccadic sampling behavior imposes robust temporal patterning on the activity of neuron ensembles and large-scale neural dynamics throughout the brain's visual pathways whose mechanistic effects on information processing are not yet fully understood. The spatio-temporal sequence of eye movements elicits a succession of temporally predictable quasi-rhythmic sensory inputs, whose encoding is enhanced by entrainment of low frequency oscillations to the rate of eye movements. Review of the pertinent findings underscores the fact that temporal coordination between motor and visual cortices is critical for understanding neural dynamics of active vision and posits that phase entrainment of neuronal oscillations plays a mechanistic role in this process.

This study proposes a new BCI technique to increase the number of commands in a single BCI system without loss of accuracy. New method: We expected that a flickering action video with left and right elbow movements could simultaneously activate the different pattern of event-related desynchronization (ERD) according to the video contents (e.g., left or right) and steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP). The classification accuracy to discriminate left, right, and rest states was compared under the three following feature combinations: SSVEP power (19-21 Hz), Mu power (8-13 Hz), and simultaneous SSVEP and Mu power. Results: The SSVEP feature could discriminate the stimulus condition, regardless of left or right, from the rest condition, while the Mu feature discriminated left or right, but was relatively poor in discriminating stimulus from rest. However, combining the SSVEP and Mu features, which were evoked by the stimulus with a single frequency, showed superior performance for discriminating all the stimuli among rest, left, or right. Comparison with the existing method: The video contents could activate the ERD differently, and the flickering component increased its accuracy, such that it revealed a better performance to discriminate when considering together. Conclusions: This paradigm showed possibility of increasing performance in terms of accuracy and number of commands with a single frequency by applying flickering action video paradigm and applicability to rehabilitation systems used by patients to facilitate their mirror neuron systems while training.

Reduced Theta Power During Memory Retrieval in Depressed Adults	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY-COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE AND NEUROIMAGING			English	Article						Depression; EEG; Memory; Retrieval; Theta; Time frequency	EPISODIC MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; HUMAN HIPPOCAMPUS; BRAIN NETWORKS; DEFAULT-MODE; GAMMA-BAND; RECOLLECTION; RECOGNITION; OSCILLATIONS; FAMILIARITY	BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with poor recollection, but the neural mechanisms responsible for this deficit are unclear. Recollection is supported by interactions between the hippocampus and cortex that appear to be mediated by oscillatory activity in the theta band (4-7 Hz) and that are elicited during source memory retrieval. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that evoked theta power during source memory retrieval would be reduced in MDD, as this would provide a physiological basis for deficient recollection in adults with depression. METHODS: Morlet wavelets were applied to event-related potentials collected from 24 unmedicated adults with MDD and 24 healthy control adults during the retrieval of source and semantic memories. Whole-scalp analyses focused on group differences in evoked theta power. RESULTS: There were no group differences in behavior. Nevertheless, from 400 to 799 ms, theta power was broadly reduced in adults with depression versus healthy adults. This reduction was observed during source and semantic retrieval. Parietal midline electrodes showed significantly reduced theta power during source-but not semantic-retrieval in adults with depression versus healthy adults in this interval. Furthermore, theta power over parietal midline sites from 400 to 799 ms was more strongly related to source memory accuracy in healthy adults versus adults with depression. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to healthy control adults, adults with depression showed reduced theta power during memory retrieval and a weaker relationship between parietal midline theta power and source memory accuracy. These findings indicate that abnormal theta signals may contribute to memory deficits in adults with MDD.

Although research has shown that we spend a substantial amount of time focused on thoughts and feelings that are intrinsically generated, evaluating such internal states, purely on psychological grounds can be restrictive. In this review of the different methods used to examine patterns of ongoing thought, we emphasise how the process of triangulation between neuroimaging techniques, with self-reported information, is important for the development of a more empirically grounded account of ongoing thought. Specifically, we show how imaging techniques have provided critical information regarding the presence of covert states and can help in the attempt to identify different aspects of experience.

The aim of the study was to investigate the differences of functional interaction between brain regions and performance during the P50 sensory gating in UHR group compared with those in first-episode schizophrenia patients (FESZ) and healthy controls (HC) groups. The study included 128-channel scalp Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings during the P50 auditory paradigm for 35 unmedicated FESZ, 30 drug-free UHR, and 40 HC. Cortical sources of scalp electrical activity were recomputed using exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA), and functional brain networks were built at the source level and compared between the groups (FESZ, UHR, HC). A classifier using decision tree was designed for differentiating the three groups, which uses demographic characteristics, MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery parameters, behavioral features in P50 paradigm, and the measures of functional brain networks based on graph theory during P50 sensory gating. The results showed that very few brain connectivities were significantly different between FESZ and UHR groups during P50 sensory gating, and that a large number of brain connectivities were significantly different between FESZ and HC groups and between UHR and HC groups. Furthermore, the FESZ group had a stronger connection in the right superior frontal gyrus and right insula than the HC group. And the UHR group had an enhanced connection in the paracentral lobule and the middle temporal gyrus compared with the HC group. Moreover, comparison of classification analysis results showed that brain network metrics during P50 sensory gating can improve the accuracy of the classification for FESZ, UHR and HC groups. Our findings provide insight into the mechanisms of P50 suppression in schizophrenia and could potentially improve the performance of early identification and diagnosis of schizophrenia for the earliest intervention.

Association Between P300 Responses to Auditory Oddball Stimuli and Clinical Outcomes in the Psychosis Risk Syndrome	JAMA PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ULTRA-HIGH RISK; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; 1ST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; UNTREATED PSYCHOSIS; SCALP TOPOGRAPHY; MENTAL STATE; INDIVIDUALS; AMPLITUDE; DURATION	IMPORTANCE In most patients, a prodromal period precedes the onset of schizophrenia. Although clinical criteria for identifying the psychosis risk syndrome (PRS) show promising predictive validity, assessment of neurophysiologic abnormalities in at-risk individuals may improve clinical prediction and clarify the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. OBJECTIVE To determine whether P300 event-related potential amplitude, which is deficient in schizophrenia, is reduced in the PRS and associated with clinical outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Auditory P300 data were collected as part of the multisite, case-control North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS-2) at 8 university-based outpatient programs. Participants included 552 individuals meeting PRS criteria and 236 healthy controls with P300 data. Auditory P300 data of participants at risk who converted to psychosis (n=73) were compared with those of nonconverters who were followed up for 24 months and continued to be symptomatic (n=135) or remitted from the PRS (n=90). Data were collected from May 27, 2009, to September 17, 2014, and were analyzed from December 3, 2015, to May 1, 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Baseline electroencephalography was recorded during an auditory oddball task. Two P300 subcomponents were measured: P3b, elicited by infrequent target stimuli, and P3a, elicited by infrequent nontarget novel stimuli. RESULTS This study included 788 participants. The PRS group (n=552) included 236 females (42.8%) (mean [SD] age, 19.21 [4.38] years), and the healthy control group (n=236) included 111 females (47.0%) (mean [SD] age, 20.44 [4.73] years). Target P3b and novelty P3a amplitudes were reduced in at-risk individuals vs healthy controls (d=0.37). Target P3b, but not novelty P3a, was significantly reduced in psychosis converters vs nonconverters (d=0.26), and smaller target P3b amplitude was associated with a shorter time to psychosis onset in at-risk individuals (hazard ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.04-2.00; P=.03). Participants with the PRS who remitted had baseline target P3b amplitudes that were similar to those of healthy controls and greater than those of converters (d=0.51) and at-risk individuals who remained symptomatic (d=0.41). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, deficits in P300 amplitude appeared to precede psychosis onset. Target P3b amplitudes, in particular, may be sensitive to clinical outcomes in the PRS, including both conversion to psychosis and clinical remission.

J	Verbaarschot, C; Farquhar, J; Haselager, P				Verbaarschot, Ceci; Farquhar, Jason; Haselager, Pim			Free Wally: Where motor intentions meet reason and consequence	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Consciousness; EEG; ERD; Free will; Motor intention; Readiness potential	CONSCIOUS INTENTION; BRAIN; POTENTIALS; MOVEMENT; TIME	To investigate the neural preparation and awareness of an intention to act, neuroscientists typically examine spontaneous movements: self-paced flexions of the hand or foot. However, these movements may not present a straightforward case of intended action as they are performed in absence of reasons to act and without the evaluation of action consequences. Therefore, a common criticism of these studies is that they lack ecological validity, because the results do not generalize to the more societally relevant deliberate actions that we perform in daily life. We agree that research on intended action should include reason-based deliberate actions in order to be more relevant for debates about human agency and free will. Therefore, we have developed a computer game called "Free Wally", which invites players to perform deliberate actions to achieve a goal. Free Wally provides a controlled environment for studying deliberate intended action, by presenting information for deciding whether or not to act, what action to perform and when to perform it, incorporating all basic components of an ecologically valid intended act. As a first step to validate our setup, we compare this game to a second computer game that measures spontaneous actions in a traditional way. While playing either game, the timing of the experienced intentions to act is measured using a real-time probing method. Moreover, the neural preparation for action is measured in terms of the (lateralized) readiness potential and alpha/beta event-related desynchronization across the motor cortex. No differences were found between the games in these last stages of action preparation, suggesting that the Free Wally game can be used to study intended action. However, differences in earlier stages during intention formation are to be expected. With Free Wally as a tool, we hope to encourage further research into the formation and content of ecologically valid motor intentions.

From self-induced to perceived errors - A generalized over-monitoring activity in obsessive-compulsive disorder	EUROPEAN NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						OCD; Error-monitoring; EEG; ERN	FRONTAL MIDLINE THETA; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; RIGHT EXPERIENCES; PHASE SYNCHRONY; ERP COMPONENTS; CORTEX; ADJUSTMENTS; DYSFUNCTION; NEGATIVITY	Well-functioning error monitoring of the inner and outer environments is essential for adaptively altering behavior, while malfunction characterizes conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The underlying brain processing is manifested as Error-Related Negativity (ERN) signal elicited following error comission, and Perceived Error Related Theta Activity (PERTA) signal elicited following detection of discrepancy in the environment. Yet, while enhanced ERN was repeatedly demonstrated in OCD patients and was found to be potentiated among their unaffected first degree relatives, no comparable observations were reported with regard to PERTA. We recorded EEG activity while OCD patients, OCD patients' siblings (Family), and healthy controls (HC) performed computerized tasks. For the examination of ERN we used the Stroop task and for the examination of PERTA we presented correct and incorrect mathematical equations. Increased ERN (0-120 ms post response) was observed in both the OCD and Family groups, but only the OCD patients' signal significantly differed from that of HC's. Similarly, modified PERTA activity was observed in both the OCD and Family groups in the N1 peak (65-125 ms post perceived error), but only for the OCD group this activity significantly differed from that of HC. Both ERN and PERTA's N1 are fast occurring peaks, which suggests that OCD is associate with a constantly over-activated detection system that monitors the inner and outer environment and reacts promptly following detection of a mistake. Furthermore, the modified but non-significantly different activity of the Family group suggests that the patholog-ical condition evolves in vulnerable individuals with neuronal predisposition.

Auditory sensory memory span for duration is severely curtailed in females with Rett syndrome	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; MECP2 DUPLICATION; FREQUENCY; CHILDREN; DEFICITS; DISCRIMINATION; INFORMATION; IMPAIRMENT; EXPRESSION; RECEPTORS	Rett syndrome (RTT), a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene, is typified by profound cognitive impairment and severe language impairment, rendering it very difficult to accurately measure auditory processing capabilities behaviorally in this population. Here we leverage the mismatch negativity (MMN) component of the event-related potential to measure the ability of Rh patients to decode and store occasional duration deviations in a stream of auditory stimuli. Sensory memory for duration, crucial for speech comprehension, has not been studied in RTT. High-density electroencephalography was successfully recorded in 18 females with Rh and 27 age-matched typically developing (TD) controls (aged 6-22 years). Data from seven Rh and three TD participants were excluded for excessive noise. Stimuli were 1 kHz tones with a standard duration of 100 ms and deviant duration of 180 ms. To assess the sustainability of sensory memory, stimulus presentation rate was varied with stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) of 450, 900, and 1800 ms. MMNs with maximum negativity over fronto-central scalp and a latency of 220-230 ms were clearly evident for each presentation rate in the TD group, but only for the shortest SOA in the Rh group. Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant group by SOA interaction. MMN amplitude correlated with age in the TD group only. MMN amplitude was not correlated with the Rett Syndrome Severity Scale. This study indicates that while Rh patients can decode deviations in auditory duration, the span of this sensory memory system is severely foreshortened, with likely implications for speech decoding abilities.

This, however, can be complicated when different sensory inputs compete for the brain's limited resources. Under such conditions, sensory processes interact with top-down attention to selectively process goal-relevant stimuli, while inhibiting irrelevant or distracting sensory signals. In the current study, we set out to provide causal mechanistic insights for whether and how prefrontal regions are involved in resolving attentional-perceptual conflicts. To this end, we applied atDCS and examined neurophysiological processes of selective auditory perception. To evaluate whether atDCS differentially affects intermingled neurophysiological subprocesses involved during conflict resolution, we decomposed the EEG data using residue iteration decomposition (RIDE). We show that the right prefrontal regions are causally involved in resolving attentional-perceptual conflicts and that atDCS increases the efficacy to do so. The data show that dissociable neurophysiological signals are specifically affected by atDCS. Conflict resolution processes that involve inhibition of competing stimuli and response evaluation and are associated with right middle frontal gyrus (BA46) seem to become intensified by atDCS during the resolution of attentional-perceptual conflicts. After stimulation the early stimulus processing level was also less prone to sensory conflicts, but this alone could not explain the increased behavioral efficacy associated with atDCS. These observed effects likely reflect changes in neuronal gain control mechanisms. Taken together, results of this study may have implications for treating attentional hyperactivity disorder, for which pharmacological intervention is currently the common therapeutic approach.

Egocentric processing in the roll plane and dorsal parietal cortex: A TMS-ERP study of the subjective visual vertical	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Subjective visual vertical; TMS-EEG; Intraparietal sulcus; Visual-vestibular interaction	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; VENTRAL INTRAPARIETAL AREA; SPATIAL NEGLECT; BRAIN-STEM; VESTIBULAR CORTEX; LESIONS AFFECT; ATTENTION; PERCEPTION; HUMANS; REPRESENTATION	The intraparietal sulcus within the dorsal right posterior parietal cortex is associated with spatial orientation and attention in relation to egocentric reference frames, such as left or right hemifield. It remains unclear whether it plays a causal role in the human in the roll plane (i.e. when visual stimuli are tilted clockwise or anticlockwise) which this is an important aspect of egocentric visual processing with clinical relevance in vestibular disorders. The subjective visual vertical (SVV) task measures the deviation between an individual's subjective vertical perception and the veridical vertical, involves the integration of visual, and vestibular information, and relies on a distributed network of multisensory regions that shows right lateralization and inter-areal inhibition. This study used combined TMS-EEG to investigate the role of the human dorsal parietal cortex in verticality perception using the SVV task in darkness. Participants were sorted according to their baseline bias at this task i.e. those with either a slight counterclockwise versus clockwise bias when judging a line to be truly vertical. Right parietal TMS facilitated verticality perception, reducing the difference between groups. ERPs suggested that the behavioral TMS effect occurred through normalizing individual SVV biases, evident frontally and late in the trial, and which was abolished after right parietal TMS. Effects were site and task specific, shown with a homologous left hemisphere control, and a landmark task performed on the same stimuli. These results support a right lateralization of visual-vestibular cognition and a distinct representation of the roll plane for egocentric processing in dorsal parietal cortex.

Telepresence is a subfield of the robotic-assisted route, where human plays the role of an operator, sending high-level instructions to an as sistive robot while receiving sensory feedback. However, for severely motor-impaired people, conventional interaction modalities may not be suitable due to their complete paralysis. Thus, designing alternative ways of interaction such as Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) is essential for a telepresence capability. We propose a novel framework that integrates a BCI system and a humanoid robot to develop a brain-controlled telepresence system with multimodal control features. In particular, the low-level control is executed by Programming by Demonstration (PbD) models, and the higher-level cognitive commands are produced by a BCI system to perform vital ADLs. The presented system is based on real-time decoding of attention-modulated neural responses elicited in the brain electroencephalographic signals and generating multiple control commands. As a result, the system allows a user to interact with a humanoid robot while receiving auditory and visual feedback from the robot's sensors.

Neurophysiological Activity Following Rewards and Losses Among Female Adolescents and Young Adults With Borderline Personality Disorder	JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						borderline personality disorder; adolescents; reward positivity; P300; time-frequency decomposition	MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; NEURAL RESPONSES; MONETARY; POSITIVITY; THETA; IMPULSIVITY; DEPRESSION; PREDICTION; CHILDHOOD; VALIDITY	Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a complex and debilitating psychiatric illness. Prior research in adults has shown that neurophysiological deficits in feedback processing and learning from rewards may be central to the development of BPD; however, little research has examined these markers in adolescents and young adults with BPD. The present study used event-related potentials and time-frequency decomposition analysis to probe neural responses to wins and losses in a guessing task among 68 females (13 to 23 years old) either with BPD (n = 35) or no history of mental disorders (healthy control [HC]; n = 33). Participants completed a guessing task wherein they won and lost money at equal frequencies while elecooencephalogram (EEG) data were acquired. Adolescents and young adults with BPD showed a smaller differentiation between wins and losses in the reward positivity (RewP) relative to HCs. Using time-frequency decomposition, we isolated distinct frequency bands sensitive to wins (delta = <3Hz) and losses (theta = 4 Hz to 7 Hz). Compared with BPD participants, HCs showed significantly larger delta power to wins, specifically. The groups did not differ in delta power to lasses, nor theta power to wins or losses. Collectively, findings implicate altered reward processing in the pathophysiology of BPD and may inform early identification and targeted intervention.

This is an adaptive strategy because it can increase the quality of a decision, and previous behavioral work has shown that decision-makers engage in such confidence-driven information-seeking. The present study aimed to characterize the neural markers that mediate the relationship between confidence and information-seeking. A paradigm was used in which 17 human participants (9 male) made an initial perceptual decision, and then decided whether or not they wanted to sample more evidence before committing to a final decision and confidence judgment. Predecisional and postdecisional event-related potential components were similarly modulated by the level of confidence and by information-seeking choices. Time-resolved multivariate decoding of scalp EEG signals first revealed that both information-seeking choices and decision confidence could be decoded from the time of the initial decision to the time of the subsequent information-seeking choice (within-condition decoding). Noabove-chance decoding was visible in the preresponse time window. Crucially, a classifier trained to decode high versus low confidence predicted information-seeking choices after the initial perceptual decision (across-condition decoding). This time window corresponds to that of a postdecisional neural marker of confidence. Collectively, our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that neural indices of confidence are functionally involved in information-seeking decisions.

This is broadly interpreted as evidence of a concentration of memory resources to the attended, to-be-remembered stimulus. However, online attentional selection is known to additionally depend on distractor inhibition, raising the viable alternative that attentional deployment in working memory involves inhibitory control processes. Here, we demonstrate that active inhibition plays a central role in the deployment of attention in working memory. We do so using a retroactive cueing paradigm, where a briefly presented memory array is followed by a cue indicating a to-be-remembered target (Experiment 1) or a to-be-forgotten distractor (Experiment 2). We identify discrete indices of target selection and distractor inhibition in lateralized oscillatory activity over visual areas. When a retroactive cue identifies the location of a target, results show rapid decrease of lateral, targete-licited alpha band activity, representing attentional orienting toward the target. This is followed only later by emergence of an increase in distractor-elicited alpha activity, reflecting distractor inhibition. In contrast, when the retroactive cue identifies a distractor, evidence of distractor inhibition emerges first, only later followed by target selection. These results thus demonstrate that separate excitatory and inhibitory processes underlie the deployment of attention on the level of working memory representations.

Attention shifting and subliminal cueing under high attentional load: an EEG study using emotional faces	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						attention; awareness; lateralised ERPs		Emotional expressions and attentional processes interact such that emotion increases perceptual sensitivity in modality-specific brain areas leading to more efficient processing of the stimulus. In the current study, we asked the question of whether the emotional expressions can be processed subliminally when faces are attended but the emotional expression is irrelevant. We presented angry and neutral male and female faces supraliminally and subliminally to participants in an attention-shifting paradigm. Emotional expression was irrelevant to the task, but the gender of the face was predictive of the location of a subsequent target. Analysis of reaction times revealed that, in the supraliminal condition, targets appearing at validly cued locations produced quicker responses than targets at invalidly cued locations. Target-locked event-related potentials (ERPs) confirmed this result and showed that attention selection elicited higher responses at attended locations, as reflected by the N1 component. However, voluntary attention shifting was not triggered when the cue was not consciously perceived. No effects of emotion were observed following target presentation, suggesting that the high attentional load required by the experiment may have prevented the processing of emotion for undetectable faces, as demonstrated by the fact that, following cue onset, the N170 was modulated by emotion in supraliminal trials only. We therefore show that emotional expressions cannot be processed without awareness when faces are attended, but the emotional expression is irrelevant. Copyright (C) 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The role of horizontal facial structure on the N170 and N250	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article							TRIAL EEG DYNAMICS; FACE RECOGNITION; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; INVERTED FACES; EFFECT SIZE; INVERSION; SENSITIVITY; IDENTIFICATION; ORIENTATION; PERCEPTION	Recent studies have shown that horizontal facial structure is important for face identification (Dakin and Watt, 2009; Goffaux and Dakin, 2010). Also, sensitivity to horizontal structure is associated with the size of the face inversion effect (Pachai et al., 2013). However, it is unclear how the N170 and N250, two components of visual event-related potentials ERPs that have been implicated in face perception, are modulated by oriented facial structure in an upright face identification task. Here, we recorded ERPs and behavioural accuracy from adult observers performing a 1-of-6 face identification task in conditions that parametrically manipulated the orientation structure of upright faces. Faces were filtered with ideal orientation filters centred on either 0 (horizontal) or 90 deg (vertical). Filter bandwidth was varied across conditions from +/- 45 to +/- 90 deg in steps of +/- 9 deg. As has been reported previously, response accuracy was significantly higher for faces that contained horizontal structure than vertical structure, and the horizontal-vertical difference was correlated with accuracy for unfiltered faces. In addition, the N170 and N250 were affected by the manipulation of horizontal facial structure. Furthermore, for the N250, but not the N170, the relative sensitivity to horizontal compared to vertical facial structure was significantly correlated with identification accuracy for unfiltered faces. We suggest that in a face identification task, the N250 but not the N170 is modulated by the amount of diagnostic information conveyed by horizontal structure.

However, findings on associations between single DA polymorphisms and inhibitory control often are mixed, partly due to their small effect sizes. In the present study, a cumulative genetic score (CGS) was used: alleles previously associated with both impulsive behavior and lower baseline DA level, precisely the DRD4 Exon III 7-repeat, DAT1 VNTR 10-repeat and the COMT 158val allele, each added a point to the DA-CGS. Participants (N = 128) completed a Go/No-Go task varying in difficulty and EEG recordings were made with focus on the NoGo-P3, an ERP that reflects inhibitory response processes. We found a higher DA-CGS (lower basal/tonic DA level) to be associated with better performance (lower %FA and more adaptive responding) in the very demanding/rapid than in the less demanding/rapid condition, whereas the reverse pattern was true for individuals with a lower DA-CGS. A similar interaction pattern of DA-CGS and task condition was found for NoGo-P3 amplitude. In line with assumptions of distinct optimum DA levels for different cognitive demands, a DA-CGS-dependent variation of tonic DA levels could have modulated the balance between cognitive stability and flexibility, thereby affecting the optimal DA level required for the specific task condition. Moreover, a task demand-dependent phasic DA release might have added to the DA-CGS-related basal/tonic DA levels, thereby additionally affecting the balance between flexibility and stability, in turn influencing performance and NoGo-P3.

We used 32 channel electroencephalograms (EEG) to record the P300 responses and 3T Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to determine gray matter volume. We recruited 36 native-Dutch speaking healthy older subjects, equally divided in two sub-groups of 52-64 and 65-76 years old, administered a battery of cognitive tests and recorded their demographics, EEGs and task performance; additionally, 16 adults from the second sub-group underwent an MRI scan. We found significant differences between age groups in their cognitive tests performance, P300 amplitudes for the frontal and parietal electrodes for the most difficult task, and P300 latencies for frontal, central and parietal electrodes for all three tasks difficulty levels. Interesting, sex and education affected cognitive and P300 results. Higher education was related to higher accuracy, and P300 amplitudes and shorter latencies. Moreover, females exhibited higher P300 amplitudes and shorter latencies, and better cognitive tasks performance compared to males. Additionally, for the 16 adults underwent to MRI scan, we found positive correlations between P300 characteristics in frontal, central and parietal areas and gray matter volume, controlling for demographic variables and TIV, but also showing that age, sex, and education correlate with gray matter volume. These findings provide support that age, sex, and education affect an individual's cognitive, neurophysiological and structural characteristics, and therefore motivate the need to further investigate these in relation to P300 responses and gray matter volume in healthy elderly.

In the last two decades, a great deal of research has focused on error-related potential (ErrP) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Many applications have been developed to assist motor-impaired people in their rehabilitation and among these are robots, spellers, gesture recognition systems, and brain-controlled wheelchairs. In this paper, we present a review of various ErrP based BCI that can potentially aid motor-disabled people in their rehabilitation and execution of their daily activities. First, we describe the ErrP phenomenon and its characteristics followed by a comprehensive application-driven discussion on ErrP based rehabilitation and assistive strategies for motor-impaired people, including studies conducted since the inception of ErrP to the current state-of-the-art applications. Lastly, we discuss the potential issues and challenges being faced by current state-of-the-art applications as well as important future pathways and research directions that might be adopted for advanced ErrP-BCIs used in clinical settings.

The major challenges are introduced due to inter- and intra-beat variation, spectral overlap of heart and lung sounds and noise picked from environment. This paper presents a robust algorithm for heart beat localization and classification using variable length window and peak amplitude threshold variation. The technique presented in this paper first attempts to find peaks which correspond to the fundamental heart sound cycle (FHSC) i.e. S1 ,S2, S1, ... or fundamental heart sound period (FHSP) i.e. S1, S1, .... If FHSC/FHSP is found, an attempt is made to extend it to the whole signal. Once extended, the signal is directly labeled using systole and diastole durations. During classification, history of labels is used to counter the heart rate variations. The proposed technique is evaluated on publicly available Pascal Heart Sound Challenge dataset and reports smaller average error for localization and has high sensitivity and accuracy for heart beat classification.

Online asynchronous decoding of error-related potentials during the continuous control of a robot	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; COMMUNICATION; ERP; BCI	Error-related potentials (ErrPs) are the neural signature of error processing. Therefore, the detection of ErrPs is an intuitive approach to improve the performance of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). The incorporation of ErrPs in discrete BCIs is well established but the study of asynchronous detection of ErrPs is still in its early stages. Here we show the feasibility of asynchronously decoding ErrPs in an online scenario. For that, we measured EEG in 15 participants while they controlled a robotic arm towards a target using their right hand. In 30% of the trials, the control of the robotic arm was halted at an unexpected moment (error onset) in order to trigger error-related potentials. When an ErrP was detected after the error onset, participants regained the control of the robot and could finish the trial. Regarding the asynchronous classification in the online scenario, we obtained an average true positive rate (TPR) of 70% and an average true negative rate (TNR) of 86.8%. These results indicate that the online asynchronous decoding of ErrPs was, on average, reliable, showing the feasibility of the asynchronous decoding of ErrPs in an online scenario.

Callousness and meanness traits are associated with increased N2 amplitude in a community sample of adolescents and adults	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						callous-unemotional; meanness; psychopathy; go/no-go; N2; P3	PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS; TRIARCHIC MODEL; ERP; IMPULSIVENESS; AGGRESSION; INHIBITION; BOLDNESS	The lack of consistent findings in the research field of psychopathy unveils the heterogeneity of this personality structure and, therefore, a dissociation of its phenotypic components is a promising venue to conciliate paradoxical results. The current study aims to assess the dissociable effects of psychopathic traits on N2 and P3 modulation, while analyzing the stability of some endophenotypic processes across development. A sample of adolescents (n = 33) and adults (n = 31) completed, respectively, the Youth Psychopathy Inventory and the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure and performed the same Go/No-Go task during an EEG recording. For adolescents, the unemotionality and remorselessness subdimensions of the callous-unemotional (CU) factor predicted, respectively, reduced N2 and P3 amplitudes. This suggests impaired inhibitory control in both subdimensions of the broad CU factor. However, the callousness subdimension of the CU factor predicted increased N2 amplitude. This pattern of findings was also observed for meanness in adults, which leads to the hypothesis that callousness traits may be a specific precursor of meanness.

This language had an NP1-NP2-verb (actor-initial or undergoer-initial) order. The presence or absence of the case markers was based on animacy. After being exposed to this language in the lab, participants made grammaticality judgments for novel sentences while their EEG was recorded. Our findings support actor-undergoer asymmetries: at the case-marked NP1, there was a larger N400 for the actor's case violations; at the NP2, there was a more significant N400-Late Positivity for the inanimate case violations. Especially, the inanimate actor' s case violation led to an N400 with an earlier onset. Furthermore, it was also observed that Chinese transfer effects could happen at a cue-level. As the learners' language exposure increased, they could successfully make use of animacy rather than word order, until they mastered the case-marking rules. Our results may shed some new light on neurophysiological mechanisms of language learning as well as on foreign language teaching.

Mood disorders are associated with aberrant neural processing of emotion in regions overlapping with 'maternal sensitivity networks' which could compromise maternal processing of infant signals. This systematic review aimed to integrate findings from studies of neural responses to infant stimuli in healthy mothers and in mothers with mood disorders. We included original studies using functional brain imaging and electrophysiological techniques. The databases psycINFO and PubMed were searched for eligible articles until January 2019. Twenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria, none of which investigated mothers with bipolar disorder or remitted unipolar disorder. Studies were characterized by large methodological heterogeneity. The most consistent findings were that healthy mothers exhibit stronger and faster neural responses to infant stimuli than non-mothers in key emotional processing regions including the amygdala, insula and orbitofrontal cortex, which is accentuated for own infants. Motherswith acute depression display blunted neural responses within these regions which correlates with greater depression severity.

Aim To verify whether the semantic processing of complex visual stimuli such as repetition, identity, order and double incongruence is recursive or computable. Subjects and methods 27 university students responded to an adapted N400 paradigm with five conditions, each with 80 tasks, while recording their brain activity with a 64-channel cap. Results Two temporal windows of 400 to 550 ms and 550 to 800 ms were analyzed using an ANOVA contrast of the condition factor by regions of interest. In addition, the inverse solution of the windows was calculated by low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) to identify the main sources related to the electrical power. The significant differences (p <0.05) in the results for the N400 and P600 in frontal and centroparietal areas in the logical operators studied are corroborated. Conclusion It is confirmed that the brain processing of complex images is modulated by repetition, identity and order, but not by negation. Therefore, it can be said that the semantic processing of complex images is semi-computable.

J	Berggren, N; Eimer, M				Berggren, Nick; Eimer, Martin			Visual working memory load disrupts the space-based attentional guidance of target selection	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						event-related potentials; memory load; N2pc component; visual attention; visual working memory	TOP-DOWN CONTROL; SEARCH; CAPTURE; DISTRACTION; TEMPLATES; N2PC	During visual search, the selection of target objects is guided by stored representations of target-defining features (attentional templates). It is commonly believed that such templates are maintained in visual working memory (WM), but empirical evidence for this assumption remains inconclusive. Here, we tested whether retaining non-spatial object features (shapes) in WM interferes with attentional target selection processes in a concurrent search task that required spatial templates for target locations. Participants memorized one shape (low WM load) or four shapes (high WM load) in a sample display during a retention period. On some trials, they matched them to a subsequent memory test display. On other trials, a search display including two lateral bars in the upper or lower visual field was presented instead, and participants reported the orientation of target bars that were defined by their location (e.g., upper left or lower right). To assess the efficiency of attentional control under low and high WM load, EEG was recorded and the N2pc was measured as a marker of attentional target selection. Target N2pc components were strongly delayed when concurrent WM load was high, indicating that holding multiple object shapes in WM competes with the simultaneous retention of spatial attentional templates for target locations. These observations provide new electrophysiological evidence that such templates are maintained in WM, and also challenge suggestions that spatial and non-spatial contents are represented in separate independent visual WM stores.

Neural Correlates of Enhanced Audiovisual Processing in the Bilingual Brain	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						audiovisual integration; bilingualism; double-flash illusion; temporal binding; experience-dependent plasticity	WHITE-MATTER INTEGRITY; HEARING LIPS; SPEECH; NOISE; INTEGRATION; SOUND; RECOGNITION; PERCEPTION; LISTENERS; WINDOW	Bilingualism is associated with enhancements in perceptual and cognitive processing necessary for juggling multiple languages. Recent psychophysical studies demonstrate bilinguals also show enhanced multisensory processing and more restricted temporal binding windows for integrating audiovisual information. Here, we probed the neural mechanisms of bilinguals' audiovisual benefits. We recorded neuroelectric responses in mono- and bi-lingual listeners to the double-flash paradigm in which auditory beeps concurrent with a single visual flash induces the perceptual illusion of multiple flashes. Relative to monolinguals, bilinguals showed less susceptibility to the illusion (fewer false perceptual reports) coupled with stronger and faster event-related potentials to audiovisual information. Source analyses of EEG data revealed monolinguals' increased propensity for erroneously perceiving audiovisual stimuli was attributed to increased activity in primary visual (V1) and auditory cortex (PAC), increases in multisensory association areas (BA 37), but reduced frontal activity (BA 10). Regional activations were associated with an opposite pattern of behaviors: whereas stronger V1 and PAC activity predicted slower behavioral responses, stronger frontal BA10 responses elicited faster judgments. Our results suggest bilinguals' higher precision in audiovisual perception reflects more veridical sensory coding of physical cues coupled with superior top-down gating of sensory information to suppress the generation of false percepts.

Neural Signal to Violations of Abstract Rules Using Speech-Like Stimuli	ENEURO			English	Article						auditory processing; EEG; predictive coding	MISMATCH-NEGATIVITY MMN; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN RESPONSES; PHONEMIC RESTORATION; PREDICTION; CONSCIOUSNESS; PERCEPTION; COMPONENT; CONTEXT; ORGANIZATION	As the evidence of predictive processes playing a role in a wide variety of cognitive domains increases, the brain as a predictive machine becomes a central idea in neuroscience. In auditory processing, a considerable amount of progress has been made using variations of the Oddball design, but most of the existing work seems restricted to predictions based on physical features or conditional rules linking successive stimuli. To characterize the predictive capacity of the brain to abstract rules, we present here two experiments that use speech-like stimuli to overcome limitations and avoid common confounds. Pseudowords were presented in isolation, intermixed with infrequent deviants that contained unexpected phoneme sequences. As hypothesized, the occurrence of unexpected sequences of phonemes reliably elicited an early prediction error signal. These prediction error signals do not seemed to be modulated by attentional manipulations due to different task instructions, suggesting that the predictions are deployed even when the task at hand does not volitionally involve error detection. In contrast, the amount of syllables congruent with a standard pseudoword presented before the point of deviance exerted a strong modulation. Prediction error's amplitude doubled when two congruent syllables were presented instead of one, despite keeping local transitional probabilities constant. This suggests that auditory predictions can be built integrating information beyond the immediate past. In sum, the results presented here further contribute to the understanding of the predictive capabilities of the human auditory system when facing complex stimuli and abstract rules.

Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of MI-based BCI-feedback training in post-stroke rehabilitation. However, in the earliest stage of the training, calibration data typically contain insufficient discriminability, resulting in unreliable feedback, which may decrease subjects' motivation and even hinder their training. To improve the performance in the early stages of MI training, a novel hybrid BCI paradigm based on MI and P300 is proposed in this study. In this paradigm, subjects are instructed to imagine writing the Chinese character following the flash order of the desired Chinese character displayed on the screen. The event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) phenomenon is produced with writing based on one's imagination. Simultaneously, the P300 potential is evoked by the flash of each stroke. Moreover, a fusion method of P300 and MI classification is proposed, in which unreliable P300 classifications are corrected by reliable MI classifications. Twelve healthy naive MI subjects participated in this study. Results demonstrated that the proposed hybrid BCI paradigm yielded significantly better performance than the single-modality BCI paradigm. The recognition accuracy of the fusion method is significantly higher than that of P300 (p < 0.05) and MI (p < 0.01). Moreover, the training data size can be reduced through fusion of these two modalities.

Electroencephalographic Biomarkers for Treatment Response Prediction in Major Depressive Illness: A Meta-Analysis	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENT RESPONSE; AUDITORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION; ANTERIOR CINGULATE ACTIVITY; QEEG PREFRONTAL CORDANCE; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; LOUDNESS DEPENDENCE; CLINICAL-RESPONSE	Objective: Reducing unsuccessful treatment trials could improve depression treatment. Quantitative EEG (QEEG) may predict treatment response and is being commercially marketed for this purpose. The authors sought to quantify the reliability of QEEG for response prediction in depressive illness and to identify methodological limitations of the available evidence. Method: The authors conducted a meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy for QEEG in depressive illness, based on articles published between January 2000 and November 2017. The review included all articles that used QEEG to predict response during a major depressive episode, regardless of patient population, treatment, or QEEG marker. The primary meta-analytic outcome was the accuracy for predicting response to depression treatment, expressed as sensitivity, specificity, and the logarithm of the diagnostic odds ratio. Raters also judged each article on indicators of good research practice. Results: In 76 articles reporting 81 biomarkers, the meta-anatytic estimates showed a sensitivity of 0.72 (95% CI= 0.67-0.76) and a specificity of 0.68 (95% CI =0.63- 0.73). The logarithm of the diagnostic odds ratio was 1.89 (95% CI= 1.56-2.21), and the area under the receiver operator curve was 0.76 (95% CI = 0.71- 0.80). No specific QEEG biomarker or specific treatment showed greater predictive power than the all-studies estimate in a meta-regression. Funnel plot analysis suggested substantial publication bias. Most studies did not use ideal practices. Conclusions: QEEG does not appear to be clinically reliable for predicting depression treatment response, as the literature is limited by underreporting of negative results, a lack of out-of-sample validation, and insufficient direct replication of previous findings. Until these limitations are remedied, QEEG is not recommended for guiding selection of psychiatric treatment.	[Widge, Alik S.; Bilge, M.

The norepinephrine (NE) system has been shown to modulate these oscillations possibly via gain control mechanisms, which depend on the modulation of neuron membrane potentials. Because the latter are also modulated by tDCS, the interrelation of tDCS and NE effects on superior frontal theta band activity needs investigation. We test the hypothesis that anodal tDCS affects modulatory effects of the NE system on theta band activity during inhibitory control in superior frontal regions. Using EEG beamforming, theta band activity in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) was integrated (correlated) with the pupil diameter data as an indirect index of NE activity. In a within-subject design, healthy participants completed a response inhibition task in two sessions in which they received 2mA anodal tDCS over the vertex, or sham stimulation. There were no behavioral effects of anodal tDCS. Yet, tDCS affected correlations between SFG theta band activity time course and the pupil diameter time course. Correlations were evident after sham stimulation (r=.701; p<.004), but absent after anodal tDCS. The observed power of this dissociation was above 95%. The data suggest that anodal tDCS may eliminate neuromodulatory effects, likely of the NE system, on theta band activity during response inhibition in a structure of the response inhibition network. The NE system and tDCS seem to target similar mechanisms important for cognitive control in the prefrontal cortex. The results provide a hint why tDCS often fails to induce overt behavioral effects and shows that neurobiological systems, which may exert similar effects as tDCS on neural processes should closely be monitored in tDCS experiments.

Bouncing back: Brain rehabilitation amid opioid and stimulant epidemics	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Review						(max 6): Opioid; Methamphetamine; Cocaine; Neuroimaging; Abstinence; Recovery	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; COCAINE-DEPENDENT INDIVIDUALS; WHITE-MATTER INTEGRITY; COGNITIVE CONTROL; WORKING-MEMORY; USE DISORDERS; METHAMPHETAMINE USE; CINGULATE CORTEX; CUE REACTIVITY	Recent methamphetamine and opioid use epidemics are a major public health concern. Chronic stimulant and opioid use are characterized by significant psychosocial, physical and mental health costs, repeated relapse, and heightened risk of early death. Neuroimaging research highlights deficits in brain processes and circuitry that are linked to responsivity to drug cues over natural rewards as well as suboptimal goal-directed decision-making. Despite the need for interventions, little is known about (1) how the brain changes with prolonged abstinence or as a function of various treatments; and (2) how symptoms change as a result of neuromodulation. This review focuses on the question: What do we know about changes in brain function during recovery from opioids and stimulants such as methamphetamine and cocaine? We provide a detailed overview and critique of published research employing a wide array of neuroimaging methods - functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, event-related potentials, diffusion tensor imaging, and multiple brain stimulation technologies along with neurofeedback - to track or induce changes in drug craving, abstinence, and treatment success in stimulant and opioid users. Despite the surge of methamphetamine and opioid use in recent years, most of the research on neuroimaging techniques for recovery focuses on cocaine use. This review highlights two main findings: (1) interventions can lead to improvements in brain function, particularly in frontal regions implicated in goal-directed behavior and cognitive control, paired with reduced drug urges/craving; and (2) the targeting of striatal mechanisms implicated in drug reward may not be as cost-effective as prefrontal mechanisms, given that deep brain stimulation methods require surgery and months of intervention to produce effects. Overall, more studies are needed to replicate and confirm findings, particularly for individuals with opioid and methamphetamine use disorders.

J	Oralhan, Z				Oralhan, Zeki			A New Paradigm for Region-Based P300 Speller in Brain Computer Interface	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Brain computer interface; P300; Human machine systems; P300 Speller	VISUAL-STIMULI; AMPLITUDE; LATENCY; SYSTEM; SIGNAL; TASK; HEAD; P3A	Electroencephalography-based brain computer interface systems could provide alternative communication methods for severely disabled people who cannot use their neuromuscular systems. The P300 signal is one of the event related potentials that are used for brain computer interface systems. The most important performance parameter of a P300 based brain computer interface system is information transfer rate that is calculated by using classification accuracy and P300 signal detection time. Moreover, P300 speller has a very critical role for classification accuracy and information transfer rate in a P300 based brain computer interface. Although most of studies are about row column based P300 speller in literature, region based P300 speller proved that has higher classification accuracy than row column based one. There are very few studies about region based P300 speller. This study aims to investigate methods for obtaining higher classification accuracy and information transfer rate with using region based P300 speller that constituted audio and visual stimulus. This is the first research that using audio and visual stimulus for a region based P300 speller in literature. Previous studies about region based P300 spellers focused on spellers with only visual stimulus types. Our new paradigm presents region based P300 spellers with only audio, only visual, and audio-visual stimuli. Audio-visual P300 speller structure is the newest model for region based spellers. The subject focused on the desired character stimulus. We used the stepwise linear discriminant analysis method for classification that either included the desired P300 signal or not. According to stepwise linear discriminant analysis, the mean classification accuracy value of the experiment was 90.31% with the audio-visual region based P300 speller. With this new paradigm, classification accuracy in the audio-visual P300 speller was improved 15.69% and 66,99% according to the visual only and audio only P300 speller that we used in the experiments, respectively.

The effect of cooperation on reward valuation also remains unclear. In this study, we conducted two experiments to examine the effect of effort on reward valuation (Experiment 1) and whether this effect can be influenced by cooperation (Experiment 2), using electroencephalogram (EEG) technology. We found that when participants worked alone, they generated a larger feedback-related negativity (FRN) amplitude for losing rewards than for gaining rewards, with more effort resulting in larger FRN amplitudes for losing rewards. However, when participants worked together with a partner, there was no significant difference between the amplitude for gaining rewards and that for losing rewards during low-effort tasks. Nevertheless, for high-effort tasks, the FRN amplitude for losing rewards was significantly larger than that for gaining rewards. Moreover, in both experiments, we found larger N1 amplitudes for gaining rewards than for losing rewards. Our ERP results suggest that in the early stage of processing, people pay extra attention to rewards, after that the effort level influences their reward valuation. In addition, cooperation regulates the reduced valuation of losing rewards only when people invest low effort.

Speech-specific audiovisual integration modulates induced theta-band oscillations	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; SEEING-VOICES; VISUAL SPEECH; HEARING-LIPS; EEG; COMPREHENSION; FACILITATION; PERCEPTION	Speech perception is influenced by vision through a process of audiovisual integration. This is demonstrated by the McGurk illusion where visual speech (for example /ga/) dubbed with incongruent auditory speech (such as /ba/) leads to a modified auditory percept (/da/). Recent studies have indicated that perception of the incongruent speech stimuli used in McGurk paradigms involves mechanisms of both general and audiovisual speech specific mismatch processing and that general mismatch processing modulates induced theta-band (4-8 Hz) oscillations. Here, we investigated whether the theta modulation merely reflects mismatch processing or, alternatively, audiovisual integration of speech. We used electroencephalographic recordings from two previously published studies using audiovisual sine-wave speech (SWS), a spectrally degraded speech signal sounding nonsensical to naive perceivers but perceived as speech by informed subjects. Earlier studies have shown that informed, but not naive subjects integrate SWS phonetically with visual speech. In an N1/P2 event-related potential paradigm, we found a significant difference in theta-band activity between informed and naive perceivers of audiovisual speech, suggesting that audiovisual integration modulates induced theta-band oscillations. In a McGurk mismatch negativity paradigm (MMN) where infrequent McGurk stimuli were embedded in a sequence of frequent audio-visually congruent stimuli we found no difference between congruent and McGurk stimuli. The infrequent stimuli in this paradigm are violating both the general prediction of stimulus content, and that of audiovisual congruence. Hence, we found no support for the hypothesis that audiovisual mismatch modulates induced theta-band oscillations. We also did not find any effects of audiovisual integration in the MMN paradigm, possibly due to the experimental design.

Elucidating the glutamatergic processes underlying mismatch negativity deficits in early stage bipolar disorder and schizophrenia: A combined H-1-MRS and EEG study	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article							MAGNETIC-RESONANCE-SPECTROSCOPY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; AUDITORY P300; OLDER-ADULTS; TOBACCO USE; MMN; GLUTATHIONE; SPECTRUM; ASSOCIATIONS	Impairments in mismatch negativity (MMN) in schizophrenia are well-established; these findings have been extended to show impairments at early illness stages and in bipolar disorder. A substantial literature supports MMN as an index of NMDA receptor output, however, few studies have conducted in vivo assessments to elucidate the neurochemical underpinnings of MMN. Sixty young (16-33 years) participants with bipolar disorder (n = 47) or schizophrenia (n = 13) underwent H-1-MRS and MMN assessment. Glutamate over creatine (Glu/Cr) levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and hippocampus were determined and MMN was measured frontally and temporally. Correlational analyses assessed the relationship between MMN amplitudes and Glu/Cr. Any significant relationships were assessed for specificity with a follow up correlation analysis of MMN and n-acetyleaspartate (NAA/Cr). No associations between frontal or temporal MMN and ACC or hippocampal Glu/Cr were noted in the bipolar group. In the schizophrenia group, frontal and right temporal MMN amplitudes corresponded with increased ACC Glu/ Cr at the trend-level. Right temporal MMN was similarly significantly associated with NAA/Cr. MMN was not associated with hippocampal Glu/Cr. This work provides in vivo evidence that glutamatergic processes may underlie MMN generation in early stage schizophrenia but not in early stage bipolar disorder suggesting differences in the MMN mechanism in these groups. The negative association between ACC Glu/Cr and MMN is consistent with findings of reduced MMN and increased in vivo glutamatergic neurometabolite levels in early stage schizophrenia. Furthermore, these results indicate that examining in vivo NAA/Cr may have provide additional insights into the MMN mechanism in schizophrenia.

The yield of long-term electrocardiographic recordings in refractory focal epilepsy	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						cardiac arrhythmias; ECG; epilepsy; implantable loop recorders; sudden unexpected death in epilepsy	SUDDEN UNEXPECTED DEATH; RISK-FACTORS; MECHANISMS; SYNCOPE; EEG; PEOPLE	Objective To determine the incidence of clinically relevant arrhythmias in refractory focal epilepsy and to assess the potential of postictal arrhythmias as risk markers for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Methods We recruited people with refractory focal epilepsy without signs of ictal asystole and who had at least one focal seizure per month and implanted a loop recorder with 2-year follow-up. The devices automatically record arrhythmias. Subjects and caregivers were instructed to make additional peri-ictal recordings. Clinically relevant arrhythmias were defined as asystole >= 6 seconds; atrial fibrillation < 55 beats per minute (bpm), or > 200 bpm and duration > 30 seconds; persistent sinus bradycardia < 40 bpm while awake; and second- or third-degree atrioventricular block and ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation. We performed 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) and tilt table testing to identify non-seizure-related causes of asystole. Results We included 49 people and accumulated 1060 months of monitoring. A total of 16 474 seizures were reported, of which 4679 were captured on ECG. No clinically relevant arrhythmias were identified. Three people had a total of 18 short-lasting (<6 seconds) periods of asystole, resulting in an incidence of 2.91 events per 1000 patient-months. None of these coincided with a reported seizure; one was explained by micturition syncope. Other non-clinically relevant arrhythmias included paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (n = 2), supraventricular tachycardia (n = 1), and sinus tachycardia with a right bundle branch block configuration (n = 1). Significance We found no clinically relevant arrhythmias in people with refractory focal epilepsy during long-term follow-up. The absence of postictal arrhythmias does not support the use of loop recorders in people at high SUDEP risk.

Here we investigated how the human brain implements this dynamic process by adopting a reward-modulated Simon task while acquiring EEG and fMRI data in separate sessions. In the Simon task, a lateral target stimulus triggers an automatic response tendency of the spatially corresponding hand, which needs to be overcome if the activated hand is opposite to what the task requires, thereby delaying the response. We associated high or low reward with different targets, the location of which could be congruent or incongruent with the correct response hand. High-reward targets elicited larger Simon effects than low-reward targets, suggesting an increase in the automatic response tendency induced by the stimulus location. This tendency was accompanied by modulations of the lateralized readiness potential over the motor cortex, and was inhibited soon after if the high-reward targets were incongruent with the correct response hand. Moreover, this process was accompanied by enhanced theta oscillations in medial frontal cortex and enhanced activity in a frontobasal ganglia network. With dynamical causal modeling, we further demonstrated that the connection from presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA) to right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) played a crucial role in modulating the reward-modulated response inhibition. Our results support a dynamic neural model of reward-induced response activation and inhibition, and shed light on the neural communication between reward and cognitive control in generating adaptive behaviors.

Pain Expressions and Inhibitory Control in Patients With Fibromyalgia: Behavioral and Neural Correlates	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain electrical activity; chronic pain; cognitive dysfunction; emotion; attention; pain; inhibitory control	ATTENTIONAL BIAS; SPANISH VERSION; CATASTROPHIZING SCALE; STROOP INTERFERENCE; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; EMOTION REGULATION; INFORMATION; THREAT; MEMORY; VALIDATION	Fibromyalgia (FM) is a generalized chronic pain condition associated with a variety of symptoms, including altered cognitive and emotional processing. It has been proposed that FM patients show a preferential allocation of attention to information related to the symptoms of the disease, particularly to pain cues. However, the existing literature does not provide conclusive evidence on the presence of this attentional bias, and its effect on cognitive functions such as inhibitory control. To clarify this issue, we recorded the electroencephalographic activity of 31 women diagnosed with FM and 28 healthy women, while performing an emotional Go/NoGo task with micro-videos of pain, happy, and neutral facial expressions. We analyzed behavioral data, performed EEG time-frequency analyses, and obtained the event-related potentials (ERPs) N2 and P3 components in NoGo trials. A series of self-reports was also administered to evaluate catastrophic thinking and the main symptoms of fibromyalgia. Pain expressions were associated with longer reaction times and more errors, as well as with higher theta and delta power, and P3 amplitude to NoGo stimuli. Thus, behavioral and psychophysiological data suggest that increased attention to pain expressions impairs the performance of an inhibitory task, although this effect was similar in FM patients and healthy controls. N2 amplitude was modulated by type of facial expression (larger to pain faces), but only for the control group. This finding suggests that the presentation of pain faces might represent a smaller conflict for the patients, more used to encounter pain stimuli. No main group effects were found significant for N2 or P3 amplitudes, nor for time-frequency data. Using stimuli with greater ecological validity than in previous studies, we could not confirm a greater effect of attentional bias toward negative stimuli over inhibitory performance in patients with FM. Studying these effects allow us to better understand the mechanisms that maintain pain and develop intervention strategies to modify them.	[Pidal-Miranda, Marina; Gonzalez-Villar, A.

For this, the amplitudes of early and late Bereitschaftspotential (early BP and late BP) from 12 patients and 12 controls were obtained while they performed spontaneous button presses under different levels of volitional experience. In the first condition, participants were distracted from their motor actions by a mental task (automatic condition) and in the second condition they were instructed to attending to their own intention to move (willed condition). The results corroborate previous report that the attention to (and, presumably, the awareness of) intention to act accounts for the expression of significant portion of the late BP in healthy individuals. More relevantly, the increased late BP in willed condition in relation to automatic condition was not present in the OCD group. Neither groups nor conditions affected the early BP. In sum, the current findings suggest the existence of abnormalities in the brain activities associated with the establishment of volitional control in OCD patients.

The motivation of this research is to develop a passive brain computer interface that can predict the occurence of this critical phenomenon during real flight conditions. Ten volunteers, equipped with a dry-EEG system, had to fly a challenging flight scenario while responding to auditory alarms by button press. The behavioral results disclosed that the pilots missed 36% of the auditory alarms. ERP analyses confirm that this phenomenon affects auditory processing at an early (N100) and late (P300) stages as the consequence of a potential attentional bottleneck mechanism. Inter-subject classification was carried out over frequency features extracted three second epochs before the alarms' onset using sparse representation for classification (SRC), sparse and dense representation (SDR) and more conventional approach such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA), shrinkage LDA and nearest neighbor (1-NN). In the best case, SRC and SDR gave respectively a performance of 66.9% and 65.4% of correct mean classification rate to predict the occurrence of inattentional deafness, outperforming LDA (60.6%), sLDA (60%) and 1NN (59.6%). These results open promising perspectives for the implementation of neuroadaptive automation with as ultimate goal to enhance alarm stimulation delivery so that it is perceived and acted upon.

Scarcity Disrupts the Neural Encoding of Black Faces: A Socioperceptual Pathway to Discrimination	JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						scarcity; face perception; race; prejudice; fMRI; N170	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS; ECONOMIC-CONDITIONS; INTERGROUP THREAT; RACIAL BIAS; RACE; BRAIN; MEDIATION; PERCEPTION; PREJUDICE; MODEL	When economic resources are scarce, racial minorities are often devalued and disenfranchised. We proposed that this pattern extends to visual processing, such that the encoding of minority group faces is disrupted under scarcity-an effect that may facilitate discrimination and contribute to racial disparities. Specifically, we used EEG and fMRI to test whether scarce economic conditions induce deficits in neural encoding of Black faces, and we examined whether this effect is associated with discriminatory resource allocation in behavior. In Study 1, framing resources as scarce (vs. neutral) selectively impaired the neural encoding of Black (vs. White) faces, as indexed by a delayed face-related N170 ERP response, and the degree of this encoding deficit predicted anti-Black allocation decisions. In Study 2, we replicated and extended this effect using fMRI: Resources framed as scarce (vs. neutral) reduced face-sensitive fusiform activity to Black (vs. White) faces. Furthermore, scarcity-decreased fusiform activity to Black faces corresponded with decreased valuation-related striatum activity to predict anti-Black allocation decisions. These findings suggest that impaired visual processing and devaluation occur selectively for minorities under scarcity-an implicit effect that may promote discrimination and contribute to rising disparities observed during economic stress.

One important influence on these mechanisms is the perceptual characteristics of the stimuli. We investigated the impact of perceptual similarity between targets and nontargets (T-N similarity) in a visual search task using EEG. Participants searched for a predefined target letter among five nontargets. The T-N similarity was manipulated with three levels: high, middle, and low. We tested for the influences of T-N similarity on an ERP (e.g., N2pc) and alpha oscillations. We observed a significant N2pc effect across all levels of similarity. The N2pc amplitude was reduced and occurred later for high similarity relative to low and middle similarities. We also showed that the N2pc amplitude was inversely correlated with the RTs across all similarities. Importantly, we found a significant alpha phase adjustment about the same time as the N2pc for high similarity; by contrast, no such effect was observed for middle and low similarities. Finally, we showed a positive correlation between the phase-locking value and the N2pc-the stronger the alpha phase-locking value, the larger the N2pc, when the T-N similarity was high. In conclusion, our results provide novel evidence for multiple competitive mechanisms during visual search.

The Emergence of Hierarchical Somatosensory Processing in Late Prematurity	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						brain development; EEG; ERP; mechanical stimulation; pre-term neonates	TIBIAL-NERVE-STIMULATION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; MEDIAN NERVE; PRETERM INFANTS; WHITE-MATTER; BRAIN; CORTEX; MATURATION; RESPONSES; TERM	The somatosensory system has a hierarchical organization. Information processing increases in complexity from the contralateral primary sensory cortex to bilateral association cortices and this is represented by a sequence of somatosensory-evoked potentials recorded with scalp electroencephalographies. The mammalian somatosensory system matures over the early postnatal period in a rostro-caudal progression, but little is known about the development of hierarchical information processing in the human infant brain. To investigate the normal human development of the somatosensory hierarchy, we recorded potentials evoked by mechanical stimulation of hands and feet in 34 infants between 34 and 42 weeks corrected gestational age, with median postnatal age of 3 days. We show that the shortest latency potential was evoked for both hands and feet at all ages with a contralateral somatotopic source in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI). However, the longer latency responses, localized in SI and beyond, matured with age. They gradually emerged for the foot and, although always present for the hand, showed a shift from purely contralateral to bilateral hemispheric activation. These results demonstrate the rostro-caudal development of human somatosensory hierarchy and suggest that the development of its higher tiers is complete only just before the time of normal birth.

J	Proverbio, AM; De Gabriele, V				Proverbio, Alice Mado; De Gabriele, Valeria			The other-race effect does not apply to infant faces: An ERP attentional study	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Parental response; Baby schema; ERPs; Face processing; Social cognition; Orbitofrontal cortex	OWN-RACE; TIME-COURSE; RECOGNITION; PERCEPTION; SYSTEM; INHIBITION; RESPONSES; CONTACT; SEX; LOCALIZATION	It is known that paedomorphic characteristics, called ''baby schema'' by Lorenz, trigger an orienting response in adults, are judged as attractive and stimulate parental care. On the other hand, it is known that ethnicity may influence face encoding, with an advantage in recognizing faces of their own ethnicity (called own-race effect). Some have argued that this effect holds also for infant faces, which conflicts with the "baby schema" phenomenon. The aim of the study was to investigate the possible presence of the own-race effect on infant vs. adult face processing. Seventeen Caucasian students participated to the study. Their EEG/ERPs were recorded as they watched 400 pictures of adult and infant faces of different ethnicity (half Caucasian, half non-Caucasian), and subsequently responded to a target orientation. The behavioral results showed that responses were faster when the target was preceded by a child face, which enhanced the arousal level, regardless of ethnicity. The electrophysiological results showed an enhanced anterior N2 response to infant than adult faces, and a lack of ORE effect only for infant faces. Overall, the data indicate that baby faces automatically attract the adult viewer's attention and that face ethnicity has no effect on this innate response.

J	Alexander, DM; Ball, T; Schulze-Bonhage, A; van Leeuwen, C				Alexander, David M.; Ball, Tonio; Schulze-Bonhage, Andreas; van Leeuwen, Cees			Large-scale cortical travelling waves predict localized future cortical signals	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; MAGNETIC-FIELD; SINGLE-TRIAL; EEG; PHASE; INFORMATION; INTERVALS; GRADIENTS	Predicting future brain signal is highly sought-after, yet difficult to achieve. To predict the future phase of cortical activity at localized ECoG and MEG recording sites, we exploit its predominant, large-scale, spatiotemporal dynamics. The dynamics are extracted from the brain signal through Fourier analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) only, and cast in a data model that predicts future signal at each site and frequency of interest. The dominant eigenvectors of the PCA that map the large-scale patterns of past cortical phase to future ones take the form of smoothly propagating waves over the entire measurement array. In ECoG data from 3 subjects and MEG data from 20 subjects collected during a self-initiated motor task, mean phase prediction errors were as low as 0.5 radians at local sites, surpassing state-of-the-art methods of within-time-series or event-related models. Prediction accuracy was highest in delta to beta bands, depending on the subject, was more accurate during episodes of high global power, but was not strongly dependent on the time-course of the task. Prediction results did not require past data from the to-be-predicted site. Rather, best accuracy depended on the availability in the model of long wavelength information. The utility of large-scale, low spatial frequency traveling waves in predicting future phase activity at local sites allows estimation of the error introduced by failing to account for irreducible trajectories in the activity dynamics. Author summary Prediction is an important step in scientific progress, often leading to real-world applications. Prediction of future brain activity could lead to improvements in detecting driver and pilot error or real-time brain testing using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Previous studies have either supposed that the 'noise' level in the cortex is high, setting the prediction bar rather low; or used localized measurements to predict future activity, with modest success. A long-held but controversial hypothesis is that the cortex is best characterized as a multi-scale dynamic structure, in which the flow of activity at one scale, say, the area responsible for motor control, is inextricably tied to activity at smaller and larger scales, for example within a cortical column and the whole cortex. We test this hypothesis by analyzing large-scale traveling waves of cortical activity. Like waves arriving on a beach, the ongoing wave motion allows better prediction of future activity compared to monitoring the local rise and fall; in the best cases the future wave cycle is predicted with as low as 20 degrees average error angle. The prediction techniques developed for the present research rely on mathematics related to quantifying large-scale weather patterns or analysis of fluid dynamics.

It is possible that self-provided misinformation, or lying, has similar effects. We hypothesized that lying impairs memory for younger adults, as increased cognitive control, necessary to inhibit a truthful response, comes at the expense of retaining veridical information in memory. Because older adults show deficits in cognitive control, we hypothesized their memory is unaffected by lying. In the present study, participants made truthful and deceptive responses on a computer while EEG data were recorded. We investigated medial frontal negativity (MFN), an ERP component associated with deception and cognitive control, which may be differentially generated across age groups due to differences in cognitive control. Unexpectedly, results revealed that older adults showed reduced accurate memory for items to which they previously lied compared to younger adults. There were no age differences in correct memory for truth items. We did not find the expected MFN effect, however results revealed long-lasting negative slow waves (NSW) to lie items across age in the pre-response period and following the response cue, suggesting the role of working memory processes in deception. These findings demonstrate that lying is another source of misinformation and influences memory differently across the lifespan.

A comparative methods' assessment	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Motor potential; Stepping; Locomotion; Motion capture; Biomechanics	POSTURAL ADJUSTMENTS; WALKING; POTENTIALS; TREADMILL	Background: Movement-Related Cortical Potentials (MRCPs) are widely used in studying brain dynamics of motor control. However, limited information is available on complex tasks such as locomotion for which the appropriate identification of gait initiation trigger is still a technical challenge. Thus, it is conceivable that recorded brain activity may vary due to the instrument used to provide the temporal trigger. Therefore, a comparative assessment was performed to determine whether and how trigger identification techniques affect the MRCP in gait initiation. New Method: Eleven able-bodied young participants performed 200 forward- and 200 backward-oriented self initiated steps. Brain activity was recorded through 64-channel electroencephalography. Four different triggering techniques were tested based on measurements of surface electromyography, stereophotogrammetry and forceplates. Results: Repeated-Measures ANOVAs on the mean amplitude of the Bereitschaftspotential and on both peak amplitude and latency of the motor potential showed a main effect of the triggering technique (p < 0.003). Specifically, force plates signal amplitude ( - 11.56 +/- 1.4 mu V) was larger than stereophotogrammetry ( - 5.0 +/- 0.5 mu V and 6.5 +/- 1 mu V) and electromyography ( - 7.2 +/- 0.9 mu V). Comparison with Existing Method(s): Considering the gait initiation task, no previous study has performed a comparison between the MRCPs observed by triggering the same signal with different approaches. Conclusion Different instruments identify triggers that vary in terms of time delay, resulting in different amplitudes and timing of the MRCPs. The comparative analysis indicates that forceplate allows to obtain the best MRCP trigger to study gait initiation, in terms of signal strength, cost and set up time.

J	Huang, L; Yang, X; Huang, ZH; Wang, YW				Huang Liang; Yang Xue; Huang Zhihua; Wang Yiwen			Brain spatio-temporal dynamics of understanding kind versus hostile intentions based on dyadic body movements	ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						Theory of Mind; kind intention; hostile intention; dyadic interaction; ERP	SOCIAL-INTERACTION; PERCEPTION; FRIENDS; SIMULATION; MIRROR; SPEED; FOES; MIND	Previous social neuroscience studies focused mainly on the neural networks that sustain an understanding of a single individual's neutral or negative intentions. However, few studies have explored those of different types of social interactive intentions performed by two or a number of individuals and their whole body movements. In addition, the spatio-temporal dynamics of understanding the kind and hostile intentions in the human brain also remain unclear. In order to address the above issue, the electroencephalograph (EEG) technique was employed to explore the dissociative neural correlates of understanding kind versus hostile intention. Twenty healthy participants were recruited for the experiment. Their behavioral data (accuracy and reaction time) and electrical brain activities were recorded while they were watching colorful photos depicting two actors' actions and performing an intention inference task (IIT). There were three different types of action intentions: kindness, hostility and non-interactiveness (neutrality). The ERP data was analyzed using the Scan and sLoreta software in an off-line way. The Univariate Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures of mean accuracy showed no significant difference among three conditions, while a main effect of condition existed for reaction time. The reaction times of hostile intention were shorter than those of the kind and neutral intentions, while no significant difference was found between the latter two conditions. The ERP data were analyzed using a three-way repeated measure ANOVA. The ANOVA factors were intention condition (kindness, hostility and neutrality), laterality (left, midline and right areas) and caudality (frontal, central and parietal areas). Electrophysiological results showed, over the frontal area, a significantly more negative amplitude of N250 (170 similar to 270 ms) for neutral intention compared to kind and hostile intentions, and the N250 amplitudes for kind intention were also more negative than those for hostile intention, especially on the FZ electrode site. The source localization showed maximum activation in Broadman 10 (BA10), in the vicinity of middle frontal gyrus, for N250 for kind and hostile intentions. At the later stage (270 similar to 450 ms), the peak amplitudes of the P300 for hostile intention were more positive than those for the kind and neutral intentions, and the P300 amplitudes for kind intention were also more positive than those for neutral intention over the central, parietal areas as well as the right hemisphere. The maximum activation for P300 of kind and hostile intentions was found in BA45, located in the vicinity of insula, and a stronger activity existed for hostile intention compared to kind intention. These findings show that there is a spatio-temporal dynamic dissociation between kind and hostile intentions understanding in the brain. Altogether, the current study provides electrophysiological evidence underlying the kind, hostile interactive intentions and non-interactive (neutral) intention understanding, and suggests a prioritized and sustained processing for hostile interactive intention. The study enriches the contents of the two-stage intention-understanding model and the putative Hierarchical & Multi-level Cognitive Framework (HMCF) in Theory of Mind.

Exploring the interaction between working memory and attention in patients with ADHD is of great significance for studying the pathological mechanism of this disease. In this study, electrophysiological markers of attention, posterior contralateral N2 (N2pc), and working memory, contralateral delay activity (CDA), were used to explore the relationship between these two cognitive abilities in patients with ADHD. EEG data were collected from adults with ADHD and age-, sex-, and IQ-matched normal controls while performing a classical visuospatial working memory task that consisted of low-load and high-load memory conditions. In different memory load conditions, the memory array elicited a smaller N2pc (220-260 ms) and a smaller CDA (400-800 ms) in adults with ADHD than in normal controls. Further analysis revealed that the reduced CDA amplitude could be significantly predicted by the earlier and reduced N2pc amplitude in adults with ADHD. Moreover, when the number of memory items increased, the increase in N2pc highly predicted the increases in CDA. Our findings illustrate the relationship between spatial working memory and attention ability in ADHD adults from the neurophysiological aspect that reduced working memory is closely related to insufficient attention ability and provide a potential physiological basis for the pathological mechanism of ADHD.

Electrophysiological correlates of prediction formation in anticipation of reward- and punishment-related feedback signals	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						ERP; feedback processing; medial frontal negativity; performance monitoring; P2; P3	NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; PROSPECT-THEORY; NEGATIVITY; VALENCE; EXPECTANCY; MAGNITUDE; MONETARY; CORTEX; EEG	Feedback processing during decision making involves comparing anticipated and actual outcome. Although effects on ERPs of valence, magnitude, expectancy, and context during feedback processing have been extensively investigated, the electrophysiological processes underlying prediction formation in anticipation of feedback signals have received little attention. The aim of the present study was to explore these processes of prediction formation and their influence on subsequent feedback signals. Twenty healthy, right-handed volunteers performed a forced-choice task in which they had to indicate which of two presented objects was more expensive. After the volunteer's choice, an expert cue, which was accurate in 80% of trials, was presented to manipulate prediction formation about future reward and punishment. ERPs were recorded during presentation of the expert cue and during feedback. Results revealed that prediction formation of future rewards and punishments is accompanied by differences in the P2 component and a subsequent delay period. During feedback processing, the prediction-related P2 was associated with the processing of valence reflected in the feedback-related P2. Furthermore, the prediction-related difference in the delay period was associated with error processing in feedback-related medial frontal negativity. These findings suggest that prediction signals prior to feedback contain information about whether a prediction is correct or wrong (expectancy) and if the outcome will be a reward or punishment (valence).

Method: Based on scores on the Somatoform Disorder Questionnaire (SDQ-20; Nijenhuis et al., 1996) we compared two non-clinical groups, one with high symptoms on the SDQ-20 and a control group with low or no symptoms. We recorded EEG whilst participants performed an exogenous tactile attention task where they had to discriminate between tactile targets following a tactile cue to the same or opposite hand. Results: The neural marker of attentional orienting to the body, the Late Somatosensory Negativity (LSN), was diminished in the high symptoms group and attentional modulation of touch processing was prolonged at mid and enhanced at later latency stages in this group. Conclusion: These results confirm that attentional processes are altered in people with somatic symptoms, even in a non-clinical group. Furthermore, the observed pattern fits explanations of changes in prior beliefs or expectations leading to diminished amplitudes of the marker of attentional orienting to the body (i.e. the LSN) and enhanced attentional gain of touch processing. Significance: This study shows that high somatic symptoms are associated with neurocognitive attention changes. (C) 2018 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Bayesian inference is the statistically optimal strategy for performing belief updating in the presence of uncertainty. An important open question is whether the use of cognitive strategies that implement Bayesian inference is dependent upon motivational state and, if so, how this is reflected in electrophysiological signatures of belief updating in the brain. Here, we recorded the EEG of participants performing a simple reward learning task with both monetary and nonmonetary instructive feedback conditions. Our aim was to distinguish the influence of the rewarding properties of feedback on belief updating from the information content of the feedback itself. A Bayesian updating model allowed us to quantify different aspects of belief updating across trials, including the size of belief updates and the uncertainty of beliefs. Faster learning rates were observed in the monetary feedback condition compared to the instructive feedback condition, while belief updates were generally larger, and belief uncertainty smaller, with monetary compared to instructive feedback. Larger amplitudes in the monetary feedback condition were found for three ERP components: the P3a, the feedback-related negativity, and the late positive potential. These findings suggest that motivational state influences inference strategies in reward learning, and this is reflected in the electrophysiological correlates of belief updating.

In the current study, we specifically focused on possible changes in endogenous visual orienting that may be reflected in the electroencephalogram. A variant of the Posner cuing paradigm was employed with valid or invalid central cues that preceded target stimuli that were presented in the left or right visual field. The target stimuli consisted of vertical or horizontal stripes with low (two thick lines) or high (six thin lines) spatial frequencies. We examined lateralized alpha power in the cue-target interval as recent studies revealed that a contra vs. ipsilateral reduction in alpha power relates to the orienting of attention. An initial orienting effect in the lower alpha band was more pronounced for dyslexic individuals than for controls, suggesting that they oriented at an earlier moment in time. However, in contrast with controls, at the end of the cue-target interval no clear contralateral reduction in the upper alpha band was observed for dyslexic individuals. Dyslexic individuals additionally displayed slower responses, especially for invalidly cued high spatial frequency targets in the left visual field. The current data support the view that dyslexic individuals orient well to the cued location but have a problem with sustaining their attention.	[Van der Lubbe, Rob H.

Nonetheless, the potential of traditional mindfulness practice for improving cognitive and neural efficiency is affected by two critical requirementsintensity of exercise and perseverance to practicewhich represent a known limitation of accessibility to meditation practices. It has been suggested that the impact of such limitations might be reduced thanks to the support of external devices. The present study aims at testing the efficacy of an intensive technology-mediated intervention based on mindful practices and supported by a brain-sensing device to optimize cognitive performance and neural efficiency. Forty participants took part in the study and were randomly divided in an active control and an experimental group. Both groups were involved in a structured intervention, which lasted 4weeks and was constituted by brief daily activities. The experimental group, differently from the active control, underwent mindfulness-based practices with the support of a dedicated device. Analyses highlighted increased electrophysiological responsiveness indices at rest and frequency profiles consistent with a relaxed mindset in the experimental group. Participants in the experimental group also showed improved electrophysiological markers of attention regulation and improved cognitive performance, as measured by a complex reaction times task. Findings hint at the potential of the investigated technology-mediated mindfulness practice for enhancing cognitive performance and for inducing consistent modulations of neural efficiency markers.

Using a within-subject design, the present study examined ovarian hormones, the error-related negativity (ERN), and self-reported checking symptoms in both the mid-follicular and mid-luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. ERN amplitude and checking symptom severity did not vary between the follicular and luteal phases. However, a more negative ERN was associated with greater checking symptoms in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, even when controlling for ERN amplitude in the follicular phase. Moreover, changes in checking symptoms between phases were associated with phase-related changes in the ERN. Finally, a significant mediation model was found such that the ERN measured in the luteal phase mediated the association between progesterone in the luteal phase and checking symptoms in the luteal phase. Collectively, the present findings suggest that levels of progesterone in the luteal phase could impact checking symptoms by modulating response monitoring and sensitivity to errors, and that fluctuation in the ERN between menstrual cycle phases may play an important role in the expression of anxious and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.

It has been reported that using contingent negative variation, the periodicity of migraine attacks is three days in adults. However, there is still a lack of relevant reports about the periodicity of migraine without aura in adults. Therefore, we investigated the changes of contingent negative variation in adults with migraine without aura from three to seven days after migraine attacks in order to provide the basis for exploring the circulation periodicity of migraine without aura. This prospective, observational study involved a group of 34 individuals with migraine without aura, who were screened during the three to seven days after a migraine attack without aura. A healthy group (31 individuals) was used as controls to assess the amplitudes of contingent negative variation and habituation of early contingent negative variation. Indices of the amplitudes included overall contingent negative variation, initial contingent negative variation, terminal contingent negative variation, and postoperative negative contingent variation. Differences between these indicators were analyzed. No significant difference was found between the patient and control groups for either the amplitudes of these measures of contingent negative variation or habituation of the early contingent negative variation for three to seven days after a migraine attack without aura (all P > 0.05). Thus, the study reported here found that the periodicity of migraine attacks without aura in adults is more than three days.

Randomized controlled trial protocol to improve multisensory neural processing, language and motor outcomes in preterm infants	BMC PEDIATRICS			English	Article						Multisensory; Intervention; Preterm; Neurodevelopment; Event-related potential; Sensory function	INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; SPEECH-SOUND DIFFERENTIATION; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY; PREMATURE-INFANTS; SENSORY PROFILES; CHILDREN BORN; KANGAROO CARE; AGE; INTERVENTION	BackgroundPremature infants are at risk for abnormal sensory development due to brain immaturity at birth and atypical early sensory experiences in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. This altered sensory development can have downstream effects on other more complex developmental processes. There are currently no interventions that address rehabilitation of sensory function in the neonatal period.MethodsThis study is a randomized controlled trial of preterm infants enrolled at 32-36weeks postmenstrual age to either standard care or standard care plus multisensory intervention in order to study the effect of multisensory intervention as compared to standard care alone. The study population will consist of 100 preterm infants in each group (total n=200). Both groups will receive standard care, consisting of non-contingent recorded parent's voice and skin-to-skin by parent. The multisensory group will also receive contemporaneous holding and light pressure containment for tactile stimulation, playing of the mother's voice contingent on the infant's pacifier sucking for auditory stimulation, exposure to a parent-scented cloth for olfactory stimulation, and exposure to carefully regulated therapist breathing that is mindful and responsive to the child's condition for vestibular stimulation. The primary outcome is a brain-based measure of multisensory processing, measured using time locked-EEG. Secondary outcomes include sensory adaptation, tactile processing, speech sound differentiation, motor and language function, measured at one and two years corrected gestational age.DiscussionThis is the first randomized controlled trial of a multisensory intervention using brain-based measurements in order to explain the causal effects of the multisensory intervention on neural processing changes to mediate neurodevelopmental outcomes in former preterm infants. In addition to contributing a critical link in our understanding of these processes, the protocolized multisensory intervention in this study is therapist administered, parent supported and leverages simple technology. Thus, this multisensory intervention has the potential to be widely implemented in various NICU settings, with the opportunity to potentially improve neurodevelopment of premature infants.Trial registrationNIH Clinical Trials (clinicaltrials.gov): NCT03232931.

Although a high-frequency response evoked by auditory senses is achievable, the quality of the recording response is not ideal, such as relatively low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Recently, auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) play an essential role in the field of basic auditory studies and clinical uses. However, how to improve the quality of ASSRs is still a challenge which researchers have been working on. This study aims at designing a more comfortable and suitable evoked paradigm and then enhancing the quality of the ASSRs in healthy subjects so as to further apply it in clinical practice. Methods: Chirp and click stimuli with 40 Hz and 60 Hz were employed to evoke the gamma-ASSR respectively, and the sound adjusted to 45 dB sound pressure level (SPL). Twenty healthy subjects with normal-hearing participated, and 64-channel EEGs were simultaneously recorded during the experiment. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) and SNR of the ASSRs were measured and analyzed to verify the feasibility and adaptability of the proposed evoked paradigm. Results: The results showed that the evoked paradigm proposed in this study could enhance ASSRs with strong feasibility and adaptability. (1) ASSR waves in time domain indicated that 40 Hz stimuli could significantly induce larger peak-to-peak values of ASSRs compared to 60 Hz stimuli (p < 0.01**); ERSP showed that obvious ASSRs were obtained at each lead for both 40 Hz and 60 Hz, as well as the click and chirp stimuli. (2) The SNR of the ASSRs were -3.23 +/- 1.68, -2.44 +/- 2.90, -4.66 +/- 2.09, and -3.53 +/- 3.49 respectively for 40 Hz click, 40 Hz chirp, 60 Hz click and 60 Hz chirp, indicating the chirp stimuli could induce significantly better ASSR than the click, and 40 Hz ASSRs had the higher SNR than 60 Hz (p < 0.01**). Limitation: In this study, sample size was small and the age span was not large enough. Conclusions: This study verified the feasibility and adaptability of the proposed evoked paradigm to improve the quality of the gamma-ASSR, which is significant in clinical application. The results suggested that 40 Hz ASSR evoked by chirp stimuli had the best performance and was expected to be used in clinical practice, especially in the field of mental diseases such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and affective disorder.

Training programs can improve cognition, yet precise characterization of the psychological and neural underpinnings supporting different training programs is lacking. Here, we assessed the effect and maintenance (3-month follow-up) of 3-month music and visual art training programs on neuroelectric brain activity in older adults using a partially randomized intervention design. During the pre-, post-, and follow-up test sessions, participants completed a brief neuropsychological assessment. High-density EEG was measured while participants were presented with auditory oddball paradigms (piano tones, vowels) and during a visual GoNoGo task. Neither training program significantly impacted psychometric measures, compared to a non-active control group. However, participants enrolled in the music and visual art training programs showed enhancement of auditory evoked responses to piano tones that persisted for up to 3 months after training ended, suggesting robust and long-lasting neuroplastic effects. Both music and visual art training also modulated visual processing during the GoNoGo task, although these training effects were relatively short-lived and disappeared by the 3-month follow-up. Notably, participants enrolled in the visual art training showed greater changes in visual evoked response (i.e., N1 wave) amplitude distribution than those from the music or control group. Conversely, those enrolled in music showed greater response associated with inhibitory control over the right frontal scalp areas than those in the visual art group. Our findings reveal a causal relationship between art training (music and visual art) and neuroplastic changes in sensory systems, with some of the neuroplastic changes being specific to the training regimen.

Nevertheless, whether and how lexical cohort size influences semantic context effects in a picture-word interference (PWI) task remains unclear. To address this issue, participants were required to name pictures, which were paired with both semantically related and unrelated distractors, from both large and small lexical cohorts while electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded. Behavior results showed a semantic interference effect but no interaction between semantic relatedness and lexical cohort size in naming latencies. ERPs and correlation analyses revealed that semantic interference effects occurred at the lexical level in the time windows of 200-400 and 400-600 ms, and lexical cohort size effects occurred at the conceptual level in the time window of 100-200 ms and at the lexical level in the time windows of 200-400 ms. Critically, no interaction between two variables was found, reflecting that lexical cohort size is independent of semantic interference for categorical relations in the PWI. sLORETA results found stronger brain activations for large lexical cohorts at the left superior temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus in the time interval of 250-300 ms, which may relate to lexical selection and self-monitoring. Our findings provide evidence for the swinging lexical network rather than the response exclusion hypothesis in spoken production.

Human Sensory LTP Predicts Memory Performance and Is Modulated by the BDNF Val(66) Met Polymorphism	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ERP; neuroplasticity; neurogenetics; visual memory; single-nucleotide polymorphism; long-term potentiation; VEP; brain-derived neurotrophic factor	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; FACTOR VAL66MET POLYMORPHISM; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; CORTICAL PLASTICITY; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; VISUAL-CORTEX; MOTOR; STIMULATION; HIPPOCAMPUS; FREQUENCY	Background: Long-term potentiation (LTP) is recognised as a core neuronal process underlying long-term memory. However, a direct relationship between LTP and human memory performance is yet to be demonstrated. The first aim of the current study was thus to assess the relationship between LTP and human long-term memory performance. With this also comes an opportunity to explore factors thought to mediate the relationship between LTP and long-term memory. The second aim of the current study was to explore the relationship between LTP and memory in groups differing with respect to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val(66) Met; a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) implicated in memory function. Methods: Participants were split into three genotype groups (Val/Val, Val/Met, Met/Met) and were presented with both an EEG paradigm for inducing LTP-like enhancements of the visually-evoked response, and a test of visual memory. Results: The magnitude of LTP 40 min after induction was predictive of long-term memory performance. Additionally, the BDNF Met allele was associated with both reduced LTP and reduced memory performance. Conclusions: The current study not only presents the first evidence for a relationship between sensory LTP and human memory performance, but also demonstrates how targeting this relationship can provide insight into factors implicated in variation in human memory performance. It is anticipated that this will be of utility to future clinical studies of disrupted memory function.	[Spriggs, Meg J.; Thompson, Chris S.; Moreau, David; McNair, Nicolas A.; Wu, C.

This study investigated whether congenital amusia, a neurodevelopmental disorder of pitch perception, is associated with impaired processing of harmonic syntactic structures. For stimuli, we used harmonic sequences containing two phrases, where the first phrase ended with a half cadence and the second with an authentic cadence. In Experiment 1, we manipulated the ending chord of the authentic cadence to be either syntactically regular or irregular based on local dependencies. Sixteen amusics and 16 controls judged the expectedness of these chords while their EEG waveforms were recorded. In comparison to the regular endings, irregular endings elicited an ERAN, an N5, and a late positive component in controls but not in amusics, indicating that amusics were impaired in processing local syntactic dependencies. In Experiment 2, we manipulated the half cadence of the harmonic sequences to either adhere to or violate long-distance syntactic dependencies. In response to irregular harmonic sequences, an ERAN-like component and an N5 were elicited in controls but not in amusics, suggesting that amusics were impaired in processing long-distance syntactic dependencies. Furthermore, for controls, the neural processing of local and long-distance syntactic dependencies was correlated at the later integration stage but not at the early detection stage. These findings indicate that amusia is associated with impairment in the detection and integration of local and long-distance syntactic violations. The implications of these findings in terms of hierarchical music-syntactic processing are discussed.

ATTENTIONAL PROCESSING OF FACIAL EXPRESSIONS AND GAZE DIRECTION IN DEPRESSION AND FIRST-EPISODE PSYCHOSIS AS REFLECTED BY LPP MODULATION	CLINICAL NEUROPSYCHIATRY			English	Article						attention; facial expressions; late positive potential; depression; first-episode psychosis	EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION; THREATENING FACES; NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; DOSE EQUIVALENTS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PERCEPTION; RESPONSES; DELUSIONS; ERP	Objective: Facial expressions communicate emotional states and regulate social bonds. An approach or avoidance-based valence might interact with direct or averted gaze to elicit different attentional allocation. These processes might be aberrant in major depression or first-episode psychosis and this requires empirical investigation. Method: This study examined higher order, controlled attentional processing of emotional facial expressions (happy, neutral, angry and fearful), with direct or averted gaze, using electroencephalogram (EEG) measures of the face-elicited Late Positive Potential (LPP), in young people diagnosed with major depression or first-episode psychosis, compared with a healthy control group. Results: In the control group, there was no evidence of increased attentional allocation to emotional facial expressions, or to facial expressions with a matching emotional expression and gaze direction. There was no evidence, in the depression or first-episode psychosis groups, for a threat-based, attentional hypersensitivity to fearful or angry facial expressions, nor for this effect to be potentiated in response to angry direct or fearful averted gaze faces. However, the absence of such effects could not be concluded due to sample size and the absence of stimulus arousal and valence ratings. Importantly, there was significantly increased attentional allocation in the first-episode psychosis group to facial expressions regardless of emotional expression or gaze direction, compared to both the depression and control group. Conclusions: There might be an attentional hypersensitivity to facial expressions regardless of emotional expression or gaze direction in first-episode psychosis.	[Kettle, Jonathan W.

In healthy controls, motor sequence learning during a Serial Reaction time (SRT) task is associated with an increase in Ne/ERN amplitude. The objective of this paper is to investigate whether concussion effects on cognitive control are associated with sequence learning changes in asymptomatic multi-concussion athletes. Thirty-seven athletes (18 nonconcusseo; 19 concussed) completed a SRT task during which continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded. Ne/ERN amplitude modulation from early to late learning blocks of the task was measured. Median reaction times (RTs) were computed to assess psychomotor speed and motor sequence learning. Psychomotor speed was significantly reduced in concussed athletes, Accentuated Ne/ERN amplitude from early to late learning blocks significantly correlated with motor sequence learning in nonconcussed athletes. In contrast, Ne/ERN amplitude was found to decrease significantly with task progression in concussed athletes who nonetheless achieved normal motor sequence learning. Multiple concussions detrimentally affect psychomotor speed. Unlike nonconcussed athletes, motor sequence learning in multi-concussion athletes was not associated with Ne/ERN amplitude modulation, indicating that cognitive control processes do not centrally contribute to learning of a motor sequence after repeated concussions.

JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; SENSORY ATTENUATION; EFFECT ANTICIPATION; EVOKED-RESPONSES; AUDITORY-CORTEX; COMPONENT; BRAIN; SOUND; EEG; SUPPRESSION	We act on the environment to produce desired effects, but we also adapt to the environmental demands by learning what to expect next, based on experience: How do action-based predictions and sensory predictions relate to each other? We explore this by implementing a self-generation oddball paradigm, where participants performed random sequences of left and right button presses to produce frequent standard and rare deviant tones. By manipulating the action-tone association as well as the likelihood of a button press over the other one, we compare ERP effects evoked by the intention to produce a specific tone, tone regularity, and both intention and regularity. We show that the N1b and Tb components of the N1 response are modulated by violations of tone regularity only. However, violations of action intention as well as of regularity elicit MMN responses, which occur similarly in all three conditions. Regardless of whether the predictions at sensory levels were based on either intention, regularity, or both, the tone deviance was further and equally well detected at hierarchically higher processing level, as reflected in similar P3a effects between conditions. We did not observe additive prediction errors when intention and regularity were violated concurrently, suggesting the two integrate despite presumably having independent generators. Even though they are often discussed as individual prediction sources in the literature, this study represents to our knowledge the first to directly compare them. Finally, these results show how, in the context of action, our brain can easily switch between top-down intention-based expectations and bottom-up regularity cues to efficiently predict future events.

Acute stress has been found to influence error processing. However, the neural dynamic correlates underlying this modulation remain elusive. To address this issue, we recruited 39 healthy male participants, who performed a two-session task before and after an acute stress test while their behavioral and EEG data were recorded. The participants were randomly exposed to either a stress condition (Maastricht Acute Stress Test) or a control condition. The stress test consisted of several hand immersion tasks (ice-cold water, 2 degrees C) and mental arithmetic tasks. A color-word Stroop task was used to investigate the stress effect on error responses. Based on the level of stress-induced cortisol, the participants in the stress group were further classified as low (N = 13) or high (N = 13) cortisol responders. The results indicated that only in the high cortisol responders, the error-related negativity (ERN) amplitude was reduced after acute stress. In addition, the increment ERN in the high cortisol responders was significantly smaller than that in the low cortisol responders. These results suggest that acute stress impairs error detection. However, the error positivity amplitudes increased in the stress group compared to the control group, indicating that acute stress leads to greater error assessment. Taken together, these results suggest that acute stress impairs error detection, which is modulated by individuals' response level following acute stress, and leads to more emotional and/or motivational responses to the error signal once the error is consciously realized.

In the proposed method, QPSO technique is modified with exploiting the novelty of search and replacement mechanism of scout bee from ABC algorithm. For this purpose, a new design problem is constructed as a nonlinear minimization of mean square error between the designed and desired filter responses in passband, stopband, and transition band simultaneously, allowing permissible ripples in passband and stopband. Efficiency of the proposed technique is measured by several attributes like passband error, stopband error, total squared error (SE), maximum stopband attenuation, maximum passband error (e(pb)(max)), passband ripple, and maximum phase deviation in passband. Experimental results evidence that a significant reduction is achieved in sum of the SE in passband and stopband from 12 to 54%, and the performance is not degraded due to quantization and truncation process. However, computation time in term of CPU time is increased from 0.77 to 4.1%, along with 2.62-7.43% hike in number of function evaluation, when compared to QPSO. A comparative study reveals that the proposed method yields better fidelity parameter as compared other evolutionary algorithms such as gravitational search algorithm, genetic algorithm, and variants of PSO. The proposed technique is also suitable for higher filter taps.

As automatized behavior is less vulnerable towards the detrimental effects of alcohol than cognitive control processes, potential cognitive inhibition deficits might however improve with training. We investigated the effect of an acute, binge-like alcohol intoxication in a balanced within-subjects design, asking n = 32 healthy young males to perform a backward inhibition paradigm once sober and once while intoxicated (similar to 1.1 parts per thousand). To identify the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms, we analyzed stimulus- and response selection-related processes in neurophysiological data after Residue Iteration Decomposition (RIDE). Alcohol generally impaired behavioral task performance (accuracy and response times) during task switching. This was associated with impaired attentional processing of the task-relevant cue (reflected by reduced P1 and N1 amplitudes), which likely resulted in a larger need for reactive control at the later stage of response selection and control (reflected by increased fronto-central theta power). Without prior practice (similar to 30 minutes), the intoxicated participants further struggled to overcome the cognitive inhibition of a previously relevant task set (reflected by a larger backward inhibition effect). This was linked to reduced posterior theta power, which reflects alcohol-induced impairments in working memory capacity and task set-relevant memory retrieval. As individuals with similar to 30 min task practice did not show the same alcohol-related deficit, it may be deduced that (partial) task set automatization via stimulus-response associations may help to reduce the detrimental effects of alcohol on cognitive inhibition during task switching.

Quantifying evidential value and selective reporting in recent and 10-year past psychophysiological literature: A pre-registered P-curve analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						P-curve; Evidential value; Selective reporting; Psychophysiology	PUBLICATION BIAS; REWARD PREDICTION; ERP; ATTENTION; POTENTIALS; COMPONENTS; EEG; RELIABILITY; NEGATIVITY; MODULATION	Selective reporting (i.e., only reporting significant findings as opposed to all analyses or results) is a questionable research practice that undermines the integrity of published research. Psychophysiology research may be susceptible to selective reporting, given the high number of decision points and methodological complexity in analyses of psychophysiology data. We aimed to assess the presence of selective reporting and evidential value (i.e., that significant results are due to true underlying effects) in recent and past psychophysiological research by utilizing p-curve analyses. Study protocols and methods were pre-registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF). P-values and the associated test statistics were extracted from articles in the most recent issue (as of January 2018) and 10-year previous counterpart issue of three major psychophysiology journals: Psychophysiology, International Journal of Psychophysiology, and Journal of Psychophysiology. Using the p-curve application, 10 primary p-curves were conducted: all recent articles, all past articles, recent articles split by journal, past articles split by journal, recent cognitive electrophysiology articles, and past cognitive electrophysiology articles. Evidential value and generally adequate average power 78% average power) were present in all p-curves, except those that only included articles from the Journal of Psychophysiology because of the small number of articles published in the journal. Findings provide some positive news and indicate that, generally, results were not selectively reported, and selective reporting may not be a primary issue for this sample of psychophysiological research. Future p-curve analyses examining sub-disciplines of psychophysiology are recommended.

Previous findings have recognized the distance effect in category-based induction: Inductive strength is affected by the hierarchical distance between the premises and conclusions. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this effect require elucidation. In the present study, we investigated the neural mechanisms of the distance effect by using EEG technology and a new experimental paradigm-category-based induction. In this paradigm, we used three hierarchical levels of categories-the subordinate category, the basic category, the superordinate category-and an irrelevant category. We further used these categories to create four types of trial that varied in the hierarchical distance between the premise and the conclusion: the subordinate-basic, the basic-superordinate, the subordinate-superordinate, and the irrelevant-superordinate trials. In each trial, participants judged the probability that the conclusion category had the same property as the premise category. Our behavioral results revealed that people responded more slowly in the irrelevant-superordinate trials than in the basic-superordinate and the subordinate-basic trials. Our ERP results showed that the irrelevant-superordinate trials elicited smaller P300 (250-500 ms) amplitudes than did the subordinate-basic and the basic-superordinate trials. In addition, the subordinate-superordinate trials elicited smaller P300 and PSW (700-998 ms) amplitudes than did the subordinate-basic and the basic-superordinate combinations. These findings indicate that the amplitudes of P300 and PSW may reflect the distance effect in inductive reasoning: The further the premise-conclusion hierarchical distance, the lower the inductive strength, and thus the smaller the P300 and PSW amplitudes.

According to the Snake Detection Theory, selection pressures posed by snakes on early primates have shaped the development of the visual system. Previous studies in humans have investigated early visual electrophysiological activity in response to snake images vs. various alternative dangerous or non-dangerous stimuli. These studies have shown that the Early Posterior Negativity (EPN) component is selectively elicited by snake or snake-like images. Recent findings yielded the complementary/alternative hypothesis that early humans (and possibly other primates) evolved an aversion especially for potentially harmful triangular shapes, such as teeth, claws or spikes. In the present study we investigated the effect of triangular and diamond-shaped patterns in snake skins on the ERP correlates of visual processing in humans. In the first experiment, we employed pictures of snakes displaying either triangular/diamond-shaped patterns or no particular pattern on their skins, and pictures of frogs as control. Participants observed a random visual presentation of these pictures. Consistent with previous studies, snakes elicited an enhanced negativity between 225 and 300 ms (EPN) compared to frogs. However, snakes featuring triangular/diamond-shaped patterns on their skin produced an enhanced EPN compared to the snakes that did not display such patterns. In a second experiment we used pictures displaying only skin patterns of snakes and frogs. Results from the second experiment confirmed the results of the first experiment, suggesting that triangular snake-skin patterns modulate the activity in human visual cortex. Taken together, our results constitute an important contribution to the snake detection theory.

J	Zhu, SQ; Zhai, Y; Jia, SW				Zhu Shuqing; Zhai Yu; Jia Shiwei			Local context dependence in feedback evaluation: An ERP study	ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						feedback evaluation; feedback-related negativity; global context dependence; local context dependence	REWARD PREDICTION ERROR; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; NEGATIVITY REFLECTS; POTENTIALS; BAD; SENSITIVITY; POSITIVITY; MAGNITUDE; OUTCOMES; VALENCE	Previous research has indicated that feedback evaluation depends on its embedded context, and feedback related negativity (FRN) is also context-dependent. However, it is still disputed whether feedback evaluation merely relies on the global context (the range of all possible outcomes in a block) or also on the local context (the range of possible outcomes on a given trial). Thus, the current study investigated whether the context-dependent effect could be extended from the global context to the local context. We assumed that if feedback evaluation is in a global context-dependent manner, then all non-reward feedback in a given block should elicit a related negativity; however, if feedback evaluation is in a local context-dependent manner, then a related negativity should be discovered for the relative unfavorable feedback compared to the relative favorable feedback in a given trial context. In this study, twenty-five healthy participants (17 females; M-age = 21.96 years old) performed a cued time-estimation task while EEG was recorded. Gain (a "+" surrounded with a circle)/ loss (a "-" surrounded with a circle) cues were presented trial-by-trial at the beginning of each trial to indicate the context of this trial. Participants needed to estimate one second and then received factual feedback in accordance with their performance. In the gain context, correct and incorrect responses resulted in gain (+ (sic)4; gain-favorable feedback) and no-gain ((sic)0; gain-unfavorable feedback), separately. In the loss context, correct and incorrect responses resulted in no-loss ((sic)0; loss-favorable feedback) and loss (-(sic)4; loss-unfavorable feedback), separately. The behavioral results indicated that larger trial-to-trial changes in time estimation were observed after relative unfavorable feedback than relative favorable feedback. The ERP results revealed that more negative FRN occurred after relative unfavorable feedback than relative favorable feedback in both the gain and loss contexts. In addition, there was no significant difference between gain-favorable and loss-favorable feedback or between gain-unfavorable and loss-unfavorable feedback. In addition, gain-unfavorable feedback elicited a more negative FRN than loss-favorable feedback, although, in fact, both were zero-value feedback. The above results indicate that feedback evaluation relies on the local context. Based on the previous literature, we infer that the task and facticity of feedback are key factors giving rise to the discrepancies of the results between the previous studies and the current study. In passive tasks (i.e., the participants do not need to react), the good-bad binary evaluation of FRN cannot be observed as well as the context dependence effect. In active tasks with false feedback, global context dependence is found. In active tasks with factual feedback, the context dependence extends to the local level.

TTV describes the variability in the amplitude of the stimulus-evoked response across trials, and it is generally observed to be reduced, or quenched. While such TTV quenching has been observed on both the cellular and regional levels, its exact behavioral relevance and neuronal basis remains unclear. Applying a novel paradigm for testing neural markers of individuality in internally-guided decision-making, we here investigated whether TTV (i) represents an individually specific response by comparing individualized vs shared stimuli; and (ii) is mediated by the complexity of prestimulus activity as measured by the Lempel-Ziv Complexity index (LZC). We observed that TTV - and other electrophysiological markers such as ERP, ERSP, and ITC - showed first significant differences between individualized and shared stimuli (while controlling for task-related effects) specifically in the alpha and beta frequency bands, and secondly that TTV in the beta band correlated significantly with reaction time and eLORETA activity. Moreover, we demonstrate that the complexity (LZC) of neuronal activity is higher in the prestimulus period while it decreases during the poststimulus period, with the former also correlating specifically with poststimulus individualized TTV in alpha (but not with shared Try). Together, our results show that the Try represents a marker of 'neural individualization' which, being related to internal processes on both neural and psychological levels, is mediated by the information complexity of prestimulus activity. More generally, our results inform the pre-post-stimulus dynamics of rest-stimulus interaction, which is a basic and ubiquitous neural phenomenon in the brain and highly relevant for mental features including their individuality.

By the use of non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), it was previously possible to show evidence for this valence specificity and to modulate the impact of the vmPFC on emotional network processing. Prior results showed increased neural activation during pleasant relative to unpleasant stimulus processing after excitatory compared to inhibitory vmPFC-tDCS. As dysfunctional vmPFC activation patterns are associated with major depressive disorder (MDD), tDCS of this region could render an attractive application in future therapy. Here, we investigated vmPFC-tDCS effects on sad compared to happy face processing, as sad faces are often used in the study of mood disorders. After counterbalanced inhibitory or excitatory tDCS, respectively, healthy participants viewed happy and sad faces during magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording. In addition, tDCS effects on an interpretational bias of ambiguous happy-sad face morphs and an attentional bias of a dot-probe task with happy and sad faces as emotional primes were investigated. Finally, in conjoint analyses with data from a previous sibling study (happy and fearful faces) we examined whether excitatory vmPFC-tDCS would reveal a general increase in processing of pleasant stimuli independent of the type of unpleasant stimuli applied (sad vs. fearful faces). MEG and behavioral results showed that happy faces promoted a relative positivity bias after excitatory compared to inhibitory tDCS, visible in left orbitofrontal cortex and in the emotion-primed dot-probe task. A converse pattern in the MEG data during sad face processing suggests the possible involvement of an empathy network and thus significantly differed from neuronal processing of fearful face processing. Implications for the bearing of vmPFC modulation on emotional face processing and the impact of specific unpleasant face expressions are discussed.

The most noteworthy evidence comes from neuroimaging. Neuroimaging findings were rarely exclusive to the cingulate cortex and tended to implicate multiple other cortices as well. Some results are reflective of obsessive -compulsive (OC) symptoms of TS. Copious findings, however, drawn from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), task fMRI, and positron emission tomography (PET) implicate six of the eight cingulate subregions in TS. Gauged by MRI, cortical thinning and/or below-normal volume are seen in subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sACC), pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC), anterior middle cingulate cortex (aMCC), and posterior middle cingulate cortex (pMCC), correlating with tic severity in sACC, pACC, and aMCC. Moreover, in pMCC, dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (dPCC), and ventral posterior cingulate cortex (vPCC), cortical thickness is a candidate biomarker shared across siblings with TS. Loss of cortex may reflect excitotoxicity secondary to insufficient local GABAergic inhibition, a notion supported by the few relevant MRS and PET studies conducted to date, recommending continued development of GABAergic and glutamatergic pharmacologic agents to treat TS. Measurements of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) obtained with DTI indicate that the white matter proximal to sACC, pACC, pMCC, and dPCC may also represent a seat of pathology in TS. rsfMRI reveals abnormal functional connectivity of pACC and dPCC with the globus pallidus internus, a favored target of therapeutic deep brain stimulation (DBS) for TS. In whole-brain network (graph theory) analysis, dPCC functional connectivity is related to the severity and complexity of tics. In task fMRI, in contrast, the pMCC seems to play a preeminent role in premonitory urges and preparation for tics as well as normal urges to urinate, swallow, and yawn. Strong monkey PET and EEG evidence ties vocal tics to spike discharges, a-activity, and regional blood flow in the pACC unleashed by failure of GABAergic inhibition in the ventral striatum. Tic suppression in fMRI scans is associated with increased blood oxygenation level-dependent activity in sACC, pACC, and aMCC, but decreased activity in pMCC and dPCC. Activity in the former three subregions may represent volitional effort, physical discomfort, and emotional distress that accompanies mounting tic urges; pMCC and dPCC may be more instrumental in amplifying than suppressing urges. Needs for future neuroimaging work in TS include longitudinal studies-particularly those striving to predict which individual pediatric patients will continue to suffer from TS as adults and studies of treatment response-particularly of behavioral therapies, which are as efficacious as pharmacology. Transcranial magnetic stimulation and related therapies such as cranial electrotherapy stimulation, which showed good efficacy in a recent trial, merit continued exploration. TS research using DTI, MRS, and PET will no doubt continue to benefit in coming years from technological advances such as ultrahigh-field scanners, multichannel head coils, and novel (including GABAergic and glutamatergic) ligands.

Investigating the perception of face identity in adults on the autism spectrum using behavioural and electrophysiological measures	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						Autism; Fast periodic visual stimulation; Face perception; Holistic processing; Face inversion effect	HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PROCESSING ABILITIES; ATYPICAL DEVELOPMENT; ERP RESPONSES; MEMORY TEST; CHILDREN; RECOGNITION; ADOLESCENTS; INVERSION	In the present study, we investigated face processing in individuals with self-reported Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD, n = 16) and typically developing control participants (n = 16) using behavioural and electrophysiological measures. As a measure of their face memory, we administered the Cambridge Face Memory Test to participants in the ASD group. The results showed that the scores of the ASD participants were reliably below the age- and gender-matched norms of neurotypical individuals. To measure brain responses to faces, we used the fast periodic visual stimulation method, presenting photographs of a same-identity face (i.e., base face) at a constant frequency of 6 Hz (F) interleaved with different-identity faces (i.e., the oddball faces) presented at 1.2 Hz. The 6 Hz presentation of the base face and 1.2 Hz presentation of the oddball face elicited periodic brain responses corresponding to face detection and face individuation processes, respectively. Participants viewed four blocks of upright faces and four blocks of inverted faces. The results showed an enhanced EEG response to upright base faces at 6 Hz frequency and its harmonics compared to inverted faces, and the response was most focal over medial occipital channels. An enhanced response was found to upright oddball faces at 1.2 Hz and its harmonics compared to the inverted faces, and the response was centred over occipito-temporal channels in the right hemisphere. Critically, no differences or interactions were found between the ASD and typically developing groups in the responses to either the 6 Hz base faces or the 1.2 oddball faces. These results suggest that in individuals with ASD, the earlier stage of face perception, as measured by the fast periodic visual stimulation paradigm, can be dissociated from the later memory stage of face processing, as assessed by the Cambridge Face Memory Test.

J	Chen, CC; Kuo, JC; Wang, WJ				Chen, Chun-Chuan; Kuo, Ju-Che; Wang, Wei-Jen			Distinguishing the Visual Working Memory Training and Practice Effects by the Effective Connectivity During n-back Tasks: A DCM of ERP Study	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						visual working memory training; neuroplasticity; executive control network; dorsal attention network; effective connectivity	NEURAL DYNAMICS; EEG; CORTEX; BRAIN; ACTIVATION; PLASTICITY; RESPONSES; NETWORKS; CAPACITY; MODEL	Visual working memory (WM) training and practice can result in improved task performance and increased P300 amplitude; however, only training can yield N160 enhancements. N160 amplitudes are related to the spatial attention, the detection of novelty and the inhibitory control, while P300 amplitudes are related to the selective attention. Therefore, it could be speculated that the mechanisms underlying N160 and P300 production may differ to accommodate to their functions. Based on the different N160 engagements and different functional roles of N160 and P300, we hypothesized that the effects of visual WM training and practice can be dissociated by their brain effective connectivity patterns. We compared different neural connectivity configurations for the main task-related brain activities including N160 and P300 during the visual three-back task in subjects after visual WM training (the WM group) and after repetitive task practice (the control group). The behavioral result shows significantly greater improvement in accuracy after training and suggests that visual WM training can boost the learning process of this simple task. The N160 peak amplitude increased significantly after training over the anterior and posterior brain areas but decreased after practice over the posterior areas, indicating different mechanisms for mediating the training and practice effects. In support of our hypothesis, we observed that visual WM training alters the frontal-parietal connections, which comprise the executive control network (ECN) and the dorsal attention network (DAN), whereas practice modulates the parietal-frontal connections underpinning P300 production for selective attention. It should be noted that the analytic results in this study are conditional on the plausible models being tested and the experimental settings. Studies that employ different tasks, devices and plausible models may lead to different results. Nevertheless, our findings provide a reference for distinguishing the visual WM training and practice effects by the underlying neuroplasticity.

The aim of our study was to determine what effect an attention-demanding cognitive performance task had on brain-heart reactivity to visual food cues in women who maintained clinically relevant weight loss vs. women who had never weight cycled. A clinical weight loss group (CWL, n = 17) and a BMI-matched control group (CTL, n = 23) completed modified Stroop tasks that either included high calorie food pictures (Food Stroop) or excluded food cues (Office Stroop). ECG, breathing rate, and EEG were recorded. CWL participants : The Eating Restraint scores (Three Factor Eating Questionnaire) of the CWL participants correlated negatively with their heart rates recorded during the Food Stroop task (r = 0.62, p < 0.01). There was no such relationship in CTL participants. The P200 latencies in CWL participants evoked by the Stroop color-word cues at the C3 electrode were positively correlated to the log high frequency power in their cardiac spectrograms during the Food Stroop (r = 0.63, p < 0.02). There were no such relationships in the Office Stroop task nor in CTL participants. Combined Groups: Participants' heart rates were significantly lower (p < 0.05) and their RMSSD values and the log Total Power in their cardiac spectrograms were significantly greater during the Food Stroop vs. Office Stroop (p < 0.01, Bonferroni corrected). In conclusion Eating Restraint scores in CWL participants correlated with their Stroop heart rates, while the P200 latencies evoked by the Stroop cues correlated with the log high frequency power in their cardiac spectrograms (marker of cardiac vagal activation) during the Food Stroop task. This provides evidence that even 12 months after successful weight loss maintenance the cardiac ANS reactivity to food cues while completing a cognitive performance test was still different to that in individuals of normal weight who never weight cycled. Across all participants the cardiac ANS reactivity evoked by performing the Stroop task was lowered by food cues suggesting that the dampening effect of food cues on cardiac ANS reactivity may be one of the drivers of 'stress induced' eating.

J	Zhang, PC; Li, YZ; Zhou, SJ; Gao, XP; Pan, X				Zhang Pengcheng; Li Yangzhuo; Zhou Shujin; Gao Xiangping; Pan Xin			Enhancement effect of near spatial distance on self-referential processing: Evidence from behavioral and ERPs studies	ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						self-referential processing; spatial distance; enhancement effect	SPACE; ATTENTION; MEMORY; RECOGNITION; INHIBITION; VALENCE; OTHERS	Self-reference can improve the memorization of stimulated information, and this is a phenomenon called the self-referential effect. Previous studies from the perspective of social distance (such as parents, friends, and strangers) show that the speed of processing or classifying stimulus and memory performance under self-reference significantly outperform the cases under other-reference. Other than social distance, another concept greatly influences individual cognition and behavior: spatial distance. However, research from the perspective of spatial distance is scant. To broaden the perspectives on the self-referential effect, we constructed different distance conditions through a 2D corridor and investigated how spatial distance affects self-referential processing through a learning-recognition paradigm and event-related potential techniques. Neutral nouns were used as the experimental materials. We designed a 2 (reference: self, other) x2 (distance: far, near) within groups design and added a stranger reference as the alert group. The corridor has three grids: the upper, middle, and lower grids. In the learning stage, the neutral noun was randomly presented in the middle grid while the name was also shown randomly in the upper or lower grid. Two levels of the distance variable were measured by the distance between the middle and the upper or lower grids. Participants were required to press the up arrow"."when name (except stranger's name) appeared in the upper grid, and press the down arrow"."when name (except stranger's name) appeared below. If a stranger's name appeared in any grid, the participants had to press "f". And try to associate the words with the names in mind during experiment. After a simple calculation of the interference task, a surprise recognition test was conducted. The response time, accuracy rate and EEG data of the participants were recorded during the experiment. The results showed that the response time under self-reference was significantly shorter than that under other-reference, and the response time of near-distance was significantly shorter than far-distance. The main effects of distance on the amplitude of P1 and N1 components and the latency of N1 component were significant, whereas the main effects of reference on those aspects were not significant. Self-referential and other-referential processing in near-distance induced larger LPC amplitude and right frontal activation relative to the far-distance alternative. In the recognition stage, memory performance in self-reference was significantly better than that in other-reference, and such performance under the near-distance condition was significantly better than that under the far-distance situation. However, memory performances under other-reference with the far-and near-distance conditions were not significant. This study broadens our understanding of self-referential processing from the perspective of spatial distance. Compared with the far-distance condition, the near-distance counterpart enhances self-referential processing; thus, when individuals process the self-reference information in the near-distance, greater LPC amplitude and right frontal activation as well as better memory performance is achieved. This study provides implications for future exploration of the self-referential effect from the perspective of spatial distance.

Intraoperative awareness, whilst uncommon, may lead to serious psychological disturbance, and alternative methods to monitor the depth of anaesthesia may reduce the incidence of serious events. Bispectral index (BIS) is a numerical scale based on electrical activity in the brain. Using a BIS monitor to guide the dose of anaesthetic may have advantages over clinical signs or ETAG. This is an update of a review last published in 2014. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of BIS to reduce the risk of intraoperative awareness and early recovery times from general anaesthesia in adults undergoing surgery. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science on 26 March 2019. We searched clinical trial registers and grey literature, and handsearched reference lists of included studies and related reviews. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in which BIS was used to guide anaesthesia compared with standard practice which was either clinical signs or end-tidal anaesthetic gas (ETAG) to guide the anaesthetic dose. We included adult participants undergoing any type of surgery under general anaesthesia regardless of whether included participants had a high risk of intraoperative awareness. We included only studies in which investigators aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of BIS for its role in monitoring intraoperative depth of anaesthesia or potential improvements in early recovery times from anaesthesia. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE. Main results We included 52 studies with 41,331 participants; two studies were quasi-randomized and the remaining studies were RCTs. All studies included participants undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia. Three studies recruited only participants who were at high risk of intraoperative awareness, whilst two studies specifically recruited an unselected participant group. We analysed the data according to two comparison groups: BIS versus clinical signs; and BIS versus ETAG. Forty-eight studies used clinical signs as a comparison method, which included titration of anaesthesia according to criteria such as blood pressure or heart rate and, six studies used ETAG to guide anaesthesia. Whilst BIS target values differed between studies, all were within a range of values between 40 to 60. BIS versus clinical signs We found low-certainty evidence that BIS-guided anaesthesia may reduce the risk of intraoperative awareness in a surgical population that were unselected or at high risk of awareness (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.36, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.60; I-2 = 61%; 27 studies; 9765 participants). However, events were rare with only five of 27 studies with reported incidences; we found that incidences of intraoperative awareness when BIS was used were three per 1000 (95% CI 2 to 6 per 1000) compared to nine per 1000 when anaesthesia was guided by clinical signs. Of the five studies with event data, one included participants at high risk of awareness and one included unselected participants, four used a structured questionnaire for assessment, and two used an adjudication process to identify confirmed or definite awareness. Early recovery times were also improved when BIS was used. We found low-certainty evidence that BIS may reduce the time to eye opening by mean difference (MD) 1.78 minutes (95% CI -2.53 to -1.03 minutes; 22 studies; 1494 participants), the time to orientation by MD 3.18 minutes (95% CI -4.03 to -2.33 minutes; 6 studies; 273 participants), and the time to discharge from the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) by MD 6.86 minutes (95% CI -11.72 to -2 minutes; 13 studies; 930 participants). BIS versus ETAG Again, events of intraoperative awareness were extremely rare, and we found no evidence of a difference in incidences of intraoperative awareness according to whether anaesthesia was guided by BIS or by ETAG in a surgical population at unselected or at high risk of awareness (Peto OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.56 to 2.26; I-2 = 37%; 5 studies; 26,572 participants; low-certainty evidence). Incidences of intraoperative awareness were one per 1000 in both groups. Only three of five studies reported events, two included participants at high risk of awareness and one included unselected participants, all used a structured questionnaire for assessment and an adjudication process to identify confirmed or definite awareness. One large study (9376 participants) reported a reduced time to discharge from the PACU by a median of three minutes less, and we judged the certainty of this evidence to be low. No studies measured or reported the time to eye opening and the time to orientation. Certainty of the evidence We used GRADE to downgrade the evidence for all outcomes to low certainty. The incidence of intraoperative awareness is so infrequent such that, despite the inclusion of some large multi-centre studies in analyses, we believed that the effect estimates were imprecise. In addition, analyses included studies that we judged to have limitations owing to some assessments of high or unclear bias and in all studies, it was not possible to blind anaesthetists to the different methods of monitoring depth of anaesthesia. Studies often did not report a clear definition of intraoperative awareness. Time points of measurement differed, and methods used to identify intraoperative awareness also differed and we expected that some assessment tools were more comprehensive than others. Authors' conclusions Intraoperative awareness is infrequent and, despite identifying a large number of eligible studies, evidence for the effectiveness of using BIS to guide anaesthetic depth is imprecise. We found that BIS-guided anaesthesia compared to clinical signs may reduce the risk of intraoperative awareness and improve early recovery times in people undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia but we found no evidence of a difference between BIS-guided anaesthesia and ETAG-guided anaesthesia. We found six studies awaiting classification and two ongoing studies; inclusion of these studies in future updates may increase the certainty of the evidence.

J	Li, SX; Che, XW; Li, YJ; Wang, L; Chen, KS				Li Shouxin; Che Xiaowei; Li Yanjiao; Wang Li; Chen Kaisheng			The effects of capacity load and resolution load on visual selective attention during visual working memory	ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						visual working memory; selective attention; capacity load; resolution load; N2	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; PERCEPTUAL LOAD; N200; TASK; REPRESENTATIONS; PRECISION; CAPTURE; CORTEX	Selective attention plays an important role in processing relevant information and ignoring irrelevant distractors. The relationship between visual working memory (VWM) and visual selective attention has been extensively studied. VWM is a complex system consisting of not only visual maintenance functions, but also executive control functions. High load on visual maintenance functions drains the capacity for perception and prevents distractors from being perceived, while high load on executive control functions drains the capacity available for active control and results in increased processing of irrelevant distractors. There are two types of load in VWM: capacity load referring to the number of items to be stored, and resolution load emphasizing the precision of the stored representations. It has been found that these two types of load exert opposite effects on selective attention. However the mechanism underlying the effects of different types of VWM load on selective attention is still unclear. In the present study, four experiments were designed to investigate how different types of VWM load affect selective attention. Thirty-six participants were enrolled in Experiment 1, 2 and 3, respectively, and 14 participants were enrolled in Experiment 4. Participants were asked to perform both a VWM task and a visual search task. In the VWM task, participants had to retain colors in VWM to perform a change detection task. There were three levels of VWM load: baseline load, high-capacity load and high-resolution load. In the baseline load condition, participants were required to retain two colors and the change between the memory colors and the probe colors was large. In the high-capacity load condition, participants had to retain four colors and the change between the memory colors and the probe colors was also large. In the high-resolution load condition, participants had to retain two colors and the change between the memory colors and the probe colors was small. In Experiment 1 and 2, the visual search task was a Flanker task that was presented either in the periphery or in the center of the memory array. The Flanker task was presented with the memory array simultaneously in Experiment 1 and sequentially in Experiment 2. In Experiment 3, the visual search task was a Navon task. It was presented after the memory array and only in the center of the memory array. In Experiment 4, a Flanker task was presented after the memory array and only in the center of the memory array. EEG data during the memory interval were recorded by a 64-channel amplifier using a standard 10-20 system. The results showed that high-capacity load and high-resolution load reduced Flanker interference, compared with baseline load, when the VWM task and the Flanker task were presented simultaneously, regardless of whether the Flanker task was presented in the periphery or in the center of the memory array. High-capacity load and high-resolution load also reduced Flanker interference, compared with baseline load, when the VWM task and the Flanker task were presented sequentially and the Flanker task was presented in the periphery of the memory array. Compared with baseline load, high-capacity load increased Flanker interference and high-resolution load reduced Flanker interference when the VWM task and the Flanker task were presented sequentially and the Flanker task was presented in the center of the memory array. Under the high-capacity load condition, the Navon interference for attending to global level was larger than that for attending to local level; under the high-resolution load condition, the Navon interference for attending to global level was smaller than that for attending to local level. ERP results showed that relative to the baseline load condition, the high-capacity load condition elicited smaller N2, whereas the high-resolution load condition elicited larger N2. In conclusion, when the Flanker task is presented during encoding stage of VWM, high-capacity load and high-resolution load reduce interference. When the Flanker task is presented in the periphery of the memory array during maintaining stage of VWM, high-capacity load and high-resolution load reduce interference. These findings support the load theory of selective attention. However, when the Flanker task is presented in the center of the memory array during the maintenance stage, high-capacity load and high-resolution load lead to opposite effects. High-resolution load reduce interference, while high-capacity load increase interference. The underlying mechanism is that the different patterns of neural activity associated with the two types of VWM load may result in different distribution of cognitive control resources to selective attention.
