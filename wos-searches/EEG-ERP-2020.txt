J	Liu, L; Zhou, RL				Liu, Lei; Zhou, Renlai			The Functional Role of Individual Alpha-Based Frontal Asymmetry in the Processing of Fearful Faces	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						frontal electroencephalography alpha asymmetry; facial expression; fearful face; event-related potential; ERP	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EEG ASYMMETRY; TIME-COURSE; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; FACIAL EXPRESSION; SEX-DIFFERENCES; ATTENTION; EMOTION; ACTIVATION; ERP	The ability to quickly identify fearful faces is important for the activation of defense mechanisms that allow an individual to deal with potential emergencies. This study examined the relationship between frontal electroencephalography (EEG) alpha asymmetry and the processing of congruent and incongruent fearful faces among female participants using event-related potentials (ERPs). Behavioral results showed that individuals with more left frontal EEG alpha asymmetry had shorter response times than individuals with more right frontal EEG alpha asymmetry during the cue-target task. ERP results indicated that, for individuals with more left frontal EEG alpha asymmetry, enhanced N1 reflected more rapid processing of emotional faces in the early stage, and enhanced P3 indicated that these individuals directed more attentional and motivational resources to the evaluation of emotional faces in the late stage. For individuals with more right frontal EEG alpha asymmetry, enhanced N2 indicated that these individuals experienced more conflict for incongruent fearful faces in the late stage. The present findings suggest that frontal EEG alpha asymmetry during resting conditions can reflect individual differences in the processing of congruent and incongruent fearful faces.

While traditional methods of EEG processing have mostly focused on enhancing signal components, few have explored background noise suppression techniques. Optimizing the suppression of background noise can play a critical role in improving the performance of EP/ERP detection. Methods: In this study, a spatio-temporal equalization (STE) method was proposed based on the Multivariate Autoregressive (MVAR) model, which has been shown to suppress the spatio-temporal correlation of background noise and improve the EEG signal detection performance. Results: For practical applications, two optimization schemes based on the spatio-temporal equalization method were designed to solve two common challenges in EEG signal detection: P300 and steady state visual evoked potentials. Our results demonstrated that the STE method effectively improves recognition performance of evoked or event-related potential detection. Additionally, the STE method offers fewer parameters, lower computational complexity, and easier implementation. Conclusion: These attributes allow the STE approach to be extended as a preprocessing method which can be used in combination with existing techniques.

A systematic search was undertaken, studies were included if they used a single task paradigm with an auditory stimulus combined with ERP measures from EEG to evaluate cognitive workload in healthy adults. Nineteen articles met the inclusion criteria. There was a change in the amplitude of ERP components with an increase in cognitive difficulty. However, this change was dependent on the features of the task and stimuli. This review emphasizes the importance of stimulus and task selection in single task paradigms to evaluate cognitive workload. This review also synthesizes important concepts regarding ERPs in single task paradigms such as the effect of primary task selection on specific ERP components.

Design A set of 700 semantically congruent and incongruent sentences was developed in accordance with current linguistic norms, and validated with an electroencephalography (EEG) study, in which the influence of age and gender on the N400 ERP magnitude was analysed. Study sample Forty-five normal-hearing subjects (19-57 years, 21 females) participated in the EEG study. Results The stimulus material used in the EEG study elicited a robust N400 ERP, with a morphology consistent with the literature. Results also showed no statistically significant effect of age or gender on the N400 magnitude. Conclusions The material presented in this paper constitutes the largest complete stimulus set suitable for both auditory and text-based N400 experiments. This material may help facilitate the efficient implementation of future N400 ERP studies, as well as promote standardisation and consistency across studies.

Despite the increasing use of ERP data in clinical research little is known about the reliability of human manual ERP labelling methods. Intra-rater and inter-rater reliability were evaluated in five electroencephalography (EEG) experts who labelled the peak negativity of averaged movement related cortical potentials (MRCPs) derived from thirty datasets. Each dataset contained 50 MRCP epochs from healthy people performing cued voluntary or imagined movement, or people with stroke performing cued voluntary movement. Reliability was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient and standard error of measurement. Excellent intra- and inter-rater reliability was demonstrated in the voluntary movement conditions in healthy people and people with stroke. In comparison reliability in the imagined condition was low to moderate. Post-hoc secondary epoch analysis revealed that the morphology of the signal contributed to the consistency of epoch inclusion; potentially explaining the differences in reliability seen across conditions. Findings from this study may inform future research focused on developing automated labelling methods for ERP feature extraction and call to the wider community of researchers interested in utilizing ERPs as a measure of neurophysiological change or in the delivery of EEG-driven interventions.

In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNN) showed adequate results in brain-computer interfaces (BCI) based on different control signals, including event-related potentials (ERP). In this study, we propose a novel CNN, called EEG-Inception, that improves the accuracy and calibration time of assistive ERP-based BCIs. To the best of our knowledge, EEG-Inception is the first model to integrate Inception modules for ERP detection, which combined efficiently with other structures in a light architecture, improved the performance of our approach. The model was validated in a population of 73 subjects, of which 31 present motor disabilities. Results show that EEG-Inception outperforms 5 previous approaches, yielding significant improvements for command decoding accuracy up to 16.0%, 10.7%, 7.2%, 5.7% and 5.1% in comparison to rLDA, xDAWN + Riemannian geometry, CNN-BLSTM, DeepConvNet and EEGNet, respectively. Moreover, EEG-Inception requires very few calibration trials to achieve state-of-the-art performances taking advantage of a novel training strategy that combines cross-subject transfer learning and fine-tuning to increase the feasibility of this approach for practical use in assistive applications.

MWL estimators based on spontaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) have shown great potentials to achieve this goal. However, the previous studies show that the between-task robustness of these EEG/ERP-based MWL estimators is still an unsolved intractable question. This study attempts to examine the task-irrelevant auditory event-related potentials (tir-aERPs) as MWL indicators. A working memory task (verbal n-back) and a visuo-motor task (multi-attribute task battery, MATB), both with two difficulty levels (easy and hard), were used in the experiment, along with task-irrelevant auditory probes that did not need any response from the participants. EEG was recorded from ten participants when they were performing the tasks. The tir-aERPs elicited by the auditory probes were extracted and analyzed. The results show that the amplitudes of N1, early P3a (eP3a) and the late reorienting negativity (RON) significantly decreased with the increasing MWL in both n-back and MATB. Task type has no obvious influence on the amplitudes and topological layout of the MWL-sensitive tir-aERPs features. These results suggest that the tir-aERPs are potentially more constant MWL indicators across very different task types. Therefore, the tir-aERPs should be taken into consideration in future task-independent MWL monitoring studies.

However, they are very weak and sensitive to the experimental settings including paradigms, stimulation parameters and even surrounding environments, resulting in a diversity of ERP patterns across different BCI experiments. It's still a challenge to develop a general decoding algorithm that can adapt to the ERP diversities of different BCI datasets with small training sets. This study compared a recently developed algorithm, i.e., discriminative canonical pattern matching (DCPM), with seven ERP-BCI classification methods, i.e., linear discriminant analysis (LDA), stepwise LDA, bayesian LDA, shrinkage LDA, spatial-temporal discriminant analysis (STDA), xDAWN and EEGNet for the single-trial classification of two private EEG datasets and three public EEG datasets with small training sets. The feature ERPs of the five datasets included P300, motion visual evoked potential (mVEP), and miniature asymmetric visual evoked potential (aVEP). Study results showed that the DCPM outperformed other classifiers for all of the tested datasets, suggesting the DCPM is a robust classification algorithm for assessing a wide range of ERP components.

J	Feng, S; Li, HF; Ma, L; Xu, ZL				Feng, Shang; Li, Haifeng; Ma, Lin; Xu, Zhongliang			An EEG Feature Extraction Method Based on Sparse Dictionary Self-Organizing Map for Event-Related Potential Recognition	ALGORITHMS			English	Article						self-organizing map; feature extraction; event-related potential; brain-computer interface; sparse dictionary		In the application of the brain-computer interface, feature extraction is an important part of Electroencephalography (EEG) signal classification. Using sparse modeling to extract EEG signal features is a common approach. However, the features extracted by common sparse decomposition methods are only of analytical meaning, and cannot relate to actual EEG waveforms, especially event-related potential waveforms. In this article, we propose a feature extraction method based on a self-organizing map of sparse dictionary atoms, which can aggregate event-related potential waveforms scattered inside an over-complete sparse dictionary into the code book of neurons in the self-organizing map network. Then, the cosine similarity between the EEG signal sample and the code vector is used as the classification feature. Compared with traditional feature extraction methods based on sparse decomposition, the classification features obtained by this method have more intuitive electrophysiological meaning. The experiment conducted on a public auditory event-related potential (ERP) brain-computer interface dataset showed that, after the self-organized mapping of dictionary atoms, the neurons' code vectors in the self-organized mapping network were remarkably similar to the ERP waveform obtained after superposition and averaging. The feature extracted by the proposed method used a smaller amount of data to obtain classification accuracy comparable to the traditional method.

Fuzzy Clustering for Exploratory Analysis of EEG Event-Related Potentials	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Data processing; Clustering algorithms; Feature extraction; Brain modeling; Task analysis; Scalp; Electroencephalography (EEG); event-related potential (ERP); interval features; possibilistic clustering; unsupervised	C-MEANS ALGORITHM; CLASSIFICATION; KERNEL; ERP; INDEXES; ICA	We introduce an analysis method for electroencephalography (EEG) data, focused on event-related potentials (ERPs). Our approach is unsupervised and makes use of a fuzzy clustering algorithm based on the possibilistic framework and includes a data-driven noise and artifact rejection phase. Our contribution provides a general analysis tool, applicable to any ERP dataset, which can uncover the dataset's internal structure. The fuzzy clustering algorithm is the core of our method, since its fine-grained membership grades how much a sample belongs to a given cluster, making the method applicable even when groups have a certain overlap. Prior to the clustering step, we apply weights to the feature vectors, optimizing them in order to enhance the variance within the dataset, and we extract time-window-interval-based features inspired by interval arithmetic. We apply the data processing workflow to the analysis of a set of ERPs recorded during an emotional Go/NoGo task. We evaluate the performance of the unsupervised analysis by computing a measure based on the clusterization rate of trials in different experimental conditions. The results of the studied dataset show that the proposed method obtains a difference of clusterization rate of 69% in Go versus NoGo trials, when weights and interval features are applied to the data, improving previous work not including weights and interval features, which had a rate of 31%. Furthermore, when compared with the standard fuzzy c-means, our proposed possibilistic clustering algorithm outperforms it in terms of the clusterization rate. We also examine the effect of preprocessing the data with independent component analysis and removing noise-related components and observe that this does not improve significantly the obtained results. These findings demonstrate that our proposed method provides a valuable data processing workflow robust to EEG artifacts and able to produce a clustering that is coherent with the experimental conditions represented in the ERP dataset.

In this study, we have investigated whether changes in odor stimuli evaluation across repeated stimuli presentation can be attributed to changes in brain perception of the stimuli. Epoch intervals representing olfactory sensory perception were extracted from electroencephalography (EEG) signals using minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR)-based single trial event related potential (ERP) approach to understand the evoked response to high pleasantness and low pleasantness stimuli. We found statistically significant changes in self reported stimuli evaluation between initial and final trials ( p < 0.05) for both stimuli categories. However, the changes in ERP amplitude were found to be statistically significant only for the high pleasantness stimuli. This implies that olfactory stimuli of higher hedonic value recruit high-order cognitive processing that may be responsible for initial increased ERP response, as well as for rapid subsequent adaptation in processing the stimuli.

Previous studies exploring the P300 have relied on either electroencephalography (EEG) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We applied simultaneous event-related EEG-fMRI to investigate how the network structure is updated from rest to the P300 task so as to guarantee information processing in the oddball task. We first identified 14 widely distributed regions of interest (ROIs) that were task-associated, including the inferior frontal gyrus and the middle frontal gyrus, etc. The task-activated network was found to closely relate to the concurrent P300 amplitude, and moreover, the individuals with optimized resting-state brain architectures experienced the pruning of network architecture, i.e. decreasing connectivity, when the brain switched from rest to P300 task.

One possible way is to use neuroscience data. This study deals with EEG technology in conjunction with predicting consumer preferences using electroencephalography (EEG). To 40 respondents were presented 10 products with different utility while EEG was measuring. The results show that there is a link between the measured EEG data and the actual preferences that were found using a binary choice task and questionnaire. Previous studies have shown that the early event-related potentials (ERPs) such as the N200 component can correlate with consumer preferences for products. At the population level, we obtained a correlation coefficient of 0.803, which proves the strong dependence between the preferential score and the value of the N200 ERP component.

However, little is known about event-related potential (ERP)-related changes in working memory after sleep loss. The purpose of this research was to explore the effects of 36 h of total sleep deprivation (TSD) on working memory through ERPs. Sixteen healthy college students performed working memory tasks while rested and after 36 h of TSD, and electroencephalography (EEG) data were simultaneously recorded while the subjects completed working memory tasks that included different types of stimulus materials. ERP data were statistically analyzed using repeated measurements analysis of variance to observe the changes in the working memory-related N2-P3 components. Compared with baseline before TSD, the amplitude of N2-P3 components related to working memory decreased, and the latency was prolonged after TSD. However, the increased amplitude of the P2 wave and the prolonged latency were found after 36 h of TSD. Thus, TSD can impair working memory capacity, which is characterized by lower amplitude and prolonged latency.

Novel electroencephalography (EEG) measures are currently being employed for improving diagnostic classification, estimating prognosis and supporting medicolegal decision-making in DOC patients. However, complex recording protocols, a confusing variety of EEG measures, and complicated analysis algorithms create roadblocks against broad application. We conducted a systematic review based on English-language studies in PubMed, Medline and Web of Science databases. The review structures the available knowledge based on EEG measures and analysis principles, and aims at promoting its translation into clinical management of DOC patients.

J	Chikara, RK; Ko, LW				Chikara, Rupesh Kumar; Ko, Li-Wei			Global Neural Activities Changes under Human Inhibitory Control Using Translational Scenario	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						electroencephalography (EEG); independent component analysis (ICA); event-related potential (ERP); N1; N2; P3; response inhibition; cingulate cortex; frontal cortex	STOP-SIGNAL; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; MOTOR INHIBITION; EXECUTIVE CONTROL; GO/NO-GO; CORTEX; TIME; EEG; COMPONENTS; ABILITY	This study presents a new approach to exploring human inhibition in a realistic scenario. In previous inhibition studies, the stimulus design of go/no-go task generally used a simple symbol for the go and stop signals. We can understand the neural activity of inhibition through simple symbol scenario. In the real world, situations of human inhibition are more complex than performing an experiment in the laboratory scale. How to explore the neural activities of inhibition in a realistic environment is more complex. Consequently, we designed a battlefield scenario to investigate the neural activities of inhibition in a more realistic environmental setting. The battlefield scenario provides stronger emotion, motivation and real-world experiences for participants during inhibition. In the battlefield scenario, the signs of fixation, go and stop were replaced by images of a sniper scope, a target and a non-target. The battlefield scenario is a shooting game between the enemy and the soldiers. In battlefield scenario participants played the role of the soldiers for shooting target and to stop shooting when a non-target appeared. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals from twenty participants were acquired and analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA) and dipole source localization method. The results of event-related potential (ERP) showed a significant modulation of the peaks N1, N2 and P3 in the frontal and cingulate cortices under inhibitory control. The partially overlapping ERP N2 and P3 waves were associated with inhibition in the frontal cortex. The ERP N2, N1 and P3 waves in the cingulate cortex are related to sustained attention, motivation, emotion and inhibitory control. In addition, the event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) results shows that the powers of the delta and theta bands increased significantly in the frontal and cingulate cortices under human inhibitory control. The EEG-ERP waves and power spectra in the frontal and cingulate cortices were found more increased than in the parietal, occipital, left and right motor cortices after successful stop. These findings provide new insights to understand the global neural activities changes during human inhibitory control with realistic environmental scenario.

However, problems such as inter-subject performance instability and ERP-illiteracy are still unresolved. Therefore, it is necessary to predict classification performance before performing an ERP speller in order to use it efficiently. In this study, we investigated the correlations with ERP speller performance using a resting-state before an ERP speller. In specific, we used spectral power and functional connectivity according to four brain regions and five frequency bands. As a result, the delta power in the frontal region and functional connectivity in the delta, alpha, gamma bands are significantly correlated with the ERP speller performance. Also, we predicted the ERP speller performance using EEG features in the resting-state. These findings may contribute to investigating the ERP-illiteracy and considering the appropriate alternatives for each user.

Specifically, the event-related potential (ERP) technique provides a tool for exploring the EEG responses to a specific event/stimulus. One of the ERP components widely studied is the P300 component, which is associated with the last stage of information processing and a general measurement of "cognitive efficiency." Methods The sample was composed of thirteen healthy right-handed individuals randomized to participate under two conditions: LEV and placebo. Electrophysiological measures were collected before and after drug intake. We explored the oddball paradigm, which is commonly used with healthy individuals to investigate the stages of information processing. Results The electrophysiological results showed a main effect of condition on P300 amplitude for the frontal (F3, Fz, F4), central (C3, Cz, C4), and parietal electrodes (P3, Pz, P4). The post hoc comparisons (Scheffe's test) demonstrated the significant differences between electrodes. Regarding P300 latency, all regions represented a main effect of condition. A P300 latency reduction was observed during LEV condition compared with placebo. Conclusion Our study observed the ERP component-P300-through the variation of its amplitude and latency to evaluate a supposed higher CNS efficiency when participants were under the LEV effect. Our findings sustain this premise, mainly due to reducing in P300 latency for the LEV condition, supporting the neural efficiency hypothesis.

N.			Distant Sensor Prediction of Event-Related Potentials	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Electrodes; Standards; Artificial neural networks; Mathematical model; Brain modeling; Electric potential; Distant-sensing; brain vital signs; electroencephalography (EEG); event-related potentials (ERP); artificial neural network; machine learning	BRAIN	Objective: The ability to measure event-related potentials (ERPs) as practical, portable brain vital signs is limited by the physical locations of electrodes. Standard electrode locations embedded within the hair result in challenges to obtaining quality signals in a rapid manner. Moreover, these sites require electrode gel, which can be inconvenient. As electrical activity in the brain is spatially volume distributed, it should be possible to predict ERPs from distant sensor locations at easily accessible mastoid and forehead scalp regions. Methods: An artificial neural network was trained on ERP signals recorded from below hairline electrode locations (Tp9, Tp10, Af7, Af8 referenced to Fp1, Fp2) to predict signals recorded at the ideal Cz location. Results: The model resulted in mean improvements in intraclass correlation coefficient relative to control for all stimulus types (Standard Tones: +9.74%, Deviant Tones: +3.23%, Congruent Words: +15.25%, Incongruent Words: +25.43%) and decreases in RMS Error (Standard Tones: -26.72%, Deviant Tones: -17.80%, Congruent Words: -28.78%, Incongruent Words: -29.61%) compared to the individual distant channels. Measured vs predicted ERP amplitudes were highly and significantly correlated with control for the N100 (R = 0.5, p(adj) < 0.05), P300 (R = 0.75, p(adj) < 0.01), and N400 (R = 0.75, p(adj) < 0.01) ERPs. Conclusion: ERP waveforms at distant channels can be combined using a neural network autoencoder to model the control channel features with better precision than those at individual distant channels. This is the first demonstration of feasibility of predicting evoked potentials and brain vital signs using signals recorded from more distant, practical locations. Significance: This solves a key engineering challenge for applications that require portability, comfort, and speed of measurement as design priorities for measurement of event-related potentials across a range of individuals, settings, and circumstances.

In this study we record emotional responses to destination pictures before and after viewing a destination TV commercial from participants' brains using electroencephalography (EEG). A control group of participants watched the same destination pictures, and an unrelated TV commercial. Emotion-related event-related potential (ERP) components, the P2 and LPP, were derived from the EEG. For the participants that watched the destination TV commercial, the P2 and the LPP were larger in response to destination pictures after compared to before having watched the TV commercial. This effect was not observed in the control group. In a behavioral version of the same experiment, we did not observe any effects in the self-report data. It is concluded that ERP methodology is a useful tool to complement the toolbox of tourism marketing researchers.

However, the feasibility of event-related potential (ERP) analyses for program comprehension were rarely examined. In this study, we aimed to discover the ERPs related to program comprehension. We conducted an experiment to capture ERPs with ten software developers during a cognitive process of comparison operation as one of the simple program comprehension processes. As results, ERP waveforms were observed in the EEG data of four subjects. In addition, we confirmed the inter-stimulus difference in peak amplitudes and peak latency.

A diagnostic and prognostic neuromarker may optimize management and return-to-activity decision-making in athletes who experience mTBI. Objective Measure an event-related potential (ERP) component captured with electroencephalography (EEG), called processing negativity (PN), at baseline and post-injury in adolescents who suffered mTBI and determine their longitudinal response relative to healthy controls. Methods Thirty adolescents had EEG recorded during an auditory oddball task at a pre-mTBI baseline session and subsequent post-mTBI sessions. Longitudinal EEG data from patients and healthy controls (n= 77) were obtained from up to four sessions in total and processed using Brain Network Analysis algorithms. Results The average PN amplitude in healthy controls significantly decreased over sessions 2 and 3; however, it remained steady in the mTBI group's 2nd (post-mTBI) session and decreased only in sessions 3 and 4. Pre- to post-mTBI amplitude changes correlated with the time interval between sessions. Conclusion These results demonstrate that PN amplitude changes may be associated with mTBI exposure and subsequent recovery in adolescent athletes. Further study of PN may lead to it becoming a neuromarker for mTBI prognosis and return-to-activity decision-making in adolescents.

Though there are likely many causes for this phenomenon, information systems researchers have posited that emotional reactions to security notifications may play a role in its explanation. This work-in-progress paper descibes a study to create a baseline of electroencephalographic (EEG) and behavioral responses to security notification images by comparing them to known responses to the well-studied International Affective Picture System (TAPS). By creating such a baseline of affective responses to security notification images, future work can explore the effect of passive emotional reactions to security notification designs which would generate insight into effective design practices.

The study on emotion recognition is all the more demanding as it involves integration of abstract phenomenon of emotion causation and emotion appraisal through physiological and brain signals. This paper describes the classification of human emotions into four classes, namely: low valence high arousal (LVHA), high valence high arousal (HVHA), high valence low arousal (HVLA) and low valence low arousal (LVLA) using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The EEG signals have been collected on three EEG electrodes along the central line viz: Fz, Cz and Pz. The analysis has been done on average event related potentials (ERPs) and difference of average ERPs using Support Vector Machine (SVM) polynomial classifier. The four-class classification accuracy of 75% using average ERP attributes and an accuracy of 76.8% using difference of ERPs as attributes has been obtained. The accuracy obtained using differential average ERP attributes is better as compared with the already existing studies.

With its high temporal resolution, electroencephalography (EEG), a technique that records electrical activity of cortical neuronal cells, is a potentially suitable technique to investigate human somatosensory processing. By using EEG, the processing of (nociceptive) stimuli can be investigated, along with the functionality of the nociceptive pathway. Therefore, it can be applied in chronic pain patients to objectify whether changes have occurred in nociceptive processing. Typically, so-called event-related potential (ERP) recordings are used, where EEG signals are recorded in response to specific stimuli and characterized by latency and amplitude. Objective. To summarize whether differences in somatosensory processing occur between chronic pain patients and healthy controls, measured with ERPs, and determine whether this response is related to the subjective pain intensity. Design. Systematic review. Setting and Methods. PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were consulted, and 18 case-control studies were finally included. Subjects. The chronic pain patients suffered from tension-type headache, back pain, migraine, fibromyalgia, carpal tunnel syndrome, prostatitis, or complex regional pain syndrome. Results. Chronic neuropathic pain patients showed increased latencies of the N2 and P2 components, along with a decreased amplitude of the N2-P2 complex, which was also obtained in FM patients with small fiber dysfunction. The latter also showed a decreased amplitude of the N2-P3 and N1-P1 complex. For the other chronic pain patients, the latencies and the amplitudes of the ERP components did not seem to differ from healthy controls. One paper indicated that the N2-P3 peak-to-peak amplitude correlates with the subjective experience of the stimulus. Conclusions. Differences in ERPs with healthy controls can mostly be found in chronic pain populations that suffer from neuropathic pain or where fiber dysfunction is present. In chronic pain populations with other etiological mechanisms, limited differences were found or agreed upon across studies.

Inhibitory control, one facet of impulsivity, can be assayed using the stop-signal task (SST) and quantified behaviorally via the stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) and electrophysiologically using event-related potentials (ERPs). Research on the relationship between alcohol use and SSRTs, and between alcohol use and inhibitory-control ERPs, is mixed. Here, adult alcohol users (n = 79), with a wide range of scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), completed the SST under electroencephalography (EEG) (70% of participants had AUDIT total scores greater than or equal to 8). Other measures, including demographic, self-report, and task-based measures of impulsivity, personality, and psychological factors, were also recorded. A machine-learning method with penalized linear regression was used to correlate individual differences in alcohol use with impulsivity measures. Four separate models were tested, with out-of-sample validation used to quantify performance. ERPs alone statistically predicted alcohol use (cross-validated r = 0.28), with both early and late ERP components contributing to the model (larger N2, but smaller P3, amplitude). Behavioral data from a wide range of impulsivity measures were also associated with alcohol use (r = 0.37). SSRT was a relatively weak statistical predictor, whereas the Stroop interference effect was relatively strong. The addition of nonimpulsivity behavioral measures did not improve the correlation (r = 0.34) and was similar when ERPs were combined with non-ERP data (r = 0.29). These findings show that inhibitory control ERPs are robustly correlated individual differences in alcohol use.

Event-related potential (ERP) is a specific type of electroencephalography that can be time-locked to a stimulus and thus allows researchers to examine neural responses to specific therapeutic techniques. A conceptual overview of the method and its applicability to counseling psychologists is provided. Additionally, this article contains basic guidelines for designing an ERP study, the tools necessary for setting up an ERP lab, and an overview of data-processing strategies. Common pitfalls encountered both broadly in neuroscience research and specifically in ERP research are discussed. An integrated review of relevant literature is presented here, along with suggestions for future counseling psychology research, with a focus on establishing biomarkers of successful interventions.

A Novel Method based on Regularized Logistic Regression and CCA for P300 Detection using a Reduced Number of EEG Trials	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Visualization; Logistics; Irrigation; Correlation; Signal to noise ratio; Receivers; Brain Computer Interface; Event Related Potential; P300; Canonical Correlation Analysis; Regularized Logistic Regression	CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; COMMUNICATION	The Event-Related Potential (ERP) P300 is an Electroencephalography (EEG) signal evoked by external stimuli, characterised by a positive deflection at the 300 ms after presentation of an interesting stimulus for the user. In literature, P300-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) has been implemented to translate the subjects intent for restoring communication and control functions. In order to detect the ERP of the EEG signals and taking into account low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the P300 signal, multiple trial averaging has been widely used, which permit diminishing the random noise. However, the signal averaging technique requires processing multiple EEG trials, thus the ITR (Information Transfer Rate) of the P300-based BCI is significantly reduced. An open challenge of P300-based BCI systems focuses on recognizing ERP signals (as target and no-target) using a reduced number of trials with an enough classification rate. In this work, we propose a novel method based on Regularized Logistic Regression (RLR) using as features the coefficients obtained from a Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), as method for detection of visual P300 ERPs using a reduced number of EEG trials (1, 2, 3 and 4 trials). The proposed method was evaluated with a freely available EEG dataset and was compared with two widely used methods: Mean-Amplitude LDA and Step-Wise LDA. Finally, the proposed method outperforms standard algorithms for P300 detection, providing a maximum accuracy of 86.3% (p=0.27 to Mean Amplitude LDA and p less than 0.05 to Stepwise-LDA) and maximum Area Under Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating characteristic (ROC) of 0.753 (p=0.715 to Mean Amplitude LDA and p=0.228 to Stepwise LDA) on the recognition. Despite the performance of some metrics of proposed method are not significant, the results allow concluding that this one have an acceptable performance for the recognition of P300, using a reduced number of trials.

Enabling event-related potential assessments using low-density electrode arrays: A new technique for denoising individual channel EEG data	2020 IEEE INTERNATIONAL IOT, ELECTRONICS AND MECHATRONICS CONFERENCE (IEMTRONICS 2020)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International IOT, Electronics and Mechatronics Conference (IEMTRONICS)	SEP 09-12, 2020	Vancouver, INDIA	IEEE, Inst Engn & Management, IEEE Vancouver Sect, SMART, Univ Engn & Management		biomedical signal processing; neurotechnology; electroencephalography (EEG); neural signal processing; empirical mode decomposition (EMD); artifact removal	REMOVAL; ARTIFACTS	Background: Brain function assessments based on event-related potentials (ERPs) derived from electroencephalography (EEG) are increasingly being conducted in realistic out-of-the-laboratory settings for clinical and non-clinical uses. For rapid testing and practical limitations, such applications require the use of low-density electrode arrays. A major impediment to their use in these applications is the lack of denoising techniques capable of removing artefactual contamination and isolating the ERPs features of interest within low-density arrays. Methods: A novel denoising technique combining empirical mode decomposition (EMD) with template matching procedure is developed and applied to individual-channel data, and the results of this new approach are compared to the results of a conventional (independent component analysis) denoising approach. Both whole-epoch morphological comparisons and specific ERP feature amplitude comparisons were undertaken at the group and individual level for a variety of ERPs indexing sensory (N100), attention (P300) and language processing (N400) using data from 31 healthy adults. Results: The new denoising technique successfully enables the capture of ERPs ranging from low-level sensation to attention to language processing (all p<0.05). Intra-class correlation analysis reveals high degree of similarity in the time series waveforms derived from the new and the conventional denoising approaches for all ERPs (highest r=0.89, all p<0.001). Analysis of specific ERP features of interest reveals no significant differences between the ERP amplitudes of the waveforms generated using the two techniques, and Pearson correlation suggests a high degree of similarity at the individual level (0.88 for N100, 0.78 for P300, and 0.80 for N400, all p<0.05). Conclusion: The new denoising technique is capable of operating on individual-channel EEG data, and produces results that are similar to those produced by conventional denoising techniques that use data from large whole-head electrode arrays. This new approach may thus enable more widespread use of ERP techniques in real world settings with low-density electrode arrays.

Thus, in EEG-based brain machine interface, information relatively easy to occur, such as motor imagery, has been used. Independent component analysis is a method to estimate multiple sources from EEG signals. If independent components can take some parts encoded by movement direction, it could improve classification performance for brain-machine interface. Therefore, this study aimed to find features contributing to specific direction in planning phase from independent components. Subjects performed a reaching task and were instructed to move their hand to one of five directions. Independent components were calculated from EEG signals during planning phase. We constructed feature vectors of each independent component with analysis of variance (ANOVA) and performed direction classification. Our results showed that using event-related potentials of independent components, classification accuracy were higher than chance level. Independent components that achieved high performance were associated with local region in the brain. Times and duration contributing to high performance were not identical to one another. We confirmed that independent components related to intended direction can be extracted and contributed to high accuracy.

Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks Discriminate Adult ADHD From Healthy Individuals on the Basis of Event-Related Spectral EEG	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						deep learning; EEG; ERP; ADHD; neuroimaging; brain disease diagnosis	CLASSIFICATION; PREVALENCE; POTENTIALS; COMORBIDITY; INHIBITION; MODULATION; DIAGNOSIS; CHILDREN; BMD	Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 5% of the pediatric and adult population worldwide. The diagnosis remains essentially clinical, based on history and exam, with no available biomarkers. In this paper, we describe a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a four-layer architecture combining filtering and pooling, which we train using stacked multi-channel EEG time-frequency decompositions (spectrograms) of electroencephalography data (EEG), particularly of event-related potentials (ERP) from ADHD patients (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 20) collected during the Flanker Task, with 2800 samples for each group. We treat the data as in audio or image classification approaches, where deep networks have proven successful by exploiting invariances and compositional features in the data. The model reaches a classification accuracy of 88% +/- 1.12%, outperforming the Recurrent Neural Network and the Shallow Neural Network used for comparison, and with the key advantage, compared with other machine learning approaches, of avoiding the need for manual selection of EEG spectral or channel features. The event-related spectrograms also provide greater accuracy compared to resting state EEG spectrograms. Finally, through the use of feature visualization techniques such as DeepDream, we show that the main features exciting the CNN nodes are a decreased power in the alpha band and an increased power in the delta-theta band around 100 ms for ADHD patients compared to healthy controls, suggestive of attentional and inhibition deficits, which have been previously suggested as pathophyisiological signatures of ADHD. While confirmation with larger clinical samples is necessary, these results suggest that deep networks may provide a useful tool for the analysis of EEG dynamics even from relatively small datasets, highlighting the potential of this methodology to develop biomarkers of practical clinical utility.

However, asynchronous BCI systems based on video-target-evoked ERPs can pose a challenge in real-world applications due to the absence of an explicit target onset time and the time jitter of the detection latency. To address this challenge, we developed an asynchronous detection framework for video target detection. In this framework, an ERP alignment method based on the principle of iterative minimum distance square error (MDSE) was proposed for constructing an ERP template and aligning signals on the same base to compensate for possible time jitter. Using this method, ERP response characteristics induced by video targets were estimated. Online video target detection results indicated that alignment methods reduced the false alarm more effectively than non-alignment methods. The false alarm of the proposed Aligned-MDSE method was one-third lower than that of existing alignment methods under the same right hit level using limited individual samples. Furthermore, cross-subject results indicated that untrained subjects could directly perform online detection tasks and achieve excellent performance by a general model trained from more than 10 subjects. The proposed asynchronous video target detection framework can thus have a significant impact on real-world BCI applications.

Prestimulus alpha and beta contributions to equiprobable Go/NoGo processing in healthy ageing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG/ERP dynamics; Alpha; Beta; Healthy ageing; Principal Components Analysis (PCA); Auditory Go/NoGo	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; EEG-DYNAMICS; ERP; TASK; NEUROSCIENCE; INHIBITION; COMPONENTS; COGNITION; MIND	The immediately-prestimulus electroencephalographic (EEG) brain state influences subsequent event-related processing, dynamically impacting event-related potential (ERP) and behavioural outcomes. Both EEG and ERPs are known to undergo age-related change, yet few have investigated the consistency in their dynamic interrelations in the context of ageing. The present investigation assessed the impact of prestimulus alpha and beta brain states in 20 young (18-26 years) and 20 gender-matched healthy older (59-75 years) adults who completed an equiprobable auditory Go/NoGo paradigm. Prestimulus alpha and beta band amplitudes in their prominent band topographies were separately used to derive Go and NoGo ERPs at 10 ascending levels of prestimulus activity, and ERP components were derived for these levels using Principal Components Analysis. Prestimulus alpha directly modulated Go/NoGo P3a amplitudes across the groups, while beta inversely modulated the young (cf. older) adult NoGo N1-1, each supporting and extending limited prior research. Several novel effects were also uncovered, most notably an inverse relationship between prestimulus alpha and reaction time. Prestimulus alpha and beta were confirmed as significant determinants of the processing outcomes in this task, and the complex pattern of results provides a normative map in healthy ageing.

Furthermore, the heterogeneity in previous research is addressed by analyzing potentially relevant demographic and methodological moderators (age group, IQ, medication, comorbidity, task, cognitive function, modality, inter-stimulus-interval, number of electrodes). Via database search 52 relevant articles were identified including n = 1576 ADHD and n = 1794 non-ADHD. Using multilevel-models, pooled effect sizes were calculated. For earlier components, individuals with ADHD showed shorter Go-P100-latencies than non-ADHD. For later ERPs, individuals with ADHD showed smaller Cue-P300-amplitudes, longer Go-P300-latencies, smaller NoGo-P300-amplitudes, longer NoGo-P300-latencies, smaller CNV-amplitudes, and smaller Pe-amplitudes. The substantial heterogeneity identified for most of the ERP components could be explained by the demographic and methodological moderators of interest. This meta-analysis identified relevant moderate group differences (-0.32 < d < -0.57), mainly regarding later cognitive ERPs. Nevertheless, results are characterized by substantial heterogeneity and the moderate effect sizes (d < 0.6) limit the use for clinical application.

In this article, we have proposed a method to improve the performance of spatiotemporal filtering by decreasing its dependency to prior estimates of ERP components. For this purpose, we have used a mixture of Gaussian kernels instead of a raw prior signal, and the parameters of the Gaussian kernel are estimated using artificial bee colony algorithm. The algorithm starts with one Gaussian kernel, and after optimizing its parameters, another Gaussian kernel is added. This procedure goes on until the stopping criterion is reached. The efficiency of the algorithm is tested for one single uncorrelated component and two correlated components for synthesized electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. Also, the efficiency of the proposed method is presented on real data for extraction of N170 component in real EEG data.

The olfactory event-related potentials (OERPs) assess the olfactory functions in time domain, with potential utility in anosmia and degenerative diseases. The transcranial magnetic stimulation-electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) could support the investigation of the intracerebral connections with very high temporal discrimination. Its application in the diagnosis of disorders of consciousness has achieved recent confirmation. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and event-related fields (ERF) could improve spatial accuracy of scalp signals, with potential large application in pre-surgical study of epileptic patients. Although these techniques have methodological limits, such as high inter- and intraindividual variability and high costs, their diffusion among researchers and clinicians is hopeful, pending their standardization.

This study presents an experimental design aimed to capture auditory event-related potentials (ERP) and event-related oscillations (ERO) to an oddball task with a fixed stimulus to stimulus interval (SOA = 1000 ms), rare targets (2000 Hz, 10% rate), frequent nontargets (1500 Hz, 80%), and rare stimulus omissions (10%). The data, expectedly, reveal highly robust effects distinguishing target and nontarget conditions. It was also revealed that p50, n100, and p200 ERP components related to sensory gating and observed for nontarget stimuli were strongly facilitated in responses to nontargets following omissions compared to nontargets following nontargets; this facilitation was also prominent for early event-related synchronization observed from delta to upper alpha bands. This experimental paradigm, therefore, enables assessment of a wide range of EEG biomarkers related to selective attention and sensory gating, and is a promising candidate for EEG endophenotype research in neuropsychiatry.

J	Hill, H				Hill, Holger			Exploring the Limitations of Event-Related Potential Measures in Moving Subjects: Pilot Studies of Four Different Technical Modifications in Ergometer Rowing	SENSORS			English	Article						event-related potentials; ERP; EEG; movement artefact; rowing movement	BRAIN-WAVE PATTERNS; EEG; COGNITION; EMOTIV; MOVEMENTS; DYNAMICS; P300	Measuring brain activity in moving subjects is of great importance for investigating human behavior in ecological settings. For this purpose, EEG measures are applicable; however, technical modifications are required to reduce the typical massive movement artefacts. Four different approaches to measure EEG/ERPs during rowing were tested: (i) a purpose-built head-mounted preamplifier, (ii) a laboratory system with active electrodes, and a wireless headset combined with (iii) passive or (iv) active electrodes. A standard visual oddball task revealed very similar (within subjects) visual evoked potentials for rowing and rest (without movement). The small intraindividual differences between rowing and rest, in comparison to the typically larger interindividual differences in the ERP waveforms, revealed that ERPs can be measured reliably even in an athletic movement such as rowing. On the other hand, the expected modulation of the motor-related activity by force output was largely affected by movement artefacts. Therefore, for a successful application of ERP measures in movement research, further developments to differentiate between movement-related neuronal activity and movement-related artefacts are required. However, activities with small magnitudes related to motor learning and motor control may be difficult to detect because they are superimposed by the very large motor potential, which increases with force output.

Experimental technologies have been greatly advanced to reduce technical timing errors and thereby reduce jitter. However, there remain intrinsic sources of jitter that are difficult to remove. The problem becomes more complicated when multiple sub-components possess different degrees and features of jitter. The jitter issue renders trial-averaged ERP inaccurate and even misleading. Effective methods for correcting ERP distortion due to latency jitter are needed. New Method: This study developed a simple and easy-to-use method and toolbox for correcting ERP jitter based on simple signal processing theories, named ReSync. ReSync can be used to correct multiple overlapping ERP sub-components with different degrees of jitter (including static sub-components) without their affecting each other. Results: The theories, principles, technical details, and limitations of ReSync are presented in this paper, along with a series of simulation and real data examples used to evaluate and validate the method. Comparison with Existing Methods: ReSync was conceptually compared with previous methods in the literature that are related to tackling of the jitter issue from theoretical, methodological, and technical perspectives. Conclusions: Providing a novel approach to latency jitter estimation with automatic dominant frequency identification and integrated decomposition and reconstruction, the ReSync method was validated using both simulation and empirical data, and demonstrated to be an effective jitter-correction approach with implementational simplicity.

Various researchers have proposed different approaches to decode EEG signals for applications like spellers, emotion recognition, lie detection, brain games etc. The ability to analyze concealed behavior is very important for legal and security purposes. Method: This research aims to identify the concealed behavior of an individual. This paper presents a three-stage "Concealed Information Test" using wavelet transform, k-means clustering and multi-layer feed-forward neural network. The test has been developed by analyzing ERP component (P300) of EEG data during a mock crime scene. The wavelet transforms extracts time and frequency information from raw EEG data. K-means clustering clusters the wavelet coefficients into three clusters. As, neural network models the nonlinear time series data viz EEG, hence it has been utilized for classification of clustered data. Results: A hybrid 3-stage classification approach is proposed by combining the advantages of all above-mentioned approaches. EEG data is recorded for a "Concealed Information Test", for implementing the proposed framework. Conclusion: The performance of the proposed system is improved from existing approaches, by providing an accuracy of 83.1%.

Despite the potential utility of ERP/ERF in cognitive domain, the clinical standardization of their use is presently undefined for most of procedures. The aim of the present review is to establish limits and reliability of ERP medical application, summarize main methodological issues, and present evidence of clinical application and future improvement. The present section of the review focuses on well-standardized ERP methods, including P300, Contingent Negative Variation (CNV), Mismatch Negativity (MMN), and N400, with a chapter dedicated to laser-evoked potentials (LEPs). One section is dedicated to proactive preparatory brain activity as the Bereitschaftspotential and the prefrontal negativity (BP and pN). The P300 and the MMN potentials have a limited but recognized role in the diagnosis of cognitive impairment and consciousness disorders. LEPs have a well-documented usefulness in the diagnosis of neuropathic pain, with low application in clinical assessment of psychophysiological basis of pain. The other ERP components mentioned here, though largely applied in normal and pathological cases and well standardized, are still confined to the research field. CNV, BP, and pN deserve to be largely tested in movement disorders, just to explain possible functional changes in motor preparation circuits subtending different clinical pictures and responses to treatments.

The ERP, frequency, and time-frequency correlates of feedback processing: Insights from a large sample study	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						cognitive control; EEG; ERPs; error processing; learning; oscillation; time frequency analyses	REWARD PREDICTION ERROR; NEURAL SYSTEM; THETA; POSITIVITY; DELTA; POTENTIALS; COMPONENTS; CONFLICT; CORTEX	Human learning, at least in part, appears to be dependent on the evaluation of how outcomes of our actions align with our expectations. Over the past 23 years, electroencephalography (EEG) has been used to probe the neural signatures of feedback processing. Seminal work demonstrated a difference in the human event-related potential (ERP) dependent on whether people were processing correct or incorrect feedback. Since then, these feedback evoked ERPs have been associated with reinforcement learning and conflict monitoring, tied to subsequent behavioral adaptations, and shown to be sensitive to a wide range of factors (e.g., Parkinson's disease). Recently, research has turned to frequency decomposition techniques to examine how changes in the EEG power spectra are related to underlying learning mechanisms. Although the literature on the neural correlates of feedback processing is vast, there are still methodological discrepancies and differences in results across studies. Here, we provide reference results and an investigation of methodological considerations for the ERP (reward positivity) and frequency (delta and theta power) correlates of feedback evaluation with a large sample size. Specifically, participants (n = 500) performed a two-armed bandit task while we recorded EEG. Our findings provide key information about the data characteristics and relationships that exist between the neural signatures of feedback evaluation. Additionally, we conclude with selected methodological recommendations for standardization of future research. All data and scripts are freely provided to facilitate open science.

An event-related potential study on humor processing	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Extraversion; Humor; Joke processing; Event-related potential; N400; Late positivity	BRAIN POTENTIALS; NEURAL BASIS; COMPREHENSION; APPRECIATION; NEUROTICISM; PREDICTION; RESPONSES; INSIGHT; AROUSAL; MODEL	Extraverts and introverts show different preferences for humor regarding different humor types. However, few studies focused on the neurological underpinnings of the connection between extraversion and the stage-wise cognitive model of humor processing. To investigate the influence of extraversion on different sub-stages of humor processing, electroencephalography (EEG) data was collected when participants read and rated jokes and non-jokes. The event-related potential (ERP) data showed a smaller N400 (300-500 ms) but a larger late positive potential (500-900 ms) for jokes than non-jokes, which may reflect lexical association and integrative interpretation in joke processing. The more extraverted group had a larger P2 (200-300 ms) and a smaller N400 than the less extraverted group in response to all the stimuli, which may indicate their different allocation of attentional and cognitive resources to external stimulation. Additionally, the regression analyses showed that the late positivity effects of jokes were positively correlated with the extraversion level. The results could imply extraverts' controlled processes of cognitive resource allocation for jokes, and suggest the same groups' attentiveness and motivation for reward stimuli (i.e., jokes). Importantly, our ERP data could support extraverts' increased exploration for verbal humor from a better temporal aspect for the first time.

By combining our non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) protocol on dogs with machine-learning algorithms, we show category-specific dog brain responses to pictures of human and dog facial expressions, objects, and phase-scrambled faces. We trained a support vector machine classifier with spatiotemporal EEG data to discriminate between responses to pairs of images. The classification accuracy was highest for humans or dogs vs. scrambled images, with most informative time intervals of 100-140 ms and 240-280 ms. We also detected a response sensitive to threatening dog faces at 30-40 ms; generally, responses differentiating emotional expressions were found at 130-170 ms, and differentiation of faces from objects occurred at 120-130 ms. The cortical sources underlying the highest-amplitude EEG signals were localized to the dog visual cortex.

Unfortunately, the N2 component has a small amplitude and the domain of validity of methods used for its estimation is difficult to assess if real data are considered. Here, we develop a computer simulator of ERP measurements emulating the variability of the visual N2 component and use the synthetic data to evaluate the performance of four popular literature ERP estimation methods. Results confirmed that a solid simulation framework could allow identifying a reliable method to detect small-amplitude ERP components and quantifying its accuracy.

Twelve statistical models are proposed that take into account the characteristics of the signals of ERP sources. For these models, Bayesian inference procedures were developed based on Markov chains Monte Carlo sampling. The effectiveness of these procedures was evaluated using both synthetic data with different signal-to-noise ratios and an array of ERPs obtained from 351 subjects in the Go/NoGo task. The procedure for obtaining estimates of the model parameters of the best accuracy was chosen. An analysis of the dependence of the model signals on the type of human activity performed showed that Bayesian parallel factor analysis is able to identify functionally different components of the ERP.

This study explored the possibility of event-related potential (ERP) markers to predict antidepressant treatment outcomes among MDD patients; (2) Methods: Fifty-two patients with MDD were recruited and evaluated through Hamilton depression (HAM-D), Hamilton anxiety rating scale (HAM-A), and CORE. Patients underwent a battery of ERP measures including frontal alpha symmetry (FAA) in the low alpha band (8-10 Hz), mismatch negativity (MMN), and loudness-dependent auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP); (3) Results: During the eight weeks of study, 61% of patients achieved remission, and 77% showed successful treatment responsiveness. Patients with low FAA in F5/F6 demonstrated a significantly higher remission/response ratio and better treatment responsiveness (F (2.560, 117.755) = 3.84, p = 0.016) compared to patients with high FAA. In addition, greater FAA in F7/F8 EEG channels was significantly associated with greater melancholia scores (r = 0.34, p = 0.018). Other ERP markers lacked any significant effect; (4) Conclusions: Our results suggested low FAA (i.e., greater left frontal activity) could reflect a good treatment response in MDD patients. These findings support that FAA could be a promising index in understanding both MDD and melancholic subtype.

The global COVID-19 pandemic has affected the economy, daily life, and mental/physical health. The latter includes the use of electroencephalography (EEG) in clinical practice and research. We report a survey of the impact of COVID-19 on the use of clinical EEG in practice and research in several countries, and the recommendations of an international panel of experts for the safe application of EEG during and after this pandemic. Methods. Fifteen clinicians from 8 different countries and 25 researchers from 13 different countries reported the impact of COVID-19 on their EEG activities, the procedures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and precautions planned or already implemented during the reopening of EEG activities. Results. Of the 15 clinical centers responding, 11 reported a total stoppage of all EEG activities, while 4 reduced the number of tests per day. In research settings, all 25 laboratories reported a complete stoppage of activity, with 7 laboratories reopening to some extent since initial closure. In both settings, recommended precautions for restarting or continuing EEG recording included strict hygienic rules, social distance, and assessment for infection symptoms among staff and patients/participants. Conclusions. The COVID-19 pandemic interfered with the use of EEG recordings in clinical practice and even more in clinical research. We suggest updated best practices to allow safe EEG recordings in both research and clinical settings. The continued use of EEG is important in those with psychiatric diseases, particularly in times of social alarm such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Reliability of mismatch negativity event-related potentials in a multisite, traveling subjects study	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Event-Related Potentials (ERP); Mismatch Negativity (MMN); EEG; Reliability; Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC); Psychosis	TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; STABILITY; PSYCHOSIS; DEFICITS; RISK; METAANALYSIS; INDIVIDUALS; DURATION; EEG	Objective: To determine the optimal methods for measuring mismatch negativity (MMN), an auditory event-related potential (ERP), and quantify sources of MMN variance in a multisite setting. Methods: Reliability of frequency, duration, and double (frequency + duration) MMN was determined from eight traveling subjects, tested on two occasions at eight laboratory sites. Deviant-specific variance components were estimated for MMN peak amplitude and latency measures using different ERP processing methods. Generalizability (G) coefficients were calculated using two-facet (site and occasion), fully crossed models and single-facet (occasion) models within each laboratory to assess MMN reliability. Results: G-coefficients calculated from two-facet models indicated fair (0.4 < G<=0.6) duration MMN reliability at electrode Fz, but poor (G 0.4) double and frequency MMN reliability. Single-facet G coefficients averaged across laboratory resulted in improved reliability (G 0.5). MMN amplitude reliability was greater than latency reliability, and reliability with mastoid referencing significantly outperformed nose-referencing. Conclusions: EEG preprocessing methods have an impact on the reliability of MMN amplitude. Within site MMN reliability can be excellent, consistent with prior single site studies. Significance: With standardized data collection and ERP processing, MMN can be reliably obtained in multisite studies, providing larger samples sizeswithin rare patient groups.

EEG-based event-related potential (ERP) technology was used to measure brain activity changes. Seventeen stroke patients participated in this study and completed ERP tests that were designed to measure EEG changes during unilateral upper limb movements in preparation and execution stages, with Instruction Response Movement (IRM) and Cued Instruction Response Movement (CIRM) paradigms. EEG data were analyzed using motor potential (MP) in the time domain and the mu-rhythm and beta frequency band response mean value (R-means) in the time-frequency domain. In IRM, the MP amplitude at Cz was higher during hemiplegic arm movement than during unaffected arm movement. MP latency was shorter at Cz and the contralesional motor cortex during hemiplegic arm movement in CIRM compared to IRM. No significant differences were found in R-means among locations, between movement sides in both ERP tests. This study presents the brain activity changes in the time and time-frequency domains in stroke patients during movement preparation and execution and supports the contralesional compensation and adjacent-region compensation mechanism of post-stroke brain reconstruction. These findings may contribute to future rehabilitation research about neuroplasticity and technology development such as the brain-computer interface.

We argue that beyond classical neuroimaging techniques and frequency analyses, methods that can be easily adapted to capture the fast processing of bodyrelated information in the brain are needed. Here we introduce a novel method that allows this by measuring event-related potentials recorded with electroencephalography (ERPs-EEG). This method possesses known EEG advantages (low cost, high temporal resolution, established paradigms) plus an improvement of its main limitation; i.e., spatiotemporally smoothed resolution due to mixed neural sources. This occurs when participants are presented and process images of bodies/actions that recruit posterior visual cortices. Such stimulus-evoked activity may spread and mask the recording of simultaneous activity arising from sensorimotor brain areas, which also process body-related information. Therefore, it is difficult to dissociate the contributing role of different brain regions. To overcome this, we propose eliciting a combination of somatosensory, motor, and visual-evoked potentials during processing of body-related information (us non-body-related). Next, brain activity from sensorimotor and visual systems can be dissociated by subtracting activity from trials containing only visual-evoked potentials to those trials containing either a mixture of visual and somatosensory or visual and motor-cortical potentials. This allows isolating visually driven neural activity in areas other than visual. To introduce this method, we revise recent work using this method, consider the processing of body-related stimuli in the brain, as well as outline key methodological aspects to-be-considered. This work provides a clear guideline to researchers interested or transitioning from behavioural to ERPs studies, offering the possibility to adapt well-established paradigms in the EEG realm to study others' body-related processing in the perceiver's own cortical body representation (e.g., examining classical EEG components in the social and embodiment frameworks).

The study aimed to investigate trait impulsivity and inhibitory components of impulsivity, related or unrelated to emotions in patients with EDs. Method A total of 17 patients with anorexia nervosa (AN), 16 patients with bulimic-spectrum EDs (BSD) and 20 healthy control (HC) participants completed an impulsivity scale (UPPS-P) before performing an emotional inhibitory control task during electroencephalography (EEG) acquisition. Results Higher trait impulsivity in EDs than HC (with higher scores among BSD patients) was observed. However, no differences in behavioural measures or neural indexes [event-related potential (ERP)] of emotional and non-emotional inhibitory control were observed between patients and HC. Conclusion The present results highlighted negative urgency, an impulsive personality trait related to emotions, as a common feature of AN and BSD. Lack of perseverance, a trait which is less related to emotions, specifically characterises patients with BSD. On the other hand, behavioural and ERP data did not show altered inhibitory control in EDs, for either general or emotional-related response inhibition.

Event Related Potentials (ERPs) and other EEG Based Methods for Extracting Biomarkers of Brain Dysfunction: Examples from Pediatric Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Neuroscience; Issue 157; biomarker; predictions; event-related potentials; latent components; cued GO/NOGO task; Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)	DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; CLINICAL-RESPONSE; COGNITIVE CONTROL; STIMULANTS; COMPONENTS; CONFLICT; N2; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; MEDICATION	Neuropsychiatric diagnoses like ADHD are based on subjective methods like interviews, rating scales and observations. There is a need for more brain-based supplements. Stimulant medication is the most common treatment for ADHD. Clinically useful predictors of response have so far not been reported. The aim of this paper is to describe the EEG based methods we apply to extract potential biomarkers for brain dysfunction. Examples relate to biomarkers for pediatric ADHD, and prediction of medication response. The main emphasis is on Event Related Potentials (ERPs). A nineteen channel EEG is recorded during a 3 min eyes-opened task, a 3 min eyes-closed task, and a 20 min cued visual GO/NOGO task (VCPT). ERPs are recorded during this task. The goal of the ERP protocol is to extract biomarkers of assumed brain dysfunctions that significantly differentiate between a patient group and healthy controls. The protocol includes recording during standard conditions and artifact correction. ERP waves can be used or transformed into latent components. The components of the patient group are compared with controls, empathizing components that, when compared, show relatively high effect sizes. Sub-groups of the patients are selected on the basis of the cluster analysis in the space of the components. Treatment procedure (such as medication, tDCS or neurofeedback protocol) can be applied and the changes in components related to treatment in the subgroups are observed, forming the basis for clinical recommendations. The methods described were applied in a study of 87 pediatric ADHD patients. The index of medication response discriminated significantly between responders and non-responders with a large, and clinically meaningful effect size (d = 1.84). In an ongoing study comparing ADHD children with matched controls, several variables discriminate significantly between patients and controls. The global index will exceed d =.8. The EEG based methods described here could be clinically meaningful.

Accumulating evidence indicates that the cause and maintenance of OCD are related to attentional bias. In this study, the neural processes underpinning attentional bias were carefully inspected for thirty participants with a high/low propensity of OC symptoms (HOC/LOC). Both behavioral and electroencephalogram (EEG) data were collected while participants were performing a dot-probe task with the threat or neutral pictures as stimuli. It was discovered from the event-related potential (ERP) results that compared to the neutral pictures, the threat pictures elicited higher amplitudes of ERP component $C1$ for both the HOC and LOC groups during the stimuli onset period. However, only the HOC group exhibited lower amplitudes of ERP component $P1$ to the threat pictures than to the neutral ones, indicating that individuals with a high level of contamination fear might divert their attention away from the threat automatically. The novel findings from the present study can pave an avenue for unveiling the complex neural mechanism associated with attentional avoidance in individuals with contamination fear.

The effect of movie-watching on electroencephalographic responses to tactile stimulation	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Somatosensory-evoked potentials; ERP; EEG; Adaptation; Tactile stimulation; Movies	SOMATOSENSORY EVOKED-POTENTIALS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; MEDIAN NERVE; BRAIN; CHILDREN; VISION; TOUCH; MODULATION; EEG	Movie-watching is becoming a popular acquisition method to increase compliance and enable neuroimaging data collection in challenging populations such as children, with potential to facilitate studying the somatosensory system. However, relatively little is known about the possible crossmodal (audiovisual) influence of movies on cortical somatosensory processing. In this study, we examined the impact of dynamic audiovisual movies on concurrent cortical somatosensory processing using electroencephalography (EEG). Forty healthy young adults (18-25 years) received passive tactile fingertip stimulation while watching an "entertaining" movie and a novel "low-demand" movie called Inscapes' compared to eyes-open rest. Watching a movie did not modulate properties of early or late somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs). Similarly, no crossmodal influence on somatosensory adaptation, denoted by a reduction in SEP amplitude with repetitive tactile stimulation, was found. The prominent oscillatory responses in the alpha and beta frequency bands following tactile stimulation differed as a function of viewing condition, with stronger alpha/beta event-related desynchronization (ERD) during moviewatching compared to rest. These findings highlight that movie-watching is a valid acquisition method during which SEPs can be measured in basic research and clinical studies, but that the attentional demands of movies need to be taken into account when performing oscillatory analyses.

However, it is still a challenge to detect single-trial event related potentials (ERPs) from electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Besides, the variability of EEG signal over time may cause difficulties of calibration in long-term system use. Recently, collaborative BCIs have been proposed to improve the overall BCI performance by fusing brain activities acquired from multiple subjects. For both individual and collaborative BCIs, feature extraction and classification algorithms that can be transferred across sessions can significantly facilitate system calibration. Although open datasets are highly efficient for developing algorithms, currently there is still a lack of datasets for a collaborative RSVP-based BCI. This paper presents a cross-session EEG dataset of a collaborative RSVP-based BCI system from 14 subjects, who were divided into seven groups. In collaborative BCI experiments, two subjects did the same target image detection tasks synchronously. All subjects participated in the same experiment twice with an average interval of similar to 23 days. The results in data evaluation indicate that adequate signal processing algorithms can greatly enhance the cross-session BCI performance in both individual and collaborative conditions. Besides, compared with individual BCIs, the collaborative methods that fuse information from multiple subjects obtain significantly improved BCI performance. This dataset can be used for developing more efficient algorithms to enhance performance and practicality of a collaborative RSVP-based BCI system.

In this article, we develop a simple and feasible concealed information test (CIT) method which is based on the audio-visual event-related potentials (ERPs) and its spatial and temporal features. The main purpose of this article is to extend a pattern recognition method with functional network parameters and global feature entropy of the EEG signals from the whole brain. At the same time, a novel quantum neural network (QNN) classifier was developed to distinguish the guilty and innocent conditions. Functional connectivity can provide extra information of interdependence between different brain regions from the spatial dimension, and entropy can reflect the complexity of the whole brain from the temporal dimension. 20 subjects participated in the CIT experiment and 30 channel ERPs were recorded. A high accuracy of 87.67% was got in recognizing the concealed information, which was higher than 85.43% for basic features, demonstrated the effectiveness of this article. Future studies should further clarify the connectivity difference and further improve the accuracy of the QNN classifier for CIT.

Concepts have two very different relations: thematic relations based on the co-occurrence of events or scenarios, and taxonomic relations based on similarity or shared features. However, it remains unclear whether thematic and taxonomic relationships differentially affect fear generalization. To clarify the underlying cognitive mechanisms of these relations, the current study combined the classical fear conditioning procedure with electroencephalography (EEG). Forty participants were conditioned to a neutral word by pairing the presentation of the word with an unpleasant electrical pulse. A different stimulus was not paired with the electrical pulse. Next, during generalization testing, thematically related or taxonomic-related words were presented. Behavioral responses (shock expectancy and response time) and brain responses (event-related potentials [ERP] and oscillation activity) were recorded. Behavioral results showed that taxonomic relations initiated higher shock expectancy compared with thematic relations, and that conceptual relations did not affect response times. Taxonomic relations induced larger P2 components than thematic relations, and danger generalization stimuli initiated smaller P600 components than safe generalization stimuli. In addition, the magnitudes of alpha and beta oscillations were larger for danger generalization stimuli. These results suggested that taxonomic stimuli generalize broader responses compared with thematic relations after fear conditioning. Therefore, we report a possible new electrophysiological evidence for the presentation of fear generalization. These findings aid our understanding of fear generalization at the concept level and have clinical implications for the cognitive treatment of anxiety disorders.

These recurrent symptoms are thought to maintain the severity and substantial impairment in social and cognitive thoughts. SAD is associated with a disruption in neuronal networks implicated in emotional regulation, perceptual stimulus functions, and emotion processing, suggesting a network system to delineate the electrocortical endophenotypes of SAD. This paper seeks to provide a comprehensive review of the most frequently studied electroencephalographic (EEG) spectral coupling, event-related potential (ERP), visual-event potential (VEP), and other connectivity estimators in social anxiety during rest, anticipation, stimulus processing, and recovery states. A search on Web of Science provided 97 studies that document electrocortical biomarkers and relevant constructs pertaining to individuals with SAD. This study aims to identify SAD neuronal biomarkers and provide insight into the differences in these biomarkers based on EEG, ERPs, VEP, and brain connectivity networks in SAD patients and healthy controls (HC). Furthermore, we proposed recommendations to improve methods of delineating the electrocortical endophenotypes of SAD, e.g., a fusion of EEG with other modalities such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalograms (MEG), to realize better effectiveness than EEG alone, in order to ultimately evolve the treatment selection process, and to review the possibility of using electrocortical measures in the early diagnosis and endophenotype examination of SAD.

Experienced Meditators Exhibit No Differences to Demographically Matched Controls in Theta Phase Synchronization, P200, or P300 During an Auditory Oddball Task	MINDFULNESS			English	Article						Mindfulness meditation; Electroencephalography; EEG; P300; P200; Oddball; Theta phase synchronization; Attention	MINDFULNESS MEDITATION; COGNITIVE THERAPY; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; FOCUSED ATTENTION; PERFORMANCE; ALPHA; EEG; VALIDATION; POTENTIALS; DEPRESSION	Objectives Long-term meditation practice affects the brain's ability to sustain attention. However, how this occurs is not well understood. Electroencephalography (EEG) studies have found that during dichotic oddball listening tasks, experienced meditators displayed altered attention-related neural markers including theta phase synchronization (TPS) and event-related potentials (ERP; P200 and P300) to target tones while meditating compared to resting, and compared to non-meditators after intensive meditation interventions. Research is yet to establish whether the changes in the aforementioned neural markers are trait changes which may be observable in meditators irrespective of practice setting. Methods The present study expanded on previous research by comparing EEG measures from a dichotic oddball task in a sample of community-based mindfulness meditators (n = 22) to healthy controls with no meditation experience (n = 22). To minimize state effects, neither group practiced meditation during/immediately prior to the EEG session. Results No group differences were observed in behavioural performance or either the global amplitude or distribution of theta phase synchronization, P200 or P300. Bayes factor analysis suggested evidence against group differences for the P200 and P300. Conclusions The results suggest that increased P200, P300, and TPS do not reflect trait-related changes in a community sample of mindfulness meditators. The present study used a larger sample size than previous research and power analyses suggested the study was sufficiently powered to detect differences. These results add nuance to our understanding of which processes are affected by meditation and the amount of meditation required to generate differences in specific neural processes.

Previous work suggests that infants process linguistic-phonetic information from simplified sung melodies. The present study investigated whether infants learn words from ecologically valid children's songs. Testing 40 Dutch-learning 10-month-olds in a familiarization-then-test electroencephalography (EEG) paradigm, this study asked whether infants can segment repeated target words embedded in songs during familiarization and subsequently recognize those words in continuous speech in the test phase. To replicate previous speech work and compare segmentation across modalities, infants participated in both song and speech sessions. Results showed a positive event-related potential (ERP) familiarity effect to the final compared to the first target occurrences during both song and speech familiarization. No evidence was found for word recognition in the test phase following either song or speech. Comparisons across the stimuli of the present and a comparable previous study suggested that acoustic prominence and speech rate may have contributed to the polarity of the ERP familiarity effect and its absence in the test phase. Overall, the present study provides evidence that 10-month-old infants can segment words embedded in songs, and it raises questions about the acoustic and other factors that enable or hinder infant word segmentation from songs and speech.

However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning the attentional benefits from mindfulness remain unclear. This randomized controlled trial examined changes in electrophysiological markers of attention before and after completion of a 6-week internet-based mindfulness intervention. EEG and ERP data were collected from 64 generally healthy, mildly stressed older adults. Participants were randomized to an internet-based mindfulness based stress reduction course (IMMI), an internet-based health and wellness education course, or a waitlist control condition. Attentional N2 and P3 evoked potentials were derived from active and passive auditory oddball paradigms. Participants in the IMMI group showed significantly greater differences in P3 peak-trough amplitude between the active and passive oddball paradigms at endpoint relative to controls. There were no significant relationships between the intervention and N2 potentials. Our data demonstrate a measurable increase in attentional control when discriminating or directing attention away from auditory stimuli for older adult participants who received mindfulness training. These findings lend support to the use of the P3 as a neurophysiological measure of meditation engagement and intervention efficacy.

In particular, ship detection is recognized as one of the core research issues of these IoT-driven intelligent marine surveillance systems. Traditional methods based on machine learning have made some achievements in detection tasks for specific objects. However, the ship objects are relatively small, and they are usually not accurately detected. In this article, we propose an electroencephalography (EEG)-based maritime object detection algorithm for IoT-driven surveillance systems in the smart ocean. For this purpose, we conduct experiments to record the EEG signals of subjects when they are watching the maritime image scenes. With the feature analysis of EEG signals, the event-related potential (ERP) components associated with detecting objects are induced, such as the $P3$ and $N2$ components. Employing classification based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA), the area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is used to evaluate the detection accuracy. We use this novel method to determine and identify essential objects and areas from IoT devices, such as digital camera imaging sensors. Our proposed method can not only help to detect small objects accurately using fewer samples but can also be used to reduce the data volume needed to be stored and transmitted in IoT-driven marine surveillance systems.

By using HPM, which is a generative model for estimating underlying process that has unknown onset timing, we can estimate responses of assumed processes underlying cognitive functions and the probability distribution of the onset timing of each process. We applied HPM to ERP data obtained during the oddball task and distinguished ERPs induced by target or nontarget stimuli. We designed 2-process and 3-process HPMs and estimated the responses of each process in these HPMs. Then, we compared these responses with ERP waveforms obtained by conventional averaging. As a result, the waveforms of the estimated response from each model resembled that of averaged ERP while the peak amplitude was higher in estimated responses than in averaged ERP. In addition, the difference of the area under curve between target and nontarget condition was clearer in estimated responses than in averaged ERP. This suggests that HPM might be able to overcome the latency variability of ERP components to estimate more exact components, which will enhance differentiating ERP components between conditions in an ERP study.

These approaches, however, do not analyse or describe the substantial variation in size and shape across the entire individual waveforms. New method: Here we show that the precision of ERP analyses can be improved by fitting gamma functions to components of interest. Gamma model analyses provide time-dependent and shape-related information about the component, such as the component's rise and decline. We demonstrated the advantages of the gamma model analysis in a simulation study and in a two-choice response task, as well as a force production task. Results: The gamma model parameters were sensitive to experimental variations, as well as variations in behavioural parameters. Comparison with existing methods: Gamma model analyses provide researchers with additional reliable indicators about the shape of an ERP component's waveform, which previous analytical techniques could not. Conclusion: This approach, therefore, provides a novel toolset to better understand the exact relationship between ERP components, behaviour and cognition.

The cognitive workload from twenty-five healthy participants was measured during a tilt-ball game while tones were presented in the background to generate event-related potentials (ERPs) in electroencephalographic (EEG) data. In the game, participants were instructed to move the ball to highlighted targets and avoid moving obstacles. The game's difficulty level was manipulated (easy, medium, hard) by adjusting the number and speed of the moving obstacles. The difficulty levels were presented in a random order during multiple short runs to minimize the effects of habituation, fatigue, and boredom. The behavioral results showed that greater task difficulty resulted in a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in game performance, i.e., participants achieved few targets with a high collision rate. To evaluate cognitive workload, we measured the amplitude of early ERP components (N1, P1, and P2) corresponding to the involuntary attention orienting response. The amplitude of the N1 component decreased significantly (p = 0.029) with an increase in cognitive workload. These findings suggest that the early ERP component, specifically the N1, corresponds to attention orienting response, and that the task difficulty modulates it. This study provided evidence that the inverse relationship between ERP components and cognitive workload can be reliably assessed by controlling for other factors such as habituation or boredom during a single task paradigm.

However, little is known about the neurophysiological correlates of these traits. In this work, we explored how the three traits are associated with event-related potential (ERP) components targeted at the etiological processes in a partial delayed threat conditioning task and in a go/no-go task. Fifty community-dwelling volunteers (25 women), without history of neurological or psychiatric conditions, were recruited and assessed for psychopathic traits using the triarchic psychopathy measure. Participants performed a threat conditioning task, and a go/no-go task while undergoing an electroencephalography recording. Results from the threat conditioning task showed that boldness was significantly associated with reduced late positive potential. Concerning the go/no-go task, disinhibition was significantly associated with reduced error-related negativity ERP component. Overall, distinct psychopathic traits were found to be associated with distinct neurophysiological correlates of threat conditioning and response inhibition. This is consistent with models of psychopathy entailing trait fearlessness and externalizing proneness, and related brain mechanisms, as distinct processes underlying the expression of psychopathic traits.

Robust, direct measures are now available through mobile electroencephalography (EEG), but there are no standard protocols for measuring cognitive load during ambulatory and postural activities. Here we provide a proof-of-concept protocol for measuring cognitive load using an auditory oddball cognitive task to elicit P3 event-related potentials (ERP) during three tasks: sitting, standing, and walking on a treadmill. Our results show that this protocol successfully elicited P3 in each task, with as little as 5 minutes of data collection per task. We found a difference in P3 during sitting and walking after approximately 30 minutes of task completion, indicating that the cognitive load of walking was higher than that of sitting (p = .012).

Major disadvantages in implementing such systems are the bulky design and system cost. This study implements a simple multifunction BCI system for the environment control and exigency assistance by just using single channel Electroencephalogram (EEG). In the proposed model, the environment is controlled through Internet of Things (IoT) as per individual's cognitive state while for exigency assistance served as per Event Related Potential (ERP) observed during oddball paradigm. Arduino microcontroller (AMC) hardware is designed for controlling environment. Different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms observed for training the classifiers. Weighted k-Nearest Neighbour (Wk-NN) algorithm trained classifier delivers the best result, with accuracy of 98.3% to detect ERP and 95% accuracy for cognitive state detection. The simple, low cost prototype system was tested for environment control and assistance.

A key proposal from de Villiers and colleagues proposes the essential role of complementation syntax in FBU development. The current study, using scalp electroencephalography (EEG), addressed one opposing hypothesis purporting that complementation is redundant to FBU by characterizing the electrophysiological correlates of FBU and complementation syntax in school-age children. Time-frequency decomposition showed robust parieto-occipital low beta (12-16 Hz) power reduction in the belief versus complementation conditions. This divergence was also supported by event-related potentials (ERPs), with parieto-occipital late slow waves around 600 to 900 ms distinguishing belief and complementation conditions. The false belief condition generated the lowest behavioral response accuracy, suggesting that it is the most challenging condition. Together, the current findings provide evidence showing that complementation is not redundant to FBU. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Guan, Yao; Keil, Andreas; Farrar, M.

The aim of the present study was to compare the GluN2B negative allosteric modulator (NAM) traxoprodil (CP-101,606) with the unselective NMDA receptor channel blocker S-ketamine to give insight into central target engagement and differentiation on multiple EEG readouts. For qEEG recordings telemetric transmitters were implanted in male Wistar rats. Recorded EEG data were analyzed using fast Fourier transformation to determine power spectra and vigilance states. Additionally, body temperature and locomotor activity were assessed via telemetry. For recordings of auditory event-related potentials (AERP) male C57B1/6J mice were chronically implanted with deep electrodes using a tethered system. Power spectral analysis revealed a significant increase in gamma power following ketamine treatment, whereas traxoprodil (6&18 mg/kg) induced an overall decrease primarily within alpha and beta bands. Additionally, ketamine disrupted sleep and enhanced time spent in wake vigilance states, whereas traxoprodil did not alter sleep-wake architecture. AERP and mismatch negativity (MMN) revealed that ketamine (10 mg/kg) selectively disrupts auditory deviance detection, whereas traxoprodil (6 mg/kg) did not alter MMN at clinically relevant doses. In contrast to ketamine treatment, traxoprodil did not produce hyperactivity and hypothermia. In conclusion, ketamine and traxoprodil showed very different effects on diverse EEG readouts differentiating selective GluN2B antagonism from non-selective pan-NMDA-R antagonists like ketamine. These readouts are thus perfectly suited to support drug discovery efforts on NMDA-R and understanding the different functions of NMDA-R subtypes.

Proper ERP detection contributes to widening the scope of use and, in general, improving functionality. The morphology and latency of ERPs are variable among subject sessions, which complicates their detection. Although variability is an intrinsic feature of neuronal activity, it can be addressed with novel views on ERP detection techniques. In this paper, we propose an agile method for characterizing and thus detecting variable ERPs, which keeps track of their temporal and spatial information through the continuous measurement of the area under the curve in ERP components. We illustrate the usefulness of the proposed ERP characterization for electrode selection in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and compare the results with other standard methods. We assess ERP classification for BCI use with Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) and cross-validation. We also evaluate performance with both the information transfer rate and BCI utility. The results of our validation tests show that this characterization helps to take advantage of the information on the evolution of positive and negative ERP components and, therefore, to efficiently select electrodes for optimized ERP detection. The proposed method improves the classification accuracy and bitrate of all sets of electrodes analyzed. Furthermore, the method is robust between different day sessions. Our work contributes to the efficient detection of ERPs, manages inter- and intrasubject variability, decreases the computational cost of classic detection methods and contributes to promoting low-cost personalized brain-computer interfaces.

Event Related Desynchronization (ERD)/Event Related Synchronization (ERS) plays a significant role in finding discriminant features of MI EEG signals. ERD/ERS is one type and Evoked Potential (EP) is another type of brain response. This study focuses upon the classification of MI EEG signals by Removing Evoked Potential (REP) from non-discriminant MI EEG data in filter band selection, called REP. This optimization is done to enhance the classification performance. A comprehensive comparison of several pipelines is presented by using famous feature extraction methods, namely Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), XDawn. The effectiveness of REP is demonstrated on the PhysioNet dataset which is an online data resource. Comparison is done between the performance of pipelines including proposed one (Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and Gaussian Process Classifier (GPC)) as well as before and after applying REP. It is observed that the REP approach has improved the classification accuracy of all the subjects used as well as all the pipelines, including state of the art algorithms, up to 20%.

A small and movable wooden box was designed, inside of which participants were exposed to visually presented words while asked to decide whether or not the first and last letters of each word were in alphabetical order. Simultaneously, brain activity was recorded via EEG. Respective encoding-related brain potentials were contrasted to an open space condition with the same task instruction. Data processing revealed that brain potentials were significantly more negative going at left lateral-frontal electrode locations when participants were inside the box compared to outside. First, we interpret this finding to show an increase in frontal brain activity reflecting higher amygdala activation while inside the box, i.e. a bottom-up process. Given the enclosed nature of this condition, one may assume fear-related brain responses to occur, reflecting projections from the amygdaloid complex to the frontal cortex. A second interpretation is that the increased lateral-frontal activity while inside the box stems from frontal regulation of negative affective responses, i.e. a top-down process, associated with the enclosed space. A third alternative interpretation is that attentional processes mediated by the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are active on higher levels while inside the box versus outside. Under the assumption that the event-related potential (ERP) differences are indeed fear-related, we want to suggest a new psychological construct that is subsequently introduced as implicit claustrophobia, i.e. a non-conscious fear of enclosed spaces.

One common ERP technique used in cognition research is the oddball paradigm where the brain's response to common and uncommon stimuli is compared. The neurologic response to the oddball paradigm produces a P300 ERP which is one of the major visual/auditory sensory ERP components. The purpose of this study to classify ERP responses to common and uncommon tones by extracting the P300 feature from ERP epochs and identify the accurate shape of the P300 wave. For recording ERP data, and OpenBCI system is used. P300 features are extracted using EEGlab which is a mathematical tool of MATLAB. Finally, various types of machine learning models are used for identifying the accurate shape of a P300 wave and then classifying common and uncommon auditory tones. For stimuli classification, all of the algorithms evaluated performed efficiently and built a consistent model with 93.75% to 99.1% evaluation accuracy. Also, for P300 shape detection, NN model showed the best performance with 94.95% accuracy. These findings have the potential to add useful machine learning-based methods to the clinical application of ERPs.

The ERN is thought to partially reflect emotionally aversive aspects of error commission, however, it has thus far not been related to the neural processing of other aversive events, such as brief aversive bodily sensations. Therefore, the present study investigated the links between the ERN and the N1 amplitudes of respiratory-related evoked potentials (RREP) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP). During the acquisition of high-density EEG, 41 healthy participants performed a Flanker task to evoke the ERN, while RREP and SEP were separately elicited, using inspiratory occlusions and electrocutaneous stimulation of the wrist. Significant positive correlations were observed between the amplitudes of the ERN and the N1 of RREP and SEP, suggesting relationships between the neural processing of different emotionally aversive events, namely errors and bodily sensations.

A central question is which stage of processing is changed after training. To answer this question, we measured the contrast response functions and electroencephalography (EEG) before and after ten daily sessions of contrast detection training. Behavioral results showed that training substantially improved visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. The learning effect was significant at the trained condition and partially transferred to control conditions. Event-related potential (ERP) results showed that training reduced the latency in both early and late ERPs at the trained condition. Specifically, contrast-gain-related changes were observed in the latency of P1, N1-P2 complex, and N2, which reflects neural changes across the early, middle, and high-level sensory stages. Meanwhile, response-gain-related changes were found in the latency of N2, which indicates stimulus-independent effect in higher-level stages. In sum, our findings indicate that learning leads to changes across different processing stages and the extent of learning and transfer may depend on the specific stage of information processing.

Various electroencephalogram (EEG)-based technologies have been developed, on the basis of empirical evidence, in order to identify this condition. However, certain electrophysiological phenomena, which seem strongly related with depth of anesthesia in some drugs, appear less consistent with those of other anesthetic drugs. There is a gap between the complexity of the phenomenon of consciousness and its behavioral manifestations, on the one hand, and the empirical nature of the reported electrophysiological markers, which are associated with it, on the other hand. In fact, such a gap might prevent us from progressing toward unified electrophysiological markers of consciousness while under anesthesia, which are applicable to all anesthetic drugs. We believe that there is a need to bridge this conceptual gap. Therefore, in this work, we will try to present a theoretical framework for such bridging. First, we suggest focusing on neuropsychological processes, which seem to have a clear role in the behavioral manifestations of consciousness while under anesthesia but seem, nevertheless, better defined than consciousness itself-such as perception and attention. Then, we suggest analyzing the effects of anesthesia upon these neuropsychological processes, as they are manifested in the EEG signal. Specifically, we will focus on the effects of anesthesia on event-related potentials (ERPs), which seem more easily associable with neuropsychological modeling.

However, its impact on cognitive performance is least explored. Objective: The present study investigated the effect of chronotype (morning "M" vs. evening "E") on cognitive measures as a function of time of the day. In addition, the correlation between electroencephalogram (EEG) waves and subjective/objective cognitive measures were investigated. Method: Cognitive status of 28 adult male subjects (15 "M" and 13 "E") was assessed objectively through event-related potential (ERP) by administering visual odd ball paradigm test and subjectively through Montreal Cognitive Assessment questionnaire. In addition, 20 to 30 min of resting EEG was recorded. Recordings were done from 8 to 10 am and from 4 to 6 pm on a single day. Power spectral analysis of EEG for alpha and beta waves at PZ and FZ cortical sites was done after subjecting selected epochs to fast Fourier transformation. Also, latency and amplitude of P300 potential from event-related potential record were measured. Appropriate statistical tests were applied for analysis. Results: Higher alpha and beta power was observed in "E" at PZ in the evening. "M" showed increased P300 latency and amplitude during evening session for frequent and rare stimuli and vice versa in "E."' Significant negative correlation was seen between latency of rare stimuli and alpha and beta power at FZ site during evening in "E" chronotype only. Conclusion: Result indicates better attention and alertness during evening hours in evening chronotypes and vice versa in morning chronotypes. The findings could be implemented to schedule the mental performance/cognitive load according to individual chronotype.

Response-locked ERPs are usually aligned to the vocal (acoustic) onset, although it is well known that articulatory movements may start up to a hundred milliseconds prior to the acoustic onset and that this "articulatory onset to acoustic onset interval" (AAI) depends on the phoneme properties. Given the previously reported difficulties to measure the AAI, the purpose of this study was to determine if the AAI could be reliably detected with EEG-microstates. High-density EEG was recorded during delayed speech production of monosyllabic pseudowords with four different onset consonants. Whereas the acoustic response onsets varied depending on the onset consonant, the response-locked spatiotemporal EEG analysis revealed a clear asynchrony of the same sequence of microstates across onset consonants. A specific microstate, the latest observed in the ERPs locked to the vocal onset, presented longer duration for phonemes with longer acoustic response onsets. Converging evidences seemed to confirm that this microstate may be related to the articulatory onset of motor execution: its scalp topography corresponded to those previously associated with muscle activity and source localization highlighted the involvement of motor areas. Finally, the analyses on the duration of such microstate in single trials further fit with the AAI intervals for specific phonemes reported in previous studies. These results thus suggest that a particular ERP-microstate is a reliable index of articulation onset and of the AAI.

Sensory evoked potentials in patients with Rett syndrome through the lens of animal studies: Systematic review	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						Electroencephalogram (EEG); Event-related potential (ERP); Rett syndrome; MECP2; Translational biomarkers; Patients; Animal model	AUDITORY BRAIN-STEM; SYNAPTIC CIRCUIT ABNORMALITIES; FREQUENCY-FOLLOWING RESPONSE; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; CPG-BINDING PROTEIN-2; 2/3 PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; MECP2 MUTATION TYPE; MUTANT MOUSE; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL FINDINGS	Objective: Systematically review the abnormalities in event related potential (ERP) recorded in Rett Syndrome (RTT) patients and animals in search of translational biomarkers of deficits related to the particular neurophysiological processes of known genetic origin (MECP2 mutations). Methods: Pubmed, ISI Web of Knowledge and BIORXIV were searched for the relevant articles according to PRISMA standards. Results: ERP components are generally delayed across all sensory modalities both in RTT patients and its animal model, while findings on ERPs amplitude strongly depend on stimulus properties and presentation rate. Studies on RTT animal models uncovered the abnormalities in the excitatory and inhibitory transmission as critical mechanisms underlying the ERPs changes, but showed that even similar ERP alterations in auditory and visual domains have a diverse neural basis. A range of novel approaches has been developed in animal studies bringing along the meaningful neurophysiological interpretation of ERP measures in RTT patients. Conclusions: While there is a clear evidence for sensory ERPs abnormalities in RTT, to further advance the field there is a need in a large-scale ERP studies with the functionally-relevant experimental paradigms. Significance: The review provides insights into domain-specific neural basis of the ERP abnormalities and promotes clinical application of the ERP measures as the non-invasive functional biomarkers of RTT pathophysiology.

Accuracy and neural correlates of blinded mediumship compared to controls on an image classification task	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Intuition; Mediumship; Electroencephalography; Behavior; Machine-learning	POTENTIALS; COMPONENT; MEDIA; ERP	In this study, a classification task asked participants to look at 180 facial photographs of deceased individuals (photographs were taken years prior to their deaths) and guess the cause of death from three equiprobable categories: heart attack; death by firearm; or car accident. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) data were simultaneously collected during the task. The participants included individuals who claimed "mediumistic" (psychic) abilities and controls who claimed no mediumistic ability. Pooled data showed accurate guesses for the cause of death (partial eta(2) = 0.12; p = 0.004), and control subjects were primarily responsible for this effect (partial eta(2) = 0.11; p = 0.005). EEG and ECG differences were found between the mediums and controls. Control participants had larger amplitude event-related potentials (ERP) following the presentation of the images than the mediums, between 80 and 110 ms, and between 200 and 350 ms. This could be interpreted as reflecting greater attention and less response inhibition by controls as compared to the mediums. Participants in the control group also had lower average heart rates than the mediums, possibly indicating less stress during the task. Speculations and limits regarding why controls performed better than mediums are discussed.

It remains unclear, however, how animals perceive and discriminate these differences. The amplitudes and latencies of event-related potentials (ERP) components can reflect the auditory processing efficiency and time course. We investigated the neural mechanisms of auditory processing in the Emei music frog (Nidirana daunchina) using an Oddball paradigm with ERP. We recorded and analyzed eletroencephalogram (EEG) signals from the forebrain and midbrain when the subjects listened to white noise (WN) and conspecific sex-specific vocalizations. We found that (1) both amplitudes and latencies of some ERP components evoked by conspecific calls were significantly higher than those by WN, suggesting the music frogs can discriminate conspecific vocalizations from background noise; (2) both amplitudes and latencies of most ERP components evoked by female calls were significantly higher or longer than those by male calls, implying that the ERP components can reflect sex differences in vocalization; and (3) there were significant differences in ERP amplitudes between male and female subjects, suggesting a sexual dimorphism in auditory perception. Together, the present results indicate that the music frog could discriminate conspecific calls from noise, male's calls from female's ones, and sexual dimorphism of auditory perception existed in this species.

The Electrocortical Signature of Successful and Unsuccessful Deception in a Face-to-Face Social Interaction	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						deception; truth; lie; EEG; ERP; contingent negative variation	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; LIE DETECTION; POTENTIALS; ACCURACY; CNV	Deceptive behavior, and the evaluation of others' behavior as truthful or deceptive, are crucial aspects of human social interaction. We report a study investigating two participants in a social interaction, performing a deception task. The first participant, the "informant," made true or false autobiographical statements. The second participant, the "detective," then classified these statements as truth or lie. Behavioral data showed that detectives performed slightly above chance and were better at correctly identifying true as compared with deceptive statements. This presumably reflects the "truth bias": the finding that individuals are more likely to classify others' statements as truthful than as deceptive - even when informed that a lie is as likely to be told as the truth. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from the informant. Event-related potential (ERP) analysis revealed a smaller contingent negative variation (CNV) preceding "convincing" statements (statements classified as true by the detective) compared to "unconvincing" statements (statements classified as lie by the detective) - irrespective of whether the statements were actually truthful or deceptive. This finding suggests a distinct electrocortical signature of "successful" compared to "unsuccessful" deceptive statements. One possible explanation is that the pronounced CNV indicates the individuals' higher "cognitive load" when processing unconvincing statements.

Spatial covariance improves BCI performance for late ERPs components with high temporal variability	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interfaces; electroencephalography; event related potentials; covariance; riemannian geometry	CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; EEG	Objective.Event Related Potentials (ERPs) reflecting cognitive response to external stimuli, are widely used in brain computer interfaces. ERP waveforms are characterized by a series of components of particular latency and amplitude. The classical ERP decoding methods exploit this waveform characteristic and thus achieve a high performance only if there is sufficient time- and phase-locking across trials. The required condition is not fulfilled if the experimental tasks are challenging or if it is needed to generalize across various experimental conditions. Features based on spatial covariances across channels can potentially overcome the latency jitter and delays since they aggregate the information across time.Approach.We compared the performance stability of waveform and covariance-based features as well as their combination in two simulated scenarios: 1) generalization across experiments on Error-related Potentials and 2) dealing with larger latency jitter across trials.Main results.The features based on spatial covariances provide a stable performance with a minor decline under jitter levels of up to +/- 300 ms, whereas the decoding performance with waveform features quickly drops from 0.85 to 0.55 AUC. The generalization across ErrP experiments also resulted in a significantly more stable performance with covariance-based features.Significance.The results confirmed our hypothesis that covariance-based features can be used to: 1) classify more reliably ERPs with higher intrinsic variability in more challenging real-life applications and 2) generalize across related experimental protocols.

Investigating Age-Related Neural Compensation During Emotion Perception Using Electroencephalography	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						emotion perception; ageing; neural compensation; electroencephalogram	WORKING-MEMORY; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; DIVIDED ATTENTION; FACE RECOGNITION; BRAIN ACTIVATION; OWN-AGE; PATTERNS; LIFE; ERP; IDENTIFICATION	Previous research suggests declines in emotion perception in older as compared to younger adults, but the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we address this by investigating how "face-age" and "face emotion intensity" affect both younger and older participants' behavioural and neural responses using event-related potentials (ERPs). Sixteen young and fifteen older adults viewed and judged the emotion type of facial images with old or young face-age and with high- or low- emotion intensities while EEG was recorded. The ERP results revealed that young and older participants exhibited significant ERP differences in two neural clusters: the left frontal and centromedial regions (100-200 ms stimulus onset) and frontal region (250-900 ms) when perceiving neutral faces. Older participants also exhibited significantly higher ERPs within these two neural clusters during anger and happiness emotion perceptual tasks. However, while this pattern of activity supported neutral emotion processing, it was not sufficient to support the effective processing of facial expressions of anger and happiness as older adults showed reductions in performance when perceiving these emotions. These age-related changes are consistent with theoretical models of age-related changes in neurocognitive abilities and may reflect a general age-related cognitive neural compensation in older adults, rather than a specific emotion-processing neural compensation.

No human intervention is needed in the analysis process. This is the state of the art results for automatic identification of Dyslexic readers using a Lexical Decision Task. We use mathematical and machine learning based techniques to automatically discover novel complex features that (i) allow for reliable distinction between Dyslexic and Normal Control Skilled readers and (ii) to validate the assumption that most of the differences between Dyslexic and Skilled readers are located in the left hemisphere. Interestingly, these tools also pointed to the fact that High Pass signals (typically considered as "noise" during ERP/EEG analyses) in fact contain significant relevant information. Finally, the proposed scheme can be used for analysis of any ERP based studies.

We performed both hypothesis-driven and data-driven analyses using event-related potentials (ERPs) time locked to the second stimulus. We replicated a previously reported left fronto-temporal ERP effect (750-1000 ms post-stimulus) in the VW task, and also found that this ERP component was only present during object memory retrieval in verbal (VW, AW) as opposed to nonverbal (Pic) stimulus types. We also found a right temporal ERP effect (850-1000 ms post-stimulus) that was present in auditory (AW) but not in visual (VW, Pic) stimulus types. In addition, we found an earlier left temporo-parietal ERP effect between 350 and 700 ms post-stimulus and a later midline parietal ERP effect between 700 and 1100 ms post-stimulus, present in all stimulus types, suggesting common neural mechanisms for object retrieval processes and object activation, respectively. These findings support multiple semantic subsystems that respond to varying stimulus modalities, and argue against an ultimate unitary amodal semantic analysis.

J	Jacobsen, NSJ; Blum, S; Witt, K; Debener, S				Jacobsen, Nadine Svenja Josee; Blum, Sarah; Witt, Karsten; Debener, Stefan			A walk in the park? Characterizing gait-related artifacts in mobile EEG recordings	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						artifact; gait; MoBI; mobile EEG	AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; ELECTROCORTICAL ACTIVITY; BRAIN; HEAD; CORTEX; MOTOR; MOVEMENTS; REMOVAL; RHYTHMS; ORIGIN	Brain activity during natural walking outdoors can be captured using mobile electroencephalography (EEG). However, EEG recorded during gait is confounded with artifacts from various sources, possibly obstructing the interpretation of brain activity patterns. Currently, there is no consensus on how the amount of artifact present in these recordings should be quantified, or is there a systematic description of gait artifact properties. In the current study, we expand several features into a seven-dimensional footprint of gait-related artifacts, combining features of time, time-frequency, spatial, and source domains. EEG ofN = 26 participants was recorded while standing and walking outdoors. Footprints of gait-related artifacts before and after two different artifact attenuation strategies (after artifact subspace reconstruction (ASR) and after subsequent independent component analysis [ICA]) were systematically different. We also evaluated topographies, morphologies, and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of button-press event-related potentials (ERP) before and after artifact handling, to confirm gait-artifact reduction specificity. Morphologies and SNR remained unchanged after artifact attenuation, whereas topographies improved in quality. Our results show that the footprint can provide a detailed assessment of gait-related artifacts and can be used to estimate the sensitivity of different artifact reduction strategies. Moreover, the analysis of button-press ERPs demonstrated its specificity, as processing did not only reduce gait-related artifacts but ERPs of interest remained largely unchanged. We conclude that the proposed footprint is well suited to characterize individual differences in gait-related artifact extent. In the future, it could be used to compare and optimize recording setups and processing pipelines comprehensively.

J	Jadav, GM; Lerga, J; Stajduhar, I				Jadav, Guruprasad Madhale; Lerga, Jonatan; Stajduhar, Ivan			Adaptive filtering and analysis of EEG signals in the time-frequency domain based on the local entropy	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Non-stationary signals; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Event-related potentials (ERP); P300; Relative intersection of confidence interval (RICI); Time-frequency signal analysis; Renyi entropy	ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; MENTAL PROSTHESIS; BRAIN; INTERSECTION; DYNAMICS; TASK	The brain dynamics in the electroencephalogram (EEG) data are often challenging to interpret, specially when the signal is a combination of desired brain dynamics and noise. Thus, in an EEG signal, anything other than the desired electrical activity, which is produced due to coordinated electrochemical process, can be considered as unwanted or noise. To make brain dynamics more analyzable, it is necessary to remove noise in the temporal location of interest, as well as to denoise data from a specific spatial location. In this paper, we propose a novel method for noisy EEG analysis with accompanying toolbox which includes adaptive, data-driven noise removal technique based on the improved intersection of confidence interval (ICI)-based algorithm. Next, a local entropy-based method for EEG data analysis was designed and included in the toolbox. As shown in the paper, the relative intersection of confidence interval (RICI) procedure retains the dominant dipole activity projected on electrodes, while the local (short-term) Renyi entropy-based analysis of the EEG representation in the time-frequency domain is efficient in detecting the presence of P300 event-related potential (ERP) at specific electrodes. Namely, the P300 are detected as sharp drop of entropy in the temporal domain that enabled accurate calculation of the index of the noise class for the EEG signals.

Flanker Task-Elicited Event-Related Potential Sources Reflect Human Recombinant Erythropoietin Differential Effects on Parkinson's Patients	PARKINSONS DISEASE			English	Article							BRAIN POTENTIALS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; DISEASE; ERP; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; ATTENTION; CORTEX	We used EEG source analysis to identify which cortical areas were involved in the automatic and controlled processes of inhibitory control on a flanker task and compared the potential efficacy of recombinant-human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) on the performance of Parkinson's Disease patients. The samples were 18 medicated PD patients (nine of them received rHuEPO in addition to their usual anti-PD medication through random allocation and the other nine patients were on their regular anti-PD medication only) and 9 age and education-matched healthy controls (HCs) who completed the flanker task with simultaneous EEG recordings. N1 and N2 event-related potential (ERP) components were identified and a low resolution tomography (LORETA) inverse solution was employed to localize the neural generators. Reaction times and errors were increased for the incongruent flankers for PD patients compared to controls. EEG source analysis identified an effect of rHuEPO on the lingual gyri for the early N1 component. N2-related sources in middle cingulate and precuneus were associated with the inhibition of automatic responses evoked by incongruent stimuli differentiated PD and HCs. From our results rHuEPO seems to mediate an effect on N1 sources in lingual gyri but not on behavioural performance. N2-related sources in middle cingulate and precuneus were evoked by incongruent stimuli differentiated PD and HCs.

J	van der Velde, B; Junge, C				van der Velde, Bauke; Junge, Caroline			Limiting data loss in infant EEG: putting hunches to the test	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; Data loss; Infants; Longitudinal; Data analysis	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NEURAL MECHANISMS; JOINT ATTENTION; ERP; RECOGNITION; 6-MONTH-OLD; 9-MONTH-OLD; BEHAVIOR	EEG is a widely used tool to study the infant brain and its relationship with behavior. As infants usually have small attention spans, move at free will, and do not respond to task instructions, attrition rates are usually high. Increasing our understanding of what influences data loss is therefore vital. The current paper examines external factors to data loss in a large-scale on-going longitudinal study (the YOUth project; 1279 five-month-olds, 1024 ten-months-olds, and 109 three-year-olds). Data loss is measured for both continuous EEG and ERP tasks as the percentage data loss after artifact removal. Our results point to a wide array of external factors that contribute to data loss, some related to the child (e.g., gender; age; head shape) and some related to experimental settings (e.g., choice of research assistant; time of day; season; and course of the experiment). Data loss was also more pro-nounced in the ERP experiment than in the EEG experiment. Finally, evidence was found for within-subject stability in data loss characteristics over multiple sessions. We end with recommendations to limit data loss in future studies.

Dose-dependent modulation of the visually evoked N1/N170 by perceptual surprise: a clear demonstration of prediction-error signalling	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						context trajectory; event&#8208; related potentials; expectancy violation; prediction error	FACE-SENSITIVE N170; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; BRAIN; ERP; POTENTIALS; ATTENTION; RESPONSES; WORD; MMN	Prediction-error checking processes play a key role in predictive coding models of perception. However, neural indices of such processes have yet to be unambiguously demonstrated. To date, experimental paradigms aiming to study such phenomena have relied upon the relative frequency of stimulus repeats and/or 'unexpected' events that are physically different from 'expected' events. These features of experimental design leave open alternative explanations for the observed effects. A definitive demonstration requires that presumed prediction error-related responses should show contextual dependency (rather than simply effects of frequency or repetition) and should not be attributable to low-level stimulus differences. Most importantly, prediction-error signals should show dose dependency with respect to the degree to which expectations are violated. Here, we exploit a novel experimental paradigm specifically designed to address these issues, using it to interrogate early latency event-related potentials (ERPs) to contextually expected and unexpected visual stimuli. In two electroencephalography (EEG) experiments, we demonstrate that an N1/N170 evoked potential is robustly modulated by unexpected perceptual events ('perceptual surprise') and shows dose-dependent sensitivity with respect to both the influence of prior information and the extent to which expectations are violated. This advances our understanding of perceptual predictions in the visual domain by clearly identifying these evoked potentials as an index of visual surprise.

Previous research has established that odor environments regulate the recognition of facial expressions. Therefore, this study combined event-related potentials (ERPs) with a facial emotion recognition task to investigate the effect of food odor context on the recognition of facial expressions and its time course. Fifty-four participants were asked to identify happy, fearful, and neutral faces in an odor context (pleasant, unpleasant or neutral). Electroencephalography (EEG) was performed to extract event-related potentials (ERPs). Behaviorally, unpleasant food odors triggered faster recognition of facial expressions, especially fearful ones. ERP results found that in the early stage, unpleasant food odors within 80-110 ms evoked a larger P100 amplitude than pleasant food odors and no odors, which showed that the unpleasant odor environment promoted the rapid processing of facial expressions. Next, the interaction between odor environment and facial expressions occurred during the middle stage, and the fearful expression evoked a smaller VPP (vertex positive potential) amplitude than the happy and neutral expressions when exposed to the unpleasant food odor environment. This result indicates that unpleasant odor environment consumed fewer cognitive resources when judging fearful expression, showing the promoting effect of mood coherence effect. These findings provided evidence for how people chose odor environments to facilitate the recognition of facial expressions, and highlighted the advantages of unpleasant food odors in communicating emotional information across the olfactory and visual pathways.

However, the current BCI system has several shortcomings as it produces a comparatively lower accuracy for real-time implementations as well as the intuitive paradigm for the users cannot be well established here. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a highly intuitive BCI paradigm that combines event-related potential (ERP) with the speech-imagery task for the individual target objects. The decoding accuracy of the proposed paradigm was 88.1% (+/- 5.90) which is a much significant higher performance than a conventional ERP system. Furthermore, the amplitude of N700 components was significantly enhanced over frontal regions which are priory evoked by the speech-imagery task. Our results could be utilized to develop a smart home system so that it could be more user-friendly and convenient by means of delivering user's intentions both, intuitively and accurately.

The purpose of this study was to measure the performance of cognitive task after 12 h of smoking abstinence by using event-related potentials (ERPs), including the error-related negativity (ERN) and the error positivity (Pe). In Eriksen flanker task, electroencephalography (EEG) signals of 24 smokers were recorded in two conditions: satiety and 12 h abstinence. In the behavioral data, both conditions exhibited more errors and more time on the incongruent trials than congruence. Meantime, the Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale (MNWS) score was increased during abstinence. Smokers showed reduced ERN and Pe after 12 h of abstinence, compared with satiety condition. The results indicate that the diminished error processing in young smokers after 12 h of abstinence. It may be related to increased withdrawal symptoms. In conclusion, the disrupted neurophysiological indexes in the general behavior monitoring system may be caused by abstinence. The results of this study may provide us with new ideas about the effects of short-term abstinence on brain cognitive neuroscience and be helpful for the solution of relapse.

Memory distortion for orthographically associated words in individuals with depressive symptoms	COGNITION			English	Review						False memory; ERP; Emotion; Mood; Depression	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CREATING FALSE MEMORIES; RECOGNITION MEMORY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; EMOTIONAL VALENCE; CONGRUENT FALSE; MOOD INDUCTION; SAD MOOD; ERP; RECOLLECTION	While major depressive disorder has been associated with increased veridical memory for negative information, prior false memory literature has linked high depressive symptoms to increased false memory for negative information. We tested whether these contradictory findings may be due to semantic and emotional cohesion inflating false alarm rates in the most commonly used false memory paradigm - the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM). In Experiment 1, healthy controls and depressive participants completed two emotional false memory tasks: the DRM, using semantically associated words, and an adaptation using orthographically associated words. Participants encoded words associated with neutral or negative critical lures. During subsequent recognition memory testing, errors were greater for negative than neutral semantic critical lures, but the opposite pattern was observed for orthographic critical lures. These findings support that orthographically associated stimuli provide a non-confounded method to test emotional false memory. In Experiment 2, we deployed the orthographic paradigm with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and a state measure of negative mood (Positive and Negative Affective Scale) to better understand neurocognitive components of emotional false memory. Replicating Experiment 1, we found fewer false alarms for negative than neutral novel orthographically associated words. The EEG data showed significant differences in two memory-related event-related potentials: the familiarity-related N400, and the recollection-related late positive component (LPC). N400 amplitudes were larger for true versus false endorsements. For LPC, increasing depressive symptoms predicted greater amplitude differences for true versus false negative items and reduced differences for neutral items. However, increasingly negative mood predicted reduced amplitude differences for negative items, and greater amplitude differences for neutral items. Although depressive symptoms and negative mood state are highly correlated, they may inform differentially influence shifts in memory retrieval strategies, with depressive symptoms predicting reduced false alarms for negative information, and negative mood state predicting increased recollection errors for negative information.

Auditory verbal hallucination (AVH) study might help in understanding schizophrenia from the perspective of individual symptoms. This study aimed to investigate the activities of the resting-state networks (RSN) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and mismatch negativity (MMN) in task-related state of schizophrenia patients with AVH. We recruited 30 schizophrenia patients without any medication for more than 4 weeks (15 AVH patients and 15 Non-AVH patients) and 15 healthy controls. We recorded the EEG data of the participants in the resting-state for 7 min and the event-related potential (ERP) data under an auditory oddball paradigm. In the resting-state EEG network, AVH patients exhibited a higher clustering coefficient than Non-AVH patients and healthy controls on delta and beta bands and a shorter characteristic path length than Non-AVH patients and healthy controls on all frequency bands. For ERP data, AVH patients showed a lower MMN amplitude than healthy controls (p= 0.017) and Non-AVH patients (p= 0.033). What's more, MMN amplitude was positively correlated with clustering coefficient, and negatively correlated with characteristic path length on delta, theta, beta and gamma band in AVH patients. Our results indicate that AVH patients showed a hyper-activity in resting-state and may have impaired higher-order auditory expectations in the task-related state than healthy controls and Non-AVH patients. And it seems reasonable to conclude that the formation of AVH may occupy certain brain resources and compete for brain resources with external auditory stimuli.

The extensive development of online teaching modes such as MOOC has provided massive amounts of learning behavior data for educational researchers. In order to increase the attention of MOOC learners and achieve better teaching results, teachers need to rationally design MOOC courses from multiple dimensions such as teaching content, courseware design, and learner psycholog. The rapid development of brain science research is constantly injecting new vitality into the reform of teaching methods. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a non-invasive measurement of the electrical activity generated when neurons in the brain emit electrical signals synchronously. In specially designed experiments, a large number of the same stimuli will usually appear repeatedly, and the event-related potential (ERP) can be extracted by averaging the EEC data segments and superimposing them together. ERP is the direct result of specific sensory or cognitive events, and it is the response of the brain that can be measured. Therefore, it has been widely used in various research fields such as neuroscience, cognitive science, and psycholog. ERP also has important applications in brain-computer interface. In this study the best state of MOOC learning is explored from the perspective of brain cognition. We obtain and measure the induced brain waves with or without novel stimulus, then analyze the extract ERP component and conduct discriminatory analysis. We design relevant eye movement experiments and EEG experiments to obtain eye movement data and EEG data. Through analysis and comparison, under various learning load levels, we find the relationship between the MOOC course design method and the attention of MOOC learners. Further discuss how to rationally design courses to improve students' learning effects. In this study we discuss the teaching reform methods that teachers should adopt in MOOC teaching, design efficient course introduction methods, stimulate learners' positive emotions, transform teaching methods as novel stimulus, enable learners to jump through the trough of thinking and increase their alertness. Related experiments verify the effectiveness of these methods and provide an effective way to improve the teaching quality of MOOC courses.

Hyperdimensional Computing for Blind and One-Shot Classification of EEG Error-Related Potentials	MOBILE NETWORKS & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); Error-related potentials (ERP); Classification; Hyperdimensional computing		The mathematical properties of high-dimensional (HD) spaces show remarkable agreement with behaviors controlled by the brain. Computing with HD vectors, referred to as "hypervectors," is a brain-inspired alternative to computing with numbers. HD computing is characterized by generality, scalability, robustness, and fast learning, making it a prime candidate for utilization in application domains such as brain-computer interfaces. We describe the use of HD computing to classify electroencephalography (EEG) error-related potentials for noninvasive brain-computer interfaces. Our algorithmnaturallyencodes neural activity recorded from 64 EEG electrodes to a single temporal-spatial hypervector without requiring any electrode selection process. This hypervector represents the event of interest, can be analyzed to identify the most discriminative electrodes, and is used for recognition of the subject's intentions. Using the full set of training trials, HD computing achieves on average 5% higher single-trial classification accuracy compared to a conventional machine learning method on this task (74.5% vs. 69.5%) and offers further advantages: (1) Our algorithm learns fast: using only 34% of training trials it achieves an average accuracy of 70.5%, surpassing the conventional method. (2) Conventional method requires priordomain expertknowledge, or a separate process, to carefully select a subset of electrodes for a subsequent preprocessor and classifier, whereas our algorithm blindly uses all 64 electrodes, tolerates noises in data, and the resulting hypervector is intrinsically clustered into HD space; in addition, most preprocessing of the electrode signal can be eliminated while maintaining an average accuracy of 71.7%.

Case Series of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation as an Augmentation Strategy for Attention Bias Modification Treatment in Adolescents with Anxiety Disorders	CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY AND SPECIAL EDUCATION			English	Article						anxiety; adolescents; attention bias modification; transcranial direct current stimulation; neuromodulation; electroencephalography (EEG); event related potential (ERP)	COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; THREAT-RELATED ATTENTION; NONANXIOUS INDIVIDUALS; MODIFICATION ABM; SOCIAL ANXIETY; ANGRY FACES; CHILDREN; INHIBITION; TRIAL	This article presents the results of a case series to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical promise of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) as an augmentation strategy in clinic referred adolescents. Attention Bias Modification Treatment (ABMT) is a computer-based attention-training protocol designed to reduce rapidly deployed attention orienting to threat and thereby reduce anxiety symptom severity. Studies of ABMT reveal overall small to medium effect sizes. Advances in the neural underpinnings of attention to threat and attention-training protocols suggest the potential of tDCS of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) as a novel augmentation strategy to enhance ABMT's efficacy (ABMT + tDCS). However, tDCS has never been tested in a sample of adolescents with anxiety disorders. Six adolescents with a primary anxiety disorder completed all four ABMT + tDCS sessions. Adverse effects were mild and transient. Adolescents and parents independently reported fair to excellent levels of satisfaction. Impairment ratings of the primary anxiety disorder significantly decreased. Further, electrophysiological data recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) suggested decreases in neural resources allocated to threat. These findings support the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical promise of tDCS as an augmentation strategy in adolescents with anxiety disorders, and provide the impetus for further investigation using randomized controlled designs in larger samples.

Differential Generation of Saccade, Fixation, and Image-Onset Event-Related Potentials in the Human Mesial Temporal Lobe	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						corollary discharge; event-related potentials; hippocampus; human intracranial electroencephalography; saccades	LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; SHARP-WAVE RIPPLES; MEMORY FORMATION; HUMAN HIPPOCAMPUS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; VISUAL EXPLORATION; INTRACRANIAL EEG; EYE-MOVEMENTS; PHASE RESET; BRAIN	Event-related potentials (ERPs) are a commonly used electrophysiological signature for studying mesial temporal lobe (MTL) function during visual memory tasks. The ERPs associated with the onset of visual stimuli (image-onset) and eye movements (saccades and fixations) provide insights into the mechanisms of their generation. We hypothesized that since eye movements and image-onset provide MTL structures with salient visual information, perhaps they both engage similar neural mechanisms. To explore this question, we used intracranial electroencephalographic data from the MTLs of 11 patients with medically refractory epilepsy who participated in a visual search task. We characterized the electrophysiological responses of MTL structures to saccades, fixations, and image-onset. We demonstrated that the image-onset response is an evoked/additive response with a low-frequency power increase. In contrast, ERPs following eye movements appeared to arise from phase resetting of higher frequencies than the image-onset ERP. Intriguingly, this reset was associated with saccade onset and not termination (fixation), suggesting it is likely the MTL response to a corollary discharge, rather than a response to visual stimulation. We discuss the distinct mechanistic underpinnings of these responses which shed light on the underlying neural circuitry involved in visual memory processing.

Preserved performance monitoring and error detection in left hemisphere stroke	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Stroke; Cognitive control; EEG; Multivariate pattern analysis; Event-related potentials	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RESPONSE CONFLICT; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ERP COMPONENTS; NEURAL SYSTEM; ANOSOGNOSIA; LESIONS; AWARENESS; ATTENTION; COMPLEX	Depending on the lesion site, a stroke typically affects various aspects of cognitive control. While executing a task, the performance monitoring system constantly compares an intended action plan with the executed action and thereby registers inaccurate actions in case of any mismatch. When errors occur, the performance monitoring system signals the need for more cognitive control, which is most efficient when the subject notices errors rather than processing them subconsciously. The current study aimed to investigate performance monitoring and error detection in a large sample of patients with left hemisphere (LH) stroke. In addition to clinical and neuropsychological tests, 24 LH stroke patients and 32 healthy age-matched controls performed a Go/Nogo task with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) measurements. This set-up enabled us to compare performance monitoring at the behavioral and the neural level. EEG data were analyzed using event-related potentials [ERPs; e.g., the error-related negativity (Ne/ERN) and error positivity (Pe)] and additionally more sensitive whole-brain multivariate pattern classification analyses (MVPA). We hypothesized that LH stroke patients would show behavioural deficits in error detection when compared to healthy controls, mirrored by differences in neural signals, in particular reflected in the Pe component. Interestingly, despite clinically relevant cognitive deficits (e.g., aphasia and apraxia) including executive dysfunction (trail making test), we did not observe any behavioral impairments related to performance monitoring and error processing in the current LH stroke patients. Patients also showed similar results for Ne/ERN and Pe components, compared to the control group, and a highly similar prediction of errors from multivariate signals. ERP abnormalities during stimulus processing (i.e., N2 and P3) demonstrated the specificity of these findings in the current LH stroke patients. In contrast to previous studies, by employing a relatively large patient sample, a well-controlled experimental paradigm with a standardized error signaling procedure, and advanced data analysis, we were able to show that performance monitoring (of simple actions) is a preserved cognitive control function in LH stroke patients that might constitute a useful resource in rehabilitative therapies for relearning impeded functions.

We studied whether compared to failed attempts in suppression, partial success can potentiate control mechanisms and this might manifest, neurally as modulation of ERP components related to conscious recollection, and behaviorally as delayed recall of learnt items. We employed a modified version of the Think \No-Think paradigm with dominant number of No-Think words (cued to forget). We defined a forgetting index as FI = Final Recall Time-Initial Recall Time. The MF trials were separated into three conditions according to their corresponding FI; Forget, Delayed Recall, and Recall conditions. The findings revealed significant late ERP effects in terms of a late parietal positivity (LPP), modulated by the item condition, that appeared to reflect the consequence of conscious suppression on actual retrieval of stored memory. Over the same topographic location, FI was negatively correlated with the LPP amplitude, demonstrating the consequence of inhibition processing during MF in modulating the recall time. The negative correlation between LPP and FI provides evidence that increased recall time due to MF is also related to reduced activity, probably in the hippocampal-parietal network, corresponding to recollection of suppressed memories.

However, electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis with a large number of channels will cause information redundancy and increase computational complexity. In this paper, a combination of random forest (RF) and genetic algorithm (GA) for EEG channel selection was proposed. Competition III Data set II was used for evaluation of the proposed improved genetic algorithm based on a six-layer batch normalized convolution neural network (BN-CNN). Experimental results show that the average accuracy of 76.1%, 85.7% and 96.9% were obtained between subject A and subject B in three conditions with data is superimposed for 5, 10, and 15 times respectively. In addition, the performance of RF-GACNN is superior that the GA-CNN and CNN. This RF and GA channel selection method would be a new method for event-related potential electroencephalogram signals analysis.

The varying level of autonomic activation in various body positions may explain the differing level of arousal in supine (Lay), seated (Sit), and standing (Stand) body positions. The present study compared for the first time the effect of these three body positions on word-recognition performance (i.e., response accuracy and response time) while simultaneously using electroencephalography (EEG) to watch the brain at work. No significant difference was found among the three body positions for response accuracy. However, the mean response time was significantly faster for the Hit (correct judgment of the repetition of a word-stimulus) response outcome category in the Sit position compared to the Stand position. Moreover, the mean response time was slower for the Miss (incorrect judgment of the repetition of a word-stimulus) category in the Lay position compared to the Sit position. EEG data analysis further revealed interesting trends for the brain potential amplitudes at 180 ms post-stimulus. The amplitude corresponding to the Miss category was significantly different from the Correct rejection category in the Stand position at this timepoint. More importantly though, the differences in brain potential amplitudes between the Miss and the other three categories (Hit, Correct rejection, and False alarm) in the Lay position around this timepoint (180 ms) could be interpreted as a potential neurophysiological correlate underlying the prolonged response time for the Miss category in the Lay position. Possibly, this phenomenon can be linked with the well-known N200 event-related potential (ERP) component.

We present BrainCoDe, a method to implicitly detect vocabulary gaps through the evaluation of event-related potentials (ERPs). In a user study (N=16), we evaluate BrainCoDe by investigating differences in ERP amplitudes during listening and reading of known words compared to unknown words. We found significant deviations in N400 amplitudes during reading and in N100 amplitudes during listening when encountering unknown words. To evaluate the feasibility of ERPs for real-time applications, we trained a classifier that detects vocabulary gaps with an accuracy of 87.13% for reading and 82.64% for listening, identifying eight out of ten words correctly as known or unknown. We show the potential of BrainCoDe to support media learning through instant translations or by generating personalized learning content.

However, in the face of previously unaligned behavioral and LPP results, the present work aimed to take a first step toward more valid electrocortical markers of ROC. Twenty-seven smokers (16 female), abstinent from smoking for 3 h prior to testing, viewed smoking-related pictures while EEG was recorded. During picture viewing, participants were asked to either imagine the short-term benefits (NOW condition) or long-term negative consequences (LATER condition) of smoking, or engage in an arithmetic task (DISTRACT condition). After each picture, participants indicated picture-related subjective craving. In addition to analyzing classic ERPs, we employed single-trial multiple robust regression within subjects to relate EEG activity at each time point and electrode to trial-wise craving ratings. Craving was lower in the LATER and DISTRACT than the NOW condition. LPP amplitudes (300-1000 ms at centro-parietal electrodes) were lower in the DISTRACT but not the LATER compared to the NOW condition. Trial-wise craving was captured between 500 and 1100 ms and around 2400 ms at central midline and left sites for DISTRACT and associated with a very brief and local signal (similar to 900 ms; at C3) for LATER. This replicates the mismatch between self-reported craving and LPP. Single-trial results suggest that the correlates of ROC are not entirely compatible with the focus on centro-parietal slow waves (i.e. the LPP) and that different strategies of ROC are characterized by distinct electrocortical markers.

This characterization may be used to aid early diagnosis and to guide individually-tailored interventions. While some event-related potential (ERP) components, such as the P300 and late positive complex (LPC), have been associated with fluid intelligence (Gf) in young population; little is known whether these associations hold for older people. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to assess whether these ERP components are associated with Gf in the elderly. Fifty-seven older adults performed a continuous performance task (CPT) and a visual oddball paradigm while EEG was recorded. Participants were divided into two groups, according to their performance in the Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices test: high-performance (HP) and low-performance (LP). Results showed that the HP group, compared to the LP group, had higher LPC amplitudes in the CPT and shorter P300 latencies in the oddball task, highlighting the role of ERP components as a potential electrophysiological proxy of Gf abilities in the elderly.

The temporal evolution of pre-stimulus slow cortical potentials is associated with an upcoming stimulus' access to visual consciousness	CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Slow cortical potentials; Event-related potentials; Visual perception; Confidence; Conscious awareness	ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE; SUBJECTIVE AWARENESS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; NEURONAL MODEL; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA; METACOGNITION; FLUCTUATIONS; PERFORMANCE	Slow cortical potentials (SCPs) have been proposed to be essential for the formation of conscious experience. To examine their temporal characteristics, we recorded electroencephalography during a visual backward-masking task, which required participants to localize the missing part of a target stimulus. A subsequent confidence rating was used as a proxy for the target's access to consciousness. Event-related potentials (ERPs) of all correct trials were determined relative to a brief period immediately before the target and then compared among consciousness levels. In an interval ranging from 2 s prior to target presentation up to this period, a negative relationship between slowly fluctuating ERP values and the level of consciousness became evident. After target presentation, high conscious awareness was characterized by an enhanced visual awareness negativity, an increased P3 component, and associated positive SCPs. Together, these findings add new evidence to the proposed role of SCPs in the emergence of visual consciousness.

J	Zhang, YY; Liu, BL; Gao, XR				Zhang Yuanyuan; Liu Baolin; Gao Xiaorong			Spatiotemporal dynamics of working memory under the influence of emotions based on EEG	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						emotion; WM capacity; source location; effective connectivity; ERP; ERSP	CONTRALATERAL DELAY ACTIVITY; TOP-DOWN MODULATION; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SYNCHRONIZATION ERS; INFORMATION-FLOW; VISUAL-ATTENTION	Objective. Previous studies have reported that working memory (WM) may be affected by emotions and that the effect may exist in different stages of WM. However, at present it remains controversial whether emotions inhibit or facilitate WM, and how the mechanism of dynamic information transmission in the brain during WM is affected by emotions. Approach. In this study, we used a video database to induce three emotions (negative, neutral, and positive) and adopted a change detection paradigm based on electroencephalography. Event-related potential (ERP) analysis, event-related spectral perturbation analysis, source location analysis based on the dipole localization method and the distributed source localization method, and effective connectivity analysis were performed. Main results. Both behavioral and ERP results suggest that positive emotions have no significant effect on WM capacity, while negative emotions could facilitate WM capacity. Furthermore, the effective connectivity results based on two source location methods suggest that the long-range connectivity between the frontal and posterior areas can reflect the influence of positive and negative emotions on the WM network, in which the connectivity under the positive emotion condition occurs in the earlier period of WM maintenance, while the connectivity under the negative emotion condition occurs in the later period of WM maintenance. Significance. The consistency of the behavioral, ERP, and effective connectivity results suggests that under the negative emotion condition, the top-down attention modulation between the frontoparietal area and posterior area could promote the most relevant information storage during WM maintenance.

There has been little attempt, however, in validating the findings in an application-oriented context involving longer test spans with realistic learning materials encompassing more items. Hence, the present study investigates subsequent memory prediction within the application context of foreign-vocabulary learning. We employed an off-line, EEG-based paradigm in which Korean participants without prior German language experience learned 900 German words in paired-associate form. Our results using convolutional neural networks optimized for EEG-signal analysis show that above-chance classification is possible in this context allowing us to predict during learning which of the words would be successfully remembered later.

Event-related potential (ERP) studies mostly focus on the P3, which is usually diminished in AUD patients. The few studies that have investigated earlier components have yielded inconsistent results. The present study aimed at identifying the onset of impaired alcohol cue processing in AUD patients, as well as the association between neurophysiological processing and subjective craving. Methods: A sample of 15 inpatients with AUD and 15 healthy controls completed a cue reactivity task with alcohol-related, neutral, and scrambled pictures. Multichannel-EEG was recorded from 70 scalp electrodes, and ERP microstates were analyzed. Results: Patients displayed impaired neurophysiological processing, as indexed by a weaker P3 and a weaker, insensitive P1. The blunted P1 was associated with higher subjective craving. Conclusions: Impaired alcohol cue processing in AUD emerges early, at the stage of sensory processing. Such deficient initial processing seems crucial to understanding cue reactivity processes in the brain and in the subjective experience of craving. Significance: The results highlight the importance of investigating early ERP components preceding the P3, and contribute to the debate on the onset of information-processing dysfunction in the addicted brain.

Mindfulness Meditators Show Enhanced Accuracy and Different Neural Activity During Working Memory	MINDFULNESS			English	Article						Attention; Mindfulness meditation; EEG; Working memory; Alpha; Theta; P3; FN400; Parietal old; new effect; 1; f aperiodic activity	COGNITIVE-PROCESSES; FRONTAL THETA; EEG; ATTENTION; ERP; ALPHA; RECOLLECTION; RETRIEVAL; CAPACITY; LOAD	Objectives Mindfulness meditation has been shown to improve working memory (WM). However, brain activity underpinning these improvements is underexplored. In meditation-naive individuals, increased fronto-midline theta and parieto-occipital alpha oscillations, and steeper 1/f aperiodic activity during WM correlate with better WM performance. Resting theta and alpha oscillations have been found to differ in meditators, but WM-related oscillations and 1/f aperiodic activity have not been examined. Additionally, WM-related event-related-potentials (ERPs) are modulated by attention, which is enhanced by mindfulness meditation, so these neural measures are candidate explanations for WM improvement in mindfulness meditators. Methods We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from 29 meditation-naive controls and 29 experienced mindfulness meditators during a Sternberg WM task and compared theta, alpha and 1/f aperiodic activity during the WM delay, and ERPs time-locked to the WM probe. Results Compared to controls, meditators demonstrated greater WM accuracy (p = 0.008, Cohen'sd = 0.688), earlier left-temporal ERP responses and a more frontal distribution of activity (FDR-p = 0.0186, eta(2) = 0.0903), as well as a reduction in overall neural response strength (FDR-p = 0.0098, eta(2) = 0.1251). A higher proportion of meditators showed theta oscillations during the WM delay, but no other differences in theta, alpha or 1/f aperiodic activity were present. Conclusions Results suggest that increased WM performance in mindfulness meditators might not result from higher amplitudes of typical WM activity, but instead from an alternative pattern of brain region engagement during WM decision making, allowing more accurate responses with less neural activation (perhaps reflecting increased neural efficiency).

In this paper, we propose a method to learn the amplitude of these components for an arbitrary random stimuli sequence. First, a Fisher optimization method is developed for binary prediction of the P300 occurrence. Then, a Generalized Linear Method (GLM) is employed to predict the amplitude of the P300 component. The proposed method is applied to an auditory oddball experiment with recorded Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Both developed methods are shown to yield promising results with an acceptable prediction error.

Machine learning techniques are increasingly adopted to classify single-trial EEG responses thereby primarily relying on amplitude-based features instead of latency-based features. In this study, we investigated changes in EEG response signatures of nine healthy older subjects when performing 10 sessions of covert attention training. We show that, when we trained classifiers to distinguish recorded EEC patterns between the two experimental conditions (a target stimulus is "present" or "not present"), latency-based classifiers outperform the amplitude-based ones and that classification accuracy improved along with behavioral accuracy, providing supportive evidence of brain plasticity.

J	Ortu, D; Vaidya, M				Ortu, Daniele; Vaidya, Manish			Intraexperimental development of priming and event related potentials effects with abstract geometrical stimuli	BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES			English	Article						Reinforcement learning; Conditional discriminations; Electroencephalography; Reaction time; Priming	ERP	In the current study we assessed the possibility of developing intraexperimentally behavioral priming and Event Related Potentials (ERP) effects that are often studied with stimuli to which participants typically have a very extensive pre-experimental history, like words. To do so we used abstract geometrical figures in a baseline Lexical Decision Task (LDT), followed by a conditional discrimination-training phase. We then repeated the LDT task to assess the effectiveness of training compared to baseline. We found that participants' reaction time data in the post training LDT session changed, compared to the pre-training LDT session, according to the specific conditional discriminations taught in the training session. Similarly, neural results suggest the presence of an effect due to training that is absent in the baseline neural measures. Moreover, similar effects were also obtained using words. Results point to the possibility that conditional discrimination learning may be sufficient to establish effects that are often considered to be language specific.

Subjective ratings of everyday life attention and memory problems were also collected.Results:Adults with ADHD showed impairments in executive functions, divided attention and sustained attention, compared with adult controls. Performance on selective attention tasks in adults with ADHD was instead no different from control participants' performance. EEG results confirmed neuropsychological findings by showing a selective impairment on P3 event-related potential (ERP) amplitude indicative of sustained attention deficits. Higher subjective ratings of everyday attentional and memory problems were also found in the ADHD group compared with the control group.Conclusion:This pattern of results suggests differential impairments of attentional skills. Impaired executive functions and higher subjective functional impairments were also found.

Methods The pain state was established by spraying capsaicin on subjects' left inner forearm. A total of 20 experimental pain subjects and 20 matched nonpain controls underwent cognitive tasks with electroencephalogram recording. We collected and analyzed behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) data. Results High cognitive tasks exhibited significantly longer response times and lower accuracies than low-load tasks. The experimental pain group displayed a significantly lower accuracy than the control group. In addition, the experimental pain group showed no significance between high and low cognitive tasks in early ERP components (amplitude of N1, P2, N2, and early part of late positive potential), whereas the control group exhibited significance between different load tasks. Furthermore, we observed a delay peak energy for delta and theta oscillation in Fz 500-800 ms after the onset for pain persons and high cognitive load tasks. Conclusions Inadequate early attention modulation, along with delayed peak energy for brain oscillation (delta and theta), could be accountable for a worse performance in cognitive tasks in the experimental pain group. Thus, cognitive load is a highly considerable factor. Overall, this study offers more insights into how healthy population works with cognitive tasks under pain neurologically.

Methods: We evaluated 72 patients with RRMS and 89 healthy control subjects in a cross-sectional study. Visual ERP were generated using illusory and non-illusory stimuli and recorded using 21 EEG scalp electrodes. The measured activity was modelled using Dynamic Causal Modelling. The model network consisted of 4 symmetric nodes including the primary visual cortex (V1/V2) and the Lateral Occipital Complex. Patients and controls were tested with a neuropsychological test battery consisting of 18 cognitive tests covering six cognitive domains. Results: We found reduced cortical connectivity in bottom-up and interhemispheric connections to the right lateral occipital complex in patients (p < 0.001). Furthermore, interhemispherical connections were related to cognitive dysfunction in several domains (attention, executive function, visual perception and organization, processing speed and global cognition) for patients (p < 0.05). No relation was seen between cortical network connectivity and cognitive function in the healthy control subjects. Conclusion: Changes in the functional connectivity to higher cortical regions provide a neurobiological explanation for the changes of the visual ERP in RRMS. Significance: This study suggests that changes in connectivity to higher cortical regions partly explain visual network dysfunction in RRMS where a lower interhemispheric connectivity may contribute to impaired cognitive function.

However, previous investigations of bilingual children's EF have largely focused on behavioral measures, or on cognitive aspects of EF. The first part of this study compared monolingual and bilingual preschoolers' performance on more purely cognitive and more affective versions of a card-sort task, and the second part investigated Error-related negativity (ERN) event-related potential (ERP) waveforms to understand error-awareness mechanisms underlying task performance. Behavioral results showed bilingual advantages in reaction times but not accuracy, and interaction effects of language background, level of challenge, and affective/motivational salience on reaction times. Electrophysiological results revealed smaller ERN peak amplitudes in bilinguals compared to monolinguals in frontal and frontocentral midline regions. Results highlight that bilingualism may shape motivational mechanisms and neural learning mechanisms such as error-detection, such that bilinguals may be less focused on their errors.

Our goals in the current study were to examine, in a sample of 43 typically developing adolescents (M-age = 15.67 years; SD = 1.01; 32.6% boys), (1) evidence of convergent validity between neural and self-report reward responsiveness, (2) associations between neural reward responsiveness and self-report dispositional affectivity and emotion dysregulation (ED) and (3) evidence of incremental validity of self-report beyond neural reward responsiveness in predicting affectivity and ED. During electroencephalography (EEG), adolescents completed two experimental paradigms probing event-related potential (ERP) indices of reward anticipation and initial responsiveness to reward attainment. Following EEG, they completed self-report measures of reward responsiveness, affectivity, and ED. Findings indicated some evidence of convergent validity between enhanced ERP indices of reward anticipation and initial response to reward and greater reinforcement sensitivity; that ERP indices of both reward responsiveness aspects predicted lower negative affectivity and less ED; and evidence of incremental validity of self-report beyond neural reward responsiveness in predicting outcomes. Results underscore the utility of a multi-method framework in assessing adolescent reward responsiveness and support the relevance of reward responsiveness in explaining individual differences in dispositional affectivity and ED.

This study examined how the release from PI also leads to a reduction in semantic inhibition, as measured primarily through an event-related potential (ERP) electroencephalography (EEG) design. The study used Chinese characters denoting different categories (word nouns for categories such as plants, clothes, and flowers) to test short-term memory recall in a control group (same category/no PI release) and experimental group (different category/PI release). Both behavioral data (recall accuracy) and ERP responses for the N400 and Late Positive Component (LPC) at frontal, central, and parietal electrode sites were collected. Behaviorally, recall accuracy declined continuously on the initial three consecutive trials, regardless of group, while recall increased significantly on the last trial specifically for the experimental group, due to the shift in semantic category. We reported a significant interaction between group and electrode site for the LPC component, indicating that inhibition effects were still active for both groups at the initial memory encoding stage (corresponding to N400), with inhibition release in the experimental group occurring through later LPC processing. These results provide electrophysiological evidence that release from PI can be distinguished from semantic forms of processing through changes in amplitude over the course of learning.

The study's aim was to compare cerebral responses to emotionally positive or negative spoken phrases matched for structure and content. Twenty participants listened to 198 vocal stimuli while detecting filler phrases containing first names. EEG was recorded from 128 sites. Three event-related potential (ERP) components were quantified and found to be sensitive to emotional valence since 350 ms of latency. P450 and late positivity were enhanced by positive content, whereas anterior negativity was larger to negative content. A similar set of markers (P300, N400, LP) was found previously for the processing of positive versus negative affective vocalizations, prosody, and music, which suggests a common neural mechanism for extracting the emotional content of auditory information. SwLORETA applied to potentials recorded between 350 and 550 ms showed that negative speech activated the right temporo/parietal areas (BA40, BA20/21), whereas positive speech activated the left homologous and inferior frontal areas.

The magnitude of the N- and P-waves are used as a semi-objective measure of the response to the painful stimulus: the higher the magnitude, the more painful the stimulus has been perceived. The strength of the N-P-wave response is also largely dependent on the chosen reference electrode site. The goal of this study was to examine which reference technique excels both in practical and theoretical terms when analyzing noxious contact heat evoked potentials (CHEPS) in the amplitude-time spectrum. We recruited 21 subjects (10 male, 11 female, mean age of 55.79 years). We applied seven noxious contact heat stimuli using two temperatures, 51 degrees C, and 54 degrees C, to each subject. During EEG analysis, we aimed to identify the referencing technique which produces the highest N-wave and P-wave amplitudes with as little artifactual influence as possible. For this purpose, we applied the following six referencing techniques: mathematically linked A1/A2 (earlobes), average reference, REST, AFz, Pz, and mathematically linked PO7/PO8. We evaluated how these techniques impact the N-P amplitudes of CHEPS based on our data from healthy subjects.

Typically, this is done by flashing stimuli at the point of static gaze fixation. While allowing for good experimental control, these paradigms ignore the dynamic role of eye-movements in natural vision. Fixation-related potentials (FRPs), obtained using simultaneous EEG and eye-tracking, overcome this limitation. Various studies have used FRPs to study processes such as lexical processing, target detection and attention allocation. The goal of this study was to carefully compare face-sensitive activity time-locked to an abrupt stimulus onset at fixation, with that time-locked to a self-generated fixation on a stimulus. Twelve participants participated in three experimental conditions: Free-viewing (FRPs), Cued-viewing (FRPs) and Control (ERPs). We used a multiple regression approach to disentangle overlapping activity components. Our results show that the N170 face-effect is evident for the first fixation on a stimulus, whether it follows a self-generated saccade or stimulus appearance at fixation point. The N170 face-effect has similar topography across viewing conditions, but there were major differences within each stimulus category. We ascribe these differences to an overlap of the fixation-related lambda response and the N170. We tested the plausibility of this account using dipole simulations. Finally, the N170 exhibits category-specific adaptation in free viewing. This study establishes the comparability of the free-viewing N170 face-effect with the classic event-related effect, while highlighting the importance of accounting for eye-movement related effects.

Yet, connections between neurophysiology and cognitive theoretical frameworks have rarely been established. The theory of event coding (TEC) details how perceptions and actions are associated (bound) in a common representational domain (the "event file"), but the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying these processes are hardly understood. We used complementary neurophysiological methods to examine the neurophysiology of event file processing (i.e., event-related potentials [ERPs], temporal EEG signal decomposition, EEG source localization, time-frequency decomposition, EEG network analysis). We show that the P3 ERP component and activity modulations in inferior parietal regions (BA40) reflect event file binding processes. The relevance of this parietal region is corroborated by source localization of temporally decomposed EEG data. We also show that temporal EEG signal decomposition reveals a pattern of results suggesting that event file processes can be dissociated from pure stimulus and response-related processes in the EEG signal. Importantly, it is also documented that event file binding processes are reflected by modulations in the network architecture of theta frequency band activity. That is, when stimulus-response bindings in event files hamper response selection this was associated with a less efficient theta network organization. A more efficient organization was evident when stimulus-response binding in event files facilitated response selection. Small-world network measures seem to reflect event file processing. The results show how cognitive-theoretical assumptions of TEC can directly be mapped to the neurophysiology of response selection.

There have been studies reported using pain-event related potential (pain-ERP) for evaluating pain perception. However, none of them has achieved high accuracy in estimating multiple pain perception levels. A major reason lies in the lack of investigation of feature extraction. The goal of this study is to assess four different pain perception levels through classification of pain-ERP, elicited by transcutaneous electrical stimulation on healthy subjects. Nonlinear methods: Higuchi's fractal dimension, Grassberger-Procaccia correlation dimension, with auto-correlation, and moving variance functions were introduced into the feature extraction. Fisher score was used to select the most discriminative channels and features. As a result, the correlation dimension with a moving variance without channel selection achieved the best accuracies of 100% for both the two-level and the three-level classification but degraded to 75% for the four-level classification. The best combined feature group is the variance-based one, which achieved accuracy of 87.5% and 100% for the four-level and three-level classification, respectively. Moreover, the features extracted from less than 20 trials could not achieve sensible accuracy, which makes it difficult for an instantaneous pain perception levels evaluation. These results show strong evidence on the possibility of objective pain assessment using nonlinear feature-based classification of pain-ERP.

The experimental manipulation of facial information offers an ecologically valid approach to investigate emotion, attention and social functioning. Humans are highly specialized in face perception and event-related brain potentials (ERP) provide insights into the temporal dynamics of involved neuronal mechanisms. Here, we summarize ERP research from the last decade, examining the processing of emotional compared to neutral facial expressions along the visual processing stream. A particular focus lies on exploring the impact of attention tasks on early (P1, N170), mid-latency (P2, EPN) and late (P3, LPP) stages of processing. This review systematizes facial emotion effects as a function of different attention tasks: 1) When faces serve as mere distractors, 2) during passive viewing designs, 3) directing attention at faces in general, and 4) paying attention to facial expressions. We find fearful and angry expressions to reliably modulate the N170, EPN, and LPP component, the latter benefiting from attention directed at the emotional facial expression. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The OWGWA can choose the control parameters of the grey wolf algorithm utilizing whale parameters. To balance out the randomness of optimization strategies another methodology is implemented called controlled search space. Adaptive filter's noise reduction capability has been tested through adding adaptive white Gaussian noise over contaminated EEG signals at different noise levels. The performance of the proposed OWGWA-CSS algorithm is evaluated by signal to noise ratio in dB, mean value, and the relationship between resultant and input ERP. In this work, ANCs are also implemented by utilizing other optimization techniques. In average cases of noisy environment, comparative analysis shows that the proposed OWGWA-CSS technique provides higher SNR value, significantly lower mean and higher correlation as compared to other techniques.

A time-series of neuronal activities was reconstructed using EEG from 25 PTSD patients and 25 healthy controls (HC). PTSD patients showed an unclear P300 event-related potential (ERP) waveform and significantly different power spectrum compared to HC. In addition, the altered network indices (low strength and clustering coefficient, but enhanced path length) appeared in PTSD patients, and the reduced nodal clustering coefficients were significantly related to symptom scores.

Group penalized generalized estimating equation for correlated event-related potentials and biomarker selection	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Event-related potentials; Correlated data; Penalized generalized estimating equations (GEE); Variable selection; Structured correlation matrix	VARIABLE SELECTION; ENVIRONMENTAL ENTEROPATHY; MODEL SELECTION; INFANTS; FACE; RECOGNITION; REGRESSION; SHRINKAGE; ATTENTION	Background Event-related potentials (ERP) data are widely used in brain studies that measure brain responses to specific stimuli using electroencephalogram (EEG) with multiple electrodes. Previous ERP data analyses haven't accounted for the structured correlation among observations in ERP data from multiple electrodes, and therefore ignored the electrode-specific information and variation among the electrodes on the scalp. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of early adversity on brain connectivity by identifying risk factors and early-stage biomarkers associated with the ERP responses while properly accounting for structured correlation. Methods In this study, we extend a penalized generalized estimating equation (PGEE) method to accommodate structured correlation of ERPs that accounts for electrode-specific data and to enable group selection, such that grouped covariates can be evaluated together for their association with brain development in a birth cohort of urban-dwelling Bangladeshi children. The primary ERP responses of interest in our study are N290 amplitude and the difference in N290 amplitude. Results The selected early-stage biomarkers associated with the N290 responses are representatives of enteric inflammation (days of diarrhea, MIP1b, retinol binding protein (RBP), Zinc, myeloperoxidase (MPO), calprotectin, and neopterin), systemic inflammation (IL-5, IL-10, ferritin, C Reactive Protein (CRP)), socioeconomic status (household expenditure), maternal health (mother height) and sanitation (water treatment). Conclusions Our proposed group penalized GEE estimator with structured correlation matrix can properly model the complex ERP data and simultaneously identify informative biomarkers associated with such brain connectivity. The selected early-stage biomarkers offer a potential explanation for the adversity of neurocognitive development in low-income countries and facilitate early identification of infants at risk, as well as potential pathways for intervention.

Combining electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), previous studies in the visual modality showed that the functional maturation of the event-related potentials (ERP) during the first postnatal semester relates to structural changes in the corresponding white matter pathways. Here investigated similar issues in the auditory modality. We measured ERPs to syllables in 1- to 6-month-old infants and related them to the maturational properties of underlying neural substrates measured with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We first observed a decrease in the latency of the auditory P2, and in the diffusivities in the auditory tracts and perisylvian regions with age. Secondly, we highlighted some of the early functional and structural substrates of lateralization. Contralateral responses to monoaural syllables were stronger and faster than ipsilateral responses, particularly in the left hemisphere. Besides, the acoustic radiations, arcuate fasciculus, middle temporal and angular gyri showed DTI asymmetries with a more complex and advanced microstructure in the left hemisphere, whereas the reverse was observed for the inferior frontal and superior temporal gyri. Finally, after accounting for the age-related variance, we correlated the inter-individual variability in P2 responses and in the microstructural properties of callosal fibers and inferior frontal regions. This study combining dedicated EEG and MRI approaches in infants highlights the complex relation between the functional responses to auditory stimuli and the maturational properties of the corresponding neural network.

Changes of orofacial somatosensory attenuation during speech production	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Event-related potentials; Orofacial somatosensory processing; Speech production; Sensory suppression	EVOKED-POTENTIALS; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; MODULATION; CORTEX	Modulation of auditory activity occurs before and during voluntary speech movement. However, it is unknown whether orofacial somatosensory input is modulated in the same manner. The current study examined whether or not the somatosensory event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to facial skin stretch are changed during speech and nonspeech production tasks. Specifically, we compared ERP changes to somatosensory stimulation for different orofacial postures and speech utterances. Participants produced three different vowel sounds (voicing) or non-speech oral tasks in which participants maintained a similar posture without voicing. ERP's were recorded from 64 scalp sites in response to the somatosensory stimulation under six task conditions (three vowelsxvoicing/posture) and compared to a resting baseline condition. The first negative peak for the vowel /u/ was reliably reduced from the baseline in both the voicing and posturing tasks, but the other conditions did not differ. The second positive peak was reduced for all voicing tasks compared to the posturing tasks. The results suggest that the sensitivity of somatosensory ERP to facial skin deformation is modulated by the task and that somatosensory processing during speaking may be modulated differently relative to phonetic identity.

There is, however, still some unexplained variability in outcomes with a number of cochlear-implant (CI) users, showing major limitations in speech comprehension. The current study used a multimodal diagnostic approach combining single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and electroencephalography (EEG) to examine the mechanisms underlying speech processing in postlingually deafened CI users (N= 21). In one session, the participants performed a speech discrimination task, during which a 96-channel EEG was recorded and the perfusions marker(99m)Tc-HMPAO was injected intravenously. The SPECT scan was acquired 1.5 h after injection to measure the cortical activity during the speech task. The second session included a SPECT scan after injection without stimulation at rest. Analysis of EEG and SPECT data showed N400 and P600 event-related potentials (ERPs) particularly evoked by semantic violations in the sentences, and enhanced perfusion in a temporo-frontal network during task compared to rest, involving the auditory cortex bilaterally and Broca's area. Moreover, higher performance in testing for word recognition and verbal intelligence strongly correlated to the activation in this network during the speech task. However, comparing CI users with lower and higher speech intelligibility [median split with cutoff + 7.6 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the Gottinger sentence test] revealed for CI users with higher performance additional activations of parietal and occipital regions and for those with lower performance stronger activation of superior frontal areas. Furthermore, SPECT activity was tightly coupled with EEG and cognitive abilities, as indicated by correlations between (1) cortical activation and the amplitudes in EEG, N400 (temporal and occipital areas)/P600 (parietal and occipital areas) and (2) between cortical activation in left-sided temporal and bilateral occipital/parietal areas and working memory capacity. These results suggest the recruitment of a temporo-frontal network in CI users during speech processing and a close connection between ERP effects and cortical activation in CI users. The observed differences in speech-evoked cortical activation patterns for CI users with higher and lower speech intelligibility suggest distinct processing strategies during speech rehabilitation with CI.

Orientation-dependency of perceptual surround suppression and orientation decoding of centre-surround stimuli are preserved with healthy ageing	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						Orientation; Multivariate decoding; Surround suppression; Electroencephalography; Event-related potentials; Ageing	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; PERCEIVED CONTRAST; PSYCHOPHYSICS; DEGRADATION; SELECTIVITY; MODULATION; PATTERNS; FOVEAL; EEG	A key visual neuronal property that is mirrored in human behaviour is centre-surround contrast suppression, which is orientation-dependent. When a target is embedded in a high-contrast surround, the centre appears reduced in contrast, the magnitude of which depends on the relative orientation between centre and surround. Previous reports demonstrate changes in perceptual surround suppression with ageing; however, whether the orientation-dependency of surround suppression is impacted by ageing has not been explored. Here, we tested 18 younger (aged 19-33) and 18 older (aged 60-77) adults. Perceptual surround suppression was stronger for parallel than orthogonal stimuli; however contrary to previous work, here we found no difference in perceptual suppression strength between age-groups. In the same participants, we measured event-related potentials (ERPs) and conducted multivariate pattern analysis to confirm that parallel and orthogonal centre-surround stimuli elicit distinguishable brain activity, predominantly over occipital areas. Despite a delay in the first prominent ERP component (P1) in response to each pattern, older adults showed similar decoding of orientation information (i.e. distinguish between parallel and orthogonal centre-surround stimuli from 70 ms post-stimulus onset) as younger adults. This suggests that sufficient information to distinguish orientation in centre-surround stimuli becomes available to the older human brain as early as in younger adults.

For instance, 18-month-olds selectively imitate an observed goal-directed action depending on its (in)congruence with a model's previous verbal announcement of a desired action goal. This EEG-study analyzed the electrophysiological underpinnings of these behavioral findings on the two functional levels of conceptual action processing and motor activation. Mid-latency mean negative ERP amplitude and mu-frequency band power were analyzed while 18-month-olds (N = 38) watched videos of an adult who performed one out of two potential actions on a novel object. In a within-subjects design, the action demonstration was preceded by either a congruent or an incongruent verbally announced action goal (e.g., "up" or "down" and upward movement). Overall, ERP negativity did not differ between conditions, but a closer inspection revealed that in two subgroups, about half of the infants showed a broadly distributed increased mid-latency ERP negativity (indicating enhanced conceptual action processing) for either the congruent or the incongruent stimuli, respectively. As expected, mu power at sensorimotor sites was reduced (indicating enhanced motor activation) for congruent relative to incongruent stimuli in the entire sample. Both EEG correlates were related to infants' language skills. Hence, 18-month-olds integrate action-goal-related verbal cues into their processing of others' actions, at the functional levels of both conceptual processing and motor activation. Further, cue integration when inferring others' action goals is related to infants' language proficiency.

In this work, we present the first comparative assessment of brain activity in subjects viewing stereoscopic images and volumetric images. Electroencephalography was employed to assess the short-term changes in event related potentials and neural oscillations which were further interpreted in terms of cognitive requirements for relative depth judgments. As a result, considerably higher activity have been registered in the beta band and gamma band in case of judging relative depth of stereoscopic images in comparison to performing a similar task on the volumetric display. In addition, the higher neural activity in the parietal area and occipital area has been observed in the case of stereoscopic images in the moments which reflect cognitive responses on the depth component of the visual stimulus. We suggest that the greater demands on cognitive load may lead to a faster onset of fatigue in a long-term perspective. Overall, EEG-based assessment of brain activity indicates that the depth extraction from volumetric images requires less cognitive effort in comparison to stereoscopic images.

Neural correlates of the Dunning-Kruger effect	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; ERP; familiarity; metacognition; recollection	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; SELF-VIEWS INFLUENCE; RECOGNITION MEMORY; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; NONCRITERIAL RECOLLECTION; UNCONSCIOUS INFLUENCES; DIVIDED ATTENTION; RETRIEVAL FLUENCY; REVERSE INFERENCE	The Dunning-Kruger effect (DKE) is a metacognitive phenomenon of illusory superiority in which individuals who perform poorly on a task believe they performed better than others, yet individuals who performed very well believe they under-performed compared to others. This phenomenon has yet to be directly explored in episodic memory, nor explored for physiological correlates or reaction times. We designed a novel method to elicit the DKE via a test of item recognition while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Throughout the task, participants were asked to estimate the percentile in which they performed compared to others. Results revealed participants in the bottom 25th percentile over-estimated their percentile, while participants in the top 75th percentile under-estimated their percentile, exhibiting the classic DKE. Reaction time measures revealed a condition-by-group interaction whereby over-estimators responded faster than under-estimators when estimating being in the top percentile and responded slower when estimating being in the bottom percentile. Between-group EEG differences were evident between over-estimators and under-estimators during Dunning-Kruger responses, which revealed FN400-like effects of familiarity supporting differences for over-estimators, whereas "old-new" memory event-related potential effects revealed a late parietal component associated with recollection-based processing for under-estimators that was not evident for over-estimators. Findings suggest over- and under-estimators use differing cognitive processes when assessing their performance, such that under-estimators may rely on recollection during memory while over-estimators may draw upon excess familiarity when over-estimating their performance. Episodic memory thus appears to play a contributory role in metacognitive judgements of illusory superiority.

Preferred EEG brain states at stimulus onset in normal ageing: Explorations in a fixed interstimulus interval Go/NoGo task	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Ageing; Preferred phase states; Event-related potentials; Brain dynamics; Phase synchronisation; Orthogonal phase effects; Principal Components Analysis; Auditory Go/NoGo task	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY ODDBALL TASK; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; DYNAMICS; PHASE; ATTENTION; CHILDREN; TOOLBOX	Some 40 years ago, Erol Basar began an interesting line of brain dynamics research on the phase of oscillatory EEG activity. Stimuli presented at a fixed interstimulus interval (ISI) were reported to produce a "preferred phase angle" at stimulus onset in the ongoing EEG oscillations, so that cortical negativity occurred more often than expected. Our previous work has confirmed this phenomenon in young adults, and linked it to enhancements in stimulus-elicited ERP components and behaviour. The present study sought evidence for this phenomenon in older adults. Twenty healthy independent-living participants (5 males) aged 59.8 to 74.8 years (M = 68.2) completed a fixed ISI equiprobable auditory oddball task. EEG phases in four traditional bands were computed separately for each artefact-free Go and NoGo trial. These were used to group accepted trials according to the phase quartile at stimulus onset in each band, forming 16 mean ERPs for each participant at each phase quartile/band combination, separately for Go and NoGo. The 32 mean ERPs were decomposed by separate Principal Component Analyses, and the N1 and P3 components were examined as a function of EEG phase at stimulus onset in each band. Differential preferential occurrence of phase states was found in all bands, generally confirming prior results in young adults despite important age differences in both EEG spectra and ERP morphology. Substantial effects on N1 and P3 components, as well as prestimulus CNVs, are discussed. The stability of this phenomenon across age indicates its important role in perception and cognition.

A History of Concussion Affects Relevancy-Based Modulation of Cortical Responses to Tactile Stimuli	FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						task-relevance; electroencephalography; somatosensory ERP; somatosensory processing; sensory gating; concussion	DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL ABNORMALITIES; ATTENTION; INHIBITION; RECOVERY; DEFICITS	Modulating cortical excitability based on a stimulus' relevance to the task at hand is a component of sensory gating, and serves to protect higher cortical centers from being overwhelmed with irrelevant information (McIlroy et al.,2003; Kumar et al.,2005; Wasaka et al., 2005). This study examined relevancy-based modulation of cortical excitability, and corresponding behavioral responses, in the face of distracting stimuli in participants with and without a history of concussion (mean age 22 +/- 3 SD years; most recent concussion 39.1 +/- 30 SD months). Participants were required to make a scaled motor response to the amplitudes of visual and tactile stimuli presented individually or concurrently. Task relevance was manipulated, and stimuli were occasionally presented with irrelevant distractors. Electroencephalography (EEG) and task accuracy data were collected from participants with and without a history of concussion. The somatosensory-evoked N70 event-related potential (ERP) was significantly modulated by task relevance in the control group but not in those with a history of concussion, and there was a significantly greater cost to task accuracy in the concussion history group when relevant stimuli were presented with an irrelevant distractor. This study demonstrated that relevancy-based modulation of electrophysiological responses and behavioral correlates of sensory gating differ in people with and without a history of concussion, even after patients were symptom-free and considered recovered from their injuries.

Distinctiveness is defined by one's ability to make correct order judgments of the presented sounds and is measured via the spatial temporal order judgement task (TOJ). The study aimed to identify electrophysiological indices of the TOJ performance. Tone pairs were presented with inter-stimulus intervals (ISI) varying between 25 and 75 ms while EEG was recorded. A pronounced amplitude change in the P2 interval was found between the event-related potential (ERP) of tone pairs having ISI = 55 and 65 ms, but it was a characteristic only of the group having poor behavioral thresholds. With the two groups combined, the amplitude change between these ERPs in the P2 interval showed a medium-size correlation with the behavioral threshold.

Noninvasive Neurological Monitoring in Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation	ASAIO JOURNAL			English	Article						extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; neuromonitoring; neurologic monitoring; neurologic complication; brain injury; feasibility	CARDIAC-ARREST; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; FEASIBILITY; PREDICTION; OUTCOMES	Optimal neurologic monitoring methods have not been characterized for patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We assessed the feasibility of noninvasive multimodal neuromonitoring (NMN) to prognosticate outcome. In this prospective observational study, neurologic examinations, transcranial Doppler (TCD), electroencephalography (EEG), and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) were performed at prespecified intervals. Outcome at discharge was defined as favorable when modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-3; unfavorable when mRS >3. Of 20 patients (median age 60 years), 17 had TCDs, 13 had EEGs, and seven had SSEPs. With NMN, 17 (85%) were found to have neurologic complications. Fourteen (70%) had unfavorable outcomes. The unfavorable outcome was associated with absent EEG reactivity, coma, central cannulation, higher transfusion requirement, and higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II and Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment scores. Seven patients had both SSEPs and EEGs and exhibited intact N20 responses despite poor outcomes. Four of these seven showed absent EEG reactivity despite intact N20. Eighteen thromboembolic events were observed, 14 of which had positive microembolic signals (MESs) in TCD. All 10 patients with arterial-sided thrombotic events had positive MES. NMN caused no adverse effects. NMN during ECMO is feasible and found high neurologic complication rate. EEG and TCD showed potential for prognostication of neurologic outcome.

In contrast, for emotional faces, previous studies have shown that early event-related potentials (ERPs), the P1, the N170, and, albeit to a lesser degree, the EPN, are relatively resistant to perceptual load manipulations. However, the temporal dynamics of the interaction between load and processing of emotional distractor faces have been neglected so far. In this preregistered EEG study (N 1/4 40), we investigated effects of perceptual load and different inter stimulus intervals (ISIs) on ERPs to fearful and neutral task-irrelevant faces. We used a task with identical visual input regardless of perceptual load (high vs. low), and four ISIs between task and face onset (100 ms, 300 ms, 600 ms, 900 ms). Results show that emotional ERP modulations depend on load manipulations as well as on specific ISIs between the perceptual task and face onset. Emotional P1 effects were modulated by load, irrespective of the ISI, while emotional N170 and EPN effects were independent of load, but modulated by the ISI. In particular, emotion effects for the EPN were only observed after a prolonged period between load task and face onset (ISI900), suggesting a strong vulnerability of this component to any competing task. Taken together, our findings show that early ERP components for fearful expressions show dissociable responses to load and timing manipulations.

J	Herbert, C; Munz, M				Herbert, Cornelia; Munz, Michael			Measuring Gait-Event-Related Brain Potentials (gERPs) during Instructed and Spontaneous Treadmill Walking: Technical Solutions and Automated Classification through Artificial Neural Networks	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						human gait analysis; machine learning; motor potentials; event-related potentials (ERPs); gait-ERPs; cognition	ATTENTION; EEG; (DE)SYNCHRONIZATION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; MOVEMENTS; RHYTHM; FALLS	The investigation of the neural correlates of human gait, as measured by means of non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG), is of central importance for the understanding of human gait and for novel developments in gait rehabilitation. Particularly, gait-event-related brain potentials (gERPs) may provide information about the functional role of cortical brain regions in human gait control. The purpose of this paper is to explore possible experimental and technical solutions for time-sensitive analysis of human gait ERPs during spontaneous and instructed treadmill walking. A solution (hardware/software) for synchronous recording of gait and EEG data was developed, tested and piloted. The solution consists of a custom-made USB synchronization interface, a time-synchronization module, and a data-merging module, allowing the temporal synchronization of recording devices, time-sensitive extraction of gait markers for the analysis of gERPs, and the training of artificial neural networks. In the present manuscript, the hardware and software components were tested with the following devices: A treadmill with an integrated pressure plate for gait analysis (zebris FDM-T) and an Acticap non-wireless 32-channel EEG system (Brain Products GmbH). The usability and validity of the developed solution was investigated in a pilot study (n= 3 healthy participants,n= 3 females, mean age = 22.75 years). The recorded continuous EEG data were segmented into epochs according to the detected gait markers for the analysis of gERPs. Finally, the EEG epochs were used to train a deep learning artificial neural network as classifier of gait phases. The results obtained in this pilot study, although preliminary, support the feasibility of the solution for the application of gait-related EEG analysis.

In recent years, several inconsistencies were found across different EEG studies, which authors often attributed to methodological differences. However, the assessment of such discrepancies is deeply underexplored. It is currently unknown if methodological differences can fully explain emerging differences and the nature of these differences. This study aims to contrast widely used methodological approaches in EEG processing and compare their effects on the outcome variables. To this end, two publicly available datasets were collected, each having unique traits so as to validate the results in two different EEG territories. The first dataset included signals with event-related potentials (visual stimulation) from 45 subjects. The second dataset included resting state EEG signals from 16 subjects. Five EEG processing steps, involved in the computation of power and phase quantities of EEG frequency bands, were explored in this study: artifact removal choices (with and without artifact removal), EEG signal transformation choices (raw EEG channels, Hjorth transformed channels, and averaged channels across primary motor cortex), filtering algorithms (Butterworth filter and Blackman-Harris window), EEG time window choices (-750 ms to 0 ms and -250 ms to 0 ms), and power spectral density (PSD) estimation algorithms (Welch's method, Fast Fourier Transform, and Burg's method). Powers and phases estimated by carrying out variations of these five methods were analyzed statistically for all subjects. The results indicated that the choices in EEG transformation and time-window can strongly affect the PSD quantities in a variety of ways. Additionally, EEG transformation and filter choices can influence phase quantities significantly. These results raise the need for a consistent and standard EEG processing pipeline for computational EEG studies. Consistency of signal processing methods cannot only help produce comparable results and reproducible research, but also pave the way for federated machine learning methods, e.g., where model parameters rather than data are shared.

Switch costs are behavioural indices of limited cognitive flexibility, and switch costs may be decomposable into stimulus- and response-related fractions, as conjectured by the domain hypothesis of cognitive flexibility. According to the domain hypothesis, there exist separable stimulus- and response-related neural networks for cognitive flexibility, which should be discernible as distinct event-related potentials (ERPs). The present card-matching study allowed isolating stimulus- and response-related switch costs, while measuring ERPs evoked by task cues and target stimuli with a focus on the target-locked N2/P3 complex. Behavioural data revealed that both stimulus-task and response-task bindings contribute to switch costs. Cue-locked ERPs yielded larger anterior negativity/posterior positivity in response to switch cues compared to repeat cues. Target-locked ERPs revealed separable ERP correlates of stimulus- and response-related switch costs. P3 waveforms with fronto-central scalp distributions emerged as a corollary of stimulus-related switch costs. Fronto-centrally distributed N2 waveforms occurred when stimulus-task and response-task bindings contributed jointly to switch costs. The reported N2/P3 ERP data are commensurate with the domain hypothesis according to which there exist separable stimulus- and response-related neural networks for cognitive flexibility.

Some studies have shown that tDCS combined with working memory training can alter the effect of training. This study aims to investigate the effect of HD-tDCS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex combined with N-back task on the amplitude of event related potentials (ERP). In the experiment, subjects performed N-back training for 30min every day with active or sham tDCS for 10 days. EEG data were recorded when subjects performing N-back tests prior to the training, 1 day and 20 days post the training, respectively. With the analyses of ERP components, it was found that there were no significant differences between active and sham groups. However, the results of post-test were significantly different from the pre-test. Subsequently, both in active group and in sham group, the amplitude of ERP increased in the frontoparietal and occipital regions 1 day post training.

For example, a left-tilted bar, a deviant, that appears after several presentations of a right-tilted bar, standards, elicits a classic visual mismatch negativity (vMMN): greater negativity for deviants than standards in event-related potentials (ERPs) between 100 and 300 ms after onset of the deviant. The classic vMMN is contributed to by adaptation; it can be distinguished from the genuine vMMN that, through use of control conditions, compares standards and deviants that are equally adapted and physically identical. To determine whether the vMMN follows similar principles to the auditory mismatch negativity (MMN), in two experiments we searched for a genuine vMMN from simple, physiologically plausible stimuli that change in fundamental dimensions: orientation, contrast, phase, and spatial frequency. We carefully controlled for attention and eye movements. We found no evidence for the genuine vMMN, despite adequate statistical power. We conclude that either the genuine vMMN is a rather unstable phenomenon that depends on still-to-be-identified experimental parameters, or it is confined to visual stimuli for which monitoring across time is more natural than monitoring over space, such as for high-level features. We also observed an early deviant-related positivity that we propose might reflect earlier predictive processing.

Assessing neurophysiological changes associated with combined transcranial direct current stimulation and cognitive-emotional training for treatment-resistant depression	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha asymmetry; EEG; event-related potential; tDCS; working memory	EEG ALPHA ASYMMETRY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE ACTIVITY; WORKING-MEMORY; TREATMENT RESPONSE; EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; MAGNETIC STIMULATION; CURRENT THERAPY; THETA-ACTIVITY; TRAIT MARKER	Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a form of non-invasive brain stimulation, is a promising treatment for depression. Recent research suggests that tDCS efficacy can be augmented using concurrent cognitive-emotional training (CET). However, the neurophysiological changes associated with this combined intervention remain to be elucidated. We therefore examined the effects of tDCS combined with CET using electroencephalography (EEG). A total of 20 participants with treatment-resistant depression took part in this open-label study and received 18 sessions over 6 weeks of tDCS and concurrent CET. Resting-state and task-related EEG during a 3-back working memory task were acquired at baseline and immediately following the treatment course. Results showed an improvement in mood and working memory accuracy, but not response time, following the intervention. We did not find significant effects of the intervention on resting-state power spectral density (frontal theta and alpha asymmetry), time-frequency power (alpha event-related desynchronisation and theta event-related synchronisation) or event-related potentials (P2 and P3 components). We therefore identified little evidence of neurophysiological changes associated with treatment using tDCS and concurrent CET, despite significant improvements in mood and near-transfer effects of cognitive training to working memory accuracy. Further research incorporating a sham-controlled group may be necessary to identify the neurophysiological effects of the intervention.

One hundred and fifty emotionally neutral, positive and negative words describing people's traits were used. Subjects were asked to attribute each word to four types of people: one-self, loved, unpleasant and neutral person. The reaction time during adjectives attribution to one-self and a loved person was shorter than during adjectives attribution to neutral and unpleasant people. Self-related adjectives induced higher amplitudes of the N400 ERP peak in the medial cortical areas in comparison with adjectives related to other people. The amplitude of P300 and P600 depended on the emotional valence of assessments, but not on the personalized attribution. The interaction between the attribution effect and the effect of emotional valence of assessments was observed for the N400 peak in the left temporal area. The maximal amplitude of N400 was revealed under self-attributing of emotionally positive adjectives. Our results supported the hypothesis that the emotional valence of assessments and the processing of information about one-self or others were related to the brain processes that differ from each other in a cortical localization or time dynamics.

According to behavioral experiments, these effects belong to distinct processing stages. Yet, these effects evoke overlapping responses in both early and late Event Related Potentials (ERPs). To probe whether these overlaps indicate sharing of resources, all relevant stimulus and response conditions were factorially combined in a numerical value comparison task. To secure ERP validity, same numbers were compared against variable reference values. This design resulted in previously unobserved interactions in behavior but inhibited late ERP effects. All effects arose early in the P1 component (around 100 ms) and most showed hemispheric specificity. Independency of congruity and SNARC effects was observed, whereas SNARC and numerical distance were closely intertwined. Differences in hemispheric specificity, rather than stage-wise separation, were key to independence.

Response inhibition, which can inhibit inappropriate behavior to adapt to changing environments, is an important aspect of executive function. The present study investigated the changes in response inhibition following VIMS using event-related potentials (ERPs). In a two-choice oddball task, ERPs were recorded at baseline (pretest) and after a 40-min virtual reality (VR) training session (posttest). The results showed a larger deviant-N2 amplitude, smaller deviant-P3 amplitude and delayed deviant-P3 latency after the VR training. Our findings suggest that VIMS is characterized in part by impaired response inhibition and that inhibition-related N2 and P3 can be used as electrophysiological indices of response inhibition in the assessment of VIMS.

Conflict-induced slowing is reduced for consecutive high-conflict stimuli, an effect known as conflict adaptation. Verguts and Notebaert's (2009) adaptation by binding theory suggests this is due to Hebbian learning of cognitive control, potentiated by the response of the locus coeruleus norepinephrine (NE) system. Phasic activity of the NE system can potentially be measured non-invasively in humans by recording the P3 component of the event-related potential (ERP), and the P3 is sensitive to conflict adaptation. Bouret and Sara's (2005) network reset theory suggests that phasic NE might functionally reset ongoing large-scale network activity, generating synchronous neural population activity like the P3. To examine the possibility that network reset contributes to conflict effects in the P3, we recorded high-density EEG data while subjects performed a flanker task. As expected, conflict and conflict adaptation modulated P3 amplitudes. Brain-behavior correlation analyses indicated that activity during the rise of the P3 was related to RT and predicted RT differences due to conflict. More importantly, phase of delta oscillations not only predicted reaction time differences between low-conflict and high-conflict conditions, but delta phase reset also predicted the amplitude of the P3. Delta oscillations exhibited dominant peaks both pre and post-stimulus, and delta at stimulus onset predicted the post-stimulus ERP, in particular the N2 and P3. This result bridges human EEG with basic mechanisms suggested by computational neural models and invasive patient recordings, namely that salient cognitive events might reset ongoing oscillations leading to the generation of the phase-locked evoked potential. We conclude that partial phase reset is a cortical mechanism involved in monitoring the environment for unexpected events, and this response contributes to conflict effects in the ERP. These results are in line with theories that phasic NE release might reset ongoing cortical activity, leading to the generation of ERP components like the P3.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is currently a supportive biomarker in the diagnosis of DLB. We performed a systematic review to better clarify the diagnostic and prognostic role of EEG in DLB and define the clinical correlates of various EEG features described in DLB. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were searched using search strategies for relevant articles up to 6 August 2020. We included 43 studies comparing EEG in DLB with other diagnoses, 42 of them included a comparison of DLB with AD, 10 studies compared DLB with Parkinson's disease dementia, and 6 studies compared DLB with other dementias. The studies were visual EEG assessment (6), quantitative EEG (35) and event-related potential studies (2). The most consistent observation was the slowing of the dominant EEG rhythm (<8 Hz) assessed visually or through quantitative EEG, which was observed in similar to 90% of patients with DLB and only similar to 10% of patients with AD. Other findings based on qualitative rating, spectral power analyses, connectivity, microstate and machine learning algorithms were largely heterogenous due to differences in study design, EEG acquisition, preprocessing and analysis.

The effect has been studied thoroughly in the last three decades, but its neural underpinnings remain a matter of speculation. A systematic review was conducted to evaluate the current evidence from studies applying neuroimaging or neurophysiological methods to investigate the glucose enhancement effect. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria of using neuroimaging in conjunction with cognitive outcomes. Six studies employed electroencephalography (EEG), four used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and one employed functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). All but one study reported modulation of neurophysiology or neuroimaging markers following glucose, while only five studies reported significant changes in cognitive outcomes. The evidence suggests that glucose administration enhances neurocognitive markers of episodic memory and attentional processes underpinned by medial temporal and frontal activation, sometimes in the absence of measurable behavioural effects. Further exploration of glucose facilitation using neuroimaging measures with increased sample sizes is warranted to replicate these findings.

BCIs based on visual event-related potentials (ERPs) depend on the perception of external stimulations and this makes them ill-designed for people with impaired gaze. To approach gaze-independent spelling, we have designed a visual ERP BCI using a P300 matrix speller based on mental imagery. The predefined intensification sequences were intuitively arranged and known by participants. By gradually reducing the intensification opacity from 100% to 0%, participants were guided on mentally imagining the intensifications in rhythm with auditory cues. This study investigated whether imagined visual stimulation can lead to ERP elicitation. The results of testing our paradigm with 15 healthy participants proved that ERPs were still significantly elicited during the mental imagery.

Twenty-seven participants (M= 25.26,SD= 5.35) whose consumption was more motivated by symbolic needs (vs. functional) were instructed to perform a visual task to evaluate the naturalness of the target stimuli. As hypothesized, the subjective evaluation showed that they had lower attitudes and perceived higher unnaturalness when the symbolic brand was recommended by AI (vs. human). Based on this self-report, two epochs were segmented for the ERP analysis: human-natural and AI-unnatural. As revealed by P100 amplitude modulation on visual modality of two agents, their evaluation relied more on face image rather than text. Furthermore, this tendency was consistently observed in that of N170 amplitude when the agent identity was defined as human. However, when the agent identity was defined as AI, reversed N170 modulation was observed, indicating that participants referred more to textual information than graphical information to assess the naturalness of the agent.

Novel Signal Processing Technique for Capture and Isolation of Blink-Related Oscillations Using a Low-Density Electrode Array for Bedside Evaluation of Consciousness	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Oscillators; Electrodes; Noise reduction; Filtering; Pollution measurement; Blink-related oscillations; artifact removal; biomedical signal processing; electroencephalography (EEG); point-of-care assessment; neurotechnology	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VEGETATIVE STATE; DELTA OSCILLATIONS; SINGLE-CHANNEL; BRAIN-FUNCTION; EYE-MOVEMENTS; WIRELESS EEG; ARTIFACTS; REMOVAL; DISORDERS	Objective: Blink-related oscillations derived from electroencephalography (EEG) have recently emerged as an important measure of awareness. Combined with portable EEG hardware with low-density electrode arrays, this neural marker may crucially augment the existing bedside assessments of consciousness in unresponsive patients. Nonetheless, the close relationship between signal characteristics of the neural response of interest and blink-induced oculomotor artifacts poses particular challenges when measuring blink-related oscillations using a point-of-care platform. This study presents a novel denoising approach based on time-frequency (TF) filtering that exploits the differential temporal and spectral features to isolate the neural response from ocular artifact in a low-density array. Methods: We investigated the effectiveness of the TF filtering technique using 64-channel EEG data collected in healthy adults, with focal analysis of the Pz and POz channels. Results: TF filtering showed comparable performance in denoising the signal relative to the established gold-standard independent component analysis approach, with strong similarities in morphological characteristics as measured by intraclass correlations (p < 0.001), extent of artifact rejection based on the ocular contamination index (p < 0.006), as well as time- and frequency-domain signal capture (p < 0.05). Results are robust at the individual and group levels, and are crucially validated using raw data from only four electrodes comprising Pz, POz, Fp2, and T7. Conclusion: These results demonstrate for the first time that TF filtering enables the successful capture and isolation of the blink-related oscillations response using a four-electrode array. Significance: This significantly advances the translation of the blink-related oscillations marker to a point-of-care platform for eventual bedside applications.

Here, we examined the effects of working memory (WM) training on various indices potentially related to SA. Pre-selected university students with elevated self-reported SA symptoms were assigned to a WM training (n = 21) or an active control treatment condition (n = 21). Pre- and post-treatment assessments were made using questionnaires related to (social) anxiety and depression, and tasks measuring WM, interference control, and attentional biases towards, and event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by, angry faces. The training enhanced WM transfer task performance, reduced SA symptoms, and changed the amplitude of the P1, N170, P2, and N2 ERP components. However, the latter changes did not mediate the effect of WM training on SA symptoms. These data provide preliminary evidence of the usefulness of WM trainings to reduce potential indices of SA, but further research is necessary to unravel the causal relation among these indices.

The EEG classification of musical notes is attempted for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. This type of classification could be applied towards the development of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) for the composition of music via thought as well as the definition of mappings between different stimuli for Sensory Substitution Devices (SSDs) that are based on their actual impact on brain signals and thus serve better the purpose of SSDs, which is to translate between senses at the perceptual level. Event-Related Spectral Perturbations (ERSP) are extracted as features and are fed into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Our aim was to classify musical notes as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B and we have achieved it with an average accuracy of 70%. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Corneo-retinal-dipole and eyelid-related eye artifacts can be corrected offline and online in electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic signals	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Magnetoencephalography; Eye artifact; Electrooculography; Event-related potential; Brain-computer interface	EEG; MOVEMENTS; REMOVAL; BLINKS	Eye movements and blinks contaminate electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) activity. As the eye moves, the corneo-retinal dipole (CRD) and eyelid introduce potential/field changes in the M/ EEG activity. These eye artifacts can affect a brain-computer interface and thereby impinge on neurofeedback quality. Here, we introduce the sparse generalized eye artifact subspace subtraction (SGEYESUB) algorithm that can correct these eye artifacts offline and in real time. We provide an open source reference implementation of the algorithm and the paradigm to obtain calibration data. Once the algorithm is fitted to calibration data (approx. 5 min), the eye artifact correction reduces to a matrix multiplication. We compared SGEYESUB with 4 state-of-the-art algorithms using M/EEG activity of 69 participants. SGEYESUB achieved the best trade-off between correcting the eye artifacts and preserving brain activity. Residual correlations between the corrected M/EEG channels and the eye artifacts were below 0.1. Error-related and movement-related cortical potentials were attenuated by less than 0.5 mu V. Our results furthermore demonstrate that CRD and eyelid-related artifacts can be assumed to be stationary for at least 1-1.5 h, validating the feasibility of our approach in offline and online eye artifact correction.

A Systematic Review of EEG Studies	JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Review						Low back pain; Electroencephalography; Evoked potential; Central nervous system	SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISM; CHRONIC MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN; AUDITORY EVOKED-RESPONSES; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TRUNK MUSCLE ACTIVATION; LUMBAR SPINE; HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION; CORTICAL ACTIVATION; POSTURAL RESPONSES; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION	This systematic review analyzed available literature on functional brain alterations in low back pain (LBP) measured with electroencephalography (EEG), as until now evidence thereof was unclear. Four electronic databases were systematically searched the 10th of March 2018, resulting in 12 included studies. Studies showed a risk of bias of 37.5 to 75% using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for case-control studies. Limited evidence reported higher amplitudes of balance-related potentials and early components of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) to noxious stimuli, and altered feedback-related negativity and P300 potentials during decision-making in chronic LBP (CLBP). These findings suggest postural strategies requiring a higher cortical attention-demand, increased sensory-discriminative processing of noxious input, and altered decision-making in CLBP. However, further research is warranted as these inferences were based on single studies. Moderate evidence for unaltered amplitude of late-phase SEPs to noxious stimuli and auditory evoked potentials in LBP implies that the affective-emotional processing of stimuli might be unaffected in LBP. Furthermore, moderate evidence indicated disturbed habituation of somatosensory stimuli in LBP. Most studies examined nonspecific or mixed CLBP populations, hence EEG-quantified brain activity in (sub)acute or recurrent LBP still needs to be explored. Perspective: This review presents an overview of the current understanding of the functional LBP brain measured with EEG. The limited evidence in current research suggests altered cortical function regarding balance control, somatosensory processing, and decision making in LBP, and highlights opportunities for future EEG-research.

Face-sensitive brain responses in the first year of life	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Event-related potentials; Face processing; Attention; Infancy	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VISUAL RECOGNITION MEMORY; 6-MONTH-OLD INFANTS; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; INVERTED FACES; ERP EVIDENCE; ATTENTION; PERCEPTION; SPECIALIZATION	Cortical areas in the ventral visual pathway become selectively tuned towards the processing of faces compared to non-face stimuli beginning around 3 months of age and continuing over the first year. Studies using event-related potentials in the EEG (ERPs) have found an ERP component, the N290, that displays specificity for human faces. Other components, such as the P1, P400, and Nc have been studied to a lesser degree in their responsiveness to human faces. However, little is known about the systematic changes in the neural responses to faces during the first year of life, and the localization of these responses in infants' brain. We examined ERP responses to pictures of faces and objects in infants from 4.5 months through 12 months in a cross-sectional study. We investigated the activity of all the components reported to be involved in infant face processing, with particular interest to their amplitude variation and cortical localization. We identified neural regions responsible for the component through the application of cortical source localization methods. We found larger P1 and N290 responses to faces than objects, and these components were localized in the lingual and middle/posterior fusiform gyri, respectively. The amplitude of the P400 was not differentially sensitive to faces over objects. The Nc component was different for faces and objects, was influenced by the infant's attentional state, and localized in medial-anterior brain areas. The implications of these results are discussed in the identification of developmental ERP precursors to face processing.

This lack of accuracy is a severe limitation to the application of ERs to clinical diagnostics. New method: We here introduce a theory of stochastic neuronal spike timing probability densities for describing the large-scale spiking activity in neural assemblies, and a spike density component analysis (SCA) method for isolating specific neural sources. The method is tested in three empirical studies with 564 cases of ERs to auditory stimuli from 94 humans, each measured with 60 EEG electrodes and 306 MEG sensors, and a simulation study with 12,300 ERs. Results: The first study showed that neural sources (but not non-encephalic artifacts) in individual averaged MEG/EEG waveforms are modelled accurately with temporal Gaussian probability density functions (median 99.7 %-99.9 % variance explained). The following studies confirmed that SCA can isolate an ER, namely the mismatch negativity (MMN), and that SCA reveals inter-individual variation in MMN amplitude. Finally, SCA reduced errors by suppressing interfering sources in simulated cases. Comparison with existing methods: We found that gamma and sine functions fail to adequately describe individual MEG/EEG waveforms. Also, we observed that principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) does not consistently suppress interference from overlapping brain activity in neither empirical nor simulated cases. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the overlapping neural sources in single-subject or patient data can be more accurately separated by applying SCA in comparison to PCA and ICA.

J	Ma, Z; Xie, ZX; Qiu, TS; Cheng, J				Ma, Zheng; Xie, Zexin; Qiu, Tianshuang; Cheng, Jun			Driving event-related potential-based speller by localized posterior activities: An offline study	MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						mobile/wearable brain computer interface; sensor selection; localized activity; event related potential; P300	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; BCI; COMMUNICATION; SELECTION; EEG	Multi-sensor recordings are normally used in event-related potential (ERP)-based brain computer interfaces (BCIs), for capturing brain activities widely distributed over the cortical surface. However, this may lead to an increased number of sensors for boosting classification performance, as well as a complicated computational effort for optimizing/reducing sensors, limiting the popularization of mobile/wearable BCIs for the end use. The localization of brain activities may help fix this issue by making useful information concentrated on relatively local brain areas, thus greatly reducing the number of sensors required and computational burden arising from the sensor selection. In the present study, we examined localization of brain activities for an ERP speller, by using novel visual graphic stimuli to induce specific brain responses. Participants were instructed to perform a spelling task under both the graphic stimuli-based and traditional character-flashing-based ERP speller paradigms. Experimental results showed that, compared to character-flashing stimuli, localized brain activities, concentrated over the posterior region, were observed for the graphic stimuli. Classification accuracies and information transfer rates were further evaluated and compared among full- (FS), normal- (NS), and localized- (LS) sensor settings. Effects of PARADIGM, SENSORSETTING, and TRIAL LENGTH were examined by a three-way repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA). ANOVA results showed that, the graphic paradigm achieved significantly better performance under LS than those achieved by the traditional paradigm at any of the three sensor settings, indicating that with visual graphic stimuli, localized posterior activities were enough to drive an ERP-based speller to achieve comparable or even better performance, compared to the traditional paradigm using global activities.

Substance use and mothers' neural responses to infant cues	INFANT MENTAL HEALTH JOURNAL			English	Article						EEG; ERP; infant cues; mothers; substance use	PRENATAL STRESS; PARENTAL STATUS; CRY PERCEPTION; USE DISORDERS; COCAINE USE; DRUG-ABUSE; ATTACHMENT; CHILDREN; FACES; ADDICTION	Substance use may influence mothers' responsiveness to their infants and negatively impact the parent-infant relationship. Maternal substance use may co-opt neural circuitry involved in caregiving, thus reducing the salience of infant cues and diminishing the sense of reward experienced by caring for infants. Gaps in understanding exist with regard to the mechanisms by which substance use operates to influence mothers' processing of infant cues and how this translates to caregiving. Therefore, we examined how substance use might relate to maternal neural responses to infant cues using event-related potentials (ERPs). Substance-using (n = 29) and nonsubstance-using (n = 29) mothers viewed photographs of infant faces and heard recordings of infant vocalizations while electroencephalography was recorded simultaneously. Three specific ERP components were used to examine initial processing of infant faces (N170) and cries (N100), and attentional allocation to infant faces and cries (P300). Substance-using mothers did not discriminate facial affect at early encoding stages (N170), were generally slower to orient to infant cries (N100), showed heightened responses to neutral faces (P300), and failed to adaptively differentiate between high-distress versus low-distress cries (P300). These differences may be important to caregiving behaviors associated with the formation of mother-child attachment. Implications are discussed, as are limitations and future directions.

The LSC speller's circular layout allows us to combine P300 detection with the detection of eye movements to improve symbol detection reliability. We separately classify the vertical and horizontal components of Electrooculography signals from shifts in user gaze during intertrial intervals, determining the quadrant of the character the participant will focus on in the next trial. A P300 EEG-based classification decision can then be corrected using quadrant information, selecting the character with the highest probability on that quadrant. This paper focuses on the implementation of the EOG quadrant detector. Preliminary results show good lateral identification but a lower selection accuracy. Empirically, it was possible to conclude that a relatively high percentage of P300 classification errors were corrected using lateral information alone, significantly increasing LSC character selection accuracy.

J	Xu, GZ; Wu, YW; Li, MF				Xu, Guizhi; Wu, Yuwei; Li, Mengfan			The Study of Influence of Sound on Visual ERP-Based Brain Computer Interface	SENSORS			English	Article						brain-computer interfaces (BCI); event-related potential (ERP); visual stimulus; auditory task; mental workload	DESIGN; P300; EEG	The performance of the event-related potential (ERP)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) declines when applying it into the real environment, which limits the generality of the BCI. The sound is a common noise in daily life, and whether it has influence on this decline is unknown. This study designs a visual-auditory BCI task that requires the subject to focus on the visual interface to output commands and simultaneously count number according to an auditory story. The story is played at three speeds to cause different workloads. Data collected under the same or different workloads are used to train and test classifiers. The results show that when the speed of playing the story increases, the amplitudes of P300 and N200 potentials decrease by 0.86 mu V (p = 0.0239) and 0.69 mu V (p = 0.0158) in occipital-parietal area, leading to a 5.95% decline (p = 0.0101) of accuracy and 9.53 bits/min decline (p = 0.0416) of information transfer rate. The classifier that is trained by the high workload data achieves higher accuracy than the one trained by the low workload if using the high workload data to test the performance. The result indicates that the sound could affect the visual ERP-BCI by increasing the workload. The large similarity of the training data and testing data is as important as the amplitudes of the ERP on obtaining high performance, which gives us an insight on how make to the ERP-BCI generalized.

The relationship between exercise intensity and neurophysiological responses to food stimuli in women: A randomized crossover event-related potential (ERP) study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Exercise intensity; Event-related potential (ERP); P3; Late positive potential (LPP); Early posterior negativity (EPN); Appetite	DUTCH EATING BEHAVIOR; ENERGY-INTAKE; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; NORMAL-WEIGHT; INHIBITORY CONTROL; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; NEURONAL RESPONSE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; AEROBIC EXERCISE; NEURAL RESPONSES	We tested the effect of different intensities of acute exercise on hunger, and post-exercise energy intake, and neurophysiological measures of attention towards foodand non-food stimuli in women. In a within-subjects crossover design, forty-two women completed no exercise, moderate-intensity exercise, and vigorous-intensity exercise sessions separated by one week, in a counterbalanced fashion. At each session, participants completed a passive viewing task of food (highand low-calorie) and non-food pictures while electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded. The early posterior negativity (EPN), P3, and late positive potential (LPP) components of the event-related potential (ERP) measured neurophysiological responses. Subjective ratings of hunger were measured before and immediately after each condition using a visual analog scale (VAS) and food intake was measured using an ad libitum snack buffet offered at the end of each condition. Results indicated that hunger levels increased as time passed for all sessions. EPN amplitude was larger to non-food compared to food images; P3 amplitude was larger to food than non-food stimuli. LPP amplitude did not differ by high-calorie, low calorie, or non-food images. Notably, there were no significant main effects or interactions of any ERP component amplitude as a function of exercise intensity. Food intake also did not differ by rest or moderate or vigorous exercise, although subjective arousal ratings to the images were higher after moderate and vigorous exercise compared to rest. Food images also had higher arousal and valence ratings than non-food images overall. Findings indicate that, in this sample, acute moderate and vigorous exercise compared to rest did not disproportionately affect neurophysiological measures of attention to food or non-food stimuli, caloric intake, or hunger.

Direct recordings of electrical activity in the brain provide important information about the complex dynamics of the cognitive processes and mental states that occur during learning, which can ultimately empower learners. In this article, electroencephalographic (EEG) methodologies, including the time-frequency and event-related potential techniques, are introduced, and the application of these techniques to studies of digital learning studies is discussed. Considerations of how to collect high quality data in both laboratory and real world settings are also presented, along with potential research directions. Finally, a general guideline for publishing results is offered. These issues are critical for producing useful applications of EEG studies to the digital learning research community.

Our objective was to investigate the neurophysiological correlates of sensory processing deficits and the electrophysiological characteristics of early information processing in adult ADHD, measured by the P1 event-related potential (ERP). Methods We obtained ERPs during a Go/NoGo task from 26 adult patients with ADHD and 25 matched controls using a high-density 128-channel BioSemi ActiveTwo recording system. Results ADHD patients had a significantly reduced P1 component at occipital and inferotemporal scalp areas compared to controls. The reduction was associated with inattention and hyperactivity symptom severity, as measured by the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale. ADHD patients with higher inattention scores had significantly smaller P1 amplitudes at posterior scalp sites, while higher hyperactivity scores were associated with higher P1 amplitudes. Conclusions Deficits in early sensory processing, as measured by the P1 ERP component, are present in adult ADHD patients and are associated with symptom severity. These findings are suggestive of bottom-up cognitive deficits in ADHD driven by impairments in early visual processing, and provide evidence that sensory processing problems are present at the neurophysiological level in this population.

J	Zani, A				Zani, Alberto			From Correlational Signs to Markers. Current Trends in Neuroelectric Research on Visual Attentional Processing	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Editorial Material						EEG; ERPs; brain visual attentional processing; neural markers; intracerebral single and distributed electric source localization analyses; hemodynamic imaging; psychological sciences; cognitive neurosciences	BRAIN; TOMOGRAPHY; EEG/MEG; ERP	Traditionally, electroencephalographic (EEG) and event-related brain potentials (ERPs) research on visual attentional processing attempted to account for mental processes in conceptual terms without reference to the way in which they were physically realized by the anatomical structures and physiological processes of the human brain. The brain science level of analysis, in contrast, attempted to explain the brain as an information processing system and to explain mental events in terms of brain processes. Somehow overcoming the separation between the two abovementioned levels of analysis, the cognitive neuroscience level considered how information was represented and processed in the brain. Neurofunctional processing takes place in a fraction of a second. Hence, the very high time resolution and the reliable sensitivity of EEG and ERPs in detecting fast functional changes in brain activity provided advantages over hemodynamic imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), as well as over behavioral measures. However, volume conduction and lack of three-dimensionality limited applications of EEG and ERPs per se more than hemodynamic techniques for revealing locations in which brain processing occurs. These limits could only be overcome by subtraction methods for isolating attentional effects that might endure over time in EEG and may be riding even over several different ERP components, and by intracerebral single and distributed electric source analyses as well as the combining of these signals with high-spatial resolution hemodynamic signals (fMRI), both in healthy individuals and clinical patients. In my view, the articles of the Special Issue concerned with "ERP and EEG Markers of Brain Visual Attentional Processing" of the present journal Brain Sciences provide very good examples of all these levels of analysis.

This work is part of a larger EEG based project and is based on the P300 speller BCI (oddball) paradigm and the x DAWN algorithm, with eight healthy subjects; while using a non-invasive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) based on low fidelity electroencephalographic (EEG) equipment. Herein, eight channels through the initial task (6 minutes), additional tasks (50 minutes) and final task (6 minutes) states, recorded the subjects' signal. Our results show that the accuracy was best for the initial task (IT) at 100%, followed closely by the final task (FT) at 98%. In addition, our ANOVA analysis showed that the amplitude exhibited a statistical significance between IT and FT, while the latency did not indicate any statistical difference. This paper provides initial results into the practicability of the aforementioned P300 speller methodology and low-cost equipment to be used repetitively and continually and the effect thereof on accuracy and signal characteristics. Our aim is to assess the effect of prolonged usage and exposure to the aforementioned methodology and equipment, with the aim of broadening its use in a real-world context.

Our perceptual systems have to resolve this ambiguity to construct stable and reliable percepts. Previous EEG studies found large amplitude differences in two event-related potential (ERP) components 200 and 400 ms after stimulus onset when comparing ambiguous with disambiguated visual information ("ERP Ambiguity Effects"). These effects so far generalized across classical ambiguous figures from different visual categories at lower (geometry, motion) and intermediate (Gestalt perception) levels. The present study aimed to examine whether these ERP Effects are restricted to ambiguous figures or whether they also occur for different degrees of visibility. Smiley faces with low and high visibility of emotional expressions, as well as abstract figures with low and high visibility of a target curvature were presented. We thus compared ambiguity effects in geometric cube stimuli with visibility in emotional faces, and with visibility in abstract figures. ERP Effects were replicated for the geometric stimuli and very similar ERP Effects were found for stimuli with emotional face expressions but also for abstract figures. Conclusively, the ERP amplitude effects generalize across fundamentally different stimulus categories and show highly similar effects for different degrees of stimulus ambiguity and stimulus visibility. We postulate the existence of a high-level/meta-perceptual evaluation instance, beyond sensory details, that estimates the certainty of a perceptual decision. The ERP Effects may reflect differences in evaluation results.

This study was an investigation of the neural correlates of emotional reactivity and reappraisal in typically developing school-age children elicited by threatening facial expressions of same-aged peers. This experimental paradigm is novel in eliciting event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to social stimuli that are ecologically valid to the everyday life of children. ERPs of 5- to 8-year-old children (N = 41, 18 females) were elicited by threatening (i.e., angry and fearful) and neutral child facial expressions, which were preceded by audio contextual cues. Three conditions differed in audio-image pairing: neutral context-neutral expression (neutral condition), negative context-threatening expression (threat condition), and reappraisal context-threatening expression (reappraisal condition). In addition, parental reporting of childhood temperament was collected to determine if elicited ERP morphologies were associated with temperamental dimensions of negative affect, extraversion, and effortful control. Elicitation of the P100 and N170 did not largely differ between conditions; however, amplitude of the late positive potential (LPP), a marker of heightened emotional reactivity and attention, was greater for threatening faces relative to neutral faces. During the reappraisal condition, no differences in ERP activity was observed compared to the threat condition. Neural substrates of emotional reactivity to social threat from peers were evident; however, the lack of ERP modulation facilitating reappraisal and the lack of strong associations between ERP morphology and temperamental dimensions is indicative of heterogeneity in LPP elicitation underlying emotion regulation in children.

Then conduct a search experiment to verify. Experimental results showed that the reaction times were longer and the accuracy rates were lower for positive icons than for negative icons. In contrast with semantic mismatched conditions, the accuracy rates were higher but the reaction times were short when the semantic matched. The N100 and P200 components were induced under the four experimental conditions, and the positive matching amplitude was significantly lower than the other three conditions. This study indicates that the icon concreteness significant affects the icon comprehension.

However, direct comparisons between conventional two-dimensional (2D) and VR stimulations are lacking. Thus, the present study compared electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of explicit task and implicit emotional attention between 2D and VR stimulation. Participants (n= 16) viewed angry and neutral faces with equal size and distance in both 2D and VR, while they were asked to count one of the two facial expressions. For the main effects of emotion (angry vs. neutral) and task (target vs. nontarget), established event related potentials (ERP), namely the late positive potential (LPP) and the target P300, were replicated. VR stimulation compared to 2D led to overall bigger ERPs but did not interact with emotion or task effects. In the frequency domain, alpha/beta-activity was larger in VR compared to 2D stimulation already in the baseline period. Of note, while alpha/beta event related desynchronization (ERD) for emotion and task conditions were seen in both VR and 2D stimulation, these effects were significantly stronger in VR than in 2D. These results suggest that enhanced immersion with the stimulus materials enabled by VR technology can potentiate induced brain oscillation effects to implicit emotion and explicit task effects.

Montell			Concurrent affective and linguistic prosody with the same emotional valence elicits a late positive ERP response	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography; emotion; event-related potential; language; prosody	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; INVOLUNTARY ATTENTION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; MEMORY TRACES; HEARING-LOSS; CORE AFFECT; LANGUAGE; RECOGNITION; PERCEPTION; SEMANTICS	Change in linguistic prosody generates a mismatch negativity response (MMN), indicating neural representation of linguistic prosody, while change in affective prosody generates a positive response (P3a), reflecting its motivational salience. However, the neural response to concurrent affective and linguistic prosody is unknown. The present paper investigates the integration of these two prosodic features in the brain by examining the neural response to separate and concurrent processing by electroencephalography (EEG). A spoken pair of Swedish words-['fa:s epsilon n] phase and ['fa:s epsilon n] damn-that differed in emotional semantics due to linguistic prosody was presented to 16 subjects in an angry and neutral affective prosody using a passive auditory oddball paradigm. Acoustically matched pseudowords['va:s epsilon m] and ['va:s epsilon m]-were used as controls. Following the constructionist concept of emotions, accentuating the conceptualization of emotions based on language, it was hypothesized that concurrent affective and linguistic prosody with the same valence-angry ['fa:s epsilon n] damn-would elicit a unique late EEG signature, reflecting the temporal integration of affective voice with emotional semantics of prosodic origin. In accordance, linguistic prosody elicited an MMN at 300-350 ms, and affective prosody evoked a P3a at 350-400 ms, irrespective of semantics. Beyond these responses, concurrent affective and linguistic prosody evoked a late positive component (LPC) at 820-870 ms in frontal areas, indicating the conceptualization of affective prosody based on linguistic prosody. This study provides evidence that the brain does not only distinguish between these two functions of prosody but also integrates them based on language and experience.

A Behavioral and Electroencephalography Study	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						gender stereotype; advertising effect; memory recognition; event-related potentials; parietal old/new effect	MATCH-UP HYPOTHESIS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; DIVIDED ATTENTION; PRODUCT TYPE; RECOLLECTION; INFORMATION; RETRIEVAL; IMPACT; ERP	Previous studies have shown equivocal results about whether atypical or unusual events, compared with typical ones, facilitate or inhibit memory. We suspect that the indefinite findings could be partly due to the recall task used in these studies, as the participants might have used inference instead of recall in their responses. In the present study, we tested the recognition memory for real (Experiment 1) and fabricated (Experiment 2) advertisements, which could be congruent or incongruent with gender stereotypes. In congruent advertisements, a female endorser presented a traditionally considered feminine product or a male endorser presented a traditionally considered masculine product, whereas the gender-product type matching reversed in incongruent advertisements. The results of both behavioral experiments revealed that the participants' memory performance for stereotype-incongruent advertisements was higher than for congruent ones. In the event-related potential (ERP) recordings in Experiment 3, larger positive amplitudes were found for stereotype-incongruent advertisements than for congruent advertisements on the left parietal sites, suggesting a deeper encoding process for stereotype-incongruent information than for stereotype-congruent information.

Automatic detection of error-related potentials (ErrPs) in electroencephalograph (EEG) could improve BCI performance by allowing to correct the erroneous action made by the machine. However, the current low accuracy in detecting ErrPs, particularly in some users, can reduce its potential benefits. The paper addresses this problem by proposing a novel relative peak feature (RPF) selection method to improve performance and accuracy for recognising an ErrP in the EEG. Using data collected from 29 participants with a mean age of 24.14 years the relative peak features yielded an average across all classifiers of 81.63% accuracy in detecting the erroneous events and an average 78.87 % accuracy in detecting the correct events, using KNN, SVM and LDA classifiers. In comparison to the temporal feature selection, there was a gain in performance in all classifiers of 17.85% for error accuracy and a reduction of -6.16% for correct accuracy Specifically; our proposed RPF used significantly reduced the number of features by 91.7% when compared with the state of the art temporal features. In the future, this work will improve the human-robot interaction by improving the accuracy of detecting errors that enable the BCI to correct any mistakes.

Electrophysiological correlates of emotional scene processing in bipolar disorder	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Bipolar disorders; Psychosis; Emotional processing; Electroencephalography	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PSYCHOTIC FEATURES; SCHIZOPHRENIA NETWORK; RESPONSES; ABNORMALITIES; PHENOTYPES; PICTURES; SPECTRUM; DEFICITS; AROUSAL	Emotional dysfunction is a core feature of bipolar I disorder (BD). Behavioral data suggest that emotional processing may differ based on history of psychosis, but physiological studies frequently disregard this differentiating feature. Face processing studies indicate that emotion-related components of event-related potentials (ERPs) are abnormal in BD, but fMRI data using emotional scenes are mixed. The current study used ERPs to examine emotional scene perception in BD with and without a history of psychosis (BDP, BDNP). 386 participants from the PARDIP consortium (HC = 181, BDP = 130, BDNP = 75) viewed neutral, pleasant, and unpleasant scenes from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) during continuous EEG recording. The early posterior negativity (EPN) and late positive potential (LPP) were examined for group and stimulus effects. Analyses were conducted for groups on and off medications to examine associations between medication status, psychosis, and ERP response. Group differences were found between HC and BD in emotional modulation of the EPN and between HC and BDP in the LPP to pleasant images. There was a significant interaction between psychosis history and anticonvulsant status in the EPN, but no other medication associations were found. The relationship between neural/self-reported emotional responses and clinical symptoms were examined with canonical correlations, but no significant associations were found. Results from this large well characterized sample indicate mild deviations in neural reactivity related to medication, mood, and psychosis history. However, processing of emotional scenes appears mostly intact in individuals with BD regardless of symptom severity.

FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						event-related potentials; event-related synchronization; fluid intelligence; academic achievement; machine learning	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; GENERAL INTELLIGENCE; SHORT-TERM; P300; LOAD; CLASSIFICATION; CONNECTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; ATTENTION	Background Educational psychology research has linked fluid intelligence (Gf) with working memory (WM), but it is still dubious whether electroencephalography (EEG) markers robustly indicate Gf. This study addresses this issue and notes the relationship between WM task-related EEG markers with Gf and academic performance. Method A sample of 62 healthy children between the ages of 9 and 12 years was selected to perform three tasks: (1) Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM) test to assess Gf; (2) 2-back task to assess central executive system (CES); and (3) delayed match-to-sample task to assess short-term storage. These subjects were divided into high ability (HA) and low ability (LA) groups based on their RSPM scores. Support vector machine and logistic regression were used to train the EEG candidate indicators. A multiple regression was used to predict children's academic performance using P3 amplitude, P2 latency, and theta-ERS. Results Behavioral results demonstrated that the correct rate of the HA group is higher than that of the LA group. The event-related potential results of the 2-back task showed that the P3 amplitude of the HA group was relatively larger and that the P2 latency was shorter than that observed in the LA group. For the delayed matching to sample task, the theta-ERS of the LA group was higher than that of the HA group. However, the area under the curve of these three indicators for Gf was < 0.75 for each and < 0.85 for the combined indicators. In predicting academic performance, only P3 amplitude showed a significant effect. Conclusion These results challenge previous findings, which reported that P3, P2, or theta power might be used in standard psychometric tests to assess an individual's intelligence.

The Cross-Modal Suppressive Role of Visual Context on Speech Intelligibility: An ERP Study	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						audiovisual integration; word identification; speech intelligibility; cross-modal suppression; auditory evoked potentials	ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; AUDITORY-CORTEX; RECOGNITION; POTENTIALS	The efficacy of audiovisual (AV) integration is reflected in the degree of cross-modal suppression of the auditory event-related potentials (ERPs, P1-N1-P2), while stronger semantic encoding is reflected in enhanced late ERP negativities (e.g., N450). We hypothesized that increasing visual stimulus reliability should lead to more robust AV-integration and enhanced semantic prediction, reflected in suppression of auditory ERPs and enhanced N450, respectively. EEG was acquired while individuals watched and listened to clear and blurred videos of a speaker uttering intact or highly-intelligible degraded (vocoded) words and made binary judgments about word meaning (animate or inanimate). We found that intact speech evoked larger negativity between 280-527-ms than vocoded speech, suggestive of more robust semantic prediction for the intact signal. For visual reliability, we found that greater cross-modal ERP suppression occurred for clear than blurred videos prior to sound onset and for the P2 ERP. Additionally, the later semantic-related negativity tended to be larger for clear than blurred videos. These results suggest that the cross-modal effect is largely confined to suppression of early auditory networks with weak effect on networks associated with semantic prediction. However, the semantic-related visual effect on the late negativity may have been tempered by the vocoded signal's high-reliability.

J	Fallon, N; Giesbrecht, T; Thomas, A; Stancak, A				Fallon, Nicholas; Giesbrecht, Timo; Thomas, Anna; Stancak, Andrej			A Behavioral and Electrophysiological Investigation of Effects of Visual Congruence on Olfactory Sensitivity During Habituation to Prolonged Odors	CHEMICAL SENSES			English	Article						cross-modal; desensitization; EEG; multisensory integration; olfaction	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ATTENTIONAL MODULATION; EEG; DISCRIMINATION; RESOLUTION; COMPONENT	Congruent visual cues augment sensitivity to brief olfactory presentations and habituation of odor perception is modulated by central-cognitive processing including context. However, it is not known whether habituation to odors could interact with cross-modal congruent stimuli. The present research investigated the effect of visual congruence on odor detection sensitivity during continuous odor exposures. We utilized a multimethod approach, including subjective behavioral responses and reaction times (RTs; study 1) and electroencephalography (EEG, study 2). Study 1: 25 participants received 2-min presentations of moderate-intensity floral odor delivered via olfactometer with congruent (flower) and incongruent (object) image presentations. Participants indicated odor perception after each image. Detection sensitivity and RTs were analyzed in epochs covering the period of habituation. Study 2: 25 new participants underwent EEG recordings during 145-s blocks of odor presentations with congruent or incongruent images. Participants passively observed images and intermittently rated the perceived intensity of odor. Event-related potential analysis was utilized to evaluate brain processing related to odor-visual pairs across the period of habituation. Odor detection sensitivity and RTs were improved by congruent visual cues. Results highlighted a diminishing influence of visual congruence on odor detection sensitivity as habituation occurred. Event-related potential analysis revealed an effect of congruency on electrophysiological processing in the N400 component. This was only evident in early periods of odor exposure when perception was strong. For the first time, this demonstrates the modulation of central processing of odor-visual pairs by habituation. Frontal negativity (N400) responses encode the aspects of cross-modal congruence for odor-vision cross-modal tasks.

J	Steinmetzger, K; Shen, ZZ; Riedel, H; Rupp, A				Steinmetzger, Kurt; Shen, Zhengzheng; Riedel, Helmut; Rupp, Andre			Auditory cortex activity measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) appears to be susceptible to masking by cortical blood stealing	HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article						Speech; Hearing; Negative BOLD responses; Event-related potentials; EEG source reconstructions; Alpha power	NEGATIVE BOLD RESPONSES; EVOKED-RESPONSES; HUMAN BRAIN; SPEECH; PITCH; ORIGIN; MODEL; FMRI; HEMODYNAMICS; PERIODICITY	To validate the use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in auditory perception experiments, combined fNIRS and electroencephalography (EEG) data were obtained from normal-hearing subjects passively listening to speech-like stimuli without linguistic content. The fNIRS oxy-haemoglobin (HbO) results were found to be inconsistent with the deoxy-haemoglobin (HbR) and EEG data, as they were dominated by increasingly more negative responses along a diagonal axis running in posterior-superior to anterior-inferior direction. This large-scale bilateral gradient in the HbO data masked the right-lateralised neural activity in the auditory cortex that was clearly evident in the HbR data and EEG source reconstructions and is most likely due to cerebral blood stealing. When the subjects were subsequently split into subgroups with more positive or more negative HbO responses in the right auditory cortex, the former group surprisingly showed smaller event-related potentials and increased EEG alpha power, indicating reduced attention and vigilance. These findings thus suggest that positive HbO responses in the auditory cortex may not necessarily be a favourable result when investigating auditory perception using fNIRS. More generally, the results show that the interpretation of fNIRS HbO signals can be misleading and demonstrate the benefits of combined fNIRS-EEG analyses. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

J	Schembri, P; Pelc, M; Ma, JX				Schembri, Patrick; Pelc, Maruisz; Ma, Jixin			The Effect That Auditory Distractions Have on a Visual P300 Speller While Utilizing Low-Cost Off-the-Shelf Equipment	COMPUTERS			English	Article						brain-computer interface (BCI); electroencephalography (EEG); event-related potential (ERP); P300 speller (P3); distractions; taxonomy		This paper investigates the effect that selected auditory distractions have on the signal of a visual P300 Speller in terms of accuracy, amplitude, latency, user preference, signal morphology, and overall signal quality. In addition, it ensues the development of a hierarchical taxonomy aimed at categorizing distractions in the P300b domain and the effect thereof. This work is part of a larger electroencephalography based project and is based on the P300 speller brain-computer interface (oddball) paradigm and the xDAWN algorithm, with eight to ten healthy subjects, using a non-invasive brain-computer interface based on low-fidelity electroencephalographic (EEG) equipment. Our results suggest that the accuracy was best for the lab condition (LC) at 100%, followed by music at 90% (M90) at 98%, trailed by music at 30% (M30) and music at 60% (M60) equally at 96%, and shadowed by ambient noise (AN) at 92.5%, passive talking (PT) at 90%, and finally by active listening (AL) at 87.5%. The subjects' preference prodigiously shows that the preferred condition wasLCas originally expected, followed byM90,M60,AN,M30,AL, andPT. Statistical analysis between all independent variables shows that we accept our null hypothesis for both the amplitude and latency. This work includes data and comparisons from our previous papers. These additional results should give some insight into the practicability of the aforementioned P300 speller methodology and equipment to be used for real-world applications.

However, research has been inconclusive as to whether this is also the case for cybersex addiction. This study aimed to investigate the time course of BIC in male individuals with tendencies towards cybersex addiction (TCA) using event-related potentials (ERPs) and to provide neurophysiological evidence of their deficient BIC. Methods: Thirty-six individuals with TCA and 36 healthy controls (HCs) were given a Two-Choice Oddball task that required them to respond differently to frequent standard stimuli (images of people) and infrequent deviant stimuli (pornographic images) within 1,000 ms. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded as the participants performed the task. Results: Despite the similarity of standard stimuli between the groups in terms of reaction times (RTs), the RTs of the TCA group to deviant stimuli were much slower than those of the HC group. The behavioral difference was accompanied by group differences in the averaged amplitudes of N2 (200-300 ms) and P3 (300-500 ms) components in the deviant-standard difference wave. More specifically, compared to the HC group, the TCA group demonstrated smaller N2 and P3 amplitude differences for deviant than standard stimuli. Discussion and conclusions: Individuals with TCA were more impulsive than HC participants and shared neuropsychological and ERP characteristics of substance use disorder or behavioral addictions, which supports the view that cybersex addiction can be conceptualized as a behavioral addiction.

We hypothesized that the neural generators progressively recruited after a cue stimulus imply executive-related areas well before engagement in executive processing in children with ADHD compared to typically developed children (TDC). We computed source localization (swLORETA) of the ERP and ERSP evoked by the Cue stimulus during a visual Cue-Go/Nogo paradigm in 15 ADHD compared to 16 TDC. A significant difference in N200/P200 amplitude over the right centro-frontal regions was observed between ADHD and TDC, supported by a stronger contribution of the left visuo-motor coordination area, premotor cortex, and prefrontal cortex in ADHD. In addition, we recorded a greater beta power spectrum in ADHD during the 80-230 ms interval, which was explained by increased activity in occipito-parieto-central areas and lower activity in the left supramarginal gyrus and prefrontal areas in ADHD. Successive analysis of the ERP generators (0-500 ms with successive periods of 50 ms) revealed significant differences beginning at 50 ms, with higher activity in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, premotor cortex, and fusiform gyrus, and ending at 400-500 ms with higher activity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and lower activity of the posterior cingulate cortex in ADHD compared to TDC. The areas contributing to ERP in ADHD and TDC differ from the early steps of visuo-attentional processing and reveal an overinvestment of the executive networks interfering with the activity of the dorsal attention network in children with ADHD.

However, few studies have examined the brain correlates of self-referential processing in long-term meditators. Here, we used the self-referential encoding task (SRET) to examine event-related potentials (ERP) during assessment of pleasant and unpleasant self-views in long-term meditators versus age-matched meditation-naive control participants. Compared with controls, meditators endorsed significantly more pleasant and fewer unpleasant words as self-referential. We also found a between-group difference in the early component of the late-positive-potential (LPP) of the ERP characterized by a larger response to unpleasant versus pleasant words in controls and no difference in meditators. A cross-sectional design, such as the one used in the present study, has certain caveats like self-selectivity bias. If such caveats did not affect our results, these findings suggest that a long-term contemplative lifestyle, of which meditation training is an integral part, alters self-referential processing towards a more adaptive view of self and neural equivalence towards pleasant and unpleasant self-views. These findings suggest that long-term meditation training may affect brain and behavioural mechanism that support a more flexible and healthy relationship to one's self.

The study included 23 unmedicated ADHD patients and 23 healthy controls. The EEG signal was analyzed in time domain by nonlinear brain dynamics and morphological features, and in time-frequency domain with wavelet coefficients. Selected features were applied to various machine learning techniques including; Multilayer Perceptron, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, k-nearest neighbor, Adaptive Boosting, Logistic Regression and Random Forest to classify ADHD patients and healthy controls. Longer P300 latencies and smaller P300 amplitudes were observed in ADHD patients relative to controls. In fractal dimension calculation relative to the control group, the ADHD group demonstrated reduced complexity. In addition, certain wavelet coefficients provided significantly different values in both groups. Combining these extracted features, our results indicated that Multilayer Perceptron method provided the best classification with an accuracy rate of 91.3% and a high level of reliability of concurrence (Kappa = 0.82). The results showed that combining time and frequency domain features can be a useful and discriminative for diagnostic purposes in ADHD. The study presents a supporting diagnostic tool that uses EEG signal processing and machine learning algorithms. The findings would be helpful in the objective diagnosis of ADHD.

Measuring word recognition in reading: eye movements and event-related potentials.Trends in Cognitive Sciences,7(11), 489-493) illustrated how "by means of review and comparison" eye movement (EM) and event-related potential (ERP) studies may advance our understanding of visual word recognition. Attempts to simultaneously record EMs and ERPs soon followed. Recently, this co-registration approach has also been transferred to fMRI and oscillatory EEG. With experimental settings close to natural reading, co-registration enables us to directly integrate insights from EM and neuroimaging studies. This should extend current experimental paradigms by moving the field towards studying sentence-level processing including effects of context and parafoveal preview. This article will introduce the basic principles and applications of co-registration and selectively review how this approach may shed light on one of the most controversially discussed issues in reading research, contextual predictions in online language processing.

J	Wright, D; Dering, B; Martinovic, J; Gheorghiu, E				Wright, Damien; Dering, Benjamin; Martinovic, Jasna; Gheorghiu, Elena			Neural responses to dynamic adaptation reveal the dissociation between the processing of the shape of contours and textures	CORTEX			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Adaptation; Contours; Textures; Context; Surround; Suppression	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE; SURROUND SUPPRESSION; CONTRAST-POLARITY; VISUAL-CORTEX; INTEGRATION; ORIENTATION; SELECTIVITY; CURVATURE; FREQUENCY	Shape-adaptation studies show that surround textures can inhibit the processing of contours. Using event-related potentials (ERP), we examined the time-course of neural processes involved in contour-shape and texture-shape processing following adaptation to contours and textures. Contours were made of Gabor strings whose orientations were either tangential or orthogonal to the contour path, while textures were made of a series of contours arranged in parallel. We focused on two ERP components -P1, related to low-level visual processes and N1, broadly indicative of mid-level vision- and, on ERP difference waves (no-adaptor minus with-adaptor) to isolate the effects of adaptation, which are fundamentally distinct from individual processes driving P1 and N1 components. We found that in the absence of adaptation, the N1 component for contour-tests peaked later and increased in amplitude compared to the N1 for texture-tests. Following adaptation, the ERP difference wave for contour-tests revealed an early and a late component that were differentially affected by the presence of surround texture, but critically not by its orientation. For texture-tests, the early component was of opposite polarity for contours compared to texture adaptors. From the temporal sequence of ERP modulations, we conclude that texture processing begins before contour processing and encompasses the stages of perceptual processing reflected in both the low-level P1 and the mid-level N1 vision-related components. Our study provides novel evidence on the nature of separable and temporally distinct texture and contour processing mechanisms, shown in two difference wave components, that highlights the multi-faceted nature of dynamic adaptation to shape when presented in isolation and in context.

An ERP study using an emotional Go/NoGo task	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Maternal anxiety; EEG; ERP; emotional faces; Go; NoGo task; N170; LPP	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; POSTNATAL DEPRESSION; POSTPARTUM ANXIETY; PARENTAL STATUS; TIME-COURSE; INFANT; BRAIN; RESPONSES; SYMPTOMS; DISORDERS	Maternal anxiety during pregnancy and the early postpartum period is associated with heightened neural processing of neutral infant faces as measured by event-related potentials (ERPs). However, less is known about how anxiety shapes neural face processing in mothers of older children. In our study, 36 mothers of 8-10 year old children completed a Go/NoGo task consisting of neutral and emotional (happy, fearful) facial expressions posed by unfamiliar school-aged children while EEG was recorded. Higher levels of maternal anxiety -indexed via self-report- were associated with delayed behavioral responses to children's fearful faces and increased N170 and LPP amplitudes elicited by children's neutral faces. While anxiety was also positively related to the LPP elicited by children's emotional faces, it only led to increased N170 amplitude responses to children's fearful, but not happy, faces and only when they were NoGo cues. The study replicates and extends prior findings examining the impact of maternal anxiety on neural responses to neutral infant faces to later stages of parenting with further neural markers and emotional expressions being affected. Findings evidence the importance of studying these associations beyond infancy to increase our knowledge about processes potentially underlying the relation between anxiety and less optimal parenting across development.

The effect of empathy and context on face-processing ERPs	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Event-related potentials (ERP); Face processing; Empathy; Context	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; EMOTIONAL FACES; TIME-COURSE; NEURAL RESPONSES; NEUTRAL FACES; PERCEPTION; INFORMATION; MODULATION; INTENSITY	The investigation of emotional face processing has largely used faces devoid of context, and does not account for within-perceiver differences in empathy. The importance of context in face perception has become apparent in recent years. This study examined the interaction of the contextual factors of facial expression, knowledge of a person's character, and within-perceiver empathy levels on face processing event-related potentials (ERPs). Forty-two adult participants learned background information about six individuals' character. Three types of character were described, in which the character was depicted as deliberately causing harm to others, accidently causing harm to others, or undertaking neutral actions. Subsequently, EEG was recorded while participants viewed the characters' faces displaying neutral or emotional expressions. Participants' empathy was assessed using the Empathy Quotient survey. Results showed a significant interaction of character type and empathy on the early posterior negativity (EPN) ERP component. These results suggested that for those with either low or high empathy, more attention was paid to the face stimuli, with more distinction between the different characters. In contrast, those in the middle range of empathy tended to produce smaller EPN with less distinction between character types. Findings highlight the importance of trait empathy in accounting for how faces in context are perceived.

Previous studies of event-related potentials (ERPs) have identified a face-selective ERP component (negative peak at about 170 ms after stimulus onset, N170) in healthy participants. In contrast, patients with schizophrenia exhibit reduced amplitude of the N170, which may represent a pathological deficit in the neurophysiology of face perception. Interestingly, healthy humans with schizophrenia-like experiences (schizotypy) also exhibit abnormal processing of face perception. Yet, it has remained unknown how schizotypy in healthy humans is associated with the neurophysiological substrates of face perception. Here, we recruited 35 healthy participants and assessed their schizotypy by the magical ideation rating scale. We used high-density electroencephalography to obtain ERPs elicited by a set of Mooney faces (face and non-face visual stimuli). We investigated median and mean reaction times and visual ERP components in response to the stimuli. We observed a significant difference in N170 amplitude between the two facestimulus conditions and found that the measured schizotypy scores were significantly correlated with both reaction times and N170 amplitude in response to the face stimuli across all participants. Our results thus support the model of schizotypy as a manifestation of a continuum between healthy individuals and patients with schizophrenia, where the N170 impairment serves as a biomarker for the degree of pathology along this continuum.

Depression is also associated with impaired decision-making, which reflects multiple cognitive, affective, and attentional processes, some of which may be lateralized. The aim of this study was to investigate brain asymmetry during a decision-making task performed in negative and positive feedback conditions in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in comparison to healthy control participants. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 60 MDD patients and 60 healthy participants while performing a multi-stage decision-making task. Frontal, central, and parietal alpha asymmetry were analyzed with EEGlab/ERPlab software. Evoked potential responses (ERPs) showed general lateralization suggestive of an initial right dominance developing into a more complex pattern of asymmetry across different scalp areas as information was processed. The MDD group showed impaired mood prior to performance, and decreased confidence during performance in comparison to the control group. The resting state frontal alpha asymmetry showed lateralization in the healthy group only. Task-induced alpha power and ERP P-100 and P-300 amplitudes were more informative biomarkers of depression during decision making. Asymmetry coefficients based on task alpha power and ERP amplitudes showed consistency in the dynamical changes during the decision-making stages. Depression was characterized by a lack of left dominance during the resting state and left hypoactivity during the task baseline and subsequent decision-making process. Findings add to understanding of the functional significance of lateralized brain processes in depression.

Up until now, the rotational uncertainty effect has been only revealed by behavior measures, and its underlying neural mechanism remains unclear. In this study, using the hand mental rotation paradigm and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, we aimed to find the electrophysiological evidences of the rotational uncertainty from event-related potential (ERP) and event-related (de)synchronization (ERS/ERD) measurements. Compared with the upright hand stimuli in AU condition, the same stimuli in SU condition took longer RT, elicited stronger alpha-ERD and beta-ERD, and evoked larger P100, P300 and the slow wave (SW) from -500 ms to -200 ms before response. In particular, the amplitude of SW difference (i.e., SWSU - SWAU) was negatively correlated with the extent of rotational uncertainty effect (i.e., RTSU - RTAU), with its source mainly in the right precentral and postcentral gyri, precuneus, and the left inferior parietal lobule. Our results suggested that identifying the upright hand stimuli in SU condition induced more activation of motor networks, and the rotational uncertainty influenced multiple cognitive processes from the early visual processing to the late mental rotation and judging phases. The results implied that in SU condition, subjects might maintain readiness for the next possible mental rotation immediately after the previous response, with more attention to the coming visual stimuli. Even for the upright stimuli, they might still prepare for the mental rotation, and even mentally rotate the stimuli in a minor angle. (C) 2020 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods Two groups of participants with low (LPS) or high (HPS) pain sensitivity (LPS group:n= 33; HPS group:n= 31) were recruited based on their scores on pain sensitivity questionnaires. This categorization was later confirmed via pain ratings to electrical stimulations. Implicit negative bias toward pain was assessed using the Implicit Association Test (IAT) involving target (pain and nonpain) and attribute (negative and neutral-affect) concept words. Behavioral and event-related potential responses for congruent and incongruent pairings during the IAT were compared between the LPS and HPS groups. Results Relative to the LPS group, participants in the HPS group exhibited greater D-score (Cohen'sd= 0.364,p= .004). Event-related potential results showed that, although P3 amplitudes to congruent and incongruent pairings differed significantly for the HPS group (Cohen'sd= 0.757,p< .001), this difference was not observed for the LPS group (Cohen'sd= 0.089,p= .29). Mediation analysis further revealed that the IAT effect on P3 responses accounted for 17.58% of the association between pain sensitivity and D-score (confidence interval = [0.009-0.051]). Conclusions Individual variation in pain sensitivity relates to implicit negative bias. This linkage is partially accounted for by the electrophysiological response that has been related to cognitive process of stimulus evaluation and categorization. Pain treatment might benefit from techniques designed to alter implicit bias.

However, the question remains whether the signal quality of dry electrode recordings is comparable to wet electrode recordings in the clinical context. We recorded the resting state EEG (rsEEG), the visual evoked potentials (VEP) and the visual P300 (P3) from 16 healthy subjects (age range: 26-79 years) and 16 neurological patients who reported subjective memory impairment (age range: 50-83 years). Each subject took part in two recordings on different days, one with 19 dry electrodes and another with 19 wet electrodes. They reported their preferred EEG system. Comparisons of the rsEEG recordings were conducted qualitatively by independent visual evaluation by two neurologists blinded to the EEG system used and quantitatively by spectral analysis of the rsEEG. The P100 visual evoked potential (VEP) and P3 event-related potential (ERP) were compared in terms of latency, amplitude and pre-stimulus noise. The majority of subjects preferred the dry electrode headset. Both neurologists reported that all rsEEG traces were comparable between the wet and dry electrode headsets. Absolute Alpha and Beta power during rest did not statistically differ between the two EEG systems (p > 0.05 in all cases). However, Theta and Delta power was slightly higher with the dry electrodes (p = 0.0004 for Theta and p < 0.0001 for Delta). For ERPs, the mean latencies and amplitudes of the P100 VEP and P3 ERP showed comparable values (p > 0.10 in all cases) with a similar spatial distribution for both wet and dry electrode systems. These results suggest that the signal quality, ease of set-up and portability of the dry electrode EEG headset used in our study comply with the needs of clinical applications.

J	McWeeny, S; Norton, ES				McWeeny, Sean; Norton, Elizabeth S.			Understanding event-related potentials (ERPs) in clinical and basic language and communication disorders research: a tutorial	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE & COMMUNICATION DISORDERS			English	Review						event-related potential (ERP); neuroscience; mismatch negativity; N400	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; RISK; CHILDREN; INFANTS; EEG; MATURATION; ERROR; P300	Background Event-related potentials (ERPs), which are electrophysiological neural responses time-locked to a stimulus, have become an increasingly common tool in language and communication disorders research. They can provide complementary evidence to behavioural measures as well as unique perspectives on communication disorders. ERPs have the distinct advantage of providing precise information about the timing of neural processes and can be used in cases where it is difficult to obtain responses from participants, such as infants or individuals who are minimally verbal. However, clinicians and clinician-scientists rarely receive training in how to interpret ERP research. Aims To provide information that allows readers to better understand, interpret and evaluate research using ERPs. We focus on research related to communication sciences and disorders and the information that is most relevant to interpreting research articles. Method We explain what ERPs are and how ERP data are collected, referencing key texts and primary research articles. Potential threats to validity, guidelines for interpreting data, and the pros and cons using of ERPs are discussed. Research in the area of paediatric language disorders is used as a model; common paradigms such as the semantic incongruity N400 and auditory mismatch negativity are used as tangible examples. With this foundation of understanding ERPs, the state of the field in terms of how ERPs are used and the ways they may inform the field are discussed. Main Contribution To date, no review has focused on ERPs as they relate to clinical or communication research. The main contribution of this review is that it provides practical information geared toward understanding ERP research. Conclusions ERPs offer insights into neural processes supporting communication and can both complement behaviour and provide information that behavioural measures cannot. We encourage readers to evaluate articles using ERPs critically, effectively pushing the field forward through increased understanding and rigor. What this paper adds ERPs have become more prevalent in research relevant to communication sciences and disorders. In order for clinicians to review and evaluate this research, an understanding of ERPs is needed. This review adds to the field by providing an accessible description of what ERPs are, a description of what ERP components are, and the most relevant commonly used components, as well as how ERP data are recorded and processed. With this foundational understanding of how ERPs work, guidelines for the interpretation of ERP data are given. Though few ERP studies currently have direct implications for clinical practice, we discuss several ways through which ERPs can impact clinical practice in future, by providing information that cannot be obtained by behaviour alone about the aetiology of disorders, and as potential biomarkers of disorder or treatment response.

Popular ERPs and ERD/ERS functions, as well as EEG-fRMI data and hyperscanning methods requires a proper temporal alignment (namely, synchronization) with stimulus onsets and other devices. Hardware-based synchronization, based on a SYNC signal injected into the device, ensures a reliable timing. In this paper we describe the design, test and validation of an EEG Synchronization Box (ESB), able to condition and distribute a SYNC signal (analog and digital) to different devices simultaneously. ESB can be easily built by individuals with basic soldering skills and represents a cost-effective solution to the available commercial synchronization boxes, while preserving similar electrical and functional features.

The time-frequency EEG signal is comprised of both phase-locked activity (associated with stimulus-specific processes) and nonphase-locked activity (represents processes thought to persist over longer timeframes and do not contribute to the average ERP). In the present study, we used a cued task-switching paradigm to examine whether phase-locked and nonphase-locked power are differentially modulated by switch and mixing effects in intervals associated with the need for proactive control (CTI) and reactive control (post-target interval). Phase-locked activity was observed in the theta and alpha bands, closely resembled that seen for total power, and was consistent with switch and mixing ERP positivities. Nonphase-locked analyses showed theta and alpha power effects for both switch and mixing effects early in the CTI and as well as more sustained alpha and beta activity around cue onset, and extending from mid-CTI into the post-target interval. Nonphase-locked activity in pretarget alpha and posttarget theta power were both correlated with response time mixing cost. These findings provide novel insight into phase-locked and nonphase-locked activity associated with switch and mixing costs that are not evident with ERP or total time-frequency analyses.

We found relevant activity at the expected channels and times, and a putative composition-related activity before the second word onset. Using threshold-free cluster permutation analysis and linear models we show a task-progression effect for the composition task that is not present for the list task. In a second experiment we evaluate two-word composition incorporating all conditions in a single task. In this case, we failed to find any significant composition-related activity suggesting that the activity measured with EEG may be in part carried by expectancy processes arising from the block design of the experiment, which can be prevented by using a non-blocked design and data-driven techniques to analyze the data.

However, due to the limited temporal resolution of non-invasive neuroimaging techniques, the role(s) of the insula in auditory processing remains unclear. As the anterior insula (aI) and the posterior insula (pI) have different connections and are thought to be functionally distinct, it is likely that these two areas contribute differently to auditory processing. Our study examines the spatiotemporal dynamics of auditory processing in the insula using intracranial electroencephalography (EEG). Eight epileptic patients completed two passive listening tasks and one three-stimulus auditory oddball detection task during the intracranial EEG monitoring of their drug-resistant seizures. Recordings were obtained from depth electrodes implanted in 11 insulae. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were analyzed using permutation analyses during the N100 and the P300 intervals, and modulations of alpha, theta, and gamma band responses were compared using Wilcoxon/Mann-Whitney analyses. N100 responses to auditory stimuli were mostly observed in the pI and were little affected by task conditions. Auditory target detection was associated with P300 ERPs, and alpha, theta, high- and low-gamma responses, preferentially at aI contacts. Results suggest that the aI is involved in voluntary attentional processing of task-relevant information, whereas the pI is involved in automatic auditory processing.

Patients with OSA have increased risk of car and work place accidents which may be attributed to cognitive impairment due to poor sleep quality. Thus, there is an increasing need to implement simple, reliable and rapid screening for cognitive impairment in OSA patients. Objectives To assess auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) and quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) as screening tools for detection of cognitive impairment in OSA patients taking circadian effects into consideration. Subjects and methods Twenty OSA patients as well as 20 gender- and age-matched volunteers were subjected to trail making test (TMT), auditory ERPs and QEEG before and after at least 6 h polysomnographic recording. Correlating electrophysiological tools with TMT and clinical parameters was done as well Results Statistically significant changes in P300 latency and reaction time, in addition to occipital alpha power were noted in cases; however, TMT failed to detect such changes. Electrophysiological results were not constantly correlated to clinical parameters. Conclusion Auditory ERPs and QEEG before and after polysomnography can be of benefit as cognitive screening test for suspected cognitive impairment in OSA patients.

However, few studies have focused on age-related changes in the N200 and P300 components among individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Therefore, this study aimed to assess age-related differences in the auditory nogo-N200 components in individuals with ADHD. Methods We enrolled 46 participants with auditory nogo-N200 and nogo-P300 components. We assessed ADHD symptoms using the Advanced Test of Attention (ATA) and Korean ADHD Rating Scale-IV (K-ARS-IV). Moreover, we assessed emotional and behavioral problems using the Korean Child Behavior Checklist (K-CBCL). Further, we measured auditory ERPs. Results There were no differences with respect to sex or ATA, K-ARS-IV, and K-CBCL scores between the groups. With a 1-year increase in age, the nogo-N200 latency at Fz and Cz decreased by 6.08 ms and 4.88 ms, respectively; this result was statistically significant in multivariable linear regression adjusted by sex and dominant hand. Conclusion Our findings revealed age-related changes in nogo-N200 latency at the Fz and Cz electrodes in individuals with ADHD. Future studies should perform comparisons with healthy controls to determine whether auditory nogo-N200 can be used to evaluate the developmental level in individuals with ADHD.

There are three major paradigms that are commonly employed for BCI: motor-imagery (MI), event-related potential (ERP), and steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP). Three individual paradigms each have their own pros and cons in terms of the available number of classes, eye/mental fatigue, illiteracy rate, and etc. When designing BCI applications a whole range of factors need to be taken into account, such as the patient's psychological and physical condition, environmental limitations, necessary number of classes and required accuracy level, among others. Given the limitations of the individual paradigms, it may not always be possible to satisfy all requirements with a current unimodal paradigm. In this study, we propose the concept of a paradigm-independent BCI framework, in which all three paradigms are available at the same time and can be used interchangeably. To do this, task-related features from the individual paradigms were extracted and cross-validated. Average classification accuracy for three-paradigm decoding was 74.84%(+/- 8.49) across 49 subjects. By considering the three major BCI paradigms, namely MI, ERP and SSVEP and by creating a machine learning framework, which is able to successfully decode the paradigm from individual trials, we pave the way towards new and more complex applications, where the limitations of unimodal BCI paradigms are alleviated.

There is need for an EEG noise/outlier resistant algorithm with a good classification accuracy. In this paper, we present a new technique for EEG signal classification to study whether a person remembers faces he or she has seen or not. For this purpose, our method applies denoising using discrete wavelet transform, time-locked EEG activity before generating templates for each class that indicates whether a person remembered or forgot. This novel technique was compared with well-known classification algorithms such as Discriminant Analysis (DA), Support Vector machines (SVM using linear kernel) and Decision Trees (DT). Our Template Matching for EEG Single trial (ETMEST) technique outperformed them all. For all subjects, the average classification accuracy of ETMEST was 94%. Also, we applied this technique on a visually evoked potential EEG dataset based on c-VEP BCI speller system to detect symbol/alphabet recognition events. The results show this method can be reliably applied to EEG-based Communication, Brain Computer Interface(BCI) applications and other signal classification problems. It is additionally surmised from this investigation that during memory encoding, the signals from the frontal and temporal lobes are the strongest and during decoding, signals from the frontal and parietal lobes are the strongest.

Behavioral advantages have recently been associated with the spatial frequency spectrum of fearful faces, better fitting the human contrast sensitivity function than the spectrum of neutral faces. However, it is unclear whether and to which extent early and late ERP differences are due to low-level spatial frequency spectrum information or high-level representations of the facial expression. In this pre-registered EEG study (N = 38), the effects of fearful-specific spatial frequencies on event-related ERPs were investigated by presenting faces with fearful and neutral expressions whose spatial frequency spectra were manipulated so as to contain either the average power spectra of neutral, fearful, or both expressions combined. We found an enlarged N170 to fearful versus neutral faces, not interacting with spatial frequency. Interactions of emotional expression and spatial frequencies were observed for the P1 and Early Posterior Negativity (EPN). For both components, larger emotion differences were observed when the spectrum contained neutral as opposed to fearful frequencies. Importantly, for the EPN, fearful and neutral expressions did not differ anymore when inserting fearful frequencies into neutral expressions, whereas typical emotion differences were found when faces contained average or neutral frequencies. Our findings show that N170 emotional modulations are unaffected by expression-specific spatial frequencies. However, expression-specific spatial frequencies alter early and mid-latency ERPs. Most notably, the EPN to neutral expressions is boosted by adding fearful spectra-but not vice versa.

P300 amplitude has been related to attention-driven context comparison and resource allocation processes. Altered P300 amplitude in ADHD can be reasonably assumed to be related to ADHD typical cognitive performance deficits. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can increase the amplitude of endogenous brain oscillations. Because ERP components can be viewed as event-related oscillations (EROs), with P300 translating into the delta (0-4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) frequency range, an increase of delta and theta ERO amplitudes by tACS should result in an increase of P300 amplitudes in ADHD patients. In this pilot study, 18 adult ADHD patients (7 female) performed three consecutive blocks of a visual oddball task while the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Patients received either 20 min of tACS or sham stimulation at a stimulation intensity of 1 mA. Individual stimulation frequency was determined using a time-frequency decomposition of the P300. Our preliminary results demonstrate a significant increase in P300 amplitude in the stimulation group which was accompanied by a decrease in omission errors pre-to-post tACS. However, studies including larger sample sizes are advised.

To compare how young adults (ages 18 to 35) respond to different levels of body fat percentage both subjectively and objectively we collected survey ratings and electroencephalography (EEG) data across five different levels of BFP from 40 participants. We adapted the experimental design from a prior behavioral study and used calibrated and morphed female face images of five different BFP levels. The results of the survey are in consensus with the previous study and assessed to be a successful replication. From the EEG data, event-related potentials (ERPs) were extracted from one electrode location (right occipitotemporal brain region) known to be particularly sensitive to face-stimuli. We found statistically significant differences in the amplitudes of the P200 component (194 ms post stimulus onset) between the thickest face and all four other BFP conditions, and in the amplitudes of the N300 component (274 ms post stimulus onset) between the average face and three other BFP conditions. As expected, there were no significant differences among the N170 amplitudes of all five BFP conditions since this ERP component simply reflects the processing of faces in general. From these results, we can infer that holistic face encoding characterized by the N170 component in the right occipitotemporal area is followed by serial evaluative processes, whose categorical and qualitative matrix and spatiotemporal dynamics should be further explored in future studies, especially in relation to the social constructs that were focused on in this study.

For this reason, electroencephalography has been broadly employed to investigate the user performance and comfort for stereoscopic visualization systems. However, no previous research investigated the cortical activity when viewing real three-dimensional images, such as demonstrated on the volumetric displays. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the short-term changes in brain activity when viewing images on the volumetric multi-planar display. The visual search array consisted of four constant angular size circles. In each trial, one of the circles was displayed closer to the subject comparing to three others. The task was to find the closest circle and submit the answer about its relative location. Each participant performed visual search tasks in three repetitive sessions consisting of 80 trials. We used electroencephalography to record the electrical activity of the brain. No significant changes were found when comparing the results of ERP components between three repetitive visual task sessions. Regarding the frequency band power, the significant changes were proved only for the alpha band in the central parietal area (Pz) and in the right parietal area (P4). The alpha band power grew considerably in most individuals when compared the signals during the third session with the first session. In addition, there was a trend of increased activity in the beta band, however, no statistical significance was reached. In this work, we discuss the possible effects of visual task and three-dimensional visualization of information on the cortical activity.

Hyper-scanning technique enables to measure brain activities simultaneously from two or more persons, which was employed in this study to explore social emotion perception. We analyzed the recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) to explore emotion perception in terms of event related potential (ERP) and phase synchronization, and classified emotion categories based on convolutional neural network (CNN). The results showed that (1) ERP was significantly different among four emotion categories (i.e., anger, disgust, neutral, and happy), but there was no significant difference for ERP in the comparison of rating orders (the order of rating actions of the paired participants); (2) the intra-brain phase lag index (PLI) was higher than the inter-brain PLI but its number of connections exhibiting significant difference was less in all typical frequency bands (from delta to gamma); (3) the emotion classification accuracy of inter-PLI-Conv outperformed that of intra-PLI-Conv for all cases of using each frequency band (five frequency bands totally). In particular, the classification accuracies averaged across all participants in the alpha band were 65.55% and 50.77% (much higher than the chance level) for the inter-PLI-Conv and intra-PLI-Conv, respectively. According to our results, the emotion category of happiness can be classified with a higher performance compared to the other categories.

Electrophysiological correlates of perceiving racial differences from the eyes region of the face	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						EEG; Event-related potentials (ERP); Race perception; Eyes; Attention; Intergroup relations; Familiarity; P2; N400; P300; Late Positive Complex (LPC); Face recognition; Configural; Holistic; Vigilance; Asian; Same-race; Other-race; Ingroup; Outgroup	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; OWN-RACE BIAS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; NEURAL SIGNALS; ATTENTION; COMPONENT; EMOTION; PERCEPTION; CONTACT; INGROUP	Past research has found that several brain event-related potentials (ERPs) were sensitive to the perception of ethnic differences displayed on human faces. This body of research suggests that the phenomenon of "race perception" involves a cascade of cognitive processes that includes both automatic and overt attentional mechanisms. However, most of these studies used stimuli depicting whole faces rather than stimuli depicting separate facial features. Therefore, it is still largely unknown if ERP responses to racial differences are the result of a holistic processing of the whole face, or whether they can be accounted for by the perception of single facial features. To address this issue, we examined whether a single facial feature, the eyes region, can provide sufficient information to trigger known ERP correlates of race perception such as the P2, the N400 and the Late Positive Complex (LPC). Specifically, we showed pictures depicting only the eyes region of Caucasian and Asian faces to a sample of Asian participants. We found that the P2 was larger for other-race (OR) compared to same-race (SR) eyes, and that the N400 was larger for SR compared to OR eyes. The effects on the P2 may suggest an enhanced vigilance response to OR eyes whereas the N400 effect could reflect a signal of familiarity triggered by SR eyes. These results indicate that a specific facial feature, the eyes region, can account for known effects of race perception on early brain potentials. Our findings also indicate that well-known early neural correlates of race perception can be triggered in the absence of a holistic processing of the whole face.

However, conventional EEG signal analysis techniques such as event related potential (ERP) and power spectrum estimation fail to provide high emotion state classification rates due to Fourier phase suppression. A four-dimensional emotional model in terms of arousal, valence, liking and dominance is proposed using emotion specific EEG signals from DEAP dataset. A compact set of temporal peak/interval related features and spectral features have been extracted to map the feature space. Through the feature map, a multiclass-support vector machine (SVM) based classifier using one-against-one algorithm is configured to yield a maximum classification accuracy of 81.6% while classifying four emotional states. A comparison of multi-class-SVM with other classifiers such as feed forward neural network and radial basis function network has been made. Significant improvement using a proposed compact hybrid EEG feature set and a multi-class-SVM has been achieved for automated emotion state classification.

As a dissociative disorder, DPD affects 1-2 % of the population, but takes 7-12 years on average to be accurately diagnosed. In this systematic review, we comprehensively describe research targeting the neural correlates of core DPD symptoms, covering publications between 1992 and 2020 that have used electrophysiological techniques. The aim was to investigate the diagnostic potential of these relatively inexpensive and convenient neuroimaging tools. We review the EEG power spectrum, components of the event-related potential (ERP), as well as vestibular and heartbeat evoked potentials as likely electrophysiological biomarkers to study DPD symptoms. We argue that acute anxiety- or trauma-related impairments in the integration of interoceptive and exteroceptive signals play a key role in the formation of DPD symptoms, and that future research needs analysis methods that can take this integration into account. We suggest tools for prospective studies of electrophysiological DPD biomarkers, which are urgently needed to fully develop their diagnostic potential.

Effects of speech transmission quality on sensory processing indicated by the cortical auditory evoked potential	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						electroencephalography; event-related brain potential; cortical auditory evoked potential; P1-N1-P2 complex; auditory sensory processing; speech quality; quality assessment	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SOUNDS VERTICAL-BAR; PASS NOISE MASKING; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; SUSTAINED POTENTIALS; ACOUSTIC CHANGE; NARROW-BAND; N1; HABITUATION; PERCEPTION	Objective.Degradations of transmitted speech have been shown to affect perceptual and cognitive processing in human listeners, as indicated by the P3 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP). However, research suggests that previously observed P3 modulations might actually be traced back to earlier neural modulations in the time range of the P1-N1-P2 complex of the cortical auditory evoked potential (CAEP). This study investigates whether auditory sensory processing, as reflected by the P1-N1-P2 complex, is already systematically altered by speech quality degradations.Approach.Electrophysiological data from two studies were analyzed to examine effects of speech transmission quality (high-quality, noisy, bandpass-filtered) for spoken words on amplitude and latency parameters of individual P1, N1 and P2 components.Main results.In the resultant ERP waveforms, an initial P1-N1-P2 manifested at stimulus onset, while a second N1-P2 occurred within the ongoing stimulus. Bandpass-filtered versus high-quality word stimuli evoked a faster and larger initial N1 as well as a reduced initial P2, hence exhibiting effects as early as the sensory stage of auditory information processing.Significance.The results corroborate the existence of systematic quality-related modulations in the initial N1-P2, which may potentially have carried over into P3 modulations demonstrated by previous studies. In future psychophysiological speech quality assessments, rigorous control procedures are needed to ensure the validity of P3-based indication of speech transmission quality. An alternative CAEP-based assessment approach is discussed, which promises to be more efficient and less constrained than the established approach based on P3.

However, the involvement of successive memory processes in the profile of episodic memory in ASD needs more study. Here, we used event-related potentials (ERP) to investigate the time course of episodic recollection with an associative recognition paradigm with picture pairs. Twenty-two participants with ASD and 32 with typical development (TD), all right-handed, were included. Behavioral results confirmed difficulties in correctly recognizing identical pairs in the ASD relative to TD group. We found an unexpected amplitude decrement on the P2 (220-270 msec) and FN400 (350-470 msec) potentials, suggesting diminished priming and familiarity effects in the ASD relative to TD group. However, ERP data revealed that the recognition of associative information relies on the same electrophysiological process (old/new effect in the 600-700-msec late positive component) in ASD participants as in TD ones, with a parietal extension in the ASD group. These results suggest that the electrophysiological processes of associative recognition are qualitatively similar in individuals with and without ASD but may differ quantitatively. This difference may be driven by the reduced early processing of picture pairs that may in turn lead to their diminished integration into the semantic memory system, being partially compensated by a greater involvement of associative memory during the recollection process. Other studies would be useful to go further in identifying these cognitive processes involved in atypical recognition in ASD and their neural substrates. Lay Summary We identified diminished performance on the associative recognition of picture pairs in adolescents and young adults with autism when compared to typical development. Electrophysiological data revealed qualitative similarities but quantitative differences between-group, with diminished priming and familiarity processes partially compensated by an enhanced parietal recollection process.

Poorer performance in same/different judgment tasks and increased occipito-temporal N1 response to the inverted (vs. upright) body schema seem to hint at an orientation-dependent perceptual mechanism. The present electrophysiological study investigated the role of attentive selection processes required to recognize the inverted (vs. upright) body schema by means of the event-related potentials (ERP). 320 different images depicting body shapes (wooden dummies) as opposed to random structures of cubes were created in 3D graphics. Thirty-two right-handed participants were presented with the stimuli in an upright and inverted orientation. They were required to alternatively recognize one of the two categories of stimuli (by button press) regardless of the orientation, during EEG recording. The body inversion led to increased reaction times during body schema recognition. A slower anterior N2, larger N1, Selection Negativity (SN), and increased parietal P300 components were elicited by the perception of the inverted body schema. Slower stimulus processing and increased attention allocation were associated with the processing of the inverted body schema. The swLORETA source reconstruction (in the SN time window) showed enhanced engagement of prefrontal, limbic, and temporal regions during the perception of the inverted body schema. At the same time, the cubes' orientation did not affect ERP amplitudes. Overall, these pieces of evidence seem to suggest a crucial role of the upright orientation in the visual recognition of the human body schema.

While there is also evidence that L2 learners can achieve native-like online-processing with sufficient proficiency (following the convergence hypothesis), considering multiple mediating factors and their impact on language processing has proven challenging. We recorded EEG while native (n = 36) and L2-speakers of French (n = 40) read sentences that were either well-formed or contained a syntactic-category error. a lexical-semantic anomaly, or both. Consistent with the critical period hypothesis, group differences revealed that while native speakers elicited a biphasic N400-P600 in response to ungrammatical sentences, L2 learners as a group only elicited an N400. However, individual data modeling using a Random Forests approach revealed that language exposure and proficiency are the most reliable predictors in explaining ERP responses, with N400 and P600 effects becoming larger as exposure to French as well as proficiency increased, as predicted by the convergence hypothesis.

While older adults often display increased sensitivity to top-down influences of contextual information during object recognition, the locus of this increased sensitivity remains unresolved. To examine the effects of aging on the neural dynamics of bottom-up and top-down visual processing during rapid object recognition, we probed the differential effects of object perceptual ambiguity and scene context con-gruity on specific EEG event-related potential components indexing dissociable processes along the vi-sual processing stream. Older adults displayed larger behavioral scene congruity effects than young adults. Older adults' larger visual P2 amplitudes to object perceptual ambiguity (as opposed to the scene congruity P2 effects in young adults) suggest continued resolution of perceptual ambiguity that inter-fered with scene congruity processing, while post-perceptual semantic integration (as indexed by N400) remained largely intact. These findings suggest that compromised bottom-up perceptual processing in healthy aging leads to an increased involvement of top-down processes to resolve greater perceptual ambiguity during object recognition.

The first approach employs training classifiers for each subject separately, while the second approach shuffles all the data from different subjects and train classification model on merged data. The proposed approaches are tested for three features classification algorithms: support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbours (kNN) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). It has been found that the proposed GT approach is very efficient for training kNN classifier, reaching averagely 98% accuracy, while it does not have any noticeable improvements when using LDA. SVM classifier turned to be non-efficient for classification of the target ERP component while using both training approaches.

Initially, it was suggested to help the disabled, but actually had been proposed a wider range of applications. However, the cross-subject recognition in BCI systems is difficult to break apart from the individual specific characteristics, unsteady characteristics, and environmental specific characteristics, which also makes it difficult to develop highly reliable and highly stable BCI systems. Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) is one of the most recent spellers with a clean, unified background and a single stimulus, which may evoke event-related potential (ERP) patterns with less individual difference. In order to build a BCI system that allows new users to use it directly without calibration or with less calibration time, RSVP was employed as evoked paradigm, then correlation analysis rank (CAR) algorithm was proposed to improve the cross-individual classification and simultaneously use as less training data as possible. Fifty-eight subjects took part in the experiments. The flash stimulation time is 200 ms, and the off time is 100 ms. The P300 component was locked to the target representation by time. The results showed that RSVP could evoke more similar ERP patterns among subjects compared with matrix paradigm. Then, the included angle cosine was calculated and counted for averaged ERP waveform between each two subjects. The average matching number of all subjects was 6 for the matrix paradigm, while for the RSVP paradigm, the average matching number range was 20 when the threshold value was set to 0.5, more than three times as much larger, quantificationally indicating that ERP waveforms evoked by the RSVP paradigm produced smaller individual differences, and it is more favorable for cross-subject classification. Information transfer rates (ITR) were also calculated for RSVP and matrix paradigms, and the RSVP paradigm got the average ITR of 43.18 bits/min, which was 13% higher than the matrix paradigm. Then, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve value was computed and compared using the proposed CAR algorithm and traditional random selection. The results showed that the proposed CAR got significantly better performance than the traditional random selection and got the best AUC value of 0.8, while the traditional random selection only achieved 0.65. These encouraging results suggest that with proper evoked paradigm and classification methods, it is feasible to get stable performance across subjects for ERP-based BCI. Thus, our findings provide a new approach to improve BCI performances.

Changes in the peak or mean amplitude of a waveform over a given time period, therefore, cannot reliably be attributed to a particular ERP component of ex ante interest, as is the standard approach to ERP analysis. Though this problem is widely recognized, it is not well addressed in practice. Our approach begins by presuming that any observed ERP waveform - at any electrode, for any trial type, and for any participant - is approximately a weighted combination of signals from an underlying set of what we refer to as principle ERPs, or pERPs. We propose an accessible approach to analyzing complete ERP waveforms in terms of their underlying pERPs. First, we propose the principle ERP reduction (pERP-RED) algorithm for investigators to estimate a suitable set of pERPs from their data, which may span multiple tasks. Next, we provide tools and illustrations of pERP-space analysis, whereby observed ERPs are decomposed into the amplitudes of the contributing pERPs, which can be contrasted across conditions or groups to reveal which pERPs differ (substantively and/or significantly) between conditions/groups. Differences on all pERPs can be reported together rather than selectively, providing complete information on all components in the waveform, thereby avoiding selective reporting or user discretion regarding the choice of which components or windows to use. The scalp distribution of each pERP can also be plotted for any group/condition. We demonstrate this suite of tools through simulations and on real data collected from multiple experiments on participants diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Software for conducting these analyses is provided in the pERPred package for R.

These ways vary between using a direct input via typical input mediums, automatic smart sensors, or even human postures. When dealing with people who suffer from disability, the aforementioned ways are not always applicable. In this paper, we introduce a new interaction style that helps disabled people. We focus on using a mental based decision making system. Precisely, we focus on issuing decisions directly from the electrical signals in a human brain. The goal is to transfer the interaction medium into the mental level. For the sake of clarity, we discuss a case study where we use a headset sensors to send direct Electroencephalography (EEG) signals as commands into the Tetris game. This case study is a simulation level suggested as a proof of concept. In the Tetris game the commands are discrete and limited. By preparing the Tetris game and using the Emotiv Epoc with a headset as the controlling tool. This paper provides a mechanism that grants ability for people to control and easily play computer games.

The aim of the present study was to examine changes in behavioral outcomes and event-related potentials (ERPs; N2 and P3 amplitudes) from baseline to post-intervention that might suggest the mechanisms underpinning these effects. Fifty-five participants completed go/no-go tasks during two electroencephalography (EEG) sessions, at baseline and post-intervention. The go/no-go task included "go" cues to low energy-dense foods and non-foods, and "no-go" cues to high energy-dense foods and non-foods. Datasets with poor signal quality and/or outliers were excluded, leaving 48 participants (N= 24 BN;N= 24 BED) in the analyses. Participants allocated to the food-specific, compared to the general intervention group, showed significantly greater reductions in reaction time to low energy-dense foods, compared to non-foods, by post-intervention. Commission errors significantly increased from baseline to post-intervention, regardless of stimulus type (food vs. non-food) and intervention group (food-specific vs. general). There were no significant changes in omission errors. P3 amplitudes to "no-go" cues marginally, but non-significantly, decreased by post-intervention, but there was no significant interaction with stimulus type (high energy-dense food vs. non-food) or intervention group (food-specific vs. general). There were no significant changes in N2 amplitudes to "no-go" cues, N2 amplitudes to "go" cues, or P3 amplitudes to "go" cues from baseline to post-intervention. Training effects were only marginally captured by these event-related potentials. We discuss limitations to the task paradigm, including its two-choice nature, ease of completion, and validity, and give recommendations for future research exploring ERPs using inhibitory control paradigms.

Overall arousal level can determine the amount of processing capacity required for attention allocation. Music evokes strong emotions and regulates arousability. Music has been used to modulate P300, especially in normals. This exploratory study examined the effect of music listening on the amplitude and latency of P300 in SZ patients. EEG/ERP was recorded (32-channels) while SZ patients (n = 20; 18-45 years) performed an auditory oddball P300 task after the eyes-dosed rest condition (Condition-A) and ten-minute music listening condition (Condition-B) as per the complete counterbalancing design (AB-BA). Patients listened to the researcher chosen, instru-mental presentation of raag-Bhoopali in the North-Indian-Classical-Music, for ten-minutes. All patients rated the music excerpt as a relaxing and positively valenced. A significant increase in accuracy score and reaction time during the oddball task after music listening was noted. There was an increase in amplitude at TP7. A trend of increased amplitude was noted across all electrodes in the music condition compared to the rest condition. Mean amplitude in an apriori defined time window of interest (250 to 750 ms) showed significant changes in the frontal and central electrode sites. Power spectral analysis indicated a slight increase in frontal and central alpha and theta activity during music listening. However, this was not statistically significant. Findings add further impetus to examine the effect of music in chronic psychiatric conditions. Need for systematic studies on a larger cohort is underscored. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Sahni, P; Kumar, J				Sahni, Pooja; Kumar, Jyoti			Effect of Nature Experience on Fronto-Parietal Correlates of Neurocognitive Processes Involved in Directed Attention: An ERP Study	ANNALS OF NEUROSCIENCES			English	Article						Nature experience; Directed attention; Inhibition; N2; P3	COGNITIVE BENEFITS; EEG; MINDFULNESS; BRAIN; RESTORATION; INHIBITION; MEDITATION; COMPONENT; FATIGUE; WALKING	Background: Several studies have demonstrated that brief interactions with natural environments can improve cognitive functioning. However, the neurocognitive processes that are affected by natural surroundings are not yet fully understood. It is argued that the "elements" in natural environment evoke "effortless" involuntary attention and may affect the neural mechanisms underlying inhibition control central to directed attention. Methods: The present study used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the effects of nature experience on neurocognitive processes involved in directed attention. During EEG recordings, participants (n = 53) were presented nature audio/video as stimuli to evoke nature experience, and flanker task was administered both before and after nature experience. An open eye rest condition was included randomly in either before or after nature experience cognitive task as a control condition. Results: The event-related potential analysis demonstrated a significant improvement in the response time after the nature experience. The analysis also demonstrated a significant difference for the inhibitory control process in fronto-parietal N2 (P < .01) and P3 (P < .05) for incongruent trials subsequent to nature experience. The spectral analysis also found an increase in alpha in all five brain regions (all Ps < .01) and fronto-central theta power (P < .01). Conclusion: The findings suggest that improved inhibitory control processes could be one of the aspects of enhanced directed attention after nature experience. Increased alpha along with theta indicates a relaxed yet alert state of mind after nature experience.

Methods EEG data were collected while 28 satiated adolescents (14 overweight/obese) viewed pictures of neutral, low-calorie food, and high-calorie food stimuli and rated their desire to eat, before having access to high-calorie snacks. Results Unlike normal-weight adolescents, overweight/obese participants showed similar P300 amplitudes for high- and low-calorie food, and strongest event-related alpha band desynchronization for low-calorie stimuli. P300 amplitudes and state craving for low-calorie food furthermore predicted snack intake in this group. Conclusions The current research focus in overweight/obesity might need to be extended to include low-calorie food. While all participants showed an attentional bias for high-calorie food, it was the processing of low-calorie food which distinguished the two weight groups on measures of neural activity and which was associated with snack food intake in the overweight/obese group.

J	Ma, Z; Cheng, J; Tao, DP				Ma, Zheng; Cheng, Jun; Tao, Dapeng			Online learning using projections onto shrinkage closed balls for adaptive brain-computer interface	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Online learning; Projections; Wearable/portable brain computer interface; Electroencephalography; Event-related potential; Biometrics	BCI	Wearable/portable brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for the long-term end use are a focus of recent BCI research. A challenge is how to update the BCI to meet changes in electroencephalography (EEG) signals, since the resource are so limited that retraining of traditional well-performed models, such as a support vector machine, is nearly impossible. To cope with this challenge, less-demanding adaptive online learning can be considered. We investigated an adaptive projected sub-gradient method (APSM) that is originated from the set theoretic estimation formulation and the projections onto convex sets theory. APSM provides a unifying framework for both adaptive classification and regression tasks. Coefficients of APSM are adjusted online as data arrive sequentially, with a regularization constraint made by projections onto a fixed closed ball. We extended the general APSM to a shrinkage form, where shrinkage closed balls were used instead of the original fixed one, expecting a more controllable fading effect and better adaptability. The convergence of shrinkage APSM was proved. It was also demonstrated that as shrinkage factor approached to 1, the limit point of shrinkage APSM would approach to the optimal solution with the least norm, which could be especially beneficial for generalization of the classifier. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated, and compared with those of the general APSM, the incremental support vector machine, and the passive aggressive algorithm, through an event-related potential-based BCI experiment. Results showed the advantage of the proposed method over the others on both the online classification performance and the easiness of tuning. Our study revealed the effectiveness of the proposed method for adaptive EEG classification, making it a promising tool for on-device training and updating of wearable/portable BCIs, as well as for application in other related fields, such as EEG-based biometrics.

Event-related potential and EEG oscillatory predictors of verbal memory in mild cognitive impairment	BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						EEG; event-related potential; mild cognitive impairment; memory; Alzheimer's disease	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; WORD REPETITION; CONVERSION; MCI; MODULATIONS; PERSPECTIVE; BIOMARKERS; RESPONSES; ALPHA	Reliable biomarkers of memory decline are critical for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease. Previous work has found three EEG measures, namely the event-related brain potential P600, suppression of oscillatory activity in the alpha frequency range (similar to 10 Hz) and cross-frequency coupling between low theta/high delta and alpha/beta activity, each of which correlates strongly with verbal learning and memory abilities in healthy elderly and patients with mild cognitive impairment or prodromal Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, we address the question of whether event-related or oscillatory measures, or a combination thereof, best predict the decline of verbal memory in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Single-trial correlation analyses show that despite a similarity in their time courses and sensitivities to word repetition, the P600 and the alpha suppression components are minimally correlated with each other on a trial-by-trial basis (generally vertical bar r(s)vertical bar < 0.10). This suggests that they are unlikely to stem from the same neural mechanism. Furthermore, event-related brain potentials constructed from bandpass filtered (delta, theta, alpha, beta or gamma bands) single-trial data indicate that only delta band activity (1-4Hz) is strongly correlated (r = 0.94, P < 0.001) with the canonical P600 repetition effect; event-related potentials in higher frequency bands are not. Importantly, stepwise multiple regression analyses reveal that the three event-related brain potential/oscillatory measures are complementary in predicting California Verbal Learning Test scores (overall R(2')s in 0.45-0.63 range). The present study highlights the importance of combining EEG event-related potential and oscillatory measures to better characterize the multiple mechanisms of memory failure in individuals with mild cognitive impairment or prodromal Alzheimer's disease.

Previous studies have shown that VSTM capacity can be modulated by the location of one's hands, where hand proximity enhances neural processing and memory of nearby visual stimuli. The present study used traditional event-related potentials (ERP) along with multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis to shed light on the neural mechanism(s) behind such near-hand effect. Participants' electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded as they performed a VSTM task with their hands either proximal or distal to the display. ERP analysis showed altered memory processing in the 400-700 ms time window during memory retrieval period. Importantly, MSE analysis also showed significant EEG difference between hand proximal and distal conditions between scales 10 to 20, and such difference is clustered around the right parietal cortex - a region that is involved in VSTM processing and bimodal hand-eye integration. The implications of higher MSE time scale in the parietal cortex are discussed in the context of signal complexity and its possible relation to cognitive processing. To our knowledge, this study provides the first investigation using MSE to characterize the temporal characteristics and signal complexity behind the effect of hand proximity.

The Association Between Experimentally Induced Stress, Performance Monitoring, and Response Inhibition: An Event-Related Potential (ERP) Analysis	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						event-related potential; error-related negativity; error positivity; N2; stress; Trier Social Stress Test	ERROR-RELATED-NEGATIVITY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; CONFLICT ADAPTATION; PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; SEX-DIFFERENCES; NEURAL SYSTEM; AWARENESS; POSITIVITY	Psychological stress is increasingly associated with alterations in performance and affect. Yet, the relationship between experimentally induced psychological stress and neural indices of performance monitoring and error processing, as well as response inhibition, are unclear. Using scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs), we tested the relationship between experimental stress, using the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), and the error-related negativity (ERN), error positivity (Pe), and N2 ERP components. A final sample of 71 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to go through the TSST (n= 36; 18 female) or a brief mindfulness relaxation exercise (n= 35; 16 female) immediately followed by a go/no-go task while electroencephalogram (EEG) data were collected. Salivary cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure confirmed increased physiological stress in the TSST group relative to control. Reaction times, accuracy, and post-error slowing did not differ by stress group. Two-group (TSST, control) by 2-trial type (correct, incorrect for ERN/Pe; go correct, no-go correct for N2) repeated measures ANOVAs for the ERN, Pe, and N2 showed the expected main effects of trial type; neither the ERN nor the N2 ERP components showed interactions with the stress manipulation. In contrast, the Pe component showed a significant Group by Trial interaction, with reduced Pe amplitude following the stress condition relative to control. Pe amplitude did not, however, correlate with cortisol reactivity. Findings suggest a reduction in Pe amplitude following experimental stress that may be associated with reduced error awareness or attention to errors following the TSST. Given the variability in the extant literature on the relationship between experimentally induced stress and neurophysiological reflections of performance monitoring, we provide another point of data and conclude that better understanding of moderating variables is needed followed by high-powered replication studies to get at the nuance that is not yet understood in the relationship between induced stress and performance monitoring/response inhibition processes.

Distraction by Unintentional Recognition: Neurocognitive Mechanisms and Effects of Aging	PSYCHOLOGY AND AGING			English	Article						aging; recognition; cognitive control; ERPs; EEG oscillations	LATE POSTERIOR NEGATIVITY; SOURCE MEMORY RETRIEVAL; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; THETA OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EPISODIC RETRIEVAL; CONTEXT MEMORY; RECOLLECTION; ERP	Sometimes, we intentionally evaluate stimuli to assess whether we recognize them, whereas, at other times, stimuli automatically elicit recognition despite our efforts to ignore them. If multiple stimuli are encountered in the same environment, intentional recognition judgments can be biased by unintentional recognition of to-be-ignored stimuli. Aging is associated with increased distractibility and impaired intentional retrieval processes, which can make older adults more susceptible to distraction-induced recognition biases. We measured recognition memory performance, event-related potentials (ERPs), and electroencephalography oscillations in old (age range = 60-74) and young (age range = 18-24) adults to investigate how aging affects unintentional and intentional memory processes, and how these processes interact over time to produce distraction-induced recognition biases. Older participants had poorer intentional recognition memory, but the biasing effect of unintentional distractor recognition was similar across age groups. FRP effects related to intentional and unintentional recognition that were strongly expressed in the younger group were reduced or absent in the older group. Furthermore, the older group showed qualitatively different ERP activity during intentional recognition compared with the younger group. However, similar patterns of theta and alpha oscillations were found in both age groups, who showed theta power increases for both intentional and unintentional recognition, whereas alpha power was enhanced for intentional recognition but reduced for unintentional recognition. Overall, the findings show that unintentional and intentional recognition involve multiple dissociable memory processes that have different time-courses and functional characteristics and are differentially affected by aging. Whereas aging has strong effects on the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying intentional recognition memory, unintentional recognition mechanisms are less affected.

But, what happens when the movement has to be suppressed? Does long-term limb immobilization modulate physiological responses underlying motor inhibition? Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in healthy participants performing a Go/Nogo task, either with both hands free to respond (T1/T4: before/after the immobilization) or when left-hand movements were prevented by a cast (T2: as soon as the cast was positioned; T3: after one week of immobilization). In the right (control) side, N140, N2, and P3 components showed the expected greater amplitude in Nogo than in Go trials, irrespective of the timepoint. On the contrary, in the left (manipulated) side, each component of the ERP responses to Nogo trials showed specific differences across timepoints, suggesting that the inhibition-related EEG activity is significantly reduced by the presence of the cast and the duration of the immobilization. Furthermore, inhibition-related theta band activity to Nogo stimuli decreased at post-immobilization blocked session (T3-blocked). Altogether these findings can be interpreted as a consequence of the plastic changes induced by the immobilization, as also demonstrated by the cast-related corticospinal excitability modulation (investigated by using TMS) and by the decreased beta band in response to Go and Nogo trials. Thus, only if we are free to move, then inhibitory responses are fully implemented. After one week of immobilization, the amount of inhibition necessary to block the movement is lower and, consequently, inhibitory-related responses are reduced.

The mechanism by which attachment security buffers against psychological threat remains unclear, however. Here, we explored how attachment security attenuates the response to threatening information using a signal detection theory (SDT) and event-related potentials (ERPs) approach. Participants were assigned to an attachment security priming condition or a control condition. After a priming procedure, behavioral data and electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded while participants categorized threatening and neutral pictures. Our behavioral results revealed that attachment security biased participant responses to categorizing the two types of pictures; participants in the control condition exhibited a tendency to categorize stimuli as threatening, whereas those in the attachment security condition tended to categorize stimuli as neutral. Meanwhile, attachment security priming modulated early attention processes, reflected by an increased P200. The findings reported here suggest that attachment security buffers against external threats by modulating individual response preferences, the effects of which manifest in the early stages of attentional processing.

However, the extent these brain signals reflect a generic process and are independent of the type of information recognized remains an open question. To address this issue, twenty-seven healthy volunteers performed an episodic memory task while their electro-encephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Participants encoded a set of abstract pictures, and subsequently rated their confidence on recognition decisions. Similar to results reported in previous studies using concrete words, we found retrieval-related theta power, FN400 and late positive component (LPC) effects. In contrast to previous studies using verbal material, a subsequent memory effect for encoding-related evoked theta power, sensitive to subjectively perceived memory confidence, was observed.

Cultural influence is reported even in economic decision making, which involves basic cognitive process, once believed to be invariant across all humans. The current study investigated the neurocognitive processes underlying economic decision making in East Asians and European Americans, with an aim to understand the cross-cultural differences in the discrete mental processes of decision making. Participants performed a risky gambling task that captures the gain maximizing and loss minimizing strategies, while electroencephalography was simultaneously collected. Event-related potentials (ERPs) associated with spontaneous emotional arousal (P2) and effortful attentional allocation (P3) were examined to determine the cultural effects on mental processes during pre-decisional and post-decisional stages. Behaviorally, Americans showed greater loss minimization than Asians. ERPs demonstrated significant cultural differences during post-decisional evaluation of outcomes, but not during pre-decisional processes. In Asians, ERP associated with emotional arousal (P2) was strongly modulated by gains, while in Americans, ERP associated with attentional allocation (P3) was strongly modulated by losses. These results suggest that Americans make conscious efforts to be self-reliant when facing financial losses, whereas Asians are more emotionally aroused by financial gains, which invites a refinement to the current theoretical propositions about cultural influence on decision making.

Here, we asked whether spatial selective attention is necessary for the processing of affective prosodies after visual deprivation from birth. For this purpose, pseudowords spoken in happy, neutral, fearful or threatening prosodies were presented at the left or right loudspeaker. Congenitally blind individuals (N = 8) and sighted controls (N = 13) had to attend to one of the loudspeakers and detect rare pseudowords presented at the attended loudspeaker during EEG recording. Emotional prosody of the syllables was task-irrelevant. Blind individuals outperformed sighted controls by being more efficient in detecting deviant syllables at the attended loudspeaker. A higher auditory N1 amplitude was observed in blind individuals compared to sighted controls. Additionally, sighted controls showed enhanced attention-related ERP amplitudes in response to fearful and threatening voices during the time range of the N1. By contrast, blind individuals revealed enhanced ERP amplitudes in attended relative to unattended locations irrespective of the affective valence in all time windows (110-350 ms). These effects were mainly observed at posterior electrodes. The results provide evidence for "emotion-general" auditory spatial selective attention effects in congenitally blind individuals and suggest a potential reorganization of the voice processing brain system following visual deprivation from birth.

The present study examined how gender role moderates sex differences in emotional reactivity. Event-related potentials (ERP) were recorded in sixty-eight subjects with typical or androgynous gender roles when they passively observed neutral and negative pictures. Behaviorally, typical females (feminine females) reported higher emotional rating than typical males (masculine males), while androgynous males and androgynous females reported no significant differences. Electrophysiologically, we found higher late positive potential (LPP) amplitude in typical females compared to typical males, while this pattern of sex difference was absent in androgynous subjects. The network analysis of EEG data indicates that typical males showed enhanced network coupling strengths between frontal/prefrontal and parietal areas than typical females, which was again absent in androgynous subjects. These findings suggest that gender role is an important determinant in the interpretation of sex differences in emotional reactivity.

Reward processing electrophysiology in schizophrenia: Effects of age and illness phase	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						First-episode schizophrenia; Chronic schizophrenia; Event-related potentials; Reward processing; Age; Depression	CLINICAL-ASSESSMENT INTERVIEW; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NEGATIVE SYNDROME SCALE; MEDIOFRONTAL NEGATIVITIES; EMOTION REGULATION; MAJOR DEPRESSION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; BIPOLAR DISORDER; PSYCHOSIS RISK; VOLUME LOSS	Background: Reward processing abnormalities may underlie characteristic pleasure and motivational impairments in schizophrenia. Some neural measures of reward processing show age-related modulation, highlighting the importance of considering age effects on reward sensitivity. We compared event-related potentials (ERPs) reflecting reward anticipation (stimulus-preceding negativity, SPN) and evaluation (reward positivity, RewP; late positive potential, LPP) across individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) and healthy controls (HC), with an emphasis on examining the effects of chronological age, brain age (i.e., predicted age based on neurobiological measures), and illness phase. Methods: Subjects underwent EEG while completing a slot-machine task for which rewards were not dependent on performance accuracy, speed, or response preparation. Slot-machine task EEG responses were compared between 54 SZ and 54 HC individuals, ages 19 to 65. Reward-related ERPs were analyzed with respect to chronological age, categorically-defined illness phase (early; ESZ versus chronic schizophrenia; CSZ), and were used to model brain age relative to chronological age. Results: Illness phase-focused analyses indicated there were no group differences in average SPN or RewP amplitudes. However, a group x reward outcome interaction revealed that ESZ differed from HC in later outcome processing, reflected by greater LPP responses following loss versus reward (a reversal of the HC pattern). While brain age estimates did not differ among groups, depressive symptoms in SZ were associated with older brain age estimates while controlling for negative symptoms. Conclusions: ESZ and CSZ did not differ from HC in reward anticipation or early outcome processing during a cognitively undemanding reward task, highlighting areas of preserved functioning. However, ESZ showed altered later reward outcome evaluation, pointing to selective reward deficits during the early illness phase of schizophrenia. Further, an association between ERP-derived brain age and depressive symptoms in SZ extends prior findings linking depression with reward-related ERP blunting. Taken together, both illness phase and age may impact reward processing among SZ, and brain aging may offer a promising, novel marker of reward dysfunction that warrants further study.

In that respect, this paper investigates the feasibility of a fully predictive methodology to detect the intention to start and stop a gait cycle by utilizing EEG signals obtained before the event occurrence. Methods An eight-channel, custom-made, EEG system with electrodes placed around the sensorimotor cortex was used to acquire EEG data from six healthy subjects and two amputees. A discrete wavelet transform-based method was employed to capture event related information in alpha and beta bands in the time-frequency domain. The Hjorth parameters, namely activity, mobility, and complexity, were extracted as features while a two-sample unpaired Wilcoxon test was used to get rid of redundant features for better classification accuracy. The feature set thus obtained was then used to classify between 'walk vs. stop' and 'rest vs. start' classes using support vector machine (SVM) classifier with RBF kernel in a ten-fold cross-validation scheme. Results Using a fully predictive intention detection system, 76.41 +/- 4.47% accuracy, 72.85 +/- 7.48% sensitivity, and 79.93 +/- 5.50% specificity were achieved for 'rest vs. start' classification. While for 'walk vs. stop' classification, the obtained mean accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 74.12 +/- 4.12%, 70.24 +/- 6.45%, and 77.78 +/- 7.01% respectively. Overall average True Positive Rate achieved by this methodology was 72.06 +/- 8.27% with 1.45 False Positives/min. Conclusion Extensive simulations and resulting classification results show that it is possible to achieve statistically similar intention detection accuracy using either only pre-movement EEG features or trans-movement EEG features. The classifier performance shows the potential of the proposed methodology to predict human movement intention exclusively from the pre-movement EEG signal to be applied in real-life prosthetic and neuro-rehabilitation systems.

Ample researches have examined how the dynamical properties of brain activity reflect the neural cognitive working mechanisms. A prevalent approach in this field is to extract the trial-averaged brain electrophysiological signals as a representation of the dynamical response of the complex neural system to external stimuli. However, the responses are intrinsically variable in latency from trial to trial. The variability compromises the accuracy of the detected dynamical response pattern based on trial-averaged approach, which may mislead subsequent modelling works. More accurate characterization of the brain's dynamical response incorporating single trial variability information is of profound significance in deepening our understanding of neural cognitive dynamics and brain's working principles. Various methods have been attempted to address the trial-to-trial asynchrony issue in order to achieve an improved representation of the dynamical response. We review the latest development of methodology in this area and the contribution of latency variability-based decomposition and reconstruction of dynamical response to neural cognitive researches.

Recent studies have demonstrated that caffeine can improve subjective attention and objective behavioral metrics, such as arousal level, reaction time, and memory efficiency. However, only a few studies have examined the electrophysiological changes caused by the caffeine in humans following sleep disturbance. In this study, an event-related potential (ERP) technique was employed to measure the behavioral, cognitive, and electrophysiological changes produced by caffeine administration after TSD. Methods: Sixteen healthy subjects within-subject design performed a visual Go/No-Go task with simultaneous electroencephalogram recording. Behavioral and ERP data were evaluated after 36 h of TSD, and the effects of ingestion of either 400 mg of caffeine or placebo were compared in a double-blind randomized design. Results: Compared with placebo administration, the Go hit rates were significantly enhanced in the caffeine condition. A simple effect analysis revealed that, compared with baseline, the Go-P2 amplitude was significantly enhanced after TSD in the caffeine consumption condition. A significant main effect of the drug was found on No-Go-P2, No-Go-N2 amplitude, and Go-P2 latency before and after TSD. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that caffeine administration has acute effects on improving the efficiency of individual automatic reactions and early cognitive processes. Caffeine was related to the preservation of an individual's arousal level and accelerated response-related decisions, while subjects' higher-level recognition had limited improvement with prolonged awareness.

J	Kim, B; Shin, J; Kim, Y; Choi, JH				Kim, Bowon; Shin, Jisu; Kim, YoungSoo; Choi, Jee Hyun			Destruction of ERP responses to deviance in an auditory oddball paradigm in amyloid infusion mice with memory deficits	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MOUSE MODELS; EVOKED POTENTIALS; IN-VIVO; BETA; DYSFUNCTION; OLIGOMERS; N1	The amyloid-beta (A beta) oligomer is considered one of the major pathogens responsible for neuronal and synaptic loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. Although the neurotoxic mechanisms of A beta have been widely investigated, experimental evidence for the direct linkage between neural signaling and cognitive impairments in association with peptide oligomers is lacking. Here, we conducted an auditory oddball paradigm utilizing an A beta-infused Alzheimer's disease mouse model and interpreted the results based on Y-maze behavioral tests. We acutely injected A beta oligomers into the intracerebroventricular brain region of normal mice to induce A beta-associated cognitive impairments. During the auditory oddball paradigm, electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded from frontal and parietal cortex of A beta-infused and control mice. The event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by auditory stimuli showed no significant difference in A beta-infused mice compared to control mice. On the other hand, the differential ERP signature elicited by oddball sound stimuli was destructed in the A beta-infused mice group. We noticed that ERP traces to standard and deviant tones were not significantly different in the A beta group, while the control group showed differences in the amplitude of ERP components. In particular, the difference in the first negative component (N1) between standard and deviant tone, which indexes the sensory memory system, was significantly reduced in the parietal cortex of A beta-infused mice. These findings demonstrate the direct influence of A beta oligomers on the functional integrity of cortical areas in vivo. Furthermore, the N1 amplitude difference may provide a potential marker of sensory memory deficits in a mouse model of AD and yield additional targets for drug assessment in AD.

Spatiotemporal brain signal associated with high and low levels of proactive motor response inhibition	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Proactive motor response inhibition; EEG; ERP; swLORETA; Source reconstruction modeling	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; STOP-SIGNAL; COGNITIVE CONTROL; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SELF-CONTROL; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PERFORMANCE; POTENTIALS; MECHANISMS	Proactive motor response inhibition is used to strategically restrain actions in preparation for stopping. In this study, we first examined the event related potential (ERP) elicited by low and high level of proactive response inhibition, as assessed by the stop-signal task. Corroborating previous studies, we found an increased amplitude of the contingent negative variation (CNV) in the high level of proactive inhibition. As the main goal of the present study, swLORETA was used to determine the neural generators characterising CNV differences between low and high levels of proactive inhibition. Results showed that the higher level of proactive inhibition involved numerous generators, including within the middle and medial frontal gyrus. Importantly, we observed that the lower level of proactive inhibition also involved a specific neural generator, within the frontopolar cortex. Altogether, present findings identified the specific brain sources of ERP signals involved in the later phase of motor preparation under low or high levels of proactive motor response inhibition.

Mobile Brain/Body Imaging of cognitive-motor impairment in multiple sclerosis: Deriving EEG-based neuro-markers during a dual-task walking study	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Multiple sclerosis; EEG; Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI); Dual-task walking	RESPONSE-INHIBITION; FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITE; ERP COMPONENTS; INTERFERENCE; DYSFUNCTION; ATTENTION; IMPACT; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ACTIVATION; AMPLITUDE	Objective: Individuals with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) often present with cognitive and motor deficits, and thus the ability to perform tasks that rely on both domains may be particularly impaired. Yet, dual-task walking studies yield mixed results. Individual variance in the ability to cope with brain insult and mobilize additional brain resources may contribute to mixed findings. Methods: To test this hypothesis, we acquired event-related potentials (ERP) in individuals with MS and healthy controls (HCs) performing a Go/NoGo task while sitting (i.e., single task) or walking (i.e., dual-task) and looked at the relationship between task related modulation of the brain response and performance. Results: On the Go/NoGo task the MS group showed dual-task costs when walking, whereas HCs showed a dual-task benefit. Further, whereas the HC group showed modulation of the brain response as a function of task load, this was not the case in the MS group. Analysis for the pooled sample revealed a positive correlation between load-related ERP effects and dual-task performance. Conclusions: These data suggest a neurophysiological marker of cognitive-motor dysfunction in MS. Significance: Understanding neural processes underlying dual-task walking will help identify objective brain measurements of real-world issues and may improve assessment of MS.

More recently, fMRI standardization efforts have focused on enabling the joint analysis of raw fMRI data across studies (mega-analysis), with the hope of achieving more detailed insights. However, it has not been clear if such analyses in the EEG field are possible or equally fruitful. Here we present the results of a large-scale EEG mega-analysis using 18 studies from six sites representing several different experimental paradigms. We demonstrate that when meta-data are consistent across studies, both channel-level and source-level EEG mega-analysis are possible and can provide insights unavailable in single studies. The analysis uses a fully-automated processing pipeline to reduce line noise, interpolate noisy channels, perform robust referencing, remove eye-activity, and further identify outlier signals. We define several robust measures based on channel amplitude and dispersion to assess the comparability of data across studies and observe the effect of various processing steps on these measures. Using ICA-based dipolar sources, we also observe consistent differences in overall frequency baseline amplitudes across brain areas. For example, we observe higher alpha in posterior vs anterior regions and higher beta in temporal regions. We also detect consistent differences in the slope of the aperiodic portion of the EEG spectrum across brain areas. In a companion paper, we apply mega-analysis to assess commonalities in event-related EEG features across studies.

The present study investigated attention-related brain activity and pupil dilation responses, evoked by task-irrelevant emotional novel sounds. In the framework of current theories about the relation between attention and the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system, we simultaneously registered event-related potentials (ERPs) in the EEG and changes in pupil diameter (PDR). Unexpected emotional negative and neutral environmental novel sounds were presented within a sequence of repeated standard sounds to 7-10-year-old children and to adults, while participants focused on a visual task. Novel sounds evoked distinctive ERP components, reflecting attention processes and a biphasic PDR in both age groups. Amplitudes of the novel-minus-standard ERPs were increased in children compared to adults, indicating immature neuronal basis of auditory attention in middle childhood. Emotional versus neutral novel sounds evoked increased responses in the ERPs and in the PDR in both age groups. This demonstrates the increased impact of emotional sounds on attention mechanisms and indicates an advanced level of emotional information processing in children. The similar pattern of novel-related PDR and ERPs is conforming to recent theories, emphasizing the role of the LC-NE system in attention processes adding a developmental perspective.

Using the N400 event-related potential to study word learning from context in children from low-and higher-socioeconomic status homes	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; SES; N400; Development; Word learning; ERP	VOCABULARY KNOWLEDGE; LANGUAGE; BRAIN; DEPTH; PERFORMANCE; EDUCATION; MEANINGS; NETWORK; BREADTH; INCOME	Children from low-socioeconomic status (SES) homes have significantly smaller vocabularies than their higher-SES peers, a gap that increases over the course of the school years. One reason for the increase in this vocabulary gap during the school years is that children from low-SES homes learn fewer words from context than their higher-SES peers. To better understand how the process of word learning from context might differ in children related to SES, we investigated changes in the N400 event-related potential (ERP) as children from low- and higher-SES homes learned new words using only the surrounding linguistic context. There were no differences in the N400 response to known words related to SES. In response to the target word being learned, children from higher-SES homes, like adults in previous studies, exhibited an attenuation of the N400 across exposures as they attached meaning to it. Children from low-SES homes did not show this same attenuation. These findings support previous work showing that children from low-SES homes may have differences or more variability in the neural components supporting language processing, and they extend previous work to illustrate how this variability may relate to word learning and, ultimately, vocabulary growth.

However, current international guidelines do not endorse the use of electroencephalographic (EEG)/magnetoencephalographic (MEG) biomarkers in clinical trials performed in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), despite a surge in recent validated evidence. This position paper of the ISTAART Electrophysiology Professional Interest Area endorses consolidated and translational electrophysiological techniques applied to both experimental animal models of AD and patients, to probe the effects of AD neuropathology (i.e., brain amyloidosis, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration) on neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning neural excitation/inhibition and neurotransmission as well as brain network dynamics, synchronization, and functional connectivity, reflecting thalamocortical and corticocortical residual capacity. Converging evidence shows relationships between abnormalities in EEG/MEG markers and cognitive deficits in groups of AD patients at different disease stages. The supporting evidence for the application of electrophysiology in AD clinical research as well as drug discovery pathways warrants an international initiative to include the use of EEG/MEG biomarkers in the main multicentric projects planned in AD patients, to produce conclusive findings challenging the present regulatory requirements and guidelines for AD studies.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: An event-related potential study of working memory	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						delayed Match-to-Sample task; retention phase; slow wave; working memory test battery for children	DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; RESTING ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; BEHAVIORAL-INHIBITION; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; ADULT ADHD; EEG-DATA; PERFORMANCE; MATURATION; BOYS	Working memory (WM) impairments have been frequently observed as an important feature of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Event-related potential (ERP) differences between ADHD and healthy controls (HC) would be expected during WM task performance. Especially, the so-called slow wave (SW), which is related to the retention process, might present amplitude differences in ADHD. In this ERP study participated twenty-nine ADHD children and adolescents and thirty-four HC. WM performance was assessed using the Working Memory Test Battery for Children (WMTB-C), and ERPs were analyzed with a Delayed Match-To-Sample (DMTS) task. ADHD sample showed worse behavioral performance in both WMTB-C and DMTS task, and higher SW amplitude during the retention phase of the DMTS task. Additionally, the principal component analysis indicated that the scores on the component explaining the centro-parietal SW were significantly different between ADHD subjects and HC. The observed impaired neurophysiological activity during the encoding and retention periods in ADHD, which would be the origin of the behavioral deficits in WM task performance, might be reflecting a delayed maturation of the neural processes underlying the centro-parietal SW.

Less is known about the ERPs' sensitivity of differentiating between individuals with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) and MCI, as early evidence indicates similar brain alterations between these two groups. In order, to establish tests that are sensitive to subclinical impairment, this study compared auditory evoked ERPs between individuals with SCI and MCI. Methods: Besides assessing cognitive performance in four neuropsychological tests (Trail Making Test A + B, verbal fluency letter and category task), latency and amplitude of ERP components evoked by an auditory oddball paradigm were compared between two groups of either individuals with SCI (n = 13) or MCI (n = 13). Results: While individuals with MCI performed significantly worse in all neuropsychological tests (TMT A: p = 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.5; TMT B: p = 0.030, Cohen's d = 0.94; verbal fluency letter: p = 0.0011, Cohen's d = 1.08; verbal fluency category: p = 0.038; Cohen's d = 0.86), no significant differences (p > 0.05) were found in ERP components with small to moderate effect sizes (Cohen's d ranged between 0.11 - 0.59). Conclusion: ERPs evoked by an auditory oddball paradigm lack sensitivity to differentiate between individuals with SCI and MCI, although significant differences in cognitive performance were detected by neuropsychological tests. Similar pathophysiological brain alterations may limit utility of ERPs as indicated by previous research and results of this study. Cognitively more challenging tasks than the auditory oddball paradigm may be considered by future investigations.

The genes responsible for regulating neuro-chemical metabolism are capable of influencing emotional responses. Objective. The goal is to determine the influence of the polymorphism of BDNF, HTR2A, and COMT genes on potentials evoked in response to faces with various emotional expressions and objects with different emotional valences. Design. The stimuli set included 175 faces and 150 objects with neutral, positive, and negative emotional content. All images were unified in size and brightness and presented for 500 ms. The participants' task was to determine the emotional content of each stimulus. Each participant's EEG was recorded at 128 points and averaged in alignment with her responses. Six measures of ERP were recorded for each lead: three for faces with different emotional expressions, and three for objects with different emotional valences. Results. We discovered that the BDNF and HTR2A gene polymorphism does not affect the visual perception of emotionally charged stimuli as reflected in changes of ERR By contrast, participants in the COMT Mel-Met group differed from participants in groups COMT Val-Met and COMT Val-Val in that their event-related potential (ERPs) for both faces and objects were characterized by an increase in P300 amplitude in their frontal, temporal, and parietal areas, predominantly in the right hemisphere. The COMT Met-Met participants were less successful in differentiating stimuli by their emotional valence. Conclusion. The COMT gene mutation of the Met/Met type may lead to deficiencies in decision-making about the emotional valence of visual stimuli, as reflected in a substantial increase in the P300 response amplitude.

Brain imaging studies have shown that the inhibition of implicit stereotypes was dependent on this domain-general cognitive control mechanism. Based on this knowledge, the present study investigated the neural oscillatory correlates of implicit gender stereotype control in an extrinsic affective Simon task (EAST) using electrophysiological methods. Participants in this task conducted verification to white gender names and colored gender traits, and their behavioral response and electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded during their performances. As predicted, stereotype-inconsistent trials resulted in reduced response accuracies and slower response times than stereotype-consistent trials. For the event-related potential (ERP) results, the enhanced performance of stereotype-inconsistent trials was accompanied by an enhanced N400 amplitude but an attenuated late positive potential amplitude. In contrast, early attentional components such as P2 and N2 as well as their amplitudes were impacted by the experimental manipulations and individual differences in gender factors. In addition, based on time-frequency (TF) analysis, we found that the enhanced performance of stereotype-inconsistent trials was also accompanied by an event-related synchronization on the frontal theta oscillation. This frontal theta appeared at a late processing stage and persisted across a time window from N400 to late positive potential. Additionally, this enhanced frontal theta effect was not modulated by the experimental manipulations and individual differences in gender factors. Based on these findings, the feature of frontal theta oscillation in the implicit gender stereotype control process was discussed.

We present a novel approach using the word-by-word technique from improvisational theatre, in which two speakers jointly produce one sentence. This paradigm allows the assessment of behavioural aspects, such as turn-times, and electrophysiological responses, such as event-related-potentials (ERPs). Twenty-five participants constructed a cued but spontaneous four-word German sentence together with a confederate, taking turns for each word of the sentence. In 30% of the trials, the confederate uttered an unexpected gender-marked article. To complete the sentence in a meaningful way, the participant had to detect the violation and retrieve and utter a new fitting response. We found significant increases in response times after unexpected words and - despite allowing unscripted language production and naturally varying speech material - successfully detected significant N400 and P600 ERP effects for the unexpected word. The N400 EEG activity further significantly predicted the response time of the subsequent turn. Our results show that combining behavioural and neuroscientific measures of verbal interactions while retaining sufficient experimental control is possible, and that this combination provides promising insights into the mechanisms of spontaneous spoken dialogue.

The aim of the present study was to investigate neural processes underlying this differentiating ability by applying a simultaneous neuroscientific approach in order to gain both electrophysiological (via electroencephalography, EEG) and vascular (via functional near-infrared-spectroscopy, fNIRS) responses. Pseudowords conforming to angry, happy, and neutral prosody were presented acoustically to participants using a passive listening paradigm in order to capture implicit mechanisms of emotional prosody processing. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) revealed a larger P200 and an increased late positive potential (LPP) for happy prosody as well as larger negativities for angry and neutral prosody compared to happy prosody around 500ms. FNIRS results showed increased activations for angry prosody at right fronto-temporal areas. Correlation between negativity in the EEG and activation in fNIRS for angry prosody suggests analogous underlying processes resembling a negativity bias. Overall, results indicate that mechanisms of emotional and phonological encoding (P200), emotional evaluation (increased negativities) as well as emotional arousal and relevance (LPP) are present during implicit processing of emotional prosody.

This study presents an event-related potentials task (Brainy-ERP) that was developed in order to investigate the electrophysiological correlates of first-, second-, and third-order cognitive and affective ToM processing. The task was based on social visual cues and involved electroencephalographic event-related potential (ERP) analyses and exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography analyses (eLORETA) source localization analyses. Results showed that in cognitive and affective conditions, first-order trials elicited greater Anterior P2 (180-370 ms) amplitudes. In the cognitive condition, third-order trials elicited greatest amplitudes in the broadly distributed early negative slow wave (eNSW, 260-470 ms) and the late NSW (LNSW, 460-1,000 ms). In the affective condition, third-order and second-order trials elicited greatest amplitudes in a broadly distributed NSW (250-1,000 ms). Regarding affective trials in the NSW time span, statistical significant differences and trends were shown regarding activation of underlying brain regions. Third-order trials elicited greatest activation in a number of regions typically associated with the ToM network, especially the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), cuneus, and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Furthermore, ToM low performers (participants with high accuracy but longer reaction times) showed by trend smaller Posterior N1 and significantly smaller eNSW amplitudes compared to average and high performers. This study offers new insights into electrophysiological correlates of basic and higher order cognitive and affective ToM processing and its precise time course.

ER success may be influenced by processes relating to the anticipation (prior to active regulation) and implementation (during active regulation) of ER strategy use. We investigated whether brain activity patterns recorded using electroencephalography (EEG) during the first second of anticipation and implementation of two ER strategies-distraction and reappraisal-were related to regulation success. Participants viewed negative images that evoked disgust and sadness. Before each image was presented, participants were cued to either passively view the image or decrease their emotional responses. ER success scores were calculated from subsequent self-reported disgust and sadness ratings. Using multivariate support vector regression, ER success scores were predicted from spatiotemporal patterns of event-related potentials during the first second of anticipation and implementation phases of each ER strategy. For both sadness and disgust, reappraisal success could be predicted during anticipation, while distraction success could be predicted during implementation. These findings suggest that early anticipatory cognitive processes are a key determinant of reappraisal success, but may not be similarly important for distraction. This may be because reappraisal is more cognitively demanding than distraction, requiring enhanced preparation of mental resources.

However, the large amount of data lead to longer data processing time, and few studies were done on single channel data about AHA. This study investigated whether single channel's data can be used to identify AHAs from healthy controls (HCs) accurately. Two groups of age-, education-, and gender-matched adults (22 AHAs, 21 HCs) performed on the gambling task. ERP features and behavior features were used to classify. For discriminating AHAs and HCs, ReliefF and SVM-RFE were applied for feature selection, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) were used to search the optimal classification model of Support Vector Machine (SVM). We analyzed the statistical significance of all the features and obtained the classification result of different stimulation conditions. In statistics, we found that AHAs were significantly different from HCs in the amplitude of P300, ERP's mean value and ERP's variance under the monetary stimulation. For large money stimulation, P300 power in delta band and N100 power in delta band had significant difference between AHAs and HCs. Combining feature sorting algorithms and optimization algorithms, the results indicated that optimal performance was achieved by using ReliefF and GA. Use the above method, the best accuracy is 86.04% in four kind (+99, +9, -9, -99) of stimulation. This is the first study that used single channel's ERP data to identify AHAs with HCs, our study provided a new insight and objective method for the rapid diagnosis of AHAs.

The sessions were eight hours apart, participants performed the same tasks in an early and a late session. For the late session fEEGrid data were concurrently recorded with traditional cap EEG data.Main results.Our analyses show that typical event-related potentials responses were captured reliably by the fEEGrid. Single-trial analyses revealed that classification was possible above chance level for auditory and tactile oddball paradigms. We also found that the signal quality remained high and impedances did not deteriorate, but instead improved over the course of the day. Regarding wearing comfort, all participants indicated that the fEEGrid was comfortable to wear and did not cause any pain even after 8 h of wearing it.Significance.We show in this report, that high quality EEG signals can be captured with the fEEGrid reliably, even in long-term recording scenarios and with a signal quality that may be considered suitable for online brain-computer Interface applications.

Functional neuroimaging shows diffusely increased activity in the visual cortex, consistent with inefficient visual processing in HD. The temporal locus of these inefficiencies in HD is unknown. This study examined the temporal unfolding of visual event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to help better define the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying visual dysfunction in HD. Thirty-three individuals with HD and 35 healthy controls (HC) were assessed using a 64-channel EEG during a modified flanker task. Permutation-controlled analyses were conducted to detect group differences in visual evoked ERPs on a millisecond-to-millisecond basis. Bayesian ANCOVAs and linear regressions that included hoarding and age were conducted to identify the best-fit model for the identified VEPs, compared to a null model that included depression and anxiety severity. Three temporal regions (175 ms, 270 ms, and 440 ms), showed differences in amplitude between HD and HC and were consistent with ERP components N1, P1/N2, and a late negative slow wave (LNSW), respectively. After controlling for depression and anxiety, HD demonstrated an enhanced ERP amplitude at N1 and an attenuated amplitude in LNSW compared to HC but did not show differences at P1/N2. For the N1 and LNSW, there was also a primary effect of the interaction between hoarding and age. This study indicates that altered visuocortical reactivity in HD first occurs at the level of visuocortical processing after 170 ms, indicating alterations of middle and later, but not early, processing in occipitotemporal visual cortex.

Methods In 45 subjects with age-appropriate normal olfactory capacity (NP) and 20 anosmics (AN), oCSERP (stimulation by hydrogen sulphide, H2S 6 ppm and phenylethyl alcohol, PEA 30 % v/v,) and tCSERP (irritation with CO2 20-60 % v/v, intensity standardized) were derived by default. Two investigators categorized the averaged EEG curves in: CSERP recognizable, no CSERP recognizable and artefact. Investigator 1 knew whether the subject was a NP or an AN, and which stimulants was used, whereas investigator 2 lacked this information. Results AN needed higher trigeminal stimulus concentrations but showed same intensity ratings compared to NP. The attention (tracking game) did not deteriorate in the course of test. The detection rate of H2S-CSERP was higher than that of PEA-CSERP. The match of H2S-CSERP detection rates between the two investigators was higher than that of PEA-CSERP and CO2-CSERP. Conclusion For the standard derivation of oCSERP, stimulation with H2S is usually sufficient. Stimulation with PEA and CO2 as well as a blinded investigator is not necessary.

Accordingly, this study sought to identify neural activities correlating with emotional states in the source space. We employed independent component analysis, followed by a source localization method, to obtain distinct neural activities from EEG signals. After the identification of seven independent component (IC) clusters in a k-means clustering analysis, group-level regression analyses using frequency band power of the ICs were performed based on Russell's valence-arousal model. As a result, in the regression of the valence level, an IC cluster located in the cuneus predicted both high- and low-valence states and two other IC clusters located in the left precentral gyrus and the precuneus predicted the low-valence state. In the regression of the arousal level, the IC cluster located in the cuneus predicted both high- and low-arousal states and two posterior IC clusters located in the cingulate gyrus and the precuneus predicted the high-arousal state. In this proof-of-concept study, we revealed neural activities correlating with specific emotional states across participants, despite individual differences in emotional processing.

However, whether and how anticipatory reward and risk processing are dissociable in terms of temporal dynamics remain ambiguous. The current event-related potential (ERP) study addressed this issue in a card-guessing task where participants were presented sequentially two cards from a deck of nine (numbered 1 through 9) and were instructed to bet whether the second card was higher or lower than the first one. Expected reward and risk were manipulated orthogonally (in an uncorrelated way) over a full range of reward probabilities (every 12.5% from 0% to 100%). We focused on three anticipatory ERP components: the cue-related reward positivity (cue-RewP), the cue-related P3 (cue-P3), and the stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN). During the period after presentation of the first card, the cue-RewP was sensitive to expected reward instead of risk, whereas the cue-P3 was mainly sensitive to risk and to a lesser extent to expected reward. During the waiting period for the second card, the SPN was sensitive to expected reward but not to risk. Our findings indicate a partial neural dissociation between expected reward and risk in the anticipatory phase of reward processing.

J	Jayarathne, I; Cohen, M; Amarakeerthi, S				Jayarathne, Isuru; Cohen, Michael; Amarakeerthi, Senaka			Person identification from EEG using various machine learning techniques with inter-hemispheric amplitude ratio	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ASYMMETRY; BRAIN; IMAGERY; CORTEX; TASKS	Association between electroencephalography (EEG) and individually personal information is being explored by the scientific community. Though person identification using EEG is an attraction among researchers, the complexity of sensing limits using such technologies in real-world applications. In this research, the challenge has been addressed by reducing the complexity of the brain signal acquisition and analysis processes. This was achieved by reducing the number of electrodes, simplifying the critical task without compromising accuracy. Event-related potentials (ERP), a.k.a. time-locked stimulation, was used to collect data from each subject's head. Following a relaxation period, each subject was visually presented a random four-digit number and then asked to think of it for 10 seconds. Fifteen trials were conducted with each subject with relaxation and visual stimulation phases preceding each mental recall segment. We introduce a novel derived feature, dubbed Inter-Hemispheric Amplitude Ratio (IHAR), which expresses the ratio of amplitudes of laterally corresponding electrode pairs. The feature was extracted after expanding the training set using signal augmentation techniques and tested with several machine learning (ML) algorithms, including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN). Most of the ML algorithms showed 100% accuracy with 14 electrodes, and according to our results, perfect accuracy can also be achieved using fewer electrodes. However, AF3, AF4, F7, and F8 electrode combination with kNN classifier which yielded 99.0 +/- 0.8% testing accuracy is the best for person identification to maintain both user-friendliness and performance. Surprisingly, the relaxation phase manifested the highest accuracy of the three phases.

Evidence to support diagnostic decisions on coma and other DoC is limited but accumulating. This guideline provides the state-of-the-art evidence regarding the diagnosis of DoC, summarizing data from bedside examination techniques, functional neuroimaging and electroencephalography (EEG). Methods Sixteen members of the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) Scientific Panel on Coma and Chronic Disorders of Consciousness, representing 10 European countries, reviewed the scientific evidence for the evaluation of coma and other DoC using standard bibliographic measures. Recommendations followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The guideline was endorsed by the EAN. Results Besides a comprehensive neurological examination, the following suggestions are made: probe for voluntary eye movements using a mirror; repeat clinical assessments in the subacute and chronic setting, using the Coma Recovery Scale - Revised; use the Full Outline of Unresponsiveness score instead of the Glasgow Coma Scale in the acute setting; obtain clinical standard EEG; search for sleep patterns on EEG, particularly rapid eye movement sleep and slow-wave sleep; and, whenever feasible, consider positron emission tomography, resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), active fMRI or EEG paradigms and quantitative analysis of high-density EEG to complement behavioral assessment in patients without command following at the bedside. Conclusions Standardized clinical evaluation, EEG-based techniques and functional neuroimaging should be integrated for multimodal evaluation of patients with DoC. The state of consciousness should be classified according to the highest level revealed by any of these three approaches.

If this is true, then nature exposure may modulate the error-related negativity (ERN), a component of the event-related brain potential (ERP) that is related to cognitive control and attentional allocation. ART suggests that cognitive resources are restored because the cognitive control networks of the brain are less engaged in nature, suggesting that the ERN may decrease in nature. In the present study, we completed a registered report, examining whether or not spending time in nature would reduce the size of the ERN compared to outdoor testing. Instead, we found that nature significantly increased the amplitude of the ERN. The implications of these results are discussed within the ART framework.

Although much evidence has shown that emotional arousal has an impact on memory retention, little is known about how emotional arousal would influence the retrieval practice effect. To answer this question, the current study used emotional pictures as a context to induce the emotional arousal for restudy or retrieval practice. A Remember/Know paradigm was used in the final test with EEG recordings to examine how the impact of emotional arousal on retrieval practice effect would be reflected in familiarity or recollection. Behavioral results showed that the remembrance was enhanced by the retrieval practice compared to the restudy under both neutral and emotional contexts. Consistently, a parietal old/new effect from 500 to 800 ms was only found for the retrieval practice but not for the restudy condition under both neutral and emotional contexts. These findings indicated that retrieval practice could enhance later recollection when compared to restudy irrespective of emotional or neutral contexts.

It is unclear whether such modulations can be observed if one only imagines stimuli to be socially relevant. In a preregistered EEG study (N = 40), participants were presented neutral, positive and negative personality-descriptive adjectives, and given a subsequent feedback revealing whether or not the adjective described their personality. While it was emphasized that feedback occurred randomly, participants were asked either to treat the feedback information as randomly chosen or to imagine it represented a veridical social feedback. Imagined social context increased EPN, P3, and LPP amplitudes to feedback. Importantly, social context and emotional content interacted, resulting in enhanced processing of imagined social negative feedback for the N1 and EPN. These results demonstrate that social attributions can easily be elicited by instructions, modulating early and late processing stages, speaking for a strong affiliation motive.

The end user is presented with flashing stimuli that indicate selections for communication, control, or both. Counting each flash that corresponds to a specific target selection while ignoring other flashes will elicit P300s to only the target selection. P300 BCIs also have been implemented using auditory or tactile stimuli. P300 BCIs have been used with a variety of applications for severely disabled end users in their homes without frequent expert support.

Frontal cortex selectively overrides auditory processing to bias perception for looming sonic motion	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Auditory event-related potentials CERPs); EEG; Looming vs. receding sounds; Perceptual anisotropy	BOUNDARY-ELEMENT METHOD; TRANSFER ENTROPY; SOUND; EEG; MODEL; REPRESENTATIONS; CONNECTIVITY; INFORMATION; INTENSITY; RESPONSES	Rising intensity sounds signal approaching objects traveling toward an observer. A variety of species preferentially respond to looming over receding auditory motion, reflecting an evolutionary perceptual bias for recognizing approaching threats. We probed the neural origins of this stark perceptual anisotropy to reveal how the brain creates privilege for auditory looming events. While recording neural activity via electroencephalography (EEG), human listeners rapidly judged whether dynamic (intensity varying) tones were looming or receding in percept. Behaviorally, listeners responded faster to auditory looms confirming a perceptual bias for approaching signals. EEG source analysis revealed sensory activation localized to primary auditory cortex (PAC) and decision-related activity in prefrontal cortex (PFC) within 200 ms after sound onset followed by additional expansive PFC activation by 500 ms. Notably, early PFC (but not PAC) activity rapidly differentiated looming and receding stimuli and this effect roughly co-occurred with sound arrival in auditory cortex. Brain-behavior correlations revealed an association between PFC neural latencies and listeners' speed of sonic motion judgments. Directed functional connectivity revealed stronger information flow from PFC -> PAC during looming vs. receding sounds. Our electrophysiological data reveal a critical, previously undocumented role of prefrontal cortex in judging dynamic sonic motion. Both faster neural bias and a functional override of obligatory sensory processing via selective, directional PFC signaling toward auditory system establish the perceptual privilege for approaching looming sounds.

It is usually electroencephalogram (EEG) based and uses motor imagery (MI) in its operation. EEG signals are known for being nonstationary and are sensitive to artifacts from various sources such as the physical and mental state of the patient, their mood, their posture, and any external noise or distractions, etc. Processing of this data directly affects the classification accuracy, making it a critical step in any BCI system. Ensemble learning has been used for many kinds of BCI classification applications including MI and P300 event related potential, which has been proven to be robust. The purpose of this paper is to generate an algorithm that uses ensemble pruning method for EEG classification evoked by an MI task. In order to achieve this, we extracted the features of an EEG dataset and trained a range of support vector machines to make a diverse ensemble of classifiers. This ensemble is then pruned by using a novel optimization model by a difference of convex algorithm, which has not been used on EEG data before.

To investigate the role of hemispheric asymmetries in these processes, 49 right- and 50 left-handers completed a tachistoscopic Go/Nogo task with positive and negative emotional faces while ERPs were recorded. Frontal resting state EEG asymmetry was assessed as a marker of individual differences in prefrontal inhibitory networks. Results supported a dependency of inhibitory processing on early lateralized processes. As expected, right-handers showed a stronger N170 over the right hemisphere, and better response inhibition when faces were projected to the right hemisphere. Left-handers showed a stronger N170 over the left hemisphere, and no behavioural asymmetry. Asymmetries in response inhibition were also valence-dependent, with better inhibition of responses to negative faces when projected to the right, and better inhibition of responses to positive faces when projected to the left hemisphere. Frontal asymmetry was not related to handedness, but did modulate response inhibition depending on valence. Consistent with the asymmetric inhibition model (Grimshaw & Carmel, 2014), greater right frontal activity was associated with better response inhibition to positive than to negative faces; subjects with greater left frontal activity showed an opposite trend. These findings highlight the interplay between bottom-up and top-down processes in explaining hemispheric asymmetries in response inhibition.

Virtual Reality (VR) technology enables users to interact with computer-generated simulated environments and to provide multi-modal sensory feedback. Using VR systems can, however, be error-prone. In this paper, we investigate the presence of ErrPs when Virtual Reality users face 3 types of visualization errors: (Te) tracking errors when manipulating virtual objects, (Fe) feedback errors, and (Be) background anomalies. We conducted an experiment in which 15 participants were exposed to the 3 types of errors while performing a center-out pick and place task in virtual reality. The results showed that tracking errors generate error-related potentials, the other types of errors did not generate such discernible patterns. In addition, we show that it is possible to detect the ErrPs generated by tracking losses in single trial, with an accuracy of 85%. This constitutes a first step towards the automatic detection of error-related potentials in VR applications, paving the way to the design of adaptive and self-corrective VR/AR applications by exploiting information directly from the user's brain.

J	Son, G				Son, Guiyoung			Morpheme Analysis Associated with German Noun Plural Endings among Second Language (L2) Learners Using Event-Related Potentials (ERPs)	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						event-related potentials (ERPs); second language learning; electroencephalogram (EEG); left anterior negativity (LAN); P600; N400; German plural endings; Dual Mechanism Model	BRAIN POTENTIALS; LANGUAGE; INTEGRATION	This paper aims to examine the morpho-syntactic process of noun plural endings, "-n" and "-s", in adult second language (L2) learners using event-related potentials (ERPs). German noun plural endings consist of many inflectional forms. They are one of the difficulties faced by German L2 learners. We recorded an electroencephalogram (EEG) study of German L2 learners by dividing study subjects into low and high L2 learners according to the learning level. We examined what ERP components were associated with L2 language processing. All participants were Korean German L2 learners who had achieved varying levels of proficiency. As a result of our analysis, we confirmed different morpho-syntactic processing between the two groups. First, N400 was detected at any learning level. It confirmed language processing supportive of the Full-Listing Model for irregular endings. Second, we confirmed left anterior negativity (LAN), as detected in both low and high proficiency L2 learners. LAN is supportive of a Full-Parsing Model for regular endings, as it was detected in both low and high proficiency L2 learners. However, P600 was detected in highly proficient L2 learners only. It implies that high proficiency learners differ from low proficiency L2 learners. P600 is processed in a reparsing process after recognition of grammatical errors. Based on this result, more active use of a Dual Mechanism Model is possible as learning levels improve. It confirms that improvement in L2 learners results in an approach to cognitive processing similar to that of German first language (L1) speakers.

Among them, the N2 and N2pc components have been demonstrated to be a measure of subjects' allocation of visual attention to possible targets and to be involved in the suppression of irrelevant items. Unfortunately, the N2 and N2pc components have smaller amplitudes compared with those of the background electroencephalogram (EEG), and their measurement requires employing techniques such as conventional averaging, which in turn necessitates several sweeps to provide acceptable estimates. In visual search studies, the number of sweeps (Nswp) used to extrapolate reliable estimates of N2/N2pc components has always been somehow arbitrary, with studies using 50-500 sweeps.In-silicostudies relying on synthetic data providing a close-to-realistic fit to the variability of the visual N2 component and background EEG signals are therefore needed to go beyond arbitrary choices in this context.Approach. In the present work, we sought to take a step in this direction by developing a simulator of ERP variations in the N2 time range based on real experimental data while monitoring variations in the estimation accuracy of N2/N2pc components as a function of two factors, i.e. signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and number of averaged sweeps.Main results.The results revealed that bothNswpand SNR had a strong impact on the accuracy of N2/N2pc estimates. Critically, the present simulation showed that, for a given level of SNR, a non-arbitraryNswpcould be parametrically determined, after which no additional significant improvements in noise suppression and N2/N2pc accuracy estimation were observed.Significance.The present simulator is thought to provide investigators with quantitative guidelines for designing experimental protocols aimed at improving the detection accuracy of N2/N2pc components. The parameters of the simulator can be tuned, adapted, or integrated to fit other ERP modulations.

It is often accompanied by a lack of emotional responsiveness and sometimes memory fragmentation. Studies haze shown the temporary occurrence of this condition among 34-70% of the general population during their life span. However, if the symptoms become consistent, they can be intolerable and can profoundly affect the quality of life in such an extent that it would be considered as one type of the dissociative disorders, depersonalisation disorder (DPD). Currently, there is no laboratory method to diagnose DPD, and studies have expressed a period of seven to 12 years for the correct diagnosis of DPD. We recently aimed to investigate DPD and its symptoms based on inexpensive and convenient electroencephalogram (EEG) neuroimaging technique, using calculation of event-related-potentials (ERPs) over the somatosensory cortex. We showed that DPD symptoms could he as a result of impairment in early (implicit) stages of information processing in the brain. We also introduced P45 as a potential electrophysiological biomarker to study DPD. In this paper, we first replicated our results and then used P45 as a feature to discriminate between individuals with high and low tendency to DPD symptoms. We used Continuous Dynamic Time Warping (CDTW) to address the possible time shift and distortion in the ERP signals and to reach better classification performance. We reached 85% accuracy (Kappa 0.7) using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, which confirms the feasibility for discrimination between DPD patients and a control group using EEG signals.

Personality Traits and Emotional Word Recognition: An ERP Study	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Extraversion; Neuroticism; Impulsivity; Anxiety; Emotional words; Event-related potentials	TIME-COURSE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; EXTROVERSION; AROUSAL; NEUROTICISM; ADJECTIVES; VALENCE; ATTENTION; COMPONENT; MOOD	Recent research has investigated how personality trait differences influence the processing of emotion conveyed by pictures, but limited research has examined the emotion conveyed by words. The present study investigated whether extraversion (extroverts vs. introverts) and neuroticism (high neurotics vs. low neurotics) influence the processing of positive, neutral, and negative words that were matched for arousal. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from healthy participants while they performed a lexical decision task. We found that personality traits influenced emotional word recognition at N400 (300-450 ms) and LPC (450-800 ms). At the earlier (N400) stage, the more extraverted and neurotic a participant was, the more reduced the N400s for the positive words relative to neutral words were. This suggests that the extroverts and high neurotics (i.e., high impulsivity) identified positive content in words during lexical feature retrieval, which facilitated such retrieval. At the later (LPC) stage, both the introverts and high neurotics (i.e., high anxiety) showed greater LPCs to negative than neutral words, indicating their sustained attention and elaborative processing of negative information. These results suggest that extraversion and neuroticism collectively influence different stages of emotional word recognition in a way that is consistent with Gray's biopsychological theory of personality.

Neural Correlates of Own- and Other-Face Perception in Body Dysmorphic Disorder	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						body dysmorphic disorder; own-face perception; face inversion effect; event-related potentials; electroencephalography	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; INVERSION; RECOGNITION; ABNORMALITIES; INFORMATION; SHAPE; DISCRIMINATION; ACQUISITION; APPEARANCE; INVENTORY	Background Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is characterized by an excessive preoccupation with one or more perceived flaws in one's own appearance. Previous studies provided evidence for deficits in configural and holistic processing in BDD. Preliminary evidence suggests abnormalities at an early stage of visual processing. The present study is the first examining early neurocognitive perception of the own face in BDD by using electroencephalography (EEG). We investigated the face inversion effect, in which inverted (upside-down) faces are disproportionately poorly processed compared to upright faces. This effect reflects a disruption of configural and holistic processing, and in consequence a preponderance of featural face processing. Methods We recorded face-sensitive event-related potentials (ERPs) in 16 BDD patients and 16 healthy controls, all unmedicated. Participants viewed upright and inverted (upside-down) images of their own face and an unfamiliar other face, each in two facial emotional expressions (neutral vs. smiling). We calculated the early ERP components P100, N170, P200, N250, and the late positive component (LPC), and compared amplitudes among both groups. Results In the early P100, no face inversion effects were found in both groups. In the N170, both groups exhibited the common face inversion effects, with significantly larger N170 amplitudes for inverted than upright faces. In the P200, both groups exhibited larger inversion effects to other (relative to own) faces, with larger P200 amplitudes for other upright than inverted faces. In the N250, no significant group differences were found in face processing. In the LPC, both groups exhibited larger inversion effects to other (relative to own) faces, with larger LPC amplitudes for other inverted than upright faces. These overall patterns appeared to be comparable for both groups. Smaller inversion effects to own (relative to other) faces were observed in none of these components in BDD, relative to controls. Conclusions The findings suggest no evidence for abnormalities at all levels of early face processing in our observed sample of BDD patients. Further research should investigate the neural substrates underlying BDD symptomatology.

This effect is one of the many cognitive distortions that can occur during gambling games. The main objective of the present study was to analyze the electrophysiological correlates of the near-miss effect via an event-related potential (ERP) study examining four distinct gambling outcomes: win, full miss, near-miss before the payline, and near-miss after the payline. This study comprised 23 healthy voluntary participants (10 women) with ages ranging between 19 and 34 years (M = 22.5; SD = 3.65). All participants completed the South Oaks Gambling Screen and played a computerized slot machine, programed to induce the near-miss effect and specifically designed for an ERP study. By splitting the near-miss effect in two subtypes (before and after the payline), increased feedback-related negativity (FRN) was found for the near-misses after the payline in comparison to losses and also to near-misses before the payline. Results also indicated an increased P300 amplitude for the near-misses before the payline compared both with losses and with near-misses after the payline. The results suggest that both FRN and P300 present different sensitivities to near-miss subtypes, suggesting a payline effect that is not demonstrated when the data of near-misses before and after the payline are analyzed together. This is the first study to analyze the effect of the near-miss subtype in an ERP study and confirms the findings of previous behavioral studies.

In recent years, brain-computer interface (BCI) systems based on electroencephalography (EEG) have developed rapidly. However, the decoding of voluntary finger pre-movements from EEG is still a challenge for BCIs. This study aimed to analyze the pre-movement EEG features in time and frequency domains and design an efficient method to decode the movement-related patterns. Approach. In this study, we first investigated the EEG features induced by the intention of left and right finger movements. Specifically, the movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) and event-related desynchronization (ERD) features were extracted using discriminative canonical pattern matching (DCPM) and common spatial patterns (CSP), respectively. Then, the two types of features were classified by two fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) classifiers, respectively. Their decision values were further assembled to facilitate the classification. To verify the validity of the proposed method, a private dataset containing 12 subjects and a public dataset from BCI competition II were used for estimating the classification accuracy. Main results. As a result, for the private dataset, the combination of DCPM and CSP achieved an average accuracy of 80.96%, which was 5.08% higher than the single DCPM method (p < 0.01) and 10.23% higher than the single CSP method (p < 0.01). Notably, the highest accuracy could achieve 91.5% for the combination method. The test accuracy of dataset IV of BCI competition II was 90%, which was equal to the best result in the existing literature. Significance. The results demonstrate the MRCP and ERD features of pre-movements contain significantly discriminative information, which are complementary to each other, and thereby could be well recognized by the proposed combination method of DCPM and CSP. Therefore, this study provides a promising approach for the decoding of pre-movement EEG patterns, which is significant for the development of BCIs.

Group-level ERP analysis and single-trial and single-subject classification are performed on four stages of the task (information encoding, retrieval, old/new decision formation, and evaluative feedback processing). The study shows that decision confidence is significantly reflected on a group, as well as on a single-trial basis, in all investigated stages at the neural level, except during encoding. The most pronounced differences between high and low confidence can be found in the ERPs during feedback presentation after a correct answer, whereas almost no differences can be found following a wrong answers. In the feedback stage, the two levels of confidence can be separated with classification accuracies of up to 70 % on average, therefore showing potential to be used as a control state in a BCI application.

Parkinson's disease is associated with impaired ability to recognize emotional facial expressions. In addition to a visual processing disorder, a visual recognition disorder may be involved in these patients. Pareidolia is a type of complex visual illusion that permits the interpretation of a vague stimulus as something known to the observer. Parkinson's patients experience pareidolic illusions. N170 and N250 waveforms are two event-related potentials (ERPs) involved in emotional facial expression recognition. Objective. In this study, we investigated how Parkinson's patients process face and face-pareidolia stimuli at the neural level using N170, vertex positive potential (VPP), and N250 components of event-related potentials. Methods. To examine the response of face and face-pareidolia processing in Parkinson's patients, we measured the N170, VPP, and N250 components of the event-related brain potentials in a group of 21 participants with Parkinson's disease and 26 control participants. Results. We found that the latencies of N170 and VPP responses to both face and face-pareidolia stimuli were increased along with their amplitudes, and the amplitude of N250 responses decreased in Parkinson's patients compared to the control group. In both control and Parkinson's patients, face stimuli generated greater ERP amplitude and shorter latency in responses than did face-pareidolia stimuli. Conclusion. The results of our study showed that ERPs associated with face and also face-pareidolia stimuli processing are changed in early-stage neurophysiological activity in the temporoparietal cortex of Parkinson's patients.

Time of day differences in neural reward responsiveness in children	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						children; ERP; reward positivity; rewards; time of day	LATE CHILDHOOD; AGE; COMPONENT; PCA; NEUROSCIENCE; NEGATIVITY; SYMPTOMS; MOOD; SEX	The Reward Positivity ( increment RewP) event-related potential (ERP), generally quantified as the difference between neural responsiveness to monetary gains (RewP-Gain) and losses (RewP-Loss) is commonly used as an index of neural reward responsiveness. Despite the popularity of this ERP component in studies of reward processing, knowledge about the role of state-related influences on the increment RewP is limited. The present study examined whether increment RewP amplitudes may differ based on when during the day they are assessed and whether age or sex would moderate this link. Participants were 188 children between the ages of 7 and 11 (47.3% female) without a lifetime history of a major depressive disorder or any anxiety disorder recruited from the community. Children completed the Doors task during which continuous electroencephalography was recorded to isolate the increment RewP. To better isolate this ERP component from other temporally or spatially overlapping ERPs, we used temporospatial principal component analysis. We found that time of day (ToD) differences in the increment RewP amplitude varied based on children's age. Specifically, older, compared to younger, children exhibited stronger responses to gains versus losses between 11:15 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. and after around 5:15 p.m. Further, these age-related differences appeared to be driven specifically by older children's reduced neural responsiveness to losses. The findings have methodological implications by highlighting the importance of accounting for the ToD at which increment RewP-focused study sessions are conducted as well as for demographic characteristics of the participants, such as their age.

However, this method is professional and complicated, and it is difficult to apply to daily sleep monitoring. This paper first designed a wearable EEG acquisition system based on TGAM module. 'Through the parameter initialization setting of the TGAM module and the Bluetooth module and the analysis of the communication protocol between the modules, the wearable EEG acquisition system was successfully built. Secondly, the extraction of different rhythm waves of EEG signals is realized by several FIR (Finite Impulse Response) bandpass filters. Principal component analysis was used to screen feature quantities. The related experiments were carried out by collecting the EEG signals of several testers through the new sensor TGAM. Finally, event-related potential analysis and event-related simultaneous analysis were used to complete the treatment of EEG segments and normal EEG segments of sleep apnea events, and normalized EEG was identified by normalized standard deviation analysis and triple normalized standard deviation analysis. The results show that the technical requirements of wearable EEG equipment can be met in terms of algorithm calculation and result performance, which can provide theoretical support for sleep monitoring.

J	Yue, K; Wang, DL				Yue, Kang; Wang, Danli			Investigating the neural activity of various 3D visual fatigue degrees using depth-related visual evoked potentials	JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION DISPLAY			English	Article						3D; EEG; visual fatigue	STIMULI; RESPONSES; STEREOGRAMS; ADAPTATION; MODULATION; DYNAMICS; NEURONS	Severe visual fatigue symptoms occur while users view three-dimensional (3D) content. These symptoms adversely affect the user experience and hinder the widespread application of 3D media. Existing studies mainly used electroencephalography (EEG) power (based on frequency domain analysis) to evaluate 3D visual fatigue (3DVF), but their results were often contradictory and confusing. To address this problem, we investigated the relationship between EEG features and visual fatigue from the perspective of both time and time-frequency domain. Random-dot stereograms (RDS) with various disparities were employed to elicit depth-related visual evoked potentials (VEPs). The experiment lasted about 27 min for each subject to induce fatigue, and the EEG was recorded synchronously. VEPs of different fatigue levels were processed to extract both time (such as P-120 and N-170 components in VEPs) and time-frequency (like event-related spectral perturbation [ERSP]) domain characteristics. A significant increase in P-120 amplitude was observed in the parietal region, and time-frequency analysis also revealed a significant ERSP decrease of theta bands in the central-frontal region with a latency of 200 to 300 ms when subjects suffered fatigue. Our results confirm the hypothesis that activity of theta decreased with 3DVF level, or rather, we found ERSPs of theta bands on FC4 and Cz in the 200- to 300-ms window decreased significantly across four fatigue levels. Furthermore, we first reported the relationship between P-120 amplitude and 3DVF, which implied this feature could be considered as a feature of 3DVF evaluation. In summary, our studies could provide a new insight for 3DVF evaluation using EEG.

Neural Field Theory of Evoked Response Potentials With Attentional Gain Dynamics	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						corticothalamic system; neural field theory; evoked potentials; brain filters; synaptic gain adjustment; local feedback; attention; brain oscillations	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; ALPHA-BAND; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; MODEL; MODULATION; MECHANISMS	A generalized neural field model of large-scale activity in the corticothalamic system is used to predict standard evoked potentials. This model embodies local feedbacks that modulate the gains of neural activity as part of the response to incoming stimuli and thus enables both activity changes and effective connectivity changes to be calculated as parts of a generalized evoked response, and their relative contributions to be determined. The results show that incorporation of gain modulations enables a compact and physically justifiable description of the differences in gain between background-EEG and standard-ERP conditions, with the latter able to be initiated from the background state, rather than requiring distinct parameters as in earlier work. In particular, top-down gains are found to be reduced during an ERP, consistent with recent theoretical suggestions that the role of internal models is diminished in favor of external inputs when the latter change suddenly. The static-gain and modulated-gain system transfer functions are analyzed via control theory in terms of system resonances that were recently shown to implement data filtering whose gain adjustments can be interpreted as attention. These filters are shown to govern early and late features in standard evoked responses and their gain parameters are shown to be dynamically adjusted in a way that implements a form of attention. The results show that dynamically modulated resonant filters responsible for the low-frequency oscillations in an evoked potential response have different parameters than those responsible for low-frequency resting EEG responses, while both responses share similar mid- and high-frequency resonant filters. These results provide a biophysical mechanism by which oscillatory activity in the theta, alpha, and beta frequency ranges of an evoked response are modulated as reflections of attention; notably theta is enhanced and alpha suppressed during the latter parts of the ERP. Furthermore, the model enables the part of the ERP response induced by gain modulations to be estimated and interpreted in terms of attention.

This review summarized recent research on EEG characterization related to the cognitive and motor functions in PD patients and discussed its potential to be used as diagnostic biomarkers. Thirty papers out of 220 published from 2010 to 2020 were reviewed. Movement abnormalities and cognitive decline are related to changes in EEG spectrum and event-related potentials (ERPs) during typical oddball paradigms and/or combined motor tasks. Abnormalities in beta and delta frequency bands are, respectively the main manifestation of dyskinesia and cognitive decline in PD. The review showed that PD patients have noteworthy changes in specific EEG characterizations, however, the underlying mechanism of the interrelation between gait and cognitive is still unclear. Understanding the specific nature of the relationship is essential for development of novel invasive clinical diagnostic and therapeutic methods.

Recent studies claimed their detectability on the scalp surface. We aimed to investigate the applicability of high-frequency oscillation analysis to routine surface EEG obtained at an epilepsy monitoring unit. Methods:We retrospectively analyzed surface EEGs of 18 patients with focal epilepsy and six controls, recorded during sleep under maximal medication withdrawal. As a proof of principle, the occurrence of motor task-related events during wakefulness was analyzed in a subsample of six patients with seizure- or syncope-related motor symptoms. Ripples (80-250 Hz) and fast ripples (>250 Hz) were identified by semi-automatic detection. Using semi-parametric statistics, differences in spontaneous and task-related occurrence rates were examined within subjects and between diagnostic groups considering the factors diagnosis, brain region, ripple type, and task condition. Results:We detected high-frequency oscillations in 17 out of 18 patients and in four out of six controls. Results did not show statistically significant differences in the mean rates of event occurrences, neither regarding the laterality of the epileptic focus, nor with respect to active and inactive task conditions, or the moving hand laterality. Significant differences in general spontaneous incidence [WTS(1) = 9.594;p= 0.005] that indicated higher rates of fast ripples compared to ripples, notably in patients with epilepsy compared to the control group, may be explained by variations in data quality. Conclusion:The current analysis methods are prone to biases. A common agreement on a standard operating procedure is needed to ensure reliable and economic detection of high-frequency oscillations.

However, studies suggest that clinical measures may not be suitable to detect subtle alterations in functioning and are limited by numerous internal and external factors. Electroencephalography (EEG) has been used for over eight decades to discern altered function following illnesses and injuries, including traumatic brain injury. This study evaluated the associations between EEG measures and clinical presentation within three-months following SRC. A systematic review of the literature was performed in Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Web of Science databases following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses guidelines, yielding a total of 13 peer-reviewed articles. Most studies showed low to moderate bias and moderate to high quality. The majority of the existing literature on the impact of concussion within the first 3 months post-injury suggests that individuals with concussion show altered brain function, with EEG abnormalities outlasting clinical dysfunction. Of all EEG biomarkers evaluated, P300 shows the most promise and should be explored further. Despite the relatively high quality of included articles, significant limitations are still present within this body of literature, including potential conflicts of interest and proprietary algorithms, making it difficult to draw strong and meaningful conclusions on the use of EEG in the early stages of SRC. Therefore, further exploration of the relationship between EEG measures and acute clinical presentation is warranted to determine if EEG provides additional benefits over current clinical assessments and is a feasible tool in clinical settings.

Previous research demonstrated several cognitive impairments in dyspneic patients including an impairment in recognition memory. Even though some factors contributing to these impairments have already been identified (e.g., smoking, medication), the relevance of dyspnea as one of those contributing factors is still unclear. Thus, the goal of the current study was to investigate whether acute dyspnea impairs recognition memory in a picture recognition task as indexed by reduced accuracy and a reduced old-new effect in event-related potentials (ERPs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Fifty healthy participants underwent a passive encoding phase without dyspnea induction, followed by the picture recognition task performed during an unloaded baseline and a resistive load induced dyspnea condition while EEG was continuously measured. Results indicated comparable accuracy during the baseline and dyspnea condition. A reduced fronto-central old-new effect during dyspnea compared to baseline was found for ERPs in the latency ranges 350-500, 500-800, 800-1100, and 1110-1400 ms. These findings suggest that dyspnea influences the process of familiarity (350-500 ms) and recollection (500-800 ms) as well as post-retrieval processes (800-1100 and 1100-1400 ms), highlighting a potential impairing effect of acute dyspnea on recognition memory.

Whilst the majority of RSVP-BCI studies to date have concentrated on the identification of a single type of image, namely pictures, here we study the capability of RSVP-BCI to detect three different target image types: pictures, numbers and words. The impact of presentation duration (speed) i.e., 100-200 ms (5-10 Hz), 200-300 ms (3.3-5 Hz) or 300-400 ms (2.5-3.3 Hz), is also investigated. 2-way repeated measure ANOVA on accuracies of detecting targets from non-target stimuli (ratio 1:9) measured via area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUC) for N = 15 subjects revealed a significant effect of factor Stimulus-Type (pictures, numbers, words) (F (2,28) = 7.243, p = 0.003) and for Stimulus-Duration (F (2,28) = 5.591, p = 0.011). Furthermore, there is an interaction between stimulus type and duration: F (4,56) = 4.419, p = 0.004). The results indicate that when designing RSVP-BCI paradigms, the content of the images and the rate at which images are presented impact on the accuracy of detection and hence these parameters are key experimental variables in protocol design and applications, which apply RSVP for multimodal image datasets.

While these typically involve overt shifts of fixation, many past studies used covert attention shifts in which fixation is unchanged, meaning that some response components may result from the inhibition of eye movements. In this study, the neural events in the human brain when making overt shifts of attention are studied through the combination of event-related potential recording with simultaneous eye tracking. Fixation shifts under competition (central target remains visible when a peripheral target appears) were compared with noncompetition (central target disappears). A longer latency for competition compared with noncompetition, which is found in the saccadic response, is already present in the early occipital positivity when a single target is presented for the fixation shift. These results indicate that the requirement to disengage from a current target affects the time course of neural processing at an early level. However, the relation is more complex when the participant is required to choose which of two targets to fixate.

Research examining P300 in relation to adolescent depression is more inconsistent; most studies fail to find P300 differences between currently depressed adolescents and controls. Previous studies have not examined the potential predictive utility of P300 in regard to adolescent depression. Therefore, the current study investigated the relationship between P300 amplitude and depression symptoms at baseline and two years later in a sample of 199 female adolescents. At baseline, participants completed measures of depression, followed by a speeded response task (flanker) while EEG was recorded. Two years later, participants completed the same depression measures. Reduced baseline P300 predicted increases in depression at two-year follow-up. Baseline P300 related particularly to two-year anhedonia and negative self-esteem symptoms. Our study suggest that reduced P300 amplitude can be utilized as a potential risk marker for adolescents at risk for developing increases in depressive symptoms.

Mindfulness Improves Attention Resource Allocation During Response Inhibition in Older Adults	MINDFULNESS			English	Article						Mindfulness; Attention; Inhibitory control; Event-related potential; Cognitive training; Ageing; EEG; Sustained attention to response task	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; MIND; INTERFERENCE; NEUROSCIENCE; PERFORMANCE; ANTERIOR; SEARCH; LAPSES; P300	Objectives A core process trained during mindfulness is inhibitory control. A decline in inhibitory control is thought to underlie age-related cognitive declines. Electroencephalographic event-related potentials (ERPs) index both the speed and allocation of attentional resources, making them useful in assessing cognition in ageing. While mindfulness has been shown to improve attentional control, studies examining ageing cohorts are lacking. Here, we examine ERP changes during an inhibitory control task in older adults to assess the ability of mindfulness to enhance cognition in ageing. Methods A longitudinal RCT was conducted to examine the effect of an 8-week mindfulness training (MT) intervention on the N2 and P3 ERP components during the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) in healthy older adults aged over 60 years (n = 48). An active control computer-based attention training (CT) program (n = 27) designed to activate similar attentional components to mindfulness was used to determine if outcomes resulted from attention training or mindfulness-specific factors. Results While both the MT and CT groups displayed improved SART performance following the interventions (as indexed by errors of commission and reaction time coefficient of variation), only the MT group showed significant reductions in frontal P3 latency during response inhibition. Conclusions The results suggest that mindfulness may enhance the speed and efficiency of attentional processes, thus providing protective benefits against age-related cognitive decline.

CNVs (Contingent Negative Variations), ERDs or ERSs (Event-Related Desynchronizations/Synchronizations) as well as ErrPs (Error-Related Potentials) are particularly important components can be identified during motor tasks and related to specific events in a Coincident Timing (CT) task. This work investigates offline EEG signals acquired during an upper limb CT task and analyzes the task protocol with the purpose of correlating the aforementioned EEG features to movement onset. CNVs and ERD/ERS were successfully identified after averaging multiple trials, and it was further concluded that complementary information about muscle activity (via EMG) as well as video tracking of arm movement play a critical role in the synchronization of EEG components with movement onset. The framework for EEG analysis presented in this paper allows for future development of a BCI on top of this CT task capable of assessing motor learning and actuating an exoskeleton to enable faster motor rehabilitation.

Methods: 19 migraineurs between attacks and 19 matched control participants performed a task evaluating jointly top-down and bottom-up attention, using visually-cued target sounds and unexpected task-irrelevant distracting sounds. Behavioral responses and magneto- and electro-encephalography signals were recorded. Event-related potentials and fields were processed and source reconstruction was applied to event-related fields. Results: At the behavioral level, neither top-down nor bottom-up attentional processes appeared to be altered in migraine. However, migraineurs presented heightened evoked responses following distracting sounds (orienting component of the N1 and Re-Orienting Negativity, RON) and following target sounds (orienting component of the N1), concomitant to an increased recruitment of the right temporoparietal junction. They also displayed an increased effect of the cue informational value on target processing resulting in the elicitation of a negative difference (Nd). Conclusions: Migraineurs appear to display increased bottom-up orienting response to all incoming sounds, and an enhanced recruitment of top-down attention. Significance: The interictal state in migraine is characterized by an exacerbation of the orienting response to attended and unattended sounds. These attentional alterations might participate to the peculiar vulnerability of the migraine brain to all incoming stimuli. (C) 2020 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Since there are no clear biomarkers for the disorder, this study aimed to investigate the neurophysiological biomarkers for deficits in executive function in children with ADHD using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography. Methods: Twenty patients diagnosed with ADHD and 19 typically developing children (TDC; 8-11 years old) were included. Event related potentials (ERPs) were recorded using an electroencephalogram (EEG) and oxygenated hemoglobin concentrations (Oxy-Hb) were recorded using fNIRS during a colored Go/NoGo task, simultaneously. Latencies and amplitudes of NoGo-N2 and NoGo/Go-P3 tasks were measured using EEG. Results: Children with ADHD showed significantly decreased Oxy-Hb in the right frontal cortex as well as longer NoGo-P3 latencies and a decreased NoGo/Go-P3 amplitude. There was a significant positive correlation between the Oxy-Hb and NoGo/ Go-P3 amplitude. Conclusions: These results suggest that children with ADHD experience executive dysfunction. Hemodynamic and electrophysiological findings during the Go/NoGo task might be useful as a biomarker of executive function. Significance: These findings have key implications for understanding the pathophysiology of deficits in executive function in ADHD. (C) 2020 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

We combined behavioral measures with EEG to examine implicit and explicit recognition of words previously introduced with or without meaning in an incidental learning task. Participants (8-11-year-old children) were not able to recognize previously introduced nonsense words and better performance on the learning task resulted in poorer word recognition. The N400 amplitude differed between nonsense words with meaning versus nonsense words no meaning and novel nonsense words. Results indicate that introducing a nonsense word with meaning does not aid in explicit word learning but improves implicit word learning.

Currently, self-reported pain is the main criterion used by clinicians assessing patients with pain. However, it is subjective, and multiple factors can affect pain levels. In this study, we investigated the neural correlates of FM pain using conditioned pain modulation (CPM), electroencephalography (EEG), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Methods. - In this cross-sectional neurophysiological analysis of a randomized, double-blind controlled trial, 36 patients with flbromyatgia were included. We analyzed CPM, EEG variables and TMS measures and their correlation with pain levels as measured by a visual analog scale. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to identify the predictors of pain severity. Results. -We found: (1) no association between pain levels and CPM; (2) an association between reduced alpha and beta power over the central region in resting-EEG and higher pain levels; (3) an association between smaller event-related desynchronization (ERD) responses in theta and delta bands over the central region and higher pain levels; (4) an association between smaller ERD responses in theta and delta bands and smaller intracortical inhibition and higher intracortical facilitation ratios; (5) an association between smaller ERD responses in delta band and reduced CPM. Conclusions. - Our results do not support CPM as a biomarker for pain intensity in FM. However, our specific EEG findings showing the relationship between pain, CPM and TMS measures suggest that FM leads to a disruption of inhibitory neural modulators and thus support CPM as a likely predictive marker of disrupted pain modulation system. These neurophysiological markers need to be further explored in potential future trials as to find novel targets for the treatment of FM. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Many symptoms of FXS overlap with those in autism including repetitive behaviors, language delays, anxiety, social impairments and sensory processing deficits. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from humans with FXS and an animal model, theFmr1knockout (KO) mouse, show remarkably similar phenotypes suggesting that EEG phenotypes can serve as biomarkers for developing treatments. This includes enhanced resting gamma band power and sound evoked total power, and reduced fidelity of temporal processing and habituation of responses to repeated sounds. Given the therapeutic potential of the antibiotic minocycline in humans with FXS and animal models, it is important to determine sensitivity and selectivity of EEG responses to minocycline. Therefore, in this study, we examined if a 10-day treatment of adultFmr1KO mice with minocycline (oral gavage, 30 mg/kg per day) would reduce EEG abnormalities. We tested if minocycline treatment has specific effects based on the EEG measurement type (e.g., resting versus sound-evoked) from the frontal and auditory cortex of theFmr1KO mice. We show increased resting EEG gamma power and reduced phase locking to time varying stimuli as well as the 40 Hz auditory steady state response in theFmr1KO mice in the pre-drug condition. Minocycline treatment increased gamma band phase locking in response to auditory stimuli, and reduced sound-evoked power of auditory event related potentials (ERP) inFmr1KO mice compared to vehicle treatment. Minocycline reduced resting EEG gamma power inFmr1KO mice, but this effect was similar to vehicle treatment. We also report frequency band-specific effects on EEG responses. Taken together, these data indicate that sound-evoked EEG responses may serve as more sensitive measures, compared to resting EEG measures, to isolate minocycline effects from placebo in humans with FXS. Given the use of minocycline and EEG recordings in a number of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental conditions, these findings may be more broadly applicable in translational neuroscience.

Until now, the most challenge of P300-based BCI is to detect P300 in a minimum of repeats, which is a balance between recognition accuracy and a number of repeats. Previous studies showed that the shallow learning model such as support vector machine (SVM), relevance vector machine (RVM) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) had been successfully used for P300 classification. In this study, we proposed a P300 recognition algorithm based on ensemble of SVMs. Firstly, we intercept 600 ms data after the visual stimulation. Secondly, the extracted segment electroencephalogram (EEG) was averaged by iteration to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. Thirdly, these obtained signals were fed to the ensemble of SVMs for target character is recognition. Finally, an output regulation mechanism was proposed for adjusting the outputs of ensemble of SVMs. The experimental results show that the highest accuracy (80%) and the information transmission rate (17.21 bits/min) are observed in the repeat number of only five. As an application and verification, this algorithm won the third prize in the BCI Controlled Robot Contest of 2019 World Robot Conference.

Electroencephalography (EEG) offers an inexpensive method of studying brain electrocortical activity shortly after exercise and thus offers a way of exploring the influence of exercise on the brain. We conducted a systematic review to summarize the current body of evidence regarding methods of EEG analysis and the reported effects of exercise interventions on EEG. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science and EMBASE were searched for studies investigating resting state EEG in exercise intervention studies carried out in participants >17 years of age and with no history of epilepsy. Further, studies solely investigating event-related potentials as an outcome measure were excluded. Relevant data were extracted, and a risk-of-bias assessment was carried out using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. A qualitative synthesis of results was carried out. A protocol for the systematic review was uploaded to (ID: CRD42019134570) and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) statement was followed. Results: Out of 1,993 records screened, 54 studies were included in a final qualitative synthesis with a total of 1,445 participants. Our synthesis showed that studies were mainly carried out using frequency analysis as an analytical method. Generally, findings across studies were inconsistent and few were adjusted for multiple comparisons. Studies were mainly of low quality and usually carried out in small populations, lowering the significance of results reported. Conclusions: Changes in the EEG as a result of an exercise intervention are elusive and difficult to replicate. Future studies should provide biologically sound hypotheses underlying assumptions, include larger populations and use standardized EEG methods to increase replicability. EEG remains an interesting methodology to examine the effects of exercise on the brain.

Tracking Cognitive Spare Capacity During Speech Perception With EEG/ERP: Effects of Cognitive Load and Sentence Predictability	EAR AND HEARING			English	Article						Auditory neuroscience; Cognitive hearing science; Cognitive spare capacity; EEG; Electrophysiology; ERP; Event-related potential; Listening effort; Speech perception	WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY; SPOKEN WORD RECOGNITION; LISTENING EFFORT; ALPHA-BAND; BRAIN POTENTIALS; EEG ALPHA; HEARING IMPAIRMENT; RECOGNIZING SPEECH; OSCILLATIONS; LANGUAGE	Objectives: Listening to speech in adverse listening conditions is effortful. Objective assessment of cognitive spare capacity during listening can serve as an index of the effort needed to understand speech. Cognitive spare capacity is influenced both by signal-driven demands posed by listening conditions and top-down demands intrinsic to spoken language processing, such as memory use and semantic processing. Previous research indicates that electrophysiological responses, particularly alpha oscillatory power, may index listening effort. However, it is not known how these indices respond to memory and semantic processing demands during spoken language processing in adverse listening conditions. The aim of the present study was twofold: first, to assess the impact of memory demands on electrophysiological responses during recognition of degraded, spoken sentences, and second, to examine whether predictable sentence contexts increase or decrease cognitive spare capacity during listening. Design: Cognitive demand was varied in a memory load task in which young adult participants (n = 20) viewed either low-load (one digit) or high-load (seven digits) sequences of digits, then listened to noise-vocoded spoken sentences that were either predictable or unpredictable, and then reported the final word of the sentence and the digits. Alpha oscillations in the frequency domain and event-related potentials in the time domain of the electrophysiological data were analyzed, as was behavioral accuracy for both words and digits. Results: Measured during sentence processing, event-related desynchronization of alpha power was greater (more negative) under high load than low load and was also greater for unpredictable than predictable sentences. A complementary pattern was observed for the P300/late positive complex (LPC) to sentence-final words, such that P300/LPC amplitude was reduced under high load compared with low load and for unpredictable compared with predictable sentences. Both words and digits were identified more quickly and accurately on trials in which spoken sentences were predictable. Conclusions: Results indicate that during a sentence-recognition task, both cognitive load and sentence predictability modulate electrophysiological indices of cognitive spare capacity, namely alpha oscillatory power and P300/LPC amplitude. Both electrophysiological and behavioral results indicate that a predictive sentence context reduces cognitive demands during listening. Findings contribute to a growing literature on objective measures of cognitive demand during listening and indicate predictable sentence context as a top-down factor that can support ease of listening.

MMN-Indexed Auditory Change Detection in Major Depressive Disorder	CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mismatch negativity; depression; anxiety; event-related potentials; ERP; electroencephalography; MMN	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; WORKING-MEMORY; TRYPTOPHAN DEPLETION; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ATTENTION; DEFICITS; STRESS; DISCRIMINATION	In major depressive disorder (MDD), event-related potentials that are involved in auditory cortex function (i.e. N100 and P300) often have greater latencies and decreased amplitudes. The auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) is thought to be produced by generators in the auditory cortex, as well as the frontal lobes. Reports on differences in MMN in those with MDD have been varied. It was hypothesized that the wide range of results in the literature may be due to the use of different deviant types in eliciting the MMN. To attempt and explain these inconsistencies, the current study employed a multifeature MMN paradigm with 5 deviant tone types in community-dwelling participants with a diagnosis of MDD. We found those with MDD had higher MMN amplitudes following tones that deviated in intensity and location, but no difference in MMNs elicted by the other deivants (relative to unaffected controls). Location MMN deviants were negatively correlated with depression severity scores (i.e. larger MMN with greater severity). We also found longer MMN latencies following the pitch deviant. These results suggest the early auditory change detection process is altered in MDD, but only following certain types of auditory stimuli. Potential explanations for these findings, including high levels of anxiety and the influence of tryptophan are explored. Equally, the current report highlights the importance of using various deviant types when examining the MMN in clinical populations.

Having focused primarily on the relationship between schizotypy and explicit emotion regulation, existing studies have, until now, neglected to acknowledge the potentially important role of implicit emotion regulation. Our aim in the current study was to investigate implicit emotion regulation deficits in schizotypy. To this end, we used a newly developed Priming-Identification (PI) ERP paradigm, consisting of a priming phase and an emotion identification phase, to test 30 individuals with schizotypy and 30 healthy controls while also acquiring EEG data. During the priming phase, we aimed to manipulate emotion regulation goals (i.e., to bring about an intended emotional state) by presenting a category of words related to emotion regulation alongside a category of control words. Associated brain responses occurring during the subsequent stage were indexed according to three ERP components: N170, early posterior negativity (EPN) and late positive potential (LPP). Results showed that, in the control group, priming words associated with emotion regulation led to enhancements in the early N170 amplitude and the middle EPN during expression identification. The same pattern was not observed in the schizotypy group. In summary, our results suggest the presence of deficits in the early and middle stages of the implicit emotion regulation process among individuals with high schizotypal traits.

Craving is supposed to impair executive functions by modulating reward salience and decision-making. Objective: The present study sought to clarify this modulation by scrutinizing reward feedback processing in an experimental decision-making task, which was accomplished by AUD patients in 2 conditions, in the context of induced alcohol craving and in neutral context. Methods: AUD inpatients (N = 40) accomplished the Balloon Analog Risk Task, while their EEG was monitored; counterbalanced across conditions, the tasks were preceded either by craving induction by means of imagery and olfactory alcohol cues, or by neutral cues. Decision choice and variability, and event-related potentials (ERPs) prior to (stimulus-preceding negativity [SPN]) and following (P2a) reward feedback upon decisions, and the outcome-related feedback-related negativity (FRN) were compared between conditions and between patients, who experienced high craving upon alcohol cues (N = 18) and those who did not (N = 22). Results: Upon craving induction (vs. neutral condition), high-craving AUD patients showed less adjustment of decision choice to preceding reward experience and more variable decisions than low-craving AUD patients, together with accentuated reward-associated ERP (SPN and P2a), while outcome-related FRN was not modified by craving. Conclusions: Results support orientation to reward in AUD patients, particularly amplified upon experienced craving, which may interfere with (feedback-guided) decision-making even in alcohol-unrelated context. Craving-accentuated ERP indices suggest neuroadaptive changes of cognitive-motivational states upon chronic alcohol abuse. Together with altered reward-related expectancies, this has to be considered in intervention and relapse prevention.

Despite the severity of this well-known issue, a reliable assessment tool has not yet been developed and implemented in the clinic. The main aim of this focused review is to evaluate the various event-related potential paradigms, recorded using EEG, which may be used to improve the assessment of patients with disorders of consciousness; we also provide a brief comparison of these paradigms with other measures. Notably, most event-related potential studies on the topic have focused on testing a small set of components, or even just a single component. However, to be of practical use, we argue that an assessment should probe a range of cognitive and linguistic functions at once. We suggest a novel approach that combines a set of well-tested auditory event-related potential components: N100, mismatch negativity, P3a, N400, early left anterior negativity and lexical response enhancement.

Methods: We propose a novel approach to align EEG trials from different subjects in the Euclidean space to make them more similar, and hence improve the learning performance for a new subject. Our approach has three desirable properties: first, it aligns the EEG trials directly in the Euclidean space, and any signal processing, feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms can then be applied to the aligned trials; second, its computational cost is very low; and third, it is unsupervised and does not need any label information from the new subject. Results: Both offline and simulated online experiments on motor imagery classification and event-related potential classification verified that our proposed approach outperformed a state-of-the-art Riemannian space data alignment approach, and several approaches without data alignment. Conclusion: The proposed Euclidean space EEG data alignment approach can greatly facilitate transfer learning in BCIs. Significance: Our proposed approach is effective, efficient, and easy to implement. It could be an essential pre-processing step for EEG-based BCIs.

This task requires a high degree of coordination between the partners and the simplicity of the task allows us to study with sufficient experimental control behavioral and neural processes that underlie this controlled interaction. For this study, 13 pairs of individuals engaged in a scripted word-by-word interaction, while we recorded the neural activity of both participants simultaneously using wireless EEG. To study expectation building, different semantic contexts were primed for each participant. Semantically unexpected continuations were introduced in 25% of all sentences. In line with the hypothesis, we observed amplitude differences for the P200-N400-P600 ERPs for unexpected compared to expected words. Moreover, we could successfully assess speech and reaction times. Our results show that it is possible to measure ERPs and RTs to semantically unexpected words in a dyadic interactive scenario.

The system works by presenting a sequence of human photographs consisting of random people photographs mixed with a few of client's acquaintances photographs that trigger P300 responses. The system then verifies the client by considering the correctness of P300 responses to the client's acquaintances photographs. The proposed system achieves an error rate of nearly zero outperforming other brain-signal-based systems and has advantages over other conventional systems in the situations where the key is exposed to the imposer.

Whereas it has been associated with a lot of pathologies, its neural associations and in which way these are related to motivational- and incentive salience, are far from being clear. Furthermore, sex differences suggest some associations with different reactivity across the menstrual cycle in women, hinting to possible hormonal influences. 35 free cycling women were tested in a randomized within-subject design across three cycle-phases, recording an EEG during an Picture-Stroop-Paradigm, measuring gonadal hormones (estradiol, progesterone, testosterone), as well as assessing impulsivity with the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire. It was hypothesized that reactivity towards highly salient pictures, indicated by the event related potentials P300 and the late positive potential (LPP), to be differing in dependence of impulsivity. Results reveal associations of high impulsivity with generally lower P300-amplitudes, blunted LPP-responses towards erotic pictures, as well as lower mean testosterone concentrations in female subjects. This is especially interesting in the context of motivational salience and might be indicating a higher threshold of activation needed in high impulsive individuals - being in line with clinical observations with associations of addictions and other disorders.

However, despite its clear logic, it has been argued that it may not succeed in isolating neural processes solely involved in the emergence of perceptual awareness. In fact, data from contrastive analysis would be contaminated by potential confounding factors reflecting distinct, though related, processes either preceding or following the conscious perception. At present, the ERP components representing the proper correlates of perceptual awareness still remain to be identified among those correlating with awareness (i.e., Visual Awareness Negativity, VAN and Late Positivity, LP). In order to dissociate visual awareness from post-perceptual confounds specifically related to decision making, we manipulated the response criterion, which affects how a percept is translated into a decision. In particular, while performing an orientation discrimination task, participants were asked to shift their response criterion across sessions. As a consequence, the resulting modulation should concern the ERP component(s) not exclusively reflecting mechanisms regulating the subjective conscious experience itself but rather the processes accompanying it. Electrophysiological results showed that N1 and P3 were sensitive to the response criterion adopted by participants. Additionally, the more the participants shifted their response criterion, the bigger the ERP modulation was; this was consequently indicative of the critical role of these components in the decision-making processes regardless of awareness level. When considering data independently from the response criterion, the aware vs. unaware contrast showed that both VAN and LP were significant. Crucially, the LP component was also modulated by the interaction of awareness and response criterion, while VAN results to be unaffected. In agreement with previous literature, these findings provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that VAN tracks the emergence of visual awareness by encoding the conscious percept, whereas LP reflects the contribution from post-perceptual processes related to response requirements. This excludes a direct functional role of this later component in giving rise to perceptual awareness.

Methods: Seventeen younger and 19 older Chinese adults judged the emotional valence of Chinese and Western pictures while electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded and analyzed by temporospatial principal component analysis to dissociate the processing stages. Results: (a) Larger N100 for negative than positive pictures was observed in younger, but not older adults, while older but not younger adults showed larger late anterior P300 for positive than negative pictures. (b) Older adults showed larger early posterior P300 for positive than negative Western pictures, but not culturally relevant Chinese pictures; such modulation effect by cultural relevance was absent in younger adults. Discussion: These findings suggest an age-related decrease in sensitivity to negative information in the earlier stage and an age-related increase in sensitivity to positive information in the later stage of cognitive processing. This supports a dual-route model of the age-related positivity effect. Moreover, the age-related positivity effect is more evident for stimuli with less cultural relevance.

We examined visual search with event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related fields (ERF) for a lateral color singleton focusing on the P1 and N1 in each hemisphere. Forty participants (19 mTBI and 21 controls) aged 50 to 72 performed a visual search task, while we recorded their magnetoencephalogram (MEG) with simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG). We compared visual ERPs and ERFs and associated cortical activity estimated using MEG source localization. Relative to matched controls, participants with an mTBI had a smaller P1 in the left hemisphere and a smaller N1 in the right hemisphere. Also, mTBI participants showed inversed activation patterns across the hemispheres during the N1 in MEG compared with controls. This is the first study to investigate the impact of mTBI on neuronal source activations during early visual processing in an aging population. Results showed that when aging individuals suffer from an mTBI, there are perturbations in the amplitude and hemispheric dominance patterns in the visual P1 and N1 responses that are visible for months to years following the injury. Our findings indicate that mTBI can lead to modifications of sensory and/or perceptual responses, suggesting possible adaptive functional reorganization following mTBI.

The past few years have witnessed an unprecedented surge in EEG-related research applied to the prediction and detection of recovery of consciousness after severe brain injury, opening up the prospect that new concepts and tools may be available at the bedside. This paper provides a comprehensive, critical overview of both consolidated and investigational electrophysiological techniques for the prognostic and diagnostic assessment of DoC. We describe conventional clinical EEG approaches, then focus on evoked and event-related potentials, and finally we analyze the potential of novel research findings. In doing so, we (i) draw a distinction between acute, prolonged and chronic phases of DoC, (ii) attempt to relate both clinical and research findings to the underlying neuronal processes and (iii) discuss technical and conceptual caveats. The primary aim of this narrative review is to bridge the gap between standard and emerging electrophysiological measures for the detection and prediction of recovery of consciousness. The ultimate scope is to provide a reference and common ground for academic researchers active in the field of neurophysiology and clinicians engaged in intensive care unit and rehabilitation.

In healthy brains, objects, especially tools, are said to cause automatic motoric 'affordances'; affecting our preparation to handle objects. For example, the N2 event-related potential has been shown to correlate with the functional properties of objects in healthy adults during passive viewing. We posited that such an affordance effect might also be observed in chronic-stage stroke survivors. With either dominant or non-dominant hand forward, we presented three kinds of stimuli in stereoscopic depth; grasp objects affording a power-grip, pinch objects affording a thumb and forefinger precision-grip and an empty desk, affording no action. EEG data from 10 stroke survivors and 15 neurologically healthy subjects were analysed for the N1 and N2 ERP components. Both components revealed differences between the two object stimuli categories and the empty desk for both groups, suggesting the presence of affordance-related motor priming from around 100 to 370 ms after stimulus onset. Hence, we speculate that stroke survivors with loss of upper limb function may benefit from object presentation regimes designed to maximise motor priming when attempting movements with manipulable objects. However, further investigation would be necessary with acute stage patients, especially those diagnosed with apraxia.

A condition-independent framework for the classification of error-related brain activity	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						EEG; ErrP; Condition complexity; Classification; Feature selection	FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; TASK-DIFFICULTY; PREDICTION ERRORS; POTENTIALS; RESPONSES; RECOGNITION; INSIGHTS; CORRECT; PE	The cognitive processing and detection of errors is important in the adaptation of the behavioral and learning processes. This brain activity is often reflected as distinct patterns of event-related potentials (ERPs) that can be employed in the detection and interpretation of the cerebral responses to erroneous stimuli. However, high-accuracy cross-condition classification is challenging due to the significant variations of the error-related ERP components (ErrPs) between complexity conditions, thus hindering the development of error recognition systems. In this study, we employed support vector machines (SVM) classification methods, based on waveform characteristics of ErrPs from different time windows, to detect correct and incorrect responses in an audio identification task with two conditions of different complexity. Since the performance of the classifiers usually depends on the salience of the features employed, a combination of the sequential forward floating feature selection (SFFS) and sequential forward feature selection (SFS) methods was implemented to detect condition-independent and condition-specific feature subsets. Our framework achieved high accuracy using a small subset of the available features both for cross- and within-condition classification, hence supporting the notion that machine learning techniques can detect hidden patterns of ErrP-based features, irrespective of task complexity while additionally elucidating complexity-related error processing variations. A schematic of the proposed approach. (a) EEG recordings in an auditory experiment in two conditions of different complexity. (b) Characteristic event related activity feature extraction. (c) Selection of feature vector subsets for easy and hard conditions corresponding to correct (Class1) and incorrect (Class2) responses.

In the present study we investigated whether severely obese subjects with or without disordered eating exhibit electroencephalographic (EEG) event-related potential (ERP) modifications as observed in substance abusers. Subjects/Methods A total of 90 women were included; 30 in the normal-weight (NW) group (18.5 < BMI < 24.5 kg/m(2); no food disinhibition or restriction on the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire) and 60 participants with BMI >= 35 kg/m(2) were separated into two groups (n = 30): without food disinhibition (disinhibition score <= 8; ObFD- group) and with food disinhibition (score >8; ObFD+). Clinical and metabolic parameters as well as compartmental aspects (Eating Disorders Inventory-2, EDI-2) were assessed. Participants underwent an ERP recording with an auditory oddball paradigm. Results The mean +/- SD P300 amplitudes in Pz were significantly (p < 0.05) lower in ObFD- (12.4 +/- 4.6) and ObFD+ (12.5 +/- 4.4) groups than in the NW group (15.8 +/- 5.9). The mean +/- SD N200 amplitude in Cz was significantly lower in the ObFD- group (-2.0 +/- 5.4) than in the NW group (-5.2 +/- 4.2 vs; p = 0.035). N200 Cz amplitude was correlated with EDI-2 Binge eating risk score (rho = 0.331; p = 0.01), EDI-2 Body Dissatisfaction score (rho = 0.351; p = 0.007), and Drive for Thinness score (rho = 0.26; p = 0.05). Conclusions The present study provides evidence for reduction of P300 and N200 amplitude in obese women and that N200 amplitude may be related to more disordered eating and eating disorder risk. This leads to consider attentional bias and response inhibition as core mechanisms in obesity and as possible targets for new therapeutic strategy.

Brief report on the relationship between temporal discount rate and error related negativity for immediate versus future choice options	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Temporal discounting; ERN; Decision making	MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; INTERTEMPORAL CHOICE; BRAIN ACTIVITY; HYPOTHETICAL REWARDS; RISK-TAKING; POTENTIALS; PERSONALITY; REAL; PREFERENCES; POSITIVITY	It is well documented that individuals vary in their economic patience - their willingness to choose delayed larger rewards (e.g., $100 in a month) over immediate smaller rewards (e.g., $25 now) - and that high levels of impatience, or temporal discounting, can be behaviorally problematic. Using event-related potential (ERP) method, we investigated error monitoring, as indexed by the error related negativity (ERN) component, as a function of discounting behavior. This work builds on prior work on risky decision making that revealed that individuals have greater ERNs for trials in which they select a risky option over a certain one (Yu and Zhou 2009), especially individuals not inclined towards risk taking (Martin and Potts 2009). In the present study, participants completed a temporal discounting task (choosing between a fixed immediate reward versus a future reward that varied across trials) while electroencephalogram (EEG) activity was recorded. We found an asymmetric relationship between discounting and the ERN: the greater an individual's overall rate of discounting, the greater the ERN component of the ERP waveform on trials where the future reward was selected, but not on trials in which the immediate reward was selected. The ERN may reflect an early warning signal alerting high discounters to potential negative consequences of future-oriented choices.

Online Classification of Multiple Motor Imagery Tasks Using Filter Bank Based Maximum-a-Posteriori Common Spatial Pattern Filters	IRBM			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); Brain Computer Interface (BCI); Event-related de-synchronization; Filter bank, common spatial patterns; Motor imagery		Objective: The main objective of this paper is to propose a novel technique, called filter bank maximum a-posteriori common spatial pattern (FB-MAP-CSP) algorithm, for online classification of multiple motor imagery activities using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. The proposed technique addresses the overfitting issue of CSP in addition to utilizing the spectral information of EEG signals inside the framework of filter banks while extending it to more than two conditions. Materials and methods: The classification of motor imagery signals is based upon the detection of event-related de-synchronization (ERD) phenomena in the mu and beta rhythms of EEG signals. Accordingly, two modifications in the existing MAP-CSP technique are presented: (i) The (pre-processed) EEG signals are spectrally filtered by a bank of filters lying in the mu and beta brainwave frequency range, (ii) the framework of MAP-CSP is extended to deal with multiple (more than two) motor imagery tasks classification and the spatial filters thus obtained are calculated for each sub-band, separately. Subsequently, the most imperative features over all sub-bands are selected and un-regularized linear discriminant analysis is employed for classification of multiple motor imagery tasks. Results: Publicly available dataset (BCI Competition IV Dataset I) is used to validate the proposed method i.e. FB-MAP-CSP. The results show that the proposed method yields superior classification results, in addition to be computationally more efficient in the case of online implementation, as compared to the conventional CSP based techniques and its variants for multiclass motor imagery classification. Conclusion: The proposed FB-MAP-CSP algorithm is found to be a potential / superior method for classifying multi-condition motor imagery EEG signals in comparison to FBCSP based techniques.

However, commercial EEG products are available commonly with a fixed headset in terms of the number of electrodes and their locations to the scalp practically constrains their generalizability for different demands of EEG and brain-computer interface (BCI) study. While most progress focused on innovation of sensing hardware and conductive electrodes, less effort has been done to renovate mechanical structures of an EEG headset. Recently, an electrode-holder assembly infrastructure was designed to be capable of unlimitedly (re)assembling a desired n-channel electrode headset through a set of primary elements (i.e., LEGO-like headset). The present work empirically demonstrated one of its advantage regarding coordinating the homogeneous or heterogeneous sensors covering the target regions of the brain. Towards this objective, an 8-channel LEGO headset was assembled to conduct a simultaneous event-related potential (ERP) recording of the wet- and dry-electrode EEG systems and testify their signal quality during standing still versus treadmill walking. The results showed that both systems returned a comparable P300 signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for standing, yet the dry system was more susceptible to the movement artifacts during slow walking. The LEGO headset infrastructure facilitates a desired benchmark study, e.g., comparing the signal quality of different electrodes on non-stationary subjects conducted in this work, or a specific EEG and BCI application.

We identify two linked problems related to estimating the phase of EEG rhythms with a specific focus on the alpha-band: 1) when the signal after a specific stimulus is unknown (real-time case), or 2) when it is corrupted by the presence of the stimulus itself (offline analysis). We propose methods to estimate the phase at the presentation time of these stimuli.Approach.Machine learning methods are used to learn the causal mapping from an unprocessed EEG recording to a phase estimate generated with a non-causal signal processing chain. This mapping is then used to predict the phase causally where non-causal methods are inappropriate.Main results.We demonstrate the ability of these machine learning methods to estimate instantaneous phase from an EEG signal subjected to very minor pre-processing with higher accuracy than commonly used signal-processing methods.Significance.Neural oscillations have been implicated in a wide variety of sensory, cognitive and motor functions. The instantaneous phase of these rhythms may reflect specific processes of computation which can be acted upon if they can be estimated with sufficient accuracy. Such brain-state dependent paradigms are of increasing medical and scientific interest.	[McIntosh, J.

Natural Categorization: Electrophysiological Responses to Viewing Natural Versus Built Environments	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						environment; electrophysiology; LPP; ERP; natural; implicit categorization	ATTENTION RESTORATION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; BENEFITS; HEALTH; EEG; PERCEPTION; COMPLEXITY; DISORDER; EXPOSURE; PROMOTE	Environments are unique in terms of structural composition and evoked human experience. Previous studies suggest that natural compared to built environments may increase positive emotions. Humans in natural environments also demonstrate greater performance on attention-based tasks. Few studies have investigated cortical mechanisms underlying these phenomena or probed these differences from a neural perspective. Using a temporally sensitive electrophysiological approach, we employ an event-related, implicit passive viewing task to demonstrate that in humans, a greater late positive potential (LPP) occurs with exposure to built than natural environments, resulting in a faster return of activation to pre-stimulus baseline levels when viewing natural environments. Our research thus provides new evidence suggesting natural environments are perceived differently from built environments, converging with previous behavioral findings and theoretical assumptions from environmental psychology.

Our aims were threefold. First, we sought to establish the sensitivity of two auditory paradigms to elicit neural responses in individual neurotypical children. Second, we aimed to validate the use of a portable and accessible electroencephalography (EEG) system, by comparing its recordings to those of a research-grade system. Third, in light of substantial interindividual variability in individuals' neural responses, we assessed whether multivariate decoding methods could improve sensitivity. Method: We tested the sensitivity of two child-friendly covert N400 paradigms. Thirty-one typically developing children listened to identical spoken words that were either strongly predicted by the preceding context or violated lexical-semantic expectations. Context was given by a cue word (Experiment 1) or sentence frame (Experiment 2), and participants either made an overall judgment on word relatedness or counted lexical-semantic violations. We measured EEG concurrently from a research-grade system, Neuroscan's SynAmps2, and an adapted gaming system, Emotiv's EPOC+. Results: We found substantial interindividual variability in the timing and topology of N400-like effects. For both paradigms and EEG systems, traditional N400 effects at the expected sensors and time points were statistically significant in around 50% of individuals. Using multivariate analyses, detection rate increased to 88% of individuals for the research-grade system in the sentences paradigm, illustrating the robustness of this method in the face of interindividual variations in topography. Conclusions: There was large interindividual variability in neural responses, suggesting interindividual variation in either the cognitive response to lexical-semantic violations and/or the neural substrate of that response. Around half of our neurotypical participants showed the expected N400 effect at the expected location and time points. A low-cost, accessible EEG system provided comparable data for univariate analysis but was not well suited to multivariate decoding. However, multivariate analyses with a research-grade EEG system increased our detection rate to 88% of individuals. This approach provides a strong foundation to establish a neural index of language comprehension in children with limited communication.

J	Feldmann-Wustefeld, T				Feldmann-Wustefeld, Tobias			Neural measures of working memory in a bilateral change detection task	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						contralateral delay activity (CDA); electroencephalography (EEG); multivariate linear classifier; negative slow wave (NSW); working memory	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; CONTRALATERAL DELAY ACTIVITY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PREDICTS INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; FLUID INTELLIGENCE; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; STORAGE CAPACITY; REPRESENTATIONS; OBJECTS	The change detection task is a widely used paradigm to examine visual working memory processes. Participants memorize a set of items and then, try to detect changes in the set after a retention period. The negative slow wave (NSW) and contralateral delay activity (CDA) are event-related potentials in the EEG signal that are commonly used in change detection tasks to track working memory load, as both increase with the number of items maintained in working memory (set size). While the CDA was argued to more purely reflect the memory-specific neural activity than the NSW, it also requires a lateralized design and attention shifts prior to memoranda onset, imposing more restrictions on the task than the NSW. The present study proposes a novel change detection task in which both CDA and NSW can be measured at the same time. Memory items were presented bilaterally, but their distribution in the left and right hemifield varied, inducing a target imbalance or "net load." NSW increased with set size, whereas CDA increased with net load. In addition, a multivariate linear classifier was able to decode the set size and net load from the EEG signal. CDA, NSW, and decoding accuracy predicted an individual's working memory capacity. In line with the notion of a bilateral advantage in working memory, accuracy, and CDA data suggest that participants tended to encode items relatively balanced. In sum, this novel change detection task offers a basis to make use of converging neural measures of working memory in a comprehensive paradigm.

Little is known about whether inner and overt speech are processed differently and which neural mechanisms are involved. By simultaneously applying electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we tried to disentangle executive control from motor and linguistic processes. A preparation phase was introduced additionally to the examination of overt and inner speech directly during naming (i.e., speech execution). Participants completed a picture-naming paradigm in which the pure preparation phase of a subsequent speech production and the actual speech execution phase could be differentiated. fNIRS results revealed a larger activation for overt rather than inner speech at bilateral prefrontal to parietal regions during the preparation and at bilateral temporal regions during the execution phase. EEG results showed a larger negativity for inner compared to overt speech between 200 and 500 ms during the preparation phase and between 300 and 500 ms during the execution phase. Findings of the preparation phase indicated that differences between inner and overt speech are not exclusively driven by specific linguistic and motor processes but also impacted by inhibitory mechanisms. Results of the execution phase suggest that inhibitory processes operate during phonological code retrieval and encoding.

Here, in the human somatosensory domain, we assessed effects of subthreshold (imperceptible) electrical finger nerve stimulation - either presented as single pulses or as brief (1 s) 7 Hz pulse trains-on mu-alpha rhythm and perceptual performance. In electroencephalography, subthreshold single pulses transiently similar to 150-350 ms poststimulus) increased mu activity (event-related synchronization), while, interestingly, subthreshold trains led to prolonged (>1 s) mu desynchronization. In psychophysics, detection of near-threshold target stimuli was consistently reduced when presented together with subthreshold trains (at three delays), whereas for targets paired with subthreshold single pulses detection remained unaffected (30 and 180 ms) or was even elevated (60 ms). Though both imperceptible, single pulses and pulse trains exerted opposite effects on neural signaling and perception. We suggest that the common neural basis is preferential activation of cortical inhibitory interneurons. While the inhibitory impact of a subthreshold single pulse (reflected by mu synchronization) is not psychophysically detectable-rather perception may be facilitated-repetition of the same subthreshold pulse shifts the excitation-inhibition balance toward an inhibitory cortical state (reflected by perceptual impediment) accompanied by mu desynchronization. These differential findings provide novel insights on the notion of alpha activity mediating functional inhibition.

The feedback-related negativity (FRN), a component of the event-related potential (ERP) that is sensitive to valenced feedback, is believed to reflect PE signals. Reinforcement is also studied using frontal midline theta (FM Theta) activity, which peaks around the same time as the FRN and increases in response to unexpected events compared to expected events. We recorded EEG while participants completed a monetary incentive delay (MID) task that included positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement conditions with multiple levels of the outcome, as well as control conditions that had no reinforcement value. Despite the overlap of FRN and FM Theta, these measures indexed dissociable cognitive processing. The FRN was sensitive to errors in both positive and negative reinforcement but not in control conditions, while frontal theta instead was sensitive to outcomes in positive reinforcement and control conditions, but not in negative reinforcement conditions. The FRN was sensitive to the point level of feedback in both positive and negative reinforcement, while FM Theta was not influenced by the feedback point level. Results are consistent with recent results indicating that the FRN is influenced by unsigned PEs (i.e., a salience signal). In contrast, we suggest that our findings for frontal theta are consistent with hypotheses suggesting that the neural generators of FM Theta are sensitive to both negative cues and the need for control.

Our hypothesis is that electroencephalography (EEG) can provide information on awareness, in terms of oscillatory activity and network task-related modifications, in people with disorders of consciousness. Similar results were obtained with neuroimaging techniques; we aim at demonstrating the use of EEG, which is low cost and routinely implemented, to the same goal. Nineteen-channel EEG was recorded in 7 persons with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and in 10 healthy subjects during the execution of active (attempted movement) and passive motor tasks as well as 2 mental imagery tasks. Event-related synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD), coherence and network parameters were calculated in delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha1 (8-10 Hz), alpha2 (10-12 Hz), and beta (13-30 Hz) ranges. In UWS subjects, passive movement induced a weak alpha2 ERD over contralateral sensorimotor area. During motor imagery, ERD was detected over the frontal and motor contralateral brain areas; during spatial imagery, ERS in lower alpha band over the right temporo-parietal regions was missing. In UWS, functional connectivity provided evidence of network disruption and isolation of the motor areas, which cannot dialog with adjacent network nodes, likely suggesting a diffuse structural alteration. Our findings suggest that people with a clinical diagnosis of UWS were able to modulate their brain activity when prompted to perform movement tasks and thus suggest EEG as a potential tool to support diagnosis of disorders of consciousness.

An Exploratory Study Using Electroencephalography (EEG) to Measure the Smartphone User Experience in the Short Term	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FLOW EXPERIENCE; TOP-DOWN; OSCILLATIONS; CLASSIFICATION; NEUROSCIENCE; ATTITUDES; EMOTIONS; GENDER; MEMORY	UX (User experience) can influence important user behaviors, including user preference, purchasing decisions, and customer loyalty. The ability to assess UX during the product trial has practical significance for design and improvement of products. In this article, two smartphones with different UX were selected through a focus group. In the EEG (electroencephalography) experiment, we explored the brain signal of users when using two smartphones to complete three tasks. The brain signal of each participant was recorded through Curry Neuroimaging Suite software (Version 7.0, Compumedics Limited, Abbotsford, Australia) when they were using the smartphones. Then results from behavioral, subjective and neural responses were analyzed. The behavioral results showed that participants completed the three tasks faster by using a smartphone with a higher score of UX. The subjective results showed a significant difference between the two smartphones. The patterns of cortical activity were obtained in the five principal frequency bands, Delta (1-4 Hz), Theta (4-8 Hz), Alpha (8-13 Hz), Beta (13-30 Hz) and Gamma (30-45 Hz). The results indicated that a smartphone with higher scores of UX could evoke stronger relative power of Alpha (fronto-central, parietal and partieto-occipital regions), Delta (frontal region) and Gamma rhythms (C3 site), but weaker relative power of Beta (left central region) and Theta rhythms (frontal and parieto-occipital regions). Also, the correlation analysis showed that there was no significant relationship between EEG and behavioral results. User's subjective experience had a significant positive correlation with the relative power of Gamma band, but a negative correlation with Beta and Theta bands (approximately significant with p = .078 and p = .071). There were also significant correlations between EEG results and sub-items of UX. Our ?ndings suggest that the difference in EEG may be taken as an evaluating indicator of user perception when using products without interruption.

Clinically, deficits in executive function have been noted in this population, but the underlying neural processes are not well understood. Using a Go/No-Go response inhibition task in conjunction with high-density electrophysiological recordings (EEG), we sought to investigate the behavioral and neural dynamics of inhibition of a prepotent response (a critical component of executive function) in individuals with 22q11.2DS with and without psychotic symptoms, when compared to individuals with idiopathic schizophrenia and age-matched neurotypical controls. Twenty-eight participants diagnosed with 22q11.2DS (14-35 years old; 14 with at least one psychotic symptom), 15 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (18-63 years old) and two neurotypical control groups (one age-matched to the 22q11.2DS sample, the other age-matched to the schizophrenia sample) participated in this study. Analyses focused on the N2 and P3 no-go responses and error-related negativity (Ne) and positivity (Pe). Atypical inhibitory processing was shown behaviorally and by significantly reduced P3, Ne, and Pe responses in 22q11.2DS and schizophrenia. Interestingly, whereas P3 was only reduced in the presence of psychotic symptoms, Ne and Pe were equally reduced in schizophrenia and 22q11.2DS, regardless of the presence of symptoms. We argue that while P3 may be a marker of disease severity, Ne and Pe might be candidate markers of risk.

In Experiment 1, the participants were instructed to indicate their wanting of a three-yogurt bundle when their neural activity was recorded. The results of self-report wanting scores revealed that the participants wanted bundles consisting of their favorite yogurt products more than those of disliked products. Such a difference in self-report scores was also indexed by the N2 in frontal brain and the P1 in the left hemisphere. By contrast, bundles consisting of three different yogurt products elicited a smaller amplitude of the N2 than bundles consisting of two favorite products and one disliked product, but these two types of bundles received comparable wanting scores. Moreover, we asked the participants in Experiment 2 to perform a visual discrimination task on these bundles, and did not found these effects on the N2 or the P1. Collectively, these results revealed neural activities underlying consumers' responses to food rewards, and demonstrated the role of individuals' variety-seeking tendency in wanting process.

The N400 for brain computer interfacing: complexities and opportunities	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain computer interfacing; N400; electroencephalography; semantic relatedness; language	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VEGETATIVE STATE; LEXICAL DECISION; REACTION-TIME; ERP EVIDENCE; DISORDERS; CONCRETENESS; REPETITION; SENTENCES; FREQUENCY	The N400 is an event related potential that is evoked in response to conceptually meaningful stimuli. It is for instance more negative in response to incongruent than congruent words in a sentence, and more negative for unrelated than related words following a prime word. This sensitivity to semantic content of a stimulus in relation to the mental context of an individual makes it a signal of interest for Brain Computer Interfaces. A complicating aspect is the number of factors that can affect the N400 amplitude. In this paper, we provide an accessible overview of this range of N400 effects, and survey the three main BCI application areas that currently exploit the N400: (1) exploiting the semantic processing of faces to enhance matrix speller performance, (2) detecting language processing in patients with Disorders of Consciousness, and (3) using semantic stimuli to probe what is on a user's mind. Drawing on studies from these application areas, we illustrate that the N400 can successfully be exploited for BCI purposes, but that the signal-to-noise ratio is a limiting factor, with signal strength also varying strongly across subjects. Furthermore, we put findings in context of the general N400 literature, noting open questions and identifying opportunities for further research.	[Dijkstra, K., V; Farquhar, J. D. R.; Desain, P. W.

However, whether this holds true in the social incentives processing is still unclear. The current study investigated the electroencephalographical (EEG) evidence of social incentives processing in women with methamphetamine use disorder (MA group, n = 19) and in a healthy control group (HC group, n = 20) using social incentive delay (SID) tasks. In the SID, participants received a "Like" (e.g., thumbs up) or "Unlike" (e.g., thumbs down) from WeChat emojis as social incentives, or neutral feedback. During the anticipation stage, the Cue-P3 and stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN) were larger for the social incentives condition than for the neutral condition. During the consummation stage, the feedback-related negativity (FRN) was marginally significantly larger in the HC group than the MA group for the social incentive condition, whereas there was no significant difference between the groups for neutral condition. Interestingly, the FB-P3 was larger for social positive feedback than for social negative feedback in the MA group, but not in HC group. Furthermore, only the HC group showed significant positive correlation between the anticipatory event-related brain potential (ERP, such as Cue-P3) and the consummatory ERP (FB-P3) in the social incentive condition. The findings suggest that women with MA use disorder have a blunted neural response to the processing of social incentives and a blunted neural response to negative social feedback, which helps to elucidate the neural mechanisms of social incentives processing in individuals with MA use disorder.

In the absence of visual input: Electrophysiological evidence of infants' mapping of labels onto auditory objects	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Word learning; Associative learning; Event-related potential; EEG; Language acquisition; Auditory modality	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WORD LEARNING-ABILITY; 6-MONTH-OLD INFANTS; SENSORY DOMINANCE; CONTINUOUS SPEECH; BRAIN SIGNATURES; MATERNAL SPEECH; LANGUAGE; VOCABULARY; MEMORY	Despite the prominence of non-visual semantic features for some words (e.g., siren or thunder), little is known about when and how the meanings of those words that refer to auditory objects can be acquired in early infancy. With associative learning being an important mechanism of word learning, we ask the question whether associations between sounds and words lead to similar learning effects as associations between visual objects and words. In an event-related potential (ERP) study, 10- to 12-month-old infants were presented with pairs of environmental sounds and pseudowords in either a consistent (where sound-word mapping can occur) or inconsistent manner. Subsequently, the infants were presented with sound-pseudoword combinations either matching or violating the consistent pairs from the training phase. In the training phase, we observed word-form familiarity effects and pairing consistency effects for ERPs time-locked to the onset of the word. The test phase revealed N400-like effects for violated pairs as compared to matching pairs. These results indicate that associative word learning is also possible for auditory objects before infants' first birthday. The specific temporal occurrence of the N400-like effect and topological distribution of the ERPs suggests that the object's modality has an impact on how novel words are processed.

Impaired Potentiation of Theta Oscillations During a Visual Cortical Plasticity Paradigm in Individuals With Schizophrenia	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						schizophrenia; cortical plasticity; long-term potentation; neural oscillations; theta band; electroencephalography	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; HIPPOCAMPAL THETA; WORKING-MEMORY; NEUROCOGNITIVE DEFICITS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL PLASTICITY; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; DENTATE GYRUS	Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a form of experience-dependent synaptic plasticity mediated by glutamatergic transmission at N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Impaired neuroplasticity has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, possibly due to underlying NMDAR hypofunction. Analogous to the high frequency electrical stimulation used to induce LTP in vitro and in vivo in animal models, repeated high frequency presentation of a visual stimulus in humans in vivo has been shown to induce enduring LTP-like neuroplastic changes in electroencephalography (EEG)-based visual evoked potentials (VEPs) elicited by the stimulus. Using this LTP-like visual plasticity paradigm, we previously showed that visual high-frequency stimulation (VHFS) induced sustained changes in VEP amplitudes in healthy controls, but not in patients with schizophrenia. Here, we extend this prior work by re-analyzing the EEG data underlying the VEPs, focusing on neuroplastic changes in stimulus-evoked EEG oscillatory activity following VHFS. EEG data were recorded from 19 patients with schizophrenia and 21 healthy controls during the visual plasticity paradigm. Event-related EEG oscillations (total power, intertrial phase coherence; ITC) elicited by a standard black and white checkerboard stimulus (similar to 0.83 Hz, several 2-min blocks) were assessed before and after exposure to VHFS with the same stimulus (similar to 8.9 Hz, 2 min). A cluster-based permutation testing approach was applied to time-frequency data to examine LTP-like plasticity effects following VHFS. VHFS enhanced theta band total power and ITC in healthy controls but not in patients with schizophrenia. The magnitude and phase synchrony of theta oscillations in response to a visual stimulus were enhanced for at least 22 min following VHFS, a frequency domain manifestation of LTP-like visual cortical plasticity. These theta oscillation changes are deficient in patients with schizophrenia, consistent with hypothesized NMDA receptor dysfunction.

We examine, whether response selection processes during cognitive-emotional control and its neurophysiological correlates, can be experimentally controlled in a cardiac-cycle dependent manner. To this end, we designed an experimental setup in which the EEG experiment, an emotional Stroop task, was controlled by the individual's electrocardiogram (ECG). Since theoretical considerations suggest that the effects of the cardiac cycle may affect only specific aspects during information processing, we apply EEG signal decomposition before examining functional neuroanatomical regions associated with cardiac-cycle dependent effects with EEG-beamforming approaches. Analyzing N = 27 healthy participants, we show that the cardiac-cycle specifically affects response selection processes, when demands on cognitive-emotional control are low. Response execution processes are sped up when trials are presented shortly after the ECG R peak. These effects were confined to conditions were response selection is not modulated by cognitive-emotional conflicts, which is in line with theoretical concepts on response selection. Corroborating the behavioural data, the EEG data show that particularly motor response-related processes encoded in the theta frequency band in middle and superior frontal regions (BA6) are differentially modulated by cardiac phase and difficulty to select a response. The presented work has an essential methodological focus in cognitive neuroscience for investigating brain-body interaction. It shows how peripheral-physiological parameters can be used to control EEG experiments and that the cardiac cycle has very specific effects in neurophysiological processes and associated functional neuroanatomical structures.

However, little is known about the differences in the cortical activation between standing and sitting, especially how the brain's intention modulates the pre-movement sensorimotor rhythm as they do for switching movements. In this study, we aim to investigate the decoding of continuous EEG rhythms during action observation (AO), motor imagery (MI), and motor execution (ME) for the actions of standing and sitting. We developed a behavioral task in which participants were instructed to perform both AO and MI/ME in regard to the transitioning actions of sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit. Our results demonstrated that the ERD was prominent during AO, whereas ERS was typical during MI at the alpha band across the sensorimotor area. A combination of the filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) and support vector machine (SVM) for classification was used for both offline and classifier testing analyses. The offline analysis indicated the classification of AO and MI providing the highest mean accuracy at 82.73 +/- 2.54% in the stand-to-sit transition. By applying the classifier testing analysis, we demonstrated the higher performance of decoding neural intentions from the MI paradigm in comparison to the ME paradigm. These observations led us to the promising aspect of using our developed tasks based on the integration of both AO and MI to build future exoskeleton-based rehabilitation systems.

J	Packard, PA; Steiger, TK; Fuentemilla, L; Bunzeck, N				Packard, Pau A.; Steiger, Tineke K.; Fuentemilla, Lluis; Bunzeck, Nico			Neural oscillations and event-related potentials reveal how semantic congruence drives long-term memory in both young and older humans	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ASSOCIATIVE MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PROACTIVE BRAIN; CATEGORY NORMS; TOP-DOWN; SCHEMA; RECOGNITION; CONFIDENCE; RECOLLECTION; LANGUAGE	Long-term memory can improve when incoming information is congruent with known semantic information. This so-called congruence effect has widely been shown in younger adults, but age-related changes and neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here, congruence improved recognition memory in younger and older adults (i.e. congruence effect), with only weak evidence for age-related decline in one behavioral study. In an EEG study, however, no significant behavioral differences in the congruence effect could be observed between age-groups. In line with this observation, electroencephalography data show that, in both groups, congruence led to widespread differences in Event-Related Potentials (ERPs), starting at around 400ms after stimulus onset, and theta, alpha and beta oscillations (4-20Hz). Importantly, these congruence-related ERPs were associated to increases in memory performance for congruent items, in both age groups. Finally, the described ERPs and neural oscillations in the theta-alpha range (5-13Hz) were less pronounced in the elderly despite a preserved congruence effect. Together, semantic congruence increases long-term memory across the lifespan, and, at the neural level, this could be linked to neural oscillations in the theta, alpha and beta range, as well as ERPs that were previously associated with semantic processing.

However, only little evidence has been published for sensory gating in PD. Sensory gating describes the brain's ability to exclude stimuli of low relevance from higher level information processing, thereby sustaining efficient cognitive processing. Deficits in sensory gating have been associated with various psychiatric conditions, most prominently schizophrenia. In this case-control event-related potential study, we tested 32 patients with PD and 39 healthy controls in a double click paradigm. Both groups were compared with regard to pre-attentive (P50), early-attentive (N100), and late-attentive (P200) sensory gating indices. Contrary to a hypothesized deficit, PD patients and healthy controls showed no differences in P50, N100 and P200 values. These results suggest that sensory gating seems to be functional across the pre-attentive, early-attentive, and late-attentive time span in this clinical population. Given this consistency across auditory sensory gating indices, further research aiming to clarify information processing deficits in PD should focus on other neurophysiological markers to investigate information processing deficits in PD (eg, P300, error-related negativity or mismatch negativity).

The evidence comes from studies in which affirmative or negative action language immediately preceded a Go/NoGo task. It was found that negation selectively modulates inhibition-related signatures of NoGo trials, supporting the Reusing Inhibition for Negation (RIN) hypothesis. To further explore this hypothesis, this study tested the reverse effects; namely, how presetting an inhibitory state affects the processing of negated action sentences. To this end, Go/NoGo responses preceded sentence reading and EEG activities were recorded throughout the entire trials. ERP results indicate that the presetting of inhibition by the NoGo cue induced a sustained modulation of waveform for negated action sentences relative to affirmative ones, which began shortly after the negation operator onset and remained beyond the action verb onset. Crucially, the estimated sources of such effect were the right inferior frontal gyrus and the left middle frontal gyrus, both relevant regions in the action inhibition circuitry. These results, complemented by previous findings, support the idea that action inhibition and negated action language share neural mechanisms and influence each other, thus confirming and extending the RIN hypothesis.

Increased Neural Reward Responsivity in Adolescents with ASD after Social Skills Intervention	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						autism spectrum disorder; EEG; ERP; reward response; RewP; sensitization; social skills intervention; PEERS (R)	AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; HABITUATION; CHILDREN; IMPROVEMENTS; MOTIVATION; AMYGDALA; BRAIN	The reward system has been implicated as a potential neural mechanism underlying social-communication deficits in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, it remains unclear whether the neural reward system in ASD is sensitive to behavioral interventions. The current study measured the reward positivity (RewP) in response to social and nonsocial stimuli in seven adolescents with ASD before and after participation in the Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills (PEERS (R)) intervention. This study also included seven neurotypical adolescents who were tested at two time points but did not receive intervention. We examined the RewP across the course of a task by comparing brain activity during the first versus second half of trials to understand patterns of responsivity over time. Improvements in social skills and decreased social-communication impairments for teens with ASD were observed after PEERS (R). Event-related potential (ERP) results suggested increased reward sensitivity during the first half of trials in the ASD group after intervention. Adolescents with ASD who exhibited less reward-related brain activity before intervention demonstrated the greatest behavioral benefits from the intervention. These findings have implications for how neuroscience can be used as an objective outcome measure before and after intervention in ASD.

Yet, it is unclear whether early neural indices of vowel processing are predominantly driven by f0 or by formant frequencies. A candidate neural index of early acoustic processing is the N1, a negative evoked potential of the human electroencephalogram (EEG), peaking between 80 and 150 ms after stimulus onset. The N1 has been found to reflect pitch differences in simple tones, but also general vowel differences. However, the relative contributions of formant frequencies and 10 to N1 amplitudes and latencies are not entirely clear. To this end, an EEG study on German vowels differing in both first (F1) and second (F2) formant as well as f0 (independently modified) was conducted. Results showed that f0 only influenced N1 latencies of vowels with low F1, while F1 influenced amplitudes and latencies for all vowels. The distance between F1 and F2 as well as F2 significantly correlated with N1 amplitudes, but not with N1 latencies. These results imply that early neural processing of vowels relies on higher spectral components (formants) rather than f0. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The present study aims to investigate whether the webpage order and which order level (high order vs low order) facilitate consumers' instant purchase decisions for products. Methods: Fourteen right-handed healthy undergraduates and graduate students participated in the experiment as paid participants. In the experiment, participants were presented with daily products in different online shopping webpages (high-order vs low-order) and reported their purchase intentions between purchase and not purchase. Meanwhile, Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from the participants throughout the experiment. In the analysis process, two event-related potentials (ERP) components, P2 and late positive potential (LPP) were mainly focused to examine the cognitive mechanism underlying the purchase decisions. Results: The behavioral data found that the low-order shopping webpage facilitated participants' purchase intentions compared with the high-order one. Neurophysiologically, increased P2 amplitudes and increased LPP amplitudes were revealed for the low-order webpage compared to the high-order webpage. The P2 indicates the early stage of attention engagement and discordant perception, while the LPP can be taken as a reflection of the late stage of the emotional self-control process. Conclusion: These results provided evidence that webpage order influenced people's purchase decisions. Low-order webpage design invoked more attention engagement and discordant perception and consumed more self-control resources than the high-order webpage design, which contributed to the higher purchase intentions.

Methods: High-density electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from 33 controls and 23 ALS patients during a SART paradigm. Differences in associated event-related potential peaks were measured for Go and NoGo trials. Sources active during these peaks were localized, and ALS-associated differences were quantified. Results: Go and NoGo N2 and P3 peak sources were localized to the left primary motor cortex, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and lateral posterior parietal cortex (PPC). NoGo trials evoked greater bilateral medial PPC activity during N2 and lesser left insular, PPC and DLPFC activity during P3. Widespread cortical hyperactivity was identified in ALS during P3. Changes in the inferior parietal lobule and insular activity provided very good discrimination (AUROC > 0.75) between patients and controls. Activation of the right precuneus during P3 related to greater executive function in ALS, indicative of a compensatory role. Interpretation: The SART engages numerous frontal and parietal cortical structures. SART-EEG measures correlate with specific cognitive impairments that can be localized to specific structures, aiding in differential diagnosis.

Here, we use electroencephalography data recorded in virtual reality experiments with patients to predict one out of eight objects that was focused on. Correct labels for these objects were known from parallel eye-tracking measurements. We extracted features from the time domain and from Pearson's correlation and applied both statistical and neuro-inspired supervised machine learning algorithms. Using a multi-layer perceptron, we achieved 65.4% accuracy on the validation data set and 70.0% accuracy on the test data set.	[Adama, V.

This study uses a novel brain-inspired artificial neural network to investigate the effect of mindfulness training on electroencephalographic function. Participants completed a 4-tone auditory oddball task (that included targets and physically similar distractors) at three assessment time points. In Group A (n = 10), these tasks were given immediately prior to 6-week mindfulness training, immediately after training and at a 3-week follow-up; in Group B (n = 10), these were during an intervention waitlist period (3 weeks prior to training), pre-mindfulness training and post-mindfulness training. Using a spiking neural network (SNN) model, we evaluated concurrent neural patterns generated across space and time from features of electroencephalographic data capturing the neural dynamics associated with the event-related potential (ERP). This technique capitalises on the temporal dynamics of the shifts in polarity throughout the ERP and spatially across electrodes. Findings support anteriorisation of connection weights in response to distractors relative to target stimuli. Right frontal connection weights to distractors were associated with trait mindfulness (positively) and depression (inversely). Moreover, mindfulness training was associated with an increase in connection weights to targets (bilateral frontal, left frontocentral, and temporal regions only) and distractors. SNN models were superior to other machine learning methods in the classification of brain states as a function of mindfulness training. Findings suggest SNN models can provide useful information that differentiates brain states based on distinct task demands and stimuli, as well as changes in brain states as a function of psychological intervention.

Subjective clinical evaluation still remains crucial in its diagnosis. Discussed are two key aspects in the "characterizing ADHD" and on the quest for objective "pathognomonic/endophenotypic diagnostic markers of ADHD". The first aspect briefly revolves around issues related to identification of pathognomonic/endophenotypic diagnostic markers in ADHD. Issues discussed include changes in ADHD definition, remission/persistence and overlapping-symptoms cum shared-heritability with its co-morbid cross-border mental disorders. The second aspect discussed is neurobiological and EEG-based studies on ADHD. Given the neurobiological and temporal aspects of ADHD symptoms the electroencephalograph (EEG) like NeuralScan by Medeia appears as an appropriate tool. The EEGs appropriateness is further enhanced when coupled with suitable behavior/cognitive/motor/psychological tasks/paradigms yielding EEG-based markers like event-related-potential (ERPs like P3 amplitudes and latency), reaction time variability (RTV), Theta:Beta ratio (TBR) and sensorimotor rhythm (SMR). At present, these markers could potentially help in the neurobiological characterization of ADHD and either help in identifying or lay the groundwork for identifying pathognomonic and/or endophenotypic EEG-based markers enabling its diagnosis, treatment and management.

However, experimental settings consisting of various tasks are particularly strenuous for patients and can thus result in poor data quality. For the economical assessment of working memory and response inhibition, this study aims to validate a combinedn-back/nogo paradigm by comparing it to single task versions and to demonstrate its applicability for ADHD research. Twenty-five healthy individuals and 34 ADHD patients between 9 and 16 years participated in this event-related potential (ERP) study. Healthy controls underwent single task versions of a 2-back working memory task and a go/nogo response inhibition task as well as the introduced combined 2-back/nogo task. This combined task demonstrated a comparable ERP structure for working memory and response inhibition aspects as single task versions. Behaviorally, higher working memory performance during the combined paradigm indicated lower task difficulty, while high correlations between combined and single task versions still indicated valid working memory measures. For response inhibition performance, different task versions resulted in similar outcomes. The application of the combinedn-back/nogo paradigm in ADHD patients revealed the expected working memory and response inhibition deficits, increased omission errors, reaction times, and standard deviation of reaction time, as well as diminishedn-back P3 and nogo P3 amplitudes. We conclude that the combinedn-back/nogo task is an effective paradigm for the economical assessment of working memory and response inhibition deficits in ADHD on a behavioral and neurophysiological level.

Despite an emerging understanding of the role of OFC in memory and executive control, its necessity for core working memory (WM) operations remains undefined. Here, we assessed the impact of OFC damage on interference effects in WM using a Recent Probes task based on the Sternberg item-recognition task (1966). Subjects were asked to memorize a set of letters and then indicate whether a probe letter was presented in a particular set. Four conditions were created according to the forthcoming response ("yes"/"no") and the recency of the probe (presented in the previous trial set or not). We compared behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) responses between healthy subjects (n = 14) and patients with bilateral OFC damage (n = 14). Both groups had the same recency pattern of slower reaction time (RT) when the probe was presented in the previous trial but not in the current one, reflecting the proactive interference (PI). The within-group electrophysiological results showed no condition difference during letter encoding and maintenance. In contrast, event-related potentials (ERPs) to probes showed distinct within-group condition effects, and condition by group effects. The response and recency effects for controls occurred within the same time window (300-500 ms after probe onset) and were observed in two distinct spatial groups including right centro-posterior and left frontal electrodes. Both clusters showed ERP differences elicited by the response effect, and one cluster was also sensitive to the recency manipulation. Condition differences for the OFC group involved two different clusters, encompassing only left hemisphere electrodes and occurring during two consecutive time windows (345-463 ms and 565-710 ms). Both clusters were sensitive to the response effect, but no recency effect was found despite the behavioral recency effect. Although the groups had different electrophysiological responses, the maintenance of letters in WM, the evaluation of the context of the probe, and the decision to accept or reject a probed letter were preserved in OFC patients. The results suggest that neural reorganization may contribute to intact recency judgment and response after OFC damage.

However, the evidence regarding potential differences in oscillatory neural activity, an inherent characteristic of brain functioning, is scarce. To fill this gap, here, we extracted and analysed (using a data-driven exploratory approach) brain oscillatory activity, both tonic (overall electroencephalographic - EEG - oscillatory activity) and transient (event related spectral perturbation [ERSP] and inter-trial coherence [ITC]), from a previous published dataset (Luque-Casado et al. 2016), where we showed different behavioural and ERP patterns during a vigilance/sustained attention task as a function of cardiovascular fitness in young adults. The ERSP results of the current study revealed increased theta (4-8 Hz) and upper beta (20-40 Hz) power and reduced lower beta (14-20 Hz) suppression after the target stimulus presentation in the higher-fit group compared to their lower-fit peers, but these differences disappeared in the second part of the task. ITC results mimicked the ERSP pattern within theta (4-8 Hz), while no differences were observed for the remaining frequency bands. Interestingly, the overall timedependent effect in transient oscillatory activity followed the reaction time pattern of results. The analysis of the overall EEG oscillatory (tonic) dynamics did not show significant differences between groups. In sum, cardiorespiratory fitness was related to a brain oscillatory differential response pattern over a wide range of the frequency spectrum and spatio-temporal distribution, which seems to underlie the positive relationship between aerobic fitness and behavioural performance in a sustained attention task. Future studies are warranted to study the causal nature (beyond mere association) of these findings.

Neonatal Multisensory Processing in Preterm and Term Infants Predicts Sensory Reactivity and Internalizing Tendencies in Early Childhood	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Premature; Infant; Neonate brain; EEG; Multisensory; Touch; Sound; Hypersensitivity	EARLY EXPERIENCE; FOLLOW-UP; INTEGRATION; CHILDREN; OUTCOMES; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; PREMATURITY; ADULTHOOD; BEHAVIOR; PLACE	Multisensory processes include the capacity to combine information from the different senses, often improving stimulus representations and behavior. The extent to which multisensory processes are an innate capacity or instead require experience with environmental stimuli remains debated. We addressed this knowledge gap by studying multisensory processes in prematurely born and full-term infants. We recorded 128-channel event-related potentials (ERPs) from a cohort of 55 full-term and 61 preterm neonates (at an equivalent gestational age) in response to auditory, somatosensory, and combined auditory-somatosensory multisensory stimuli. Data were analyzed within an electrical neuroimaging framework, involving unsupervised topographic clustering of the ERP data. Multisensory processing in full-term infants was characterized by a simple linear summation of responses to auditory and somatosensory stimuli alone, which furthermore shared common ERP topographic features. We refer to the ERP topography observed in full-term infants as "typical infantile processing" (TIP). In stark contrast, preterm infants exhibited non-linear responses and topographies less-often characterized by TIP; there were distinct patterns of ERP topographies to multisensory and summed unisensory conditions. We further observed that the better TIP characterized an infant's ERPs, independently of prematurity, the more typical was the score on theInfant/Toddler Sensory Profile(ITSP) at 12 months of age and the less likely was the child to the show internalizing tendencies at 24 months of age. Collectively, these results highlight striking differences in the brain's responses to multisensory stimuli in children born prematurely; differences that relate to later sensory and internalizing functions.

Electroencephalography (EEG) abnormalities are also observed in subjects with FXS, with many researchers paying attention to these as biomarkers. Despite intensive preclinical research using Fmr1 knock out (KO) mice, an effective treatment for FXS has yet to be developed. Here, we examined Fmr1-targeted transgenic rats (Fmr1-KO rats) as an alternative preclinical model of FXS. We characterized the EEG phenotypes of Fmr1-KO rats by measuring basal EEG power and auditory steady state response (ASSR) to click trains of stimuli at a frequency of 10-80 Hz. Fmr1-KO rats exhibited reduced basal alpha power and enhanced gamma power, and these rats showed enhanced locomotor activity in novel environment. While ASSR clearly peaked at around 40 Hz, both inter-trial coherence (ITC) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) were significantly reduced at the gamma frequency band in Fmr1-KO rats. Fmr1-KO rats showed gamma power abnormalities and behavioral hyperactivity that were consistent with observations reported in mouse models and subjects with FXS. These results suggest that gamma power abnormalities are a translatable biomarker among species and demonstrate the utility of Fmr1-KO rats for investigating drugs for the treatment of FXS.

To examine the neurocognitive mechanisms, young and older adults completed an item encoding task involving a semantic judgment on individual objects and an associative encoding task involving a judgment whether one of two objects could fit into the other, while their EEG was recorded. Item and associative recognition were equally reduced in older adults, unexpectedly yielding no disproportionate age-related associative deficit. A behavioral follow-up experiment did reveal an associative deficit when item and associative memory were both tested for the stimuli encoded in an easier version of the associative task, although this effect tended to be smaller than the deficit in an interactive imagery task. The behavioral and ERP results together suggest that in the item task, older adults failed to bind together perceptual object features, leading to low item memory performance. In the association task, both age groups engaged shallow, perceptual encoding processes, which appeared to be less efficient in older adults. These results suggest that the age-related associative deficit is modulated by the extent to which both item and associative memory depend on low-level feature binding and higher-level strategic processes.

Many previous studies have used tactile stimulation to conduct psychological and psychophysiological experiments. However, most of these studies used solid material, not water stream, as an experimental stimulus. To investigate water perception, or to easily control the temperature of an experimental stimulus, it is important to be able to control the water stimulus. In this study, we investigated the usability of water as an experimental stimulus for electroencephalography (EEG) experiments and report the basic EEG response to water stimulus. We developed a tactile stimulation device using a water stream to study EEG responses, with the ability to control the stimulus onset timing. As stimuli, we selected two types of water stream, normal and soft, based on a psychological experiment to confirm a difference of subjective feeling induced by these water streams. We conducted a typical oddball task using the two different water streams and recorded EEG waveforms from 64 electrodes while participants touched the water streams. We calculated P300 at the Pz electrode, alpha asymmetry at the frontal electrodes, and alpha suppression at the parietal area. As a result, we observed typical P300 differentiation based on the stimulus proportion (target 20% and standard 80%). We observed a weaker alpha suppression when participants touched the soft water stream compared to the normal shower. These results demonstrate the usability of water stream in psychophysiological studies and suggested that alpha suppression could be a candidate to evaluate comfort of water stream.

Here, we adapted the Effort Expenditure for Reward Task, a well-known laboratory task used to evaluate motivation, to study the event-related potentials associated with reward processing. The Stimulus Preceding Negativity (SPN) and the P300 were utilized as motivation indicators with high density electroencephalography. The SPN was found to be more negative for difficult choices compared to easy choices, suggesting a greater level of motivation, at a neurophysiological level. The insula, a structure previously associated with both effort discounting and prediction error, was concomitantly activated during the generation of the SPN. Processing a gain significantly altered the amplitude of the P300 compared to an absence of gain, particularly on centroparietal electrodes. One of the generators of the P300 was located on the vmPFC, a cerebral structure involved in the choice between two positive results and their predictions, during loss processing. Both the SPN and the P300 appear to be reliable neural markers of motivation. We postulate that the SPN represents the strength of the motivational level, while the P300 represents the impact of motivation on updating memories of the feedback.

These may have important consequences for infants' social-cognitive development. The current study investigated effects of maternal sensitive and intrusive behavior on 6- to 7-month-old infants' ERP responses to a socio-emotional cue that infants are often confronted with from an early age: emotional prosody in infant-directed speech. Infants may differ in their sensitivity to environmental (including parenting) influences on development, and the current study also explored whether infants' resting frontal asymmetry conveys differential susceptibility to effects of maternal sensitivity and intrusiveness. Results revealed that maternal intrusiveness was related to the difference in infants' ERP responses to happy and angry utterances. Specifically, P2 amplitudes in response to angry sounds were less positive than those in response to happy sounds for infants with less intrusive mothers. Whether this difference reflects an enhanced sensitivity to emotional prosody or a (processing) preference remains to be investigated. No evidence for differential susceptibility was found, as infant frontal asymmetry did not moderate effects of sensitivity or intrusiveness.

An Electrophysiological Study of Aging and Perceptual Letter-Matching	EXPERIMENTAL AGING RESEARCH			English	Article							AGE-DIFFERENCES; DIFFERENT JUDGMENTS; P300 LATENCY; ADULT AGE; IMPACT; MODEL	Background: Previous studies on perceptual letter-matching have found that younger and older adults showed "fast-same" effects for response time and "false-different" effects for errors but the effects were more pronounced for older adults. According to the Noisy Operator Theory, internal noise in visual processing distorts "same" trials into appearing different whereas distortion for "different" trials does not affect performance. Older adults have a "noisier" representation of items within perceptual processing which can impact perceptual matching. However, EEG measures may provide a more direct measure of letter-matching decisions. Methods: We measured the P300 event-related potential (ERP) amplitude, an index of familiarity in stimulus categorization, and behavioral measures (response time and accuracy) to assess letter-matching performance. Results: Individuals responded faster to "same" trials than to "different" trials but were less accurate. Older adults showed similar P300 amplitudes across trial type whereas younger adults produced a larger amplitude for "same" than "different" trials, suggesting that older adults showed less familiarity for "same" trials than did younger adults - a prediction of the Noisy Operator Theory. Conclusions: These ERP results are consistent with the Noisy Operator Theory - suggesting that an age-related increase in internal noise affected letter-matching performance.

While various approaches to improve attentional engagement exist, it is difficult to produce an effect in younger people, due to the inadequate attraction of these approaches themselves. Here, we show that a single 30-min engagement with an attention restoration theory (ART)-inspired closed-loop software program (Virtual ART) delivered on a consumer-friendly virtual reality head-mounted display (VR-HMD) could lead to improvements in both general attention level and the depth of engagement in young university students. These improvements were associated with positive changes in both behavioral (response time and response time variability) and key electroencephalography (EEG)-based neural metrics (frontal midline theta inter-trial coherence and parietal event-related potential P3b). All the results were based on the comparison of the standard Virtual ART tasks (control group, n = 15) and closed-loop Virtual ART tasks (treatment group, n = 15). This study provides the first case of EEG evidence of a VR-HMD-based closed-loop ART intervention generating enhanced attentional engagement.

To do this, it is necessary to inhibit the ongoing wrong action and reprogram a new motor plan as appropriate for the current task. This ability requires a complex interaction between cognitive and motor control. Here, we aimed at shedding light on this interplay. To do this, we administered a spatial version of the Stroop task comprising blocks with different Proportion Congruency (PC) manipulations (i.e., manipulating the percentage of congruent trials at 25%, 50% or 75%), to elicit different cognitive control demands. Moreover, we used two techniques with high-temporal resolution, as we simultaneously recorded EEG and mouse trajectories, that can be considered the real-time kinematic correlates of the ongoing cognitive processing. Specifically, we analyzed the Event Related Potentials (ERPs) locked to the peak deceleration time, which marks the suppression of ongoing erroneous trajectories, and we estimated their neural sources. We found three PC-dependent ERP components engaging distinct neural regions, which showed a reduction of the Stroop effect for low-PC blocks. By using a novel co registration of mouse-trajectories and EEG, we suggest that the observed components may reflect different mechanisms engaged by reactive cognitive control to resolve the interference, including the suppression of an ongoing but no longer appropriate response, the selection of the new motor plan and its actual updating.

Previous studies on a motion paradigm called dynamic motion aftereffect (dMAE) showed that neural adaptation can establish even in very short timescales. However, the neural mechanisms underlying such rapid form of neural plasticity is still debated. In the present study, short- and long-term forms of neural plasticity were investigated using dynamic motion aftereffect combined with EEG (Electroencephalogram). Participants were adapted to directional drifting gratings for either short (640 msec) or long (6.4 sec) durations. Both adaptation durations led to motion aftereffects on the perceived direction of a dynamic and directionally ambiguous test pattern, but the long adaptation produced stronger dMAE. In line with behavioral results, we found robust changes in the event-related potentials elicited by the dynamic test pattern within 64-112 msec time range. These changes were mainly clustered over occipital and parietooccipital scalp sites. Within this time range, the aftereffects induced by long adaptation were stronger than those by short adaptation. Moreover, the aftereffects by each adaptation duration were in the opposite direction. Overall, these EEG findings suggest that dMAEs reflect changes in cortical areas mediating low- and mid-level visual motion processing. They further provide evidence that short- and long-term forms of motion adaptation lead to distinct changes in neural activity, and hence support the view that adaptation is an active time-dependent process which involves different neural mechanisms.

This study examined the associations between neurocognitive processes and trait-rumination in relation to familial risk for depression in nondepressed girls in early adolescence. Neurocognitive processes were assessed via EEG recording during an emotional Go/NoGo task, and analyses examined two Event-Related Potential components, including the Go and NoGo N2, reflecting attentional engagement and cognitive control processes respectively, and the Go and NoGo P3, reflecting motivated attention and inhibitory motor processes. In higher-risk youth, rumination was associated with specific alterations in both N2 and P3 amplitudes to nonemotional faces when required to enact a response, suggesting disrupted behavioral flexibility in adjusting responses to meet task demands. In lower-risk youth, however, greater rumination was associated with diminished engagement of top-down attention and cognitive control resources (i.e., attenuated N2 amplitudes), and enhanced activation of inhibitory motor control processes (i.e., enhanced P3 amplitudes). Results provide novel information regarding the association between depression-risk, rumination, and emotional processing in early adolescence that may have implications for risk-identification and prevention.

Behavioural data showed faster and more accurate responses for digit targets, with a right hand/left hemisphere advantage only for verbal numerals. Occipito-temporal N1, peaking at approximately 180 ms, was strongly left-lateralized during verbal number processing and bilateral during digit processing. A LORETA (low-resolution electromagnetic tomography) source reconstruction performed at the N1 latency stage (155-185 ms) revealed greater brain activation during coding of Arabic than of verbal stimuli. Digit perceptual coding was associated with the activation of the right angular gyrus (rAG), the left fusiform gyrus (FG,BA37), and left and right superior and medial frontal areas. N1 sources for verbal numerals included the left FG (BA37), the precuneus (BA31), the parahippocampal area and a small right prefrontal activation. In addition, verbal numerals elicited a late frontocentral negativity, possibly reflecting stimulus unfamiliarity or complexity. Overall, the data suggest distinct mechanisms for number reading through ciphers (digits) or words. Information about quantity was accessed earlier and more accurately if numbers were in a nonlinguistic code. Indeed, it can be speculated that numerosity processing would involve circuits originally involved in processing space (i.e., rAG/rIPS).

However, to our knowledge no study so far has examined neuronal correlates of performance monitoring using an ecologically valid task outside a typical laboratory setting. Therefore, we examined midfrontal theta and the feedback-related negativity (FRN) using mobile EEG in a physical shooting task within an ecologically valid environment with highly dynamical visual feedback. Participants shot a target using a toy gun while moving and looking around freely. Shots that missed the target evoked stronger midfrontal theta activity than hits and this response was rather phase-unlocked. There was no difference between misses and hits in the FRN. The results raise the question whether the absence of certain ERP components like the FRN could be due to methodological reasons or to the fact that partially different neuronal processes may be activated in the laboratory as compared to more ecologically valid tasks. Overall, our results indicate that crucial neurocognitive processes of performance monitoring can be assessed in highly dynamic and ecologically valid settings by mobile EEG.

Both contextual regularity and selective attention affect the reduction of precision-weighted prediction errors but in distinct manners	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						auditory perception; electroencephalography (EEG); precision; prediction errors; predictive coding	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; REPETITION SUPPRESSION; AUDITORY-CORTEX; N1 WAVE; TIME; ENHANCEMENT; RESPONSES; IDENTIFICATION; STIMULI	Predictive coding model of perception postulates that the primary objective of the brain is to infer the causes of sensory inputs by reducing prediction errors (i.e., the discrepancy between expected and actual information). Moreover, prediction errors are weighted by their precision (i.e., inverse variance), which quantifies the degree of certainty about the variables. There is accumulating evidence that the reduction of precision-weighted prediction errors can be affected by contextual regularity (as an external factor) and selective attention (as an internal factor). However, it is unclear whether the two factors function together or separately. Here we used electroencephalography (EEG) to examine the putative interaction of contextual regularity and selective attention on this reduction process. Participants were presented with pairs of regular and irregular quartets in attended and unattended conditions. We found that contextual regularity and selective attention independently modulated the N1/MMN where the repetition effect was absent. On the P2, the two factors respectively interacted with the repetition effect without interacting with each other. The results showed that contextual regularity and selective attention likely affect the reduction of precision-weighted prediction errors in distinct manners. While contextual regularity finetunes our efficiency at reducing precision-weighted prediction errors, selective attention seems to modulate the reduction process following the Matthew effect of accumulated advantage.

Conscious perception and the modulatory role of dopamine: no effect of the dopamine D2 agonist cabergoline on visual masking, the attentional blink, and probabilistic discrimination	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Dopamine; Cabergoline; Basal ganglia; Striatum; Consciousness; Backward masking; Attentional blink; Spontaneous eye blink rate; EEG; Event-related potential	BASAL GANGLIA; WORKING-MEMORY; STRIATAL DOPAMINE; FRONTAL-CORTEX; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; SYSTEM; RATES; INTERFERENCE; ORGANIZATION	Rationale Conscious perception is thought to depend on global amplification of sensory input. In recent years, striatal dopamine has been proposed to be involved in gating information and conscious access, due to its modulatory influence on thalamocortical connectivity. Objectives Since much of the evidence that implicates striatal dopamine is correlational, we conducted a double-blind crossover pharmacological study in which we administered cabergoline-a dopamine D2 agonist-and placebo to 30 healthy participants. Under both conditions, we subjected participants to several well-established experimental conscious-perception paradigms, such as backward masking and the attentional blink task. Results We found no evidence in support of an effect of cabergoline on conscious perception: key behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) findings associated with each of these tasks were unaffected by cabergoline. Conclusions Our results cast doubt on a causal role for dopamine in visual perception. It remains an open possibility that dopamine has causal effects in other tasks, perhaps where perceptual uncertainty is more prominent.	[Boonstra, E. A.; Slagter, H.

While its subtractive origin strongly influences the amplitude, thus hindering its detection, other external factors, such as subject's inefficiency to allocate attention to the cued target, or the heterogeneity of the visual context, may strongly affect the elicitation of the component itself. It would therefore be extremely important to create a tool that, using as few sweeps as possible, could reliably establish whether an N2pc is present in an individual subject. In the present work, we propose an approach by resorting to a time-frequency analysis of N2pc individual signals; in particular, power at each frequency band (alpha/beta/delta/theta) was computed in the N2 time range and correlated to the estimated amplitude of the N2pc. Preliminary results on fourteen human volunteers of a visual search design showed a very high correlation coefficient (over 0.9) between the low frequency bands power and the mean absolute amplitude of the component, using only 40 sweeps. Results also seemed to suggest that N2pc amplitude values higher than 0.5 mu V could be accurately classified according to time-frequency indices.

Detection of neurophysiological features in female R255X MeCP2 mutation mice	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						Neurodevelopmental disorders; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Event-related potential (ERP); Rett syndrome; Neurophysiological features; Biomarkers	RETT-SYNDROME; MOUSE MODEL; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; DEFICITS; EXPRESSION; BIOMARKERS; PHENOTYPES; SYNCHRONY; RESPONSES; SEVERITY	Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) that is nearly always caused by loss of function mutations in Methyl-CpG-binding Protein 2 (MECP2) and shares many clinical features with other NDD. Genetic restoration of Mecp2 in symptomatic mice lacking MeCP2 expression can reverse symptoms, providing hope that disease modifying therapies can be identified for WIT. Effective and rapid clinical trial completion relies on well-defined clinical outcome measures and robust biomarkers of treatment responses. Studies on other NDD have found evidence of differences in neurophysiological measures that correlate with disease severity. However, currently there are no well-validated biomarkers in RTT to predict disease prognosis or treatment responses. To address this, we characterized neurophysiological features in a mouse model of WIT containing a knock-in nonsense mutation (p.R255X) in the Mecp2 locus. We found a variety of changes in heterozygous female Mecp2(R255X/X )mice including age-related changes in sleep/wake architecture, alterations in baseline EEG power, increased incidence of spontaneous epileptiform discharges, and changes in auditory evoked potentials. Furthermore, we identified association of some neurophysiological features with disease severity. These findings provide a set of potential non-invasive and translatable biomarkers that can be utilized in preclinical therapy trials in animal models of WIT and eventually within the context of clinical trials.

Focused-attention meditation increases cognitive control during motor sequence performance: Evidence from the N2 cortical evoked potential	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Sequence learning; Meditation; Attention; Serial reaction time task; Cognitive control; ERP; N2	SINGLE-SESSION MEDITATION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; EVENT SEQUENCES; WORKING-MEMORY; IMPLICIT; MINDFULNESS; TASK; EXPLICIT; STATES	Previous work found that single-session focused attention meditation (FAM) enhanced motor sequence learning through increased cognitive control as a mechanistic action, although electrophysiological correlates of sequence learning performance following FAM were not investigated. We measured the persistent frontal N2 event-related potential (ERP) that is closely related to cognitive control processes and its ability to predict behavioural measures. Twenty-nine participants were randomised to one of three conditions reflecting the level of FAM experienced prior to a serial reaction time task (SRTT): 21 sessions of FAM (FAM21, N = 12), a single FAM session (FAM1, N = 9) or no preceding FAM control (Control, N = 8). Continuous 64-channel EEG were recorded during SRTT and N2 amplitudes for correct trials were extracted. Component amplitude, regions of interests, and behavioural outcomes were compared using mixed effects regression models between groups. FAM21 exhibited faster reaction time performances in majority of the learning blocks compared to FAM1 and Control. FAM21 also demonstrated a significantly more pronounced N2 over majority of anterior and central regions of interests during SRTT compared to the other groups. When N2 amplitudes were modelled against general learning performance, FAM21 showed the greatest rate of amplitude decline over anterior and central regions. The combined results suggest that FAM training provided greater cognitive control enhancement for improved general performance, and less pronounced effects for sequence-specific learning performance compared to the other groups. Importantly, FAM training facilitates dynamic modulation of cognitive control: lower levels of general learning performance was supported by greater levels of activation, whilst higher levels of general learning exhibited less activation.

J	Benau, EM; Atchley, RA				Benau, Erik M.; Atchley, Ruth Ann			Some Compliments (and Insults) Are More Heartfelt High Cardiac Awareness Increases P2 Amplitudes to Emotional Verbal Stimuli That Involve the Body	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						interoception; embodiment; cardiac perception; attentional bias; event-related potentials	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INTEROCEPTIVE AWARENESS; BRAIN; SENSITIVITY; REPETITION; ATTENTION; ERP; MODULATION; ANXIETY; TASK	Previous research suggests that individuals with increased awareness of internal bodily states (i.e., high interoceptive awareness) are more sensitive to emotional stimuli, particularly stimuli that are negative or threatening. Concurrently, there is increasing evidence that words that are more body-referent (e.g., bonehead) are processed faster, perceived more accurately, and generate larger neuroelectrical signals than those that are less body-referent (e.g., idiot). The present study examined individual differences in interoceptive awareness (IA) to these more embodied words. While electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded, participants passively viewed insults, compliments, and neutral stimuli, half of which were more embodied (e.g., bonehead, beautiful) and half of which were less embodied (e.g., idiot, friendly). Results showed that the high perceivers generated a Larger P2 to embodied compliments than less embodied compliments while average perceivers generated a larger P2 to embodied insults than to less embodied insults. The results provide preliminary evidence that good cardiac awareness is not only associated with increased sensitivity to negative stimuli, but to stimuli pertaining to the body itself.

Effects of theta burst stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex on language switching - A behavioral and ERP study	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						rTMS; Theta burst stimulation; EEG; ERP; Language switching; Bilingualism; Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; WORKING-MEMORY; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; BRAIN; BILINGUALS; INHIBITION; TASK; LOCALIZATION; IMPROVEMENT; ACTIVATION	This study investigated the role of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in language switching using theta burst stimulation (TBS) and electroencephalography in late bilinguals. After a sham-controlled baseline, participants received either excitatory or inhibitory TBS over the left DLPFC before conducting picture naming tasks in pure language blocks and a language switching block, as well as a nonverbal switching task. On the behavioral level, we found no effect of TBS. However, the ERP-analysis revealed an effect of Stimulation for the picture naming tasks, characterized by alterations in the left DLPFC at 20-72 ms, and in networks associated with conflict resolution and self-monitoring at 533-600 ms. As we did not find an interaction between Stimulation and Block (switching vs non-switching), prefrontal stimulation did not specifically modulate interlanguage control. The left DLPFC might rather be involved in enhancing maintenance of task demands and self-monitoring during language production in both mono- and bilingual contexts.

Utility of invasive electroencephalography in children 3 years old and younger with refractory epilepsy	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS			English	Article						subdural grids; invasive electrocorticography; children; refractory epilepsy; localization; epileptogenic zone; electroencephalography	INTRACRANIAL ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; CATASTROPHIC EPILEPSY; SURGERY; COMPLICATIONS; ELECTRODES; INFANTS; AGE	OBJECTIVE Early surgical intervention for pediatric refractory epilepsy is increasingly advocated as surgery has become safer and data have demonstrated improved outcomes with early seizure control. There is concern that the risks associated with staged invasive electroencephalography (EEG) in very young children outweigh the potential benefits. Here, the authors present a cohort of children with refractory epilepsy who were referred for invasive monitoring, and they evaluate the role and safety of staged invasive EEG in those 3 years old and younger. METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective review of children 3 years and younger with epilepsy, who had been managed surgically at two institutions between 2001 and 2015. A cohort of pediatric patients older than 3 years of age was used for comparison. Demographics, seizure etiology, surgical management, surgical complications, and adverse events were recorded. Statistical analysis was completed using Stata version 13. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Fisher's exact test was used to compare proportions. RESULTS Ninety-four patients (45 patients aged <= 3 [47.9%]) and 208 procedures were included for analysis. Eighty-six procedures (41.3%) were performed in children younger than 3 years versus 122 in the older cohort (58.7%). Forty-two patients underwent grid placement (14 patients aged <= 3 [33.3%]); 3 of them developed complications associated with the implant (3/42 [7.14%]), none of whom were among the younger cohort. Across all procedures, 11 complications occurred in the younger cohort versus 5 in the older patients (11/86 [12.8%] vs 5/122 [4.1%], p = 0.032). Two adverse events occurred in the younger group versus 1 in the older group (2/86 [2.32%] vs 1/122 [0.82%], p = 0.571). Following grid placement, 13/14 younger patients underwent guided resections compared to 20/28 older patients (92.9% vs 71.4%, p = 0.23). CONCLUSIONS While overall complication rates were higher in the younger cohort, subdural grid placement was not associated with an increased risk of surgical complications in that population. Invasive electrocorticography informs management in very young children with refractory, localization-related epilepsy and should therefore be used when clinically indicated.

EEG/fMRI data proves that in the visual tristimulus oddball paradigm, two P300 potentials (P3a and P3b) induced by target stimulation and novel stimulation are detected at the frontal-middle (Fz), center (Cz), and mid-apical (Pz) electrodes. Previous studies have shown that P3a and P3b have different spatial distributions of brain activation, but it is unclear whether they have the same neural mechanism. The purpose of this study is to determine the neuropsychological mechanisms of P3a and P3b, as well as the spatiotemporal differences in neurodynamics between the two ERP subcomponents. In a group of 25 subjects, P300 ERP induced by target stimulation and novel stimulation can be detected at the Fz, Cz, and Pz electrodes. At Cz and Fz, compared with P3b related to the target stimulus, the P3a related to the novel stimulus has a higher amplitude and the waveform declines more slowly. But at Pz, P3b has a higher amplitude than P3a. P3a appeared earlier than P3b at Cz and Fz, but the opposite phenomenon was observed at the Pz electrode. The activated brain regions of P3a included the left frontal-parietal lobe region, left anterior wedge lobe region, and right insula, while the target-driven P3b was significantly associated with BOLD changes in the bilateral fusiform gyrus, the left frontal region, and the bilateral insula. The results showed that the integration of the spatial and temporal information of the two imaging modes, namely, ERP and fMRI, proves the existence of the different brain function processes of the two P300 subcomponents. Through the analysis of the composition of P300, the results further proved that the top-down and bottom-up processing processes have played a role in the occurrence of attention capture. It is just that the modulation effects of the two processing mechanisms are different in different tasks. Therefore, it should be noted that the captured neural mechanism is not a single top-down or bottom-up processing process but should be the result of the interaction between the two.

Detecting (Un)seen Change: The Neural Underpinnings of (Un)conscious Prediction Errors	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						consciousness; prediction errors; DCM; vMMN; EEG	VISUAL MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; NO-REPORT; PARADIGMS; PERCEPTION; STIMULI; MASKING; MOTION	Detecting changes in the environment is fundamental for our survival. According to predictive coding theory, detecting these irregularities relies both on incoming sensory information and our top-down prior expectations (or internal generative models) about the world. Prediction errors (PEs), detectable in event-related potentials (ERPs), occur when there is a mismatch between the sensory input and our internal model (i.e., a surprise event). Many changes occurring in our environment are irrelevant for survival and may remain unseen. Such changes, even if subtle, can nevertheless be detected by the brain without emerging into consciousness. What remains unclear is how these changes are processed in the brain at the network level. Here, we used a visual oddball paradigm in which participants engaged in a central letter task during electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings while presented with task-irrelevant high- or low-coherence background, random-dot motion. Critically, once in a while, the direction of the dots changed. After the EEG session, we confirmed that changes in motion direction at high- and low-coherence were visible and invisible, respectively, using psychophysical measurements. ERP analyses revealed that changes in motion direction elicited PE regardless of the visibility, but with distinct spatiotemporal patterns. To understand these responses, we applied dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to the EEG data. Bayesian Model Averaging showed visible PE relied on a release from adaptation (repetition suppression) within bilateral MT+, whereas invisible PE relied on adaptation at bilateral V1 (and left MT+). Furthermore, while feedforward upregulation was present for invisible PE, the visible change PE also included downregulation of feedback between right MT+ to V1. Our findings reveal a complex interplay of modulation in the generative network models underlying visible and invisible motion changes.

However, how the brain networks and their topological properties evolve over time during transient feedback-related cognition processing in SZ patients has not been investigated so far. In this paper, using publicly available feedback-related ERP data which were recorded from SZ patients and healthy controls (HC) when they performed a reinforcement learning task, we carried out an event-related network analysis where topology of brain functional networks was characterized with some graph measures including clustering coefficient (C), global efficiency (E-global) and local efficiency (E-local) on a millisecond timescale. Our results showed that the brain functional networks displayed rapid rearrangements of topological properties during transient feedback-related cognition process for both two groups. More importantly, we found that SZ patients exhibited significantly reduced theta-band (time window of 170-350 ms after stimuli onset) brain functional connectivity strength, E-global, E-local and C in response to negative feedback stimuli compared to HC group. The network based statistic (NBS) analysis detected one significantly decreased theta-band subnetwork in SZ patients mainly involving in frontal-occipital and temporal-occipital connections compared to HC group. In addition, clozapine treatment seemed to greatly reduce theta-band power and topological measures of brain networks in SZ patients. Finally, the theta-band power, graph measures and functional connectivity were extracted to train a support vector machine classifier for classification of HC from SZ, or Cloz + SZ or Cloz- SZ, and a relatively good classification accuracy of 84.48%, 89.47% and 78.26% was obtained, respectively. The above results suggested a less optimal organization of theta-band brain network in SZ patients, and studying the topological parameters of brain networks evolve over time during transient feedback-related processing could be useful for understanding the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying reinforcement learning deficits in SZ patients.

It is well established that symmetry activates a network of extrastriate visual regions, including V4 and the Lateral Occipital Complex. This symmetry response generates an event-related potential called the sustained posterior negativity (SPN). However, previous work has used abstract stimuli, typically dot patterns or shapes. We tested the generality of the SPN. We confirmed that the SPN wave was present and of similar amplitude for symmetrical shapes, flowers and landscapes, whether participants were responding either to image symmetry or to image color. We conclude that the extrastriate symmetry response can be generated by any two-dimensional image and is similar in different stimulus domains.	[Makin, Alexis D.

Identifying and analyzing the appropriate brain activity to have access to such windows is often difficult due to technical or psycho-physiological constraints. Indeed, studying interactions through this approach frequently requires adapting them to accommodate specific BCI-related paradigms which change the functioning of their interface on both the human-side and the machine-side. The combined examination of Electroencephalography and Eyetracking recordings, mainly by means of studying Fixation-Related Potentials, can help to circumvent the necessity for these adaptations by determining interaction-relevant moments during natural manipulation. In this contribution, we examine how properties contained within the bi-modal recordings can be used to assess valuable information about the interaction. Practically, three properties are studied which can be obtained solely through data obtained from analysis of the recorded biosignals. Namely, these properties consist of relative gaze metrics, being abstractions of the gaze patterns, the amplitude variations in the early brain activity potentials and the brain activity frequency band differences between fixations. Through their observation, information about three different aspects of the explored interface are obtained. Respectively, the properties provide insights about general perceived task difficulty, locate moments of higher attentional effort and discriminate between moments of exploration and moments of active interaction.

This priority is maintained across various information processing stages as evident in early, intermediate and late components of event-related potentials (ERPs). However, emotional modulations are inconsistently reported for these different processing stages. In this pre-registered study, we investigated how feature-based attention differentially affects ERPs to fearful and neutral faces in 40 participants. The tasks required the participants to discriminate either the orientation of lines overlaid onto the face, the sex of the face or the face's emotional expression, increasing attention to emotion-related features. We found main effects of emotion for the N170, early posterior negativity (EPN) and late positive potential (LPP). While N170 emotional modulations were task-independent, interactions of emotion and task were observed for the EPN and LPP. While EPN emotion effects were found in the sex and emotion tasks, the LPP emotion effect was mainly driven by the emotion task. This study shows that early responses to fearful faces are task-independent (N170) and likely based on low-level and configural information while during later processing stages, attention to the face (EPN) or-more specifically-to the face's emotional expression (LPP) is crucial for reliable amplified processing of emotional faces.

This component is concomitant to activity related to motor preparation, that is, the Bereitschaftspotential (BP). The pN component has been reported in experiments based on the visual modality only; for other modalities (acoustic and/or somatosensory) the presence of the pN warrants further investigation. This study represents a first step toward this direction; indeed, we aimed at describing the pN and the BP components in discriminative response tasks (DRTs) for three sensory modalities. In experiment 1 ERPs were recorded in 29 adults in visual and auditory DRT; an additional group of 15 adults participated to a somatosensory DRT (experiment 2). In line with previous results both the pN and the BP were clearly detectable in the visual modality. In the auditory modality the prefrontal pN was not detectable directly; however, the pN could be derived by subtraction of separate EEG traces recorded in a "passive" version of the same auditory task, in which motor responses were not required. In the somatosensory modality both the pN and the BP were detectable, although with lower amplitudes with respect to other two sensory modalities. Overall, regardless of the sensory modality, anticipatory task-related pN and BP components could be detected (or derived by subtraction) over both the prefrontal and motor cortices. These results support the view that anticipatory processes share common components among sensory modalities.

For this purpose, subjects listened to semantically correct and incorrect sentences while performing a correctness judgement task. In order to examine underlying neural mechanisms, a multi-methodological approach was chosen combining two neuroscientific methods with behavioral data. In particular, fast dynamic changes reflected in the semantically associated N400 component of the electroencephalography (EEG) were simultaneously assessed with the topographically more fine-grained vascular signals acquired by the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). EEG results revealed a larger N400 for incorrect compared to correct sentences in both spoken and sung sentences. However, the N400 was delayed for sung sentences, potentially due to the longer sentence duration. fNIRS results revealed larger activations for spoken compared to sung sentences irrespective of semantic correctness at predominantly left-hemispheric areas, potentially suggesting a greater familiarity with spoken material. Furthermore, the fNIRS revealed a widespread activation for correct compared to incorrect sentences irrespective of modality, potentially indicating a successful processing of sentence meaning. The combined results indicate similar semantic processing in speech and song.

Impaired Sensory Processing During Low-Oxygen Exposure: A Noninvasive Approach to Detecting Changes in Cognitive States	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						hypoxia; event-related potentials; mismatch negativity; P3a; auditory processing	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; HYPOBARIC HYPOXIA; MEMORY IMPAIRMENT; REACTION-TIME; MILD HYPOXIA; EEG CHANGES; DEFICITS; EXPRESSION; BIOMARKERS; COMPONENTS	The ability to detect novelty in our environment is a critical sensory function. A reliable set of event-related potentials (ERP), known as the auditory deviance response (ADR), are elicited in the absence of directed attention and indexes functionally relevant networks. The ADR consists of three peaks: mismatch negativity (MMN), P3a, and reorienting negativity (RON) that are sequentially evoked in response to unattended changes in repetitive background stimulation. While previous studies have established the ADR's sensitivity to a range of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions and are leading candidate biomarkers of perturbations of the central nervous system (CNS), here we sought to determine if ADR peaks are sensitive to decreases in breathable oxygen. Participants performed a visuomotor tracking task while EEG was recorded during two 27-min sessions. The two sessions differed in the amount of environmental oxygen available: 10.6% O-2 (hypoxia) versus 20.4% O-2 (normoxia). ERPs were measured while a series of identical, or "standard," tones combined with occasional "oddball," tones, were presented. MMN, P3a, and RON were assessed in response to the oddball compared to the standard stimuli. Behavioral impairment during hypoxia was demonstrated by a deficit in tracking performance compared to the normoxia condition. Whereas no changes were detected in the MMN or RON, the amplitude of the P3a component was significantly reduced during hypoxia compared to normoxia, within the first 9 min of exposure. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the effect of low oxygen exposure on passively elicited neural measures of early sensory processing. This study demonstrates that passively elicited EEG measures, reflecting preattentive auditory processing, are disrupted by acute hypoxia. Results have implications for the development of biomarkers for the noninvasive assessment of CNS perturbations.

Neural changes in early visual processing after 6 months of mindfulness training in older adults	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article								Mindfulness has been shown to improve attentional performance, which is known to decline in aging. Long-latency electroencephalographic (EEG) event-related potential (ERP) changes have been reported immediately after mindfulness training, however the enduring stability of these effects is unknown. Furthermore, the ability of mindfulness to impact earlier stages of information processing is unclear. We examined neural activation using high density EEG in older adults engaged in mindfulness training to examine the long-term stability of training effects. After 6 months of training, mindfulness practitioners displayed enhanced neural activation during sensory encoding and perceptual processing of a visual cue. Enhanced perceptual processing of a visual cue was associated with increased neural activation during post-perceptual processing of a subsequent target. Similar changes were not observed in a control group engaged in computer-based attention training over the same period. Neural changes following mindfulness training were accompanied by behavioural improvements in attentional performance. Our results are suggestive of increased efficiency of the neural pathways subserving bottom-up visual processing together with an enhanced ability to mobilise top-down attentional processes during perceptual and post-perceptual processing following mindfulness training. These results indicate that mindfulness may enhance neural processes known to deteriorate in normal aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases.

However, these phenomena have mainly been studied focussing on individual performance. Here, we explored EEG responses to motor prediction errors during a human-avatar interaction and show that Theta/Alpha activity of the frontal error-monitoring system works in phase with activity of the occipito-temporal node of the action observation network. Our motor interaction paradigm required healthy individuals to synchronize their reach-to-grasp movements with those of a virtual partner in conditions that did (Interactive) or did not require (Cued) movement prediction and adaptation to the partner's actions. Crucially, in 30% of the trials the virtual partner suddenly and unpredictably changed its movement trajectory thereby violating the human participant's expectation. These changes elicited error-related neuromarkers (ERN/Pe - Theta/Alpha modulations) over fronto-central electrodes during the Interactive condition. Source localization and connectivity analyses showed that the frontal Theta/Alpha activity induced by violations of the expected interactive movements was in phase with occipito-temporal Theta/Alpha activity. These results expand current knowledge about the neural correlates of on-line interpersonal motor interactions linking the frontal error-monitoring system to visual, body motion-related, responses.

Task-related electroencephalography was collected in 23 young adults following 20 min of rest and AE on separate, counterbalanced days. The results revealed reductions in standard deviation of response time and coefficient of variation of response time following AE compared to rest. Neuroelectric analyses showed increased P3 amplitude following AE compared to rest. Task-related frontal alpha desynchronization was stronger in the 2-back compared with the 1-back task following AE, while no such modulation was observed following rest. These findings suggest AE may temporarily enhance working memory, as reflected by decreases in response variability, which are accompanied by neuroelectric indices reflecting greater upregulation of attentional processes.

Effects of eccentricity on the attention-related N2pc component of the event-related potential waveform	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						attention; eccentricity; EEG; ERP; N2pc	MASS UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS; TARGET ECCENTRICITY; VISUAL-SEARCH; DISTRIBUTIONS; ARTIFACTS; NEURONS; CORTEX; ICA	The N2pc ERP component has been widely used as a measure of lateralized visual attention. It is characterized by a negativity contralateral to the attended location or target, and it is thought to reflect contralaterally enhanced processing of attended information in intermediate to high levels of the ventral visual pathway. Given that the receptive fields in these areas often extend a few degrees into the ipsilateral hemifield, we might expect that near-midline stimuli would be processed by both the contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres, resulting in a diminished N2pc. However, little is known about the effect of eccentricity on the N2pc component. To address this gap in knowledge, we recorded the EEG while participants performed a discrimination task with stimuli presented at one of five eccentricities (0 degrees, 0.05 degrees, 1 degrees, 2 degrees, 4 degrees and 8 degrees between the inner edge of the stimulus and the midline). We found that the N2pc amplitude remained relatively constant across eccentricities, including when the inner edge was at the midline, except that N2pc amplitude was reduced by more than 50% at the greatest eccentricity (8 degrees). We also examined the contralateral positivity that often follows the N2pc. This positivity became progressively larger, and the transition from negative to positive occurred progressively later, as the eccentricity increased. These findings suggest that future experiments looking at the N2pc can use near-midline stimuli without compromising the N2pc amplitude, but should avoid large eccentricities. Implications about the neural generators of the N2pc are also discussed.

A validation of Emotiv EPOC Flex saline for EEG and ERP research	PEERJ			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Emotiv; Validation; MMN; P300; SSVEP; EPOC Flex; N170; Alpha	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; OCCIPITOTEMPORAL CORTEX; FACE; ALPHA; N170; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; INVERSION; RESPONSES; COMPONENT	Background: Previous work has validated consumer-grade electroencephalography (EEG) systems for use in research. Systems in this class are cost-effective and easy to set up and can facilitate neuroscience outside of the laboratory. The aim of the current study was to determine if a new consumer-grade system, the Emotiv EPOC Saline Flex, was capable of capturing research-quality data. Method: The Emotiv system was used simultaneously with a research-grade EEG system, Neuroscan Synamps2, to collect EEG data across 16 channels during five well-established paradigms: (1) a mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm that involved a passive listening task in which rare deviant (1,500 Hz) tones were interspersed amongst frequent standard tones (1,000 Hz), with instructions to ignore the tones while watching a silent movie; (2) a P300 paradigm that involved an active listening task in which participants were asked to count rare deviant tones presented amongst frequent standard tones; (3) an N170 paradigm in which participants were shown images of faces and watches and asked to indicate whether the images were upright or inverted; (4) a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) paradigm in which participants passively viewed a flickering screen (15 Hz) for 2 min; and (5) a resting state paradigm in which participants sat quietly with their eyes open and then closed for 3 min each. Results: The MMN components and P300 peaks were equivalent between the two systems (BF10 = 0.25 and BF10 = 0.26, respectively), with high intraclass correlations (ICCs) between the ERP waveforms (>0.81). Although the N170 peak values recorded by the two systems were different (BF10 = 35.88), ICCs demonstrated that the N170 ERP waveforms were strongly correlated over the right hemisphere (P8; 0.87-0.97), and moderately-to-strongly correlated over the left hemisphere (P7; 0.52-0.84). For the SSVEP, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was larger for Neuroscan than Emotiv EPOC Flex (19.94 vs. 8.98, BF10 = 51,764), but SNR z-scores indicated a significant brain response at the stimulus frequency for both Neuroscan (z = 12.47) and Flex (z = 11.22). In the resting state task, both systems measured similar alpha power (BF10 = 0.28) and higher alpha power when the eyes were closed than open (BF10 = 32.27). Conclusions: The saline version of the Emotiv EPOC Flex captures data similar to that of a research-grade EEG system. It can be used to measure reliable auditory and visual research-quality ERPs. In addition, it can index SSVEP signatures and is sensitive to changes in alpha oscillations.

Artifacts generated from body activities (e.g., eyeblinks and teeth clenches) often contaminate EEGs and make EEG-based classification/identification hard. Although independent component analysis (ICA) is the gold-standard technique for attenuating the effects of such contamination, the estimated independent components are still mixed with artifactual and neuronal information because ICA relies only on the independence assumption. The same problem occurs when using independent vector analysis (IVA), an extended ICA method. To solve this problem, we designed an independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA)-based automatic artifact reduction technique that clearly models sources from observations under the independence assumption and a low-rank nature in the frequency domain. For automatic artifact reduction, we combined the signal separation technique with an independent component classifier for EEGs named ICLabel. To assess the comparative efficiency of the proposed method, the discriminabilities of artifact-reduced EEGs using ICA, IVA, and ILRMA were determined using an open-access EEG dataset named OpenBMI, which contains EEG data obtained through three BCI paradigms [motor-imagery (MI), event-related potential (ERP), and steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)]. BCI performances were obtained using these three paradigms after applying artifact reduction techniques, and the results suggested that our proposed method has the potential to achieve higher discriminability than ICA and IVA for BCIs. In addition, artifact reduction using the ILRMA approach clearly improved (by over 70%) the averaged BCI performances using artifact-reduced data sufficiently for most needs of the BCI community. The extension of ICA families to supervised separation that leaves the discriminative ability would further improve the usability of BCIs for real-life environments in which artifacts frequently contaminate EEGs.

Electroencephalography (EEG) and facial electromyography (EMG) were measured when spoken conversations were presented with pictures that provided either congruent (non-ironic) or incongruent (ironic) contexts. In a separate session, participants evaluated the congruency and valence of the stimuli. While both groups rated ironic stimuli funnier than non-ironic stimuli, the control group rated all the stimuli funnier than the dysphoric group. N400-like activity, P600, and EMG activity indicating smiling were larger after the ironic stimuli than the non-ironic stimuli for both groups. Further, in the dysphoric group the irony modulation was evident in the electrode cluster over the right hemisphere, while no such difference in lateralization was observed in the control group. The results suggest a depression-related alteration in the P600 response associated to irony comprehension, but no alterations were found in emotional reactivity specifically related to irony.

Recent research on cognitive neuroscience has enriched current understanding on the neurological underpinning of second language learning. Beyond behavioral findings, examining brain functions and structures provides a biological explanation of how language acquisition (as a natural experience) and learning (as an active skill and knowledge acquisition process) shapes the human brain. Together, combining cognitive neuroscience methods and second language acquisition and learning has offered an opportunity for cross-disciplinary collaboration. To facilitate cross-disciplinary understanding and potential research collaboration, this review paper aims to provide an overview of the major cognitive neuroscience methodologies adopted to study second language acquisition and learning. A selection of empirical studies covers second language acquisition in developing children, bilingualism as a naturally-occurring experience, and short-term second language learning in laboratory settings. Brain structural (diffusion tensor imaging, DTI; and voxel-based morphometry, VBM) and functional (electroencephalography, EEG; and event-related potentials, EPRs) methods are briefly discussed with suggested further readings. The paper ends with future directions using these methodologies to explore brain changes in response to second language teaching and learning experience. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Fifty-eight participants (26 females and 32 males) completed a chronometric mental rotation task with cube figures, human figures, and body postures. The results are straightforward: depending on angular disparity, participants had a faster reaction time and a higher accuracy rate for embodied stimuli compared to cube figures. The electroencephalogram (EEG) activity pattern showed a higher negative amplitude modulation in the frontal electrodes for females compared to males during the late (400-600 ms) time interval. From 200 to 400 ms after stimulus onset, there was a different activation pattern in the parietal and central electrodes, whereas frontal electrodes did not show differences between embodied and abstract stimuli. From 400 to 600 ms after stimulus onset, there was a different pattern in the central and frontal electrodes but not in the parietal areas for embodied figures in compared to cube figures. Concluding, even though there were no sex differences in the behavioral data, the EEG data did show alterations at the late time interval. Thus, the disparate results regarding sex differences that depend on the type of analysis (behavioral versus neurophysiological) should be more thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, the difference in processing embodied stimuli in an object-based mental rotation task could be confirmed in EEG activity pattern for the first time.

We examined the relationships among event-related brain potential (ERP) measures of early sensory, pre-attentional, and attention-dependent cognition, in antipsychotic-naive help-seeking CHR patients (n = 36) and healthy control participants (n = 22). These measures included the gamma auditory steady-state response (ASSR; early sensory); mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a (pre-attentional); and N400 semantic priming effects - a measure of using meaningful context to predict related items - over a shorter and a longer time interval (attention-dependent). Compared to controls, CHR patients had significantly smaller P3a amplitudes (d = 0.62, p = 0.03) and N400 priming effects over the long interval (d = 0.64, p = 0.02). In CHR patients, gamma ASSR evoked power and phase-locking factor were correlated (r= 0.41, p = 0.03). Reductions in mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a amplitudes were also correlated (r = -0.36, p = 0.04). Moreover, lower gamma ASSR evoked power correlated with smaller MMN amplitudes (r = -0.45, p = 0.02). MMN amplitude reduction was also associated with reduced N400 semantic priming over the shorter but not the longer interval (r = 0.52, p < 0.002). This pattern of results suggests that, in a subset of CHR patients, impairment in preattentionalmeasures of early information processingmay contribute to deficits in attention-dependent cognition involving rapid, more automatic processing, but may be independent from pathological processes affecting more controlled or strategic processing. Thus, combining neurophysiological indices of cognitive deficits in different domains offers promise for improving their predictive power as prognostic biomarkers of clinical outcome.

Pseudowords, either phonotactically legal or illegal with respect to their native language, were acoustically presented to monolingually German raised infants. Neural activity was simultaneously assessed by means of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy ((NIPS). The former method excellently tracks fast processing mechanisms, whereas the latter reveals brain areas recruited. Results of the present study indicate that 18-month-olds recognize the linguistic properties of their native language based on phonotactics. This manifested in an increased N400 for legal compared to illegal pseudowords in the EEG conforming to adult-like mechanisms. Unfortunately, fNIRS findings did not support this discrimination ability. Possible methodological and brain maturational reasons might explain this null finding. This study provides evidence for the advantage of a multi-methodological approach in order to get a clear picture on neural language development.

This study investigated how these two types of external interference affect task performance and attentional and WM processes as indexed by specific event-related potentials (ERPs) of the EEG. A Continuous Number Task (CNT) was applied, in which participants had to either decide whether the current number (condition without WM load) or the sum of the current and the preceding number (condition with WM load) was odd or even while responding to interlaced single letters (interruptions) or ignoring them (distractions). Contrary to previous research, we did not find external interference to affect performance under WM load. Unexpectedly, our results rather show that performance was significantly improved in trials after distractions compared to before. This effect was reflected particularly in a significantly increased P3 mean amplitude indicating enhanced attentional reallocation to task-relevant stimuli. Interestingly, this P3 effect appeared independent of WM load and also following interruptions. This underpins the account of P3 amplitudes being modulated by the interval between two task-relevant stimuli rather than by overall task-difficulty. Moreover, a pronounced fronto-central and posterior slow wave following interference suggest more control resources to maintain task-relevant stimuli in WM independent of the preceding interfering stimulus. Our results thus suggest that the type and foreknowledge of external interference may modulate the amount of interference and may also facilitate resource preparation under WM load.

The Influence of Maternal Schizotypy on the perception of Facial Emotional Expressions during Infancy: an Event-Related Potential Study	INFANT BEHAVIOR & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						EEG; Schizotypy; Event-related potential; Infancy; Facial Expression; Schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA-SPECTRUM DISORDERS; AFFECT RECOGNITION DEFICITS; SOCIAL COGNITION; PERSONALITY-TRAITS; AFFECTIVE PROSODY; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; MOTHERS FACE; HIGH-RISK; CHILDREN; ERP	Parenting directly affects the developmental and clinical outcomes of children. How parental personality relates to perceptual and cognitive mechanisms during early development is not clear. For parents with traits of the personality dimension schizotypy, would their infant display brain responses similar to those on the schizophrenia-spectrum? This study investigates whether maternal personality influences early social-cognitive awareness during the first 6 postnatal months. Schizotypy is a dimension of personality within the general population. If deficits contribute to the development of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders by influencing the development of symptom-like characteristics, they may be observable in neurotypical individuals with schizotypal characteristics. Parents and their infants were shown standardised positive and negative faces and event-related potential responses were assessed. It was hypothesised that the infants of schizotypic mothers would display differential Negative-central event-related potentials for the happy and fearful expressions when compared to infants of non-schizotypic mothers. Results support prior literature; indicating 6-month-old infants allocate more attentional resources to fearful when contrasted to happy faces. The adult cohort displays this same ability. In addition, schizotypic mothers displayed comparable amplitudes for both expressions in comparison to the control mothers who exhibited larger amplitudes towards the fearful compared to the happy expression. Infants of schizotypic mothers did not show a greater sensitivity to facial expressions at 6-months, but schizotypic mothers showed a generalised response towards facial expressions compared to the typical P600 response illustrated by the control mothers. The present study suggests that development in the higher cognitive domains, such as the allocation of attention to novel stimuli, are not affected at 6 months of age by maternal personality related to schizotypy when examined at the group level. Implications for personality development, maternal-infant interactions and cognitive neuroscience methodologies are discussed.	[Smith, E. S.; Crawford, T.

Although Parkinson's disease (PD) is primarily known as a movement disorder, recent research has redefined it as a multisystem disorder affecting cognition, in particular inhibitory control and attentional resource allocation. Analysing the neural mechanisms underlying this cognitive deficit provides a better understanding of brain changes observed in patients affected by PD. Therefore, this study aimed to identify resource allocation to relevant and irrelevant stimuli in patients affected by PD. Besides neuropsychological tests, we employed electroencephalographic recordings during an auditory oddball paradigm in 13 patients suffering from idiopathic PD and 11 healthy controls (HC). Participants were instructed to ignore the standard stimulus and to respond as fast as possible to the rarely presented target tone. Event-related potentials (ERP) and time-frequency representations (TFR) were analyzed. Patients affected by PD showed faster response latencies to the task-irrelevant standard tones, but slower response latencies to target tones compared to HC. This observation was prominent at frontal sites during later P3-like processing stages. Reaction time, however, was prolonged in patients with PD, suggesting inefficient resource allocation. Additionally, TFR revealed reduced parietal alpha activity, which is associated with distractor suppression and functional inhibition in patients with PD compared to healthy controls. Thus, our results point towards inefficient resource allocation in patients with PD possibly driven by less functional inhibition through parietal alpha activity.

We examined these sub-processes using reaction times, event-related potentials (ERPs), and their neuronal source activations during the Attention Network Test (ANT) in control children, attentional problems (AP) children, and reading difficulties (RD) children. During the ANT, electroencephalography was measured using 128 electrodes on three groups of Finnish sixth-graders aged 12-13 years (control = 77; AP = 15; RD = 23). Participants were asked to detect the direction of a middle target fish within a group of five fish. The target stimulus was either preceded by a cue (center, double, or spatial), or without a cue, to manipulate the alerting and orienting sub-processes of attention. The direction of the target fish was either congruent or incongruent in relation to the flanker fish, thereby manipulating the inhibition sub-processes of attention. Reaction time performance showed no differences between groups in alerting, orienting, and inhibition effects. The group differences in ERPs were only found at the source level. Neuronal source analysis in the AP children revealed a larger alerting effect (double-cued vs. non-cued target stimuli) than control and RD children in the left occipital lobe. Control children showed a smaller orienting effect (spatially cued vs. center-cued target stimuli) in the left occipital lobe than AP and RD children. No group differences were found for the neuronal sources related to the inhibition effect. The neuronal activity differences related to sub-processes of attention in the AP and RD groups suggest different underlying mechanisms for attentional and reading problems.

Mit einem einzelnen Kanal wird jedoch nur ein Teil des gesamten Hirnprozesses erfasst. Fur eine Gehirn-Computer Schnittstelle, die in kurzer Zeit eine Entscheidung treffen muss, ist diese singulare Gehirnantwort haufig unzureichend wogegen die Information aus mehreren Kanalen haufig redundant ist. Beide Vorgehensweisen sind nicht optimal. Daher ist es unser Ziel, die Kanale zu wenigen Komponenten zu kombinieren, die die relevantesten Modulationen eines Hirnprozesses erfassen. Methodik Wir nutzen die kanonische Korrelationsanalyse, um datengetrieben raumliche Filter aus dem EEG zu bestimmen. Mit der Produkt-Moment Korrelation ermitteln wir, auf welche von 12 verschiedenen Stimulussequenzen die Studienteilnehmer geachtet haben. Ergebnisse Die verdeckte Aufmerksamkeit der Studienteilnehmer konnte mit hoher Genauigkeit (89,39,2%) aus dem raumlich gefilterten EEG und signifikant besser als aus einzelnen Kanalen dekodiert werden. Schlussfolgerung Die aus dem EEG erlernten raumlichen Filter ermoglichen die Extraktion von Komponenten, die einen event-korrelierten Gehirnprozess charakterisieren und eine Gehirn-Computer Schnittstelle effektiv steuern konnen, was von hoher Relevanz fur Patienten ist, die nicht mehr anderweitig kommunizieren konnen. Abstract Objective Event-related potentials are commonly calculated in single EEG channels. However, a single channel reflects only a part of the whole brain process. A brain-computer interface must detect a user's intention in short intervals and thus this sparse brain response might be insufficient while information in multiple channels might be redundant. Therefore, our aim was to combine the channels to a few components which reflect the most relevant modulations of a brain process. Methods We applied canonical correlation analysis to determine spatial filters from EEG signals. Using an ordinary correlation measure, we decoded to which of 12 stimulus sequences the participants directed their attention. Results The covert attention of participants was decoded i) with high accuracy (89,3 +/- 9,2%) from spatially filtered EEG signals and ii) significantly better compared to using single channel features. Conclusions The spatial filters, learned from EEG data, permitted the extraction of components characterizing an event-related brain process. Furthermore, they could be effectively used to control a brain-computer interface, which is highly relevant for patients who have lost all other communication abilities.

However, the reverse effects, namely, how cognitive inhibition influences the processing of emotional stimuli, have been considerably neglected. This ERP study tries to fill this gap by studying the bidirectional interactions between emotional language and inhibitory processes. To this end, participants read emotional sentences, embedded in a cue-based Go-NoGo task. In Experiment 1, the critical emotional adjective preceded the Go-NoGo visual cue. The ERPs showed a significant reduction in the inhibition-related N2 component in NoGo trials when they were preceded by negative adjectives, compared to positive or neutral adjectives, indicating a priming-like effect on inhibitory control. Consistently, the estimated source of this interaction was the dorsomedial PFC, a region associated with inhibitory and control processes. In Experiment 2, the Go-NoGo cue preceded the emotional adjective, and the ERPs showed a sustained, broadly distributed LPP-like positivity for NoGo negative trials, relative to all the other conditions. In this case, the presetting of an inhibition state modulated the processing of negatively charged words. Together, the two experiments suggest a mutual facilitation between inhibitory control and negative valence, supporting thereby recent integrative theories of cognition-emotion interactions.

Four ERP components likely signal infants' face-sensitivity but reflect different underlying mechanisms: the P1, N290, P400, Nc. We test whether these components reveal similar developmental patterns from early to late infancy, using a longitudinal dataset of 80 infants tested at 5 and 10 months. The P1, N290, and the Nc show face-categorization already in 5-months-olds, a pattern which did not change over time. Development is visible as increased amplitudes in all components, but similar for face and non-face stimuli. By using Markov models, we illustrate that there are differences in the distribution of individual trajectories of face-categorization components from 5 to 10 months. Whereas individual trajectories appear more varied for the Nc and the P1, the N290 reveals a more consistent pattern: a larger proportion of 5-month-olds shows the dominant group response; a larger proportion of 10-month-olds remains in this group, and larger proportions of the alternative trajectories from 5- to 10-month-olds move towards the dominant group. This is vital information when one wants to examine individual differences in infant ERPs related to face-categorization.

J	Travers, E; Khalighinejad, N; Schurger, A; Haggard, P				Travers, Eoin; Khalighinejad, Nima; Schurger, Aaron; Haggard, Patrick			Do readiness potentials happen all the time?	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							DECISION-MAKING; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; VOLITION; BRAIN; INITIATION; CHOICE	The Readiness Potential (RP) is a slow negative EEG potential found in the seconds preceding voluntary actions. Here, we explore whether the RP is found only at this time, or if it also occurs when no action is produced. Recent theories suggest the RP reflects the average of accumulated stochastic fluctuations in neural activity, rather than a specific signal related to self-initiated action: RP-like events should then be widely present, even in the absence of actions. We investigated this hypothesis by searching for RP-like events in background EEG of an appropriate dataset for which the action-locked EEG had previously been analysed to test other hypotheses [Khalighinejad, N., Brann, E., Dorgham, A., Haggard, P. Dissociating cognitive and motoric precursors of human self-initiated action. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience. 2019, 1-14]. We used the actual mean RP as a template, and searched the entire epoch for similar neural signals, using similarity metrics that capture the temporal or spatial properties of the RP. Most EEG epochs contained a number of events that were similar to the true RP, but did not lead directly to any voluntary action. However, these RP-like events were equally common in epochs that eventually terminated in voluntary actions as in those where voluntary actions were not permitted. Events matching the temporal profile of the RP were also a poor match for the spatial profile, and vice versa. We conclude that these events are false positives, and do not reflect the same mechanism as the RP itself. Finally, applying the same template-search algorithm to simulated EEG data synthesized from different noise distributions showed that RP-like events will occur in any dataset containing the 1/f noise ubiquitous in EEG recordings. To summarise, we found no evidence of genuinely RP-like events at any time other than immediately prior to self-initiated actions. Our findings do not support a purely stochastic model of RP generation, and suggest that the RP may be a specific precursor of self-initiated voluntary actions.

However, it is unclear how individual differences in emotion differentiation modulate the electrocortical dynamics of cognitive reappraisal. To this end, we employed event-related potentials (ERPs) and source analysis to characterize temporal dynamics and cortical functions of cognitive reappraisal related with positive emotion differentiation. The electroencephalogram (EEG) data from 36 participants (aged 18-25 years) were recorded when they were required to view neutral, pleasant emotional stimuli, or positively reappraise neutral emotional stimuli. Results showed that, compared with the individuals with low positive emotion differentiation, the individuals with high positive emotion differentiation presented larger late positive potential (LPP) amplitude enhancement during positive reappraisal. Source analysis further found that individuals with high positive emotion differentiation exhibited more activations in the middle frontal gyrus (Brodmann area [BA] 11), superior temporal gyrus (BA 38), and inferior frontal gurus (BA 47) when they implemented cognitive reappraisal as compared with their counterparts. Our findings deepen our understanding of the dynamic cortical organization of how positive emotion differentiation impacts cognitive reappraisal and informs cognitive reappraisal interventions for individuals with low emotion differentiation.

While the nature of the language impairment after stroke is very patient specific, characterizing each persons impairment is useful for treatment and research. Recently, language processing frameworks as a whole are moving towards whole-brain network based analyses. Reflecting this, network based approaches to normal and impaired EEG data are also needed. We measured some aspects of language processing impairments with electroencephalography (EEG). Using EEG recordings from subjects engaged in a speech perception task, we devised a framework based on graph signal processing and information theory, to reveal features of the brain dynamics that separate the 21 healthy subjects from an aphasic patient. This patient has focal difficulty in speech perception. We performed a robust principal component analysis to jointly infer a time-invariant low rank structure and time-varying sparse matrices to characterize brain dynamics in the healthy and the aphasic subjects. With this graph theoretic approach, we demonstrate the possibility to characterize impairment at a patient specific level, that sheds insight into cognitive processes that were disrupted at the network level. This allows for a complementary measure of patient impairment to traditional ERP metrics.

Understanding the cortical-motor coordination is important for improving physical therapy for motor disabilities. However, its underlying transient neural dynamics is still largely unknown. In this study, we applied an eigenvector-based dynamical network analysis method to investigate the functional connectivity calculated from electroencephalography (EEG) signals under visual-motor coordination task and to identify its meta-stable states dynamics. We first tested this signal processing on a simulated network to evaluate it in comparison with other dynamical methods, demonstrating that the eigenvector-based dynamical network analysis was able to correctly extract the dynamical features of the evolving networks. Subsequently, the eigenvector-based analysis was applied to EEG data collected under a visual-motor coordination experiment. In the EEG study with participants, the results of both topological analysis and the eigenvector-based dynamical analysis were able to distinguish different experimental conditions of visual tracking task. With the dynamical analysis, we showed that different visual-motor coordination states can be distinguished by investigating the meta-stable states dynamics of the functional connectivity.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) elicits stimulus-specific enhancement of cortical plasticity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Plasticity; Neuromodulation; TDCS; EEG; ERP	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BRAIN; MOTOR; RAT; LTP; MODULATION	Background: Deficits in plasticity underlie many severe psychiatric disorders. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising method for modulating plasticity. However, given its non-focal nature, there are open questions as to how targeting and outcome specificity can best be achieved. Objective: Understanding how tDCS interacts with concurrent brain activity is necessary for the rational advancement of tDCS. In the present study, we use an event-related potential (ERP) paradigm to assess the stimulus-specific effects of tDCS on cortical plasticity. Methods: 22 healthy volunteers underwent a blinded, sham-controlled plasticity paradigm in a crossover design. High frequency presentation of auditory stimuli was used to induce potentiation in specific components of the ERP. We investigated whether anodal tDCS targeting the auditory cortex would modulate plasticity induction across time. Two pure tones were used as stimuli, only one of the tones, the target tone, was used for plasticity induction. Plasticity was quantified as change in the mean amplitude of the N100 component relative to baseline. Results: TDCS significantly modulated plasticity in the target tone compared to sham (p = 0.02) but had no effect on the control tone (p = 0.73). This effect was time dependent, with tDCS effects no longer apparent 30 min after stimulation. Conclusions: Our results indicate that tDCS can modulate cortical plasticity in the auditory cortex in an activity-dependent manner. These findings bolster the idea that tDCS can be an effective tool to target and modulate plasticity both for research and therapeutic purposes.

Brain Vital Signs Detect Cognitive Improvements During Combined Physical Therapy and Neuromodulation in Rehabilitation From Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: A Case Report	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						traumatic brain injury (TBI); translingual neurostimulation (TLNS); electroencephalography (EEG); brain vital signs; neuroplasticity; post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); case report	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; STIMULATION; BALANCE; NUCLEI; P300	Using a longitudinal case study design, we have tracked the recovery of motor function following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) through a multimodal neuroimaging approach. In 2006, Canadian Soldier Captain (retired) Trevor Greene (TG) was attacked with an axe to the head while on tour in Afghanistan. TG continues intensive daily rehabilitation, which recently included the integration of physical therapy (PT) with neuromodulation using translingual neurostimulation (TLNS) to facilitate neuroplasticity. Recent findings with PT + TLNS demonstrated that recovery of motor function occurred beyond conventional time limits, currently extending past 14-years post-injury. To investigate whether PT + TLNS similarly resulted in associated cognitive function improvements, we examined event-related potentials (ERPs) with the brain vital signs framework. In parallel with motor function improvements, brain vital signs detected significant increases in basic attention (as measured by P300 response amplitude) and cognitive processing (as measured by contextual N400 response amplitude). These objective cognitive improvements corresponded with TG's self-reported improvements, including a noteworthy and consistent reduction in ongoing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The findings provide valuable insight into the potential importance of non-invasive neuromodulation in cognitive rehabilitation, in addition to initial indications for physical rehabilitation.

Recent research efforts have focused on identifying biomarkers that precede psychosis onset and enhance the accuracy of clinical outcome prediction in CHR-P individuals, with the ultimate goal of developing staged treatment approaches based on the individual's level of risk. Identifying such biomarkers may also facilitate progress toward understanding pathogenic mechanisms un-derlying psychosis onset, which may support the development of mechanistically informed early interventions for psychosis. In recent years, electroencephalography-based event-related potential measures with established sensitivity to schizophrenia have gained traction in the study of CHR-P and its clinical outcomes. In this review, we describe the evidence for event-related potential abnormalities in CHR-P and discuss how they inform our under-standing of information processing deficits as vulnerability markers for emerging psychosis and as indicators of future outcomes. Among the measures studied, P300 and mismatch negativity are notable because deficits predict con-version to psychosis and/or CHR-P remission. However, the accuracy with which these and other measures predict outcomes in CHR-P has been obscured in the prior literature by the tendency to only report group-level differences, underscoring the need for inclusion of individual predictive accuracy metrics in future studies. Nevertheless, both P300 and mismatch negativity show promise as electrophysiological markers of risk for psychosis, as target engagement measures for clinical trials, and as potential translational bridges between human studies and animal models focused on novel drug development for early psychosis.

Previous studies show that individuals with ADHD and neurotypical individuals with increased MW-S display similar cognitive-performance and electrophysiological (EEG) impairments in attentional processes. However, the cognitive-EEG markers associated with increased MW-S in ADHD remain poorly understood. We therefore investigated such markers in a sample of 69 sex- and age-matched adults with ADHD and 29 controls during the Sustained Attention to Response Task. We compared task performance and EEG measures (P3, time-frequency brain-oscillations) of attentional processes between groups, and examined their association with a validated self-report questionnaire of MW-S. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that MW-S and ADHD diagnosis relate to the same cognitive-EEG impairments using a hierarchical regression model. Compared to controls, adults with ADHD showed attenuations in P3, event-related alpha and beta suppression during response inhibition (No-Go trials), and theta power activations during response execution (Go trials), as well as increased reaction time variability and more commission/omission errors. MW-S was also continuously associated with most cognitive-EEG measures related to ADHD. The hierarchical regressions on measures associated with both ADHD diagnosis and MW-S showed that MW-S did not explain additional variance in the cognitive-EEG markers (except for beta suppression) beyond ADHD diagnosis, and vice versa. These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that ADHD diagnosis and MW-S share common neural deficits, and that MW-S may reflect a core symptom of the disorder.

J	Domracheva, M; Kulikova, S				Domracheva, Marina; Kulikova, Sofya			EEG correlates of perceived food product similarity in a cross-modal taste-visual task	FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE			English	Article						Taste perception; EEG; N400; Induced gamma oscillations; Cross-modal tasks	GAMMA-BAND RESPONSES; BRAIN	The most common tools to understand perception of food products are hall tests, surveys and observations. However, these approaches require large samples to get reliable results and they are rather costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, they are also highly expert-dependent and rely on the assumption that study participants can express their preferences consciously and explicitly. In our paper, we suggest an electroencephalography-based (EEG) approach to evaluate perceived product similarly in a cross-modal taste-visual task. We tested two potential neurometrics measured from Fz electrode: the amplitude of the N400-like evoked response potentials (ERP) and the power of induced gamma oscillations during 400-600 ms period after visual stimulus presentation. Both metrics showed a strong correlation with the perceived similarly scores at both individual and group levels; however, N400-like amplitude had greater inter-subject variability making it less suitable for practical applications. The results based on the power of induced gamma oscillations (N = 18) could be compared to traditional hall-tests (N = 200) and may potentially reveal subtle differences in food perception that can not be captured in the hall-tests.

Repetition attenuates the influence of recency on recognition memory: Behavioral and electrophysiological evidence	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						continuous recognition; EEG; episodic memory; ERPs; retrieval; serial search; time	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RETRIEVAL-PROCESSES; JUDGMENTS; STRENGTH; MODEL; ERPS; TIME; MIND; REPRESENTATION; COMPONENTS	Studies of recognition memory often demonstrate a recency effect on behavioral performance, whereby response times (RTs) are faster for stimuli that were previously presented recently as opposed to more remotely in the past. One account of this relationship between performance and presentation lag posits that memories are accessed by serially searching backward in time, such that RT indicates the self-terminating moment of such a process. Here, we investigated the conditions under which this serial search gives way to more efficient means of retrieving memories. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during a continuous recognition task, in which subjects made binary old/new judgments to stimuli that were each presented up to four times across a range of lags. Stimulus repetition and shorter presentation lag both gave rise to speeded RTs, consistent with previous findings, and we novelly extend these effects to a robust latency measure of the left parietal ERP correlate of retrieval success. Importantly, the relationship between repetition and recency was further elucidated, such that repetition attenuated lag-related differences that were initially present in both the behavioral and neural latency data. These findings are consistent with the idea that an effortful search through recent memory can quickly be abandoned in favor of relying on more efficient "time-independent" cognitive processes or neural signals.

The inter-subject and intra-subject variability was investigated under the inhibition of human response with a realistic environmental scenario. In present study, we used a battleground scenario where a sniper-scope picture was the background, a target picture was a go signal, and a nontarget picture was a stop signal. The task instructions were to respond on the target image and inhibit the response if a nontarget image appeared. This scenario produced a threatening situation and endorsed the evaluation of how subject's response inhibition manifests in a real situation. In this study, 32 channels of electroencephalography (EEG) signals were collected from 20 participants during successful stop (response inhibition) and failed stop (response) trials. These EEG signals were used to predict two possible outcomes: successful stop or failed stop. The inter-subject variability (between-subjects) and intra-subject variability (within-subjects) affect the performance of participants in the classification system. The EEG signals of successful stop versus failed stop trials were classified using quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) (i.e., parametric) and K-nearest neighbor classifier (KNNC) and Parzen density-based (PARZEN) (i.e., nonparametric) under inter- and intra-subject variability. The EEG activities were found to increase during response inhibition in the frontal cortex (F3 and F4), presupplementary motor area (C3 and C4), parietal lobe (P3 and P4), and occipital (O1 and O2) lobe. Therefore, power spectral density (PSD) of EEG signals (1-50Hz) in F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, O1, and O2 electrodes were measured in successful stop and failed stop trials. The PSD of the EEG signals was used as the feature input for the classifiers. Our proposed method shows an intra-subject classification accuracy of 97.61% for subject 15 with QDA classifier in C3 (left motor cortex) and an overall inter-subject classification accuracy of 71.66% +/- 9.81% with the KNNC classifier in F3 (left frontal lobe). These results display how inter-subject and intra-subject variability affects the performance of the classification system. These findings can be used effectively to improve the psychopathology of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), schizophrenia, and suicidality.

Virtual reality (VR) can be useful as a diagnostic and/or a neurorehabilitation tool, and its effects can be monitored by means of both clinical and electroencephalography (EEG) data recording of brain activity. We reported on the case of a 17-year-old patient with a disorder of consciousness (DoC) who was provided with VR training to improve her cognitive-behavioral outcomes, which were assessed using clinical scales (the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised, the Disability Rating Scale, and the Rancho Los Amigos Levels of Cognitive Functioning), as well as EEG recording, during VR training sessions. At the end of the training, significant improvements in both clinical and neurophysiological outcomes were achieved. Then, we carried out a systematic review of the literature to investigate the role of EEG and VR in the management of patients with DoC. A search on PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases was performed, using the keywords: "disorders of consciousness" and "virtual reality", or "EEG". The results of the literature review suggest that neurophysiological data in combination with VR could be useful in evaluating the reactions induced by different paradigms in DoC patients, helping in the differential diagnosis. In conclusion, the EEG plus VR approach used with our patient could be promising to define the most appropriate stimulation protocol, so as to promote a better personalization of the rehabilitation program. However, further clinical trials, as well as meta-analysis of the literature, are needed to be affirmative on the role of VR in patients with DoC.

Multielectrode array analysis of EEG biomarkers in a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						Fragile X syndrome; Autism; Auditory cortex; Sensory hypersensitivity; EEG; Multielectrode array; Gamma power	EPILEPSY; MALES; FMR1; MICE; POTENTIALS; RESPONSES	Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a leading known genetic cause of intellectual disability with symptoms that include increased anxiety and social and sensory processing deficits. Recent EEG studies in humans with FXS have identified neural oscillation deficits that include increased resting state gamma power, increased amplitude of auditory evoked potentials, and reduced inter-trial phase coherence of sound-evoked gamma oscillations. Identification of comparable EEG biomarkers in mouse models of FXS could facilitate the pre-clinical to clinical therapeutic pipeline. However, while human EEG studies have involved 128-channel scalp EEG acquisition, no mouse studies have been performed with more than three EEG channels. In the current study, we employed a recently developed 30-channel mouse multielectrode array (MEA) system to record and analyze resting and stimulus-evoked EEG signals in WT vs. Fmr1 KO mice. Using this system, we now report robust MEA-derived phenotypes including higher resting EEG power, altered event-related potentials (ERPs) and reduced inter-trial phase coherence to auditory chirp stimuli in Fmr1 KO mice that are remarkably similar to those reported in humans with FXS. We propose that the MEA system can be used for: (i) derivation of higher-level EEG parameters; (ii) EEG biomarkers for drug testing; and (ii) mechanistic studies of FXS pathophysiology.

Using this methodology, the present work aims to detect differential attentional processing of ingroup and outgroup members based on gender categories. Specifically, three EEG studies tested how factors that enhance social identity relevance, namely gender identification and contextual salience of gender representation, moderate neural gender categorization effects. Study 1 showed that both women (Study 1a) and men (Study 1b) were more likely to show preferential attention to ingroup over outgroup members, but only when they identified strongly with their gender group. Study 2 showed that when gender categories in an intergroup leadership context were made salient (i.e., when women were numerically underrepresented versus equally represented compared to men), women, irrespective of their level of gender identification, showed preferential attention to ingroup over outgroup members. Together, this work provides empirical evidence for (1) the neural gender categorization effect among both men and women as soon as 100 ms after face perception and (2) the moderating role of factors that enhance social identity relevance in early gender categorization.

For instance, despite the importance of rapidly decoding fearful faces, this expression often is confused with other expressions, such as Surprise in explicit behavioral categorization tasks. We quantified implicit visual discrimination among rapidly presented facial expressions with an oddball periodic visual stimulation approach combined with electroencephalography (EEG), testing for the relationship with behavioral explicit measures of facial emotion discrimination. We report robust facial expression discrimination responses bilaterally over the occipito-temporal cortex for each pairwise expression change. While fearful faces presented as repeated stimuli led to the smallest deviant responses from all other basic expressions, deviant fearful faces were well discriminated overall and to a larger extent than expressions of Sadness and Anger. Expressions of Happiness did not differ quantitatively as much in EEG as for behavioral subjective judgments, suggesting that the clear dissociation between happy and other expressions, typically observed in behavioral studies, reflects higher-order processes. However, this expression differed from all others in terms of scalp topography, pointing to a qualitative rather than quantitative difference. Despite this difference, overall, we report for the first time a tight relationship of the similarity matrices across facial expressions obtained for implicit EEG responses and behavioral explicit measures collected under the same temporal constraints, paving the way for new approaches of understanding facial expression discrimination in developmental, intercultural, and clinical populations.

Although theories delineate how action integration requiring binding between different action features may be accomplished, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms are largely elusive. The present study examined the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying binding processes in actions. To this end, we conducted EEG recordings and applied standard event-related potential analyses, temporal EEG signal decomposition and multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA). According to the code occupation account, an overlap between a planned and a to-be-performed action impairs performance. The level, to which performance is attenuated depends on the strength of binding of action features. This binding process then determines the representation of them, the so-called action files. We show that code occupation and bindings between action features specifically modulate processes preceding motor execution as showed by the stimulus-locked lateralized readiness potential (LRP). Conversely, motor execution processes reflected by the response-locked LRP were not modulated by action file binding. The temporal decomposition of the EEG signal, further distinguished between action file related processes: the planned response determining code occupation was reflected in general (voluntary) response selection but not in involuntary (response priming-related) activation. Moreover, MVPA on temporally decomposed neural signals indicated that action files are represented as a continuous chain of activations. Within this chain, inhibitory and response re-activation patterns can be distinguished. Taken together, the neurophysiological correlates of action file binding suggest that parallel, stimulus- and response-related pre-motor processes are responsible for the code occupation in the human motor system.

In the present work we aimed at exploring conscious and unconscious lasting (>1 second) expectancy effects. Methods: In a series of four experiments we engaged participants in the foreperiod paradigm while using both unmasked and masked cues that were informative about the presence/absence of an upcoming target. We recorded behavioral responses, high-density scalp EEG (Exp. 2a), and intra-cranial EEG (Exp. 2b). Results: While conscious expectancy was associated with a large behavioral effect (similar to 450 ms), unconscious expectancy effect was significant but much smaller (4 ms). Both conscious and unconscious expectancy Contingent Negative Variations (CNVs) originated from temporal cortices, but only the late component of conscious CNV originated from an additional source located in the vicinity of mesiofrontal areas and supplementary motor areas. Finally, only conscious expectancy was accessible to introspection. Conclusions: Both unmasked and masked cues had an impact on response times and on brain activity. Significance: These results support a two-stage model of the underlying mechanisms of expectancy. (C) 2019 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Yet, the underlying cognitive neural mechanism of it remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the underlying cognitive neural mechanisms of response inhibition to angry expressions in individuals with high trait aggression and whether there was emotion-specificity of response inhibition in individuals with high trait aggression. 58 individuals (29 participants with high trait aggression) completed an emotional Go/NoGo task, during which participants' EEG were recorded. Results indicated that individuals with high trait aggression showed smaller NoGo P3 effect than individuals with low trait aggression, in particular facing angry or fearful expressions. These results suggest that individuals with high trait aggression show deficits in response inhibition, in particular facing angry expressions, and these deficits exist in the later stage of response inhibition, which is closely related to the actual inhibition of the motor system; there is no emotion-specificity of response inhibition in individuals with high trait aggression.

However, brain mechanisms underlying paternal responses to infant crying are still largely unknown. Here using EEG, we investigated brain activations in two different groups, 10 fathers and 10 non-fathers, in response to infant-related sounds: typically developing infants' cry(TD), ASD infants' cry(ASD), infants' laughter(LAU), and white noise(WN). Event Related Potentials in the first second after stimuli onset were analyzed. Analysis revealed a significant interaction between group and stimulus type in the left dorsolateral frontal cluster of electrodes, a brain area involved in motor programming and communicative signals' processing. A main effect of group in response to all auditory stimuli, irrespective of stimulus duration, emerged in the right temporal and parietal clusters. The different levels of familiarity and distinct processing strategies found in response to infant vocalizations shed light on the physiological mechanisms underlying adaptive paternal responses to infants' behaviours.

Previous evidence has shown an increased heart and respiratory rate during the observation and imagination of human actions that require a great muscular effort. In addition, TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) and EEG studies have evidenced a greater muscle-specific cortical excitability and an increase in late event-related potentials during the observation of effortful actions. In this investigation, fifteen professional female ballet dancers and 15 controls with no experience whatsoever with dance, gymnastics, or martial arts were recruited. They were shown 326 short videos displaying a male dancer performing standard ballet steps that could be either effortful or relatively effortless. Participants were instructed to observe each clip and imagine themselves physically executing the same movement. Importantly, they were blinded to the stimuli properties. The observation of effortful compared with effortless movements resulted in a larger P300 over frontal sites in dancers only, likely because of their visuomotor expertise with the specific steps. Moreover, an enhanced Late Positivity was identified over posterior sites in response to effortful stimuli in both groups, possibly reflecting the processing of larger quantities of visual kinematic information. The source reconstruction swLORETA performed on the Late Positivity component showed greater engagement of frontoparietal regions in dancers, while task-related frontal and occipitotemporal visual regions were more active in controls. It, therefore, appears that, in dancers, effort information was encoded in a more refined manner during action observation and in the absence of explicit instruction. Acquired motor knowledge seems to result in visuomotor resonance processes, which, in turn, underlies enhanced action representation of the observed movements.

To characterize the functional role of the occipito-temporal theta-band increase during the processing of body-part stimuli, we recorded EEG from healthy participants while they were engaged in an identification task (match-to-sample) of images of hands and nonbody control images (leaves). In addition to confirming that occipito-temporal electrodes show a larger N1 for hand images compared with control stimuli, cluster-based analysis revealed an occipito-temporal cluster showing an increased theta power when hands are presented (compared with leaves) and show that this theta increase is higher for identified hands compared with nonidentified ones while not being significantly different between not identified nonhand stimuli. Finally, single trial multivariate pattern analysis revealed that time-frequency modulation in the theta band is a better marker for classifying the identification of hand images than the ERP modulation. The present results support the notion that theta activity over the occipito-temporal cortex is an informative marker of hand visual processing and may reflect the activity of a network coding for stimulus identity. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Hands provide crucial information regarding the identity of others, which is a key information for social processes. We recorded EEG activity of healthy participants during the visual identification of hand images. The combination of univariate and multivariate pattern analysis in time- and time-frequency domain highlights the functional role of theta (4-7 Hz) activity over visual areas during hand identification and emphasizes the robustness of this neuromarker in occipito-temporal visual processing dynamics.

Motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (EEG) classification is a widely applied paradigm in brain-computer interfaces. The common spatial pattern, based on the event-related desynchronization (ERD)/event-related synchronization (ERS) phenomenon, is one of the most popular algorithms for motor imagery-based EEG classification. Moreover, the spatiotemporal discrepancy feature based on the event-related potential phenomenon has been demonstrated to provide complementary information to ERD/ERS-based features. In this paper, aiming to improve the performance of motor imagery-based EEG classification in a few-channel situation, an ensemble support vector learning (ESVL)-based approach is proposed to combine the advantages of the ERD/ERS-based features and the event-related potential-based features in motor imagery-based EEG classification. Methods: ESVL is an ensemble learning algorithm based on support vector machine classifier. Specifically, the decision boundary with the largest interclass margin is obtained using the support vector machine algorithm, and the distances between sample points and the decision boundary are mapped to posterior probabilities. The probabilities obtained from different support vector machine classifiers are combined to make prediction. Thus, ESVL leverages the advantages of multiple trained support vector machine classifiers and makes a better prediction based on the posterior probabilities. The class discrepancy-guided sub-band-based common spatial pattern and the spatiotemporal discrepancy feature are applied to extract discriminative features, and then, the extracted features are used to train the ESVL classifier and make predictions. Results: The BCI Competition IV datasets 2a and 2b are employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed ESVL algorithm. Experimental comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods are performed, and the proposed ESVL-based approach achieves an average max kappa value of 0.60 and 0.71 on BCI Competition IV datasets 2a and 2b respectively. The results show that the proposed ESVL-based approach improves the performance of motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces. Conclusion: The proposed ESVL classifier could use the posterior probabilities to realize ensemble learning and the ESVL-based motor imagery classification approach takes advantage of the merits of ERD/ERS based feature and event-related potential based feature to improve the experimental performance.

EEG correlates of physical effort and reward processing during reinforcement learning	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						effort; feedback-related negativity; human; reinforcement; reward	FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS DOPAMINE; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; PREDICTION ERRORS; SEEKING BEHAVIOR; DECISION-MAKING; SIGNALS; COST	Effort-based decision making is often modeled using subjective value, a function of reward discounted by effort. We asked whether EEG event-related potential (ERP) correlates of reward processing are also modulated by physical effort. Human participants performed a task in which they were required to accurately produce target levels of muscle activation to receive rewards. Quadriceps muscle activation was recorded with electromyography (EMG) during isometric knee extension. On a given trial, the target muscle activation required either low or high effort. The effort was determined probabilistically according to a binary choice, such that the responses were associated with 20% and 80% probability of high effort. This contingency could only be learned through experience, and it reversed periodically. Binary reinforcement feedback depended on accurately producing the target muscle activity. Participants adaptively avoided effort by switching responses more frequently after choices that resulted in hard effort. Feedback after participants' choices that revealed the resulting effort requirement did not elicit modulation of the feedback-related negativity/reward positivity (FRN/RP). However, the neural response to reinforcement outcome after effort production was increased by preceding physical effort. Source decomposition revealed separable early and late positive deflections contributing to the ERP. The main effect of reward outcome, characteristic of the FRN/RP. loaded onto the earlier component, whereas the reward x effort interaction was observed only in the later positivity. which resembled the P300. Thus, retrospective effort modulates reward processing. This may explain paradoxical behavioral findings whereby rewards requiring more effort to obtain can become more powerful reinforcers. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Choices probabilistically determined the physical effort requirements for a subsequent task, and reward depended on task performance. Feedback revealing whether choices resulted in easy or hard effort did not elicit reinforcement learning signals. However, the neural responses to reinforcement were modulated by preceding effort. Thus, effort itself was not treated as loss or punishment, but it affected the responses to subsequent reinforcement outcomes. This may explain how effort can enhance the motivational effect of reward.

However, little is known about the neural correlates of STIs when they first develop. In the present study, we measured event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) using an N400 paradigm. Seventeen 9-year-old Chinese children were first instructed to remember facial photos and paired trait-implying behaviors. Subsequently, they performed a lexical decision task in which faces were used to prime the inferred traits or their antonyms. Compared to the inferred traits, the antonyms exhibited a stronger amplitude on both N400 (370-500 ms) and negative slow wave (NSW; 550-800 ms). However, only N400 showed a right hemispheric dominance of STIs. In addition, ERSP results revealed stronger lower alpha band (7-10 Hz) activity for antonyms than inferred traits over the right parieto-occipital area from 420 ms to 800 ms. These findings, coupled with the electroencephalography (EEG) source localization (standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography [sLORETA]), provide evidence for a "monitoring-control" two-stage neural network.

Patients with mutations of the Thyroid hormone beta-receptor show an ADHD-like phenotype for performance monitoring: an electrophysiological study	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Thyroid hormones (TH); Resistance to thyroid hormones; TH beta receptor; Action monitoring; Event-related potentials; ADHD-like symptoms	DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; ERROR-RELATED-NEGATIVITY; REPORT SCALE ASRS; ADULT ADHD; CINGULATE CORTEX; ERP COMPONENTS; ATTENTION; VALIDITY; RESISTANCE; CHILDREN	Resistance to thyroid hormone beta (RTH beta) is a syndrome of reduced responsiveness of peripheral tissue to thyroid hormone, caused by mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (THRB). Its cognitive phenotype has been reported to be similar to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This study used electrophysiological biomarkers of performance monitoring in RTH beta to contribute further evidence on its phenotypical similarity to ADHD. Twenty-one participants with RTH beta aged 18-67 years and 21 matched healthy controls performed a modified flanker task during EEG recording. The RTH beta and control groups were compared on behavioural measures and components of event related potentials (ERPs), i.e. the error related negativity (ERN), the error positivity (Pe) and P3 component. There were no significant group differences with regard to behaviour. RTH beta subjects displayed significantly reduced ERN and Pe amplitudes compared to the controls in the response-locked ERPs. In addition, we observed reduced P3 amplitudes in both congruent and incongruent trials, as well as prolonged P3 latencies in RTH beta subjects in the stimulus-locked ERPs. Our findings reveal alterations in error detection and performance monitoring of RTH beta patients, likely indicating reduced error awareness. The electrophysiological phenotype of RTH beta subjects with regard to action monitoring is indistinguishable from ADHD.

They represent a relatively simple iconic mapping: the phonological/phonetic properties of the word evokes acoustic related features of referents. Here, we explore the EEG correlates of processing onomatopoeia in English. Participants were presented with a written cue-word (e.g., leash) and then with a spoken target-word. The target-word was either an onomatopoeia (e.g., bark), a sound-related but arbitrary word (e.g., melody), or another arbitrary word (e.g., bike). Participants judged whether the cue- and the target-word were similar in meaning. We analysed Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) in different time-windows: (i) early (100-200 and 200-250 ms) to assess differences in processing at the form-level; (ii) the N400 time-window (300-500 ms) in order to establish if there are differences in semantic processing across our word-types; and (iii) late (600-900 ms) to assess post-lexical effects. We found that onomatopoeia differed from the other words in the N400 time-window: when cue and target were unrelated, onomatopoeic words led to greater negativity which can be accounted for in terms of enhanced semantic activation of onomatopoeia which leads to greater salience of the mismatch. We discuss results in the context of a growing body of literature investigating iconicity in language processing and development.

Neural indices of orienting, discrimination, and conflict monitoring after contextual fear and safety learning	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Event-related potential; Anxiety; Attention	ATTENTIONAL CONTROL; VIGILANCE-AVOIDANCE; TRAIT ANXIETY; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; SOCIAL ANXIETY; THREAT; EMOTION; ERP; COMPONENT	Investigations of fear conditioning have recently begun to evaluate contextual factors that affect attention-related processes. However, much of the extant literature does not evaluate how contextual fear learning influences neural indicators of attentional processes during goal-directed activity. The current study evaluated how early attention for task-relevant stimuli and conflict monitoring were affected when presented within task-irrelevant safety and threat contexts after fear learning. Participants (N= 72) completed a Flanker task with modified context before and after context-dependent fear learning. Flanker stimuli were presented in the same threat and safety contexts utilized in the fear learning task while EEG was collected. Results indicated increased early attention (N1) to flankers appearing in threat contexts and later increased neural indicators (P2) of attention to flankers appearing in safety contexts. Results of this study indicate that contextual fear learning modulates early attentional processes for task-relevant stimuli that appear in the context of safety and threat. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.

It is not clear whether these effects are distinct or related phenomena, or whether they are early sensory effects or late decisional processes. Combining electroencephalography and electrocardiography, along with signal detection theory analyses, we identify two distinct heartbeat-related influences on conscious perception differentially related to early vs. late somatosensory processing. First, an effect on early sensory processing was found for the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP), a marker of cardiac interoception. The amplitude of the prestimulus HEP negatively correlated with localization and detection of somatosensory stimuli, reflecting a more conservative detection bias (criterion). Importantly, higher HEP amplitudes were followed by decreases in early (P50) as well as late (N140, P300) somatosensoryevoked potential (SEP) amplitudes. Second, stimulus timing along the cardiac cycle also affected perception. During systole, stimuli were detected and correctly localized less frequently, relating to a shift in perceptual sensitivity. This perceptual attenuationwas accompanied by the suppression of only late SEP components (P300) and was stronger for individuals with a more stable heart rate. Both heart-related effects were independent of alpha oscillations' influence on somatosensory processing. We explain cardiac cycle timing effects in a predictive coding account and suggest that HEP-related effects might reflect spontaneous shifts between interoception and exteroception or modulations of general attentional resources. Thus, our results provide a general conceptual framework to explain how internal signals can be integrated into our conscious perception of the world.

Several previous studies have indicated that stream segregation may precede temporal integration when both processes are required. In the present study, we utilized mismatch negativity (MMN)-which reflects automatic change detection-to systematically estimate the threshold of the frequency difference at which stream segregation occurs prior to temporal integration when these functions occur together during a state of inattention. Electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded from 22 healthy Japanese men presented with six blocks of alternating high pure tones (high tones) and low pure tones (low tones). Only high tones were omitted with 5 % probability in all blocks. Our results indicated that stream segregation should cancel temporal integration of close sounds, as indicated by omission-MMN elicitation, when the frequency difference is 1000 Hz or larger.

In contrast, abstract verbs (e.g., think, dissolve) are often treated as a homogeneous category. We compared event-related potentials recorded during a syntactic classification task of four verb types; 1) ab-stract mental, 2) abstract emotional, 3) abstract nonbodily, and 4) concrete. Abstract nonbodily state verbs showed a sustained negativity at frontocentral electrodes and sustained positivity at parietal and occipital electrodes beginning 400 ms post-stimulus onset relative to abstract mental state and concrete verbs. Discrete source localization revealed a right inferior parietal source for all verbs and a distributed source estimation localized sources that distinguished between abstract mental state and abstract nonbodily state verbs to bilateral parietal cortex, left temporal cortex and right ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that different types of abstract verbs are associated with representational differences.

J	Ismail, LE; Karwowski, W				Ismail, Lina Elsherif; Karwowski, Waldemar			Applications of EEG indices for the quantification of human cognitive performance: A systematic review and bibliometric analysis	PLOS ONE			English	Review							ADAPTIVE AUTOMATION SYSTEM; FRONTAL THETA ACTIVITY; AIR-TRAFFIC-CONTROL; MENTAL FATIGUE; DRIVER FATIGUE; WAVELET TRANSFORM; MEMORY LOAD; VIGILANCE LEVEL; DUAL-TASK; DROWSINESS ESTIMATION	Background Neuroergonomics combines neuroscience with ergonomics to study human performance using recorded brain signals. Such neural signatures of performance can be measured using a variety of neuroimaging techniques, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and electroencephalography (EEG). EEG has an excellent temporal resolution, and EEG indices are highly sensitive to human brain activity fluctuations. Objective The focus of this systematic review was to explore the applications of EEG indices for quantifying human performance in a variety of cognitive tasks at the macro and micro scales. To identify trends and the state of the field, we examined global patterns among selected articles, such as journal contributions, highly cited papers, affiliations, and high-frequency keywords. Moreover, we discussed the most frequently used EEG indices and synthesized current knowledge regarding the EEG signatures of associated human performance measurements. Methods In this systematic review, we analyzed articles published in English (from peer-reviewed journals, proceedings, and conference papers), Ph.D. dissertations, textbooks, and reference books. All articles reviewed herein included exclusively EEG-based experimental studies in healthy participants. We searched Web-of-Science and Scopus databases using specific sets of keywords. Results Out of 143 papers, a considerable number of cognitive studies focused on quantifying human performance with respect to mental fatigue, mental workload, mental effort, visual fatigue, emotion, and stress. An increasing trend for publication in this area was observed, with the highest number of publications in 2017. Most studies applied linear methods (e.g., EEG power spectral density and the amplitude of event-related potentials) to evaluate human cognitive performance. A few papers utilized nonlinear methods, such as fractal dimension, largest Lyapunov exponent, and signal entropy. More than 50% of the studies focused on evaluating an individual's mental states while operating a vehicle. Several different methods of artifact removal have also been noted. Based on the reviewed articles, research gaps, trends, and potential directions for future research were explored. Conclusion This systematic review synthesized current knowledge regarding the application of EEG indices for quantifying human performance in a wide variety of cognitive tasks. This knowledge is useful for understanding the global patterns of applications of EEG indices for the analysis and design of cognitive tasks.

In auditory processing, violations of local (within-trial) expectations elicit a mismatch negativity (MMN), while violations of global (across-trial) expectations elicit a later positive component (P300). This result is taken as evidence of prediction errors ascending through the expectation hierarchy. However, in language comprehension, there is no evidence that violations of semantic expectations across local-global levels similarly elicit a sequence of hierarchical error signals, thus drawing into question the putative link between event-related potentials (ERPs) and prediction errors. We investigated the neural basis of such hierarchical expectations of semantics in a word-pair priming paradigm. By manipulating the overall proportion of related or unrelated wordpairs across the task, we created two global contexts that differentially encouraged strategic use of primes. Across two experiments, we replicated behavioral evidence of greater priming in the high validity context, reflecting strategic expectations of upcoming targets based on "global" context. In our preregistered EEG analyses, we observed a "local" prediction error ERP effect (i.e., semantic priming) similar to 250 ms post-target, which, in exploratory analyses, was followed 100 ms later by a signal that interacted with the global context. However, the later effect behaved in an apredictive manner, i.e., was most extreme for fulfilled expectations, rather than violations. Our results are consistent with interpretations of early ERPs as reflections of prediction error and later ERPs as processes related to conscious access and in support of task demands.

Neural characteristics of cognitive reappraisal success and failure: An ERP study	BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						increased late positive potentials; P200 component; reappraisal success and failure	EMOTION REGULATION; POSITIVE REAPPRAISAL; DISTRACTION; ATTENTION; PICTURES	Introduction Cognitive reappraisal, an important strategy of emotion regulation, can change emotional experience and attention to emotional information. However, not all individuals can deploy reappraisal strategies successfully. In the current study, we investigated event-related potential (ERP) characteristics of reappraisal success and of reappraisal failure. Methods Twenty-six participants were divided into the success group or the failure group based on self-report ratings of how successful they were in reducing their response to negative images using cognitive reappraisal strategy. All participants viewed 30 neutral images and 30 negative images which they were asked to just watch, and 30 negative stimuli that they were asked to reappraise, while electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Results The success group reported a significant reduction in the unpleasantness of negative images than the failure group in the negative-reappraisal condition. The ERP data indicated that two time windows differentiated between the success and failure groups. In 200-300 ms, P200 was significantly more positive to the negative-watch condition relative to both negative-reappraisal and neutral conditions in the failure group, while no difference was observed in the success group. In 300-5,000 ms, cognitive reappraisal led to increased late positive potential (LPP) relative to negative-watch in the early and middle latency windows (300-3,100 ms) in both groups; in the late latency window (3,100-5,000 ms), the reappraisal success group showed the LPP amplitude to the negative-reappraisal stimuli to be more positive than to the negative-watch stimuli, while no difference was found in the reappraisal failure group. Conclusion Our study provided direct evidence that different neurophysiological features were associated with reappraisal success and failure while engaging in the reappraisal of negative stimuli. This result will contribute to better understanding of the neural mechanism of emotion regulation in emotional disorders (i.e., depression and anxiety).

In particular, the task generates two theoretically interesting effects: the Simon effect proper and the sequential modulations of this effect. In the present study, we review the main theoretical explanations of both kinds of effects and the available neuroscientific studies that investigated the neural underpinnings of the cognitive processes underlying the Simon effect proper and its sequential modulation using electroencephalogram (EEG) and event-related brain potentials (ERP), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Then, we relate the neurophysiological findings to the main theoretical accounts and evaluate their validity and empirical plausibility, including general implications related to processing interference and cognitive control. Overall, neurophysiological research supports claims that stimulus location triggers the creation of a spatial code, which activates a spatially compatible response that, in incompatible conditions, interferes with the response based on the task instructions. Integration of stimulus-response features plays a major role in the occurrence of the Simon effect (which is manifested in the selection of the response) and its modulation by sequential congruency effects. Additional neural mechanisms are involved in supporting the correct and inhibiting the incorrect response.

J	Isel, F; Shen, WL				Isel, Frederic; Shen, Weilin			Perception of lexical neutral tones in mandarin compounds: Electroencephalographic evidence from an oddball paradigm	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Compound; Mandarin; Neutral tone; EEG Oddball; PAP model; N325	ARTICULATION INFLUENCES; SPOKEN; ERP; SEGMENTATION; CHILDREN; STRESS; ACCESS; WORDS	The present electroencephalographic (EEG) study was designed to investigate the perception of Mandarin neutral tone (T0) by adult Mandarin speakers. For this purpose, we examined the event-related brain potential (ERP) correlates of T0 processing in two-character Mandarin compounds. Eighteen native Mandarin speakers were tested using a modified oddball paradigm. Sixty strong-strong and 60 strong-weak (T0) disyllabic Mandarin compounds were selected from the Contemporary Chinese Dictionary. Participants performed one explicit task of stress discrimination (i.e., deciding whether the fourth word in sequences of 4 spoken words had the same stress pattern as the previous words or a different one) and one implicit task of passive listening. Behaviorally, accuracy showed that Mandarin listeners were able to correctly discriminate T0 from the canonical strong-strong stress pattern in 87.2% of cases. Neurophysiologically, larger N200 and P200 were observed for the infrequent strong-weak stress pattern compared to the canonical strong-strong one. Critically, a N325 was replicated in Mandarin, with a larger N325 for strong-weak than for strong-strong compounds. Consistently with a previous interpretation proposed by Bocker et al. (1999) for Dutch, we argue that the N325 might be a manifestation of the extraction of stress pattern in Mandarin also. Taken together, the present data on T0 perception in Mandarin are discussed in the context of the Prosody-Assisted-Processing (PAP) model (Isel et al., 2003), a cognitive model of spoken compound processing based on stress-timed languages, which postulates an early involvement of prosody in order to guide the morphological analysis at the lexical level.

In two experiments, infants were presented with sounds as primes, followed by images of human figures and furniture items as targets. In experiment 1 (N = 20), images were preceded by infant-directed (ID) or adult-directed (AD) speech to explore effects of intermodal categorical mismatches. Furniture targets (mismatching category) elicited an increased amplitude of the Negative central (Nc) component compared to human targets (matching category), p < .01, indicating increased attention. Results did not vary with manner of speaking (ID or AD). Experiment 2 (N = 17) explored whether a categorical mismatch between prime and target would elicit increased positive slow wave (PSW) amplitudes for human targets, indicating increased memory effort. Here, bicycle ringtones and ID speech served as primes. Again, furniture targets elicited an increased Nc regardless of prime category, p < .05, and a categorical change from human speech to furniture target images elicited an increased PSW, p < .05. No PSW effect was found for human targets following bicycle ringtones, however. The experiments reported here suggest that auditory primes may increase infant attention and memory updating particularly for non-social, categorically mismatching stimuli.

Till date, the diagnosis of DOC relies only on clinical evaluation or subjective scoring systems such as Glasgow coma scale, which fails to detect subtle changes and thereby results in diagnostic errors. The high rate of misdiagnosis and inability to predict the recovery of consciousness for DOC patients have created a huge research interest in the assessment of consciousness. Researchers have explored the use of various stimulation and neuroimaging techniques to improve the diagnosis. In this article, we present the important findings of resting-state as well as sensory stimulation methods and highlight the stimuli proven to be successful in the assessment of consciousness. Primarily, we review the literature based on (a) application/non-use of stimuli (i.e., sensory stimulation/resting state-based), (b) type of stimulation used (i.e., auditory, visual, tactile, olfactory, or mental-imagery), (c) electrophysiological signal used (EEG/ERP, fMRI, PET, EMG, SCL, or ECG). Among the sensory stimulation methods, auditory stimulation has been extensively used, since it is easier to conduct for these patients. Olfactory and tactile stimulation have been less explored and need further research. Emotionally charged stimuli such as subject's own name or narratives in a familiar voice or subject's own face/family pictures or music result in stronger responses than neutral stimuli. Studies based on resting state analysis have employed measures like complexity, power spectral features, entropy and functional connectivity patterns to distinguish between the VS and MCS patients. Resting-state EEG and fMRI are the state-of-the-art techniques and have a huge potential in predicting the recovery of coma patients. Further, EMG and mental-imagery based studies attempt to obtain volitional responses from the VS patients and thus could detect their command-following capability. This may provide an effective means to communicate with these patients. Recent studies have employed fMRI and PET to understand the brain-activation patterns corresponding to the mental imagery. This review promotes our knowledge about the techniques used for the diagnosis of patients with DOC and attempts to provide ideas for future research.

It seems, however, that the degree of deficits strongly depends on the examined subprocess, with the resolution of stimulus-stimulus conflicts being particularly difficult for patients with ADHD. The picture is far less clear regarding stimulus-response conflicts. The current study provides multi-level behavioural and neurophysiological data on this type of conflict monitoring in children with ADHD compared to healthy controls. To account for the potentially strong effects of intra-individual variability, electroencephalogram (EEG) signal decomposition methods were used to analyze the data. Crucially, none of the analyses (behavioural, event-related potentials, or decomposed EEG data) show any differences between the ADHD group and the control group. Bayes statistical analysis confirmed the high likelihood of the null hypothesis being true in all cases. Thus, the data provide multi-level evidence showing that conflict monitoring processes are indeed partly intact in ADHD, even when eliminating possible biasing factors such as intra-individual variability. While stimulus-stimulus conflict processing has been shown to be consistently dysfunctional in ADHD, the resolution of stimulus-response conflicts is not deficient in this patient group. In comparison to other studies, the results provide novel theoretical insights into the nature of conflict control deficits in childhood ADHD.

Using electroencephalography, prenatal to postnatal changes in cortical sensitivity (P1, P2, late positive potential, N170 event-related potentials) to infant and adult faces were examined in relation to reported mother-infant bonding in 40 mothers (M-age = 30.5 years). Prenatal to postnatal increases in P1 and P2 responses to infant faces predicted stronger bonding. Findings suggest that cortical changes in attention allocation rather than in face-specific encoding enhance bonding.

However, wearable robotics increases the risk from falling. Neuroimaging studies have provided evidence for the involvement of frontocentral and parietal cortices in postural control and this opens up the possibility of using decoders for early detection of balance loss by using electroencephalography (EEG). This study investigates the presence of commonly identified components of the perturbation evoked responses (PEP) when a person is in an exoskeleton. We also evaluated the feasibility of using single-trial EEG to predict the loss of balance using a convolution neural network. Overall, the model achieved a mean 5-fold cross-validation test accuracy of 75.2 % across six subjects with 50% as the chance level. We employed a gradient class activation map-based visualization technique for interpreting the decisions of the CNN and demonstrated that the network learns from PEP components present in these single trials. The high localization ability of Grad-CAM demonstrated here, opens up the possibilities for deploying CNN for ERP/PEP analysis while emphasizing on model interpretability.

The goal of our research was to study cognitive impairment in a patient at an early stage of VaD. We evaluated latencies of the P3 GO and NOGO components of event-related potentials (ERPs), elicited in cued GO/NOGO tasks, as potential neuromarkers of cognitive impairment, as suggested by previous research. Case study: The patient, a right-handed, 53-year-old male with a college education, suffered a transient ischemic attack (TIA) in 2011. During this attack, which lasted for a few minutes, he was confused and had trouble speaking, trouble seeing in both eyes, difficulty walking, problems with balance and coordination, and strange behavior. Seven years later, in 2018, he was assessed using the HBI methodology, which consisted of recording (1) a 19-channel EEG in resting state (with eyes open and eyes closed), and (2) a cued GO/NOGO task, and then comparing the results with EEG spectra and Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) data from normative and patient databases. The patient died in 2019. Post-mortem studies confirmed cortical microhaemorrhages neuropathological criteria for VaD. We did not found deposits of hyperphosphorylated tau (HPT) and A beta, which fulfil the neuropathological criteria for AD. Results: The parietal-temporal-occipital EEG power was significantly higher in all conditions in this subject in comparison to healthy controls, indicating idling of the corresponding areas. The amplitude and latency of the P3 GO wave were found to be intact in the subject, indicating normal posterior cortical functioning in the cognitive task. The latency of the P3 GO wave was found to be significantly higher in the subject, indicating impairment of engagement operations. Conclusions: In a GO/NOGO task, ERPs provide a useful tool for assessment of brain functioning in clinical settings.

Modulation of epileptic networks by transient interictal epileptic activity: A dynamic approach to simultaneous EEG-fMRI	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						EEG-fMRI; Epilepsy; Dynamic functional connectivity; Pre-surgical planning	STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SIMULTANEOUS INTRACRANIAL EEG; PHYSIOLOGICAL NOISE; PULSE ARTIFACT; SEIZURES; SPIKES; MRI; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; CLASSIFICATION; LOCALIZATION	Epileptic networks, defined as brain regions involved in epileptic brain activity, have been mapped by functional connectivity in simultaneous electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) recordings. This technique allows to define brain hemodynamic changes, measured by the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal, associated to the interictal epileptic discharges (IED), which together with ictal events constitute a signature of epileptic disease. Given the highly time-varying nature of epileptic activity, a dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis of EEG-fMRI data appears particularly suitable, having the potential to identify transitory features of specific connections in epileptic networks. In the present study, we propose a novel method, defined dFC-EEG, that integrates dFC assessed by fMRI with the information recorded by simultaneous scalp EEG, in order to identify the connections characterised by a dynamic profile correlated with the occurrence of IED, forming the dynamic epileptic subnetwork. Ten patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy were included, with different aetiology and showing a widespread (or multilobar) BOLD activation, defined as involving at least two distinct clusters, located in two different lobes and/or extended to the hemisphere contralateral to the epileptic focus. The epileptic focus was defined from the IED-related BOLD map. Regions involved in the occurrence of interictal epileptic activity; i.e., forming the epileptic network, were identified by a general linear model considering the timecourse of the fMRI-defined focus as main regressor. dFC between these regions was assessed with a sliding-window approach. dFC timecourses were then correlated with the sliding-window variance of the IED signal (VarIED), to identify connections whose dynamics related to the epileptic activity; i.e., the dynamic epileptic subnetwork. As expected, given the very different clinical picture of each individual, the extent of this subnetwork was highly variable across patients, but was but was reduced of at least 30% with respect to the initially identified epileptic network in 9/10 patients. The connections of the dynamic subnetwork were most commonly close to the epileptic focus, as reflected by the laterality index of the subnetwork connections, reported higher than the one within the original epileptic network. Moreover, the correlation between dFC timecourses and VarIED was predominantly positive, suggesting a strengthening of the dynamic subnetwork associated to the occurrence of IED. The integration of dFC and scalp IED offers a more specific description of the epileptic network, identifying connections strongly influenced by IED. These findings could be relevant in the pre-surgical evaluation for the resection or disconnection of the epileptogenic zone and help in reaching a better post-surgical outcome. This would be particularly important for patients characterised by a widespread pathological brain activity which challenges the surgical intervention.	[Iannotti, G.

The exact nature of this differentiation is unclear. To this end, EEG (electrophysiological) responses to prepulse inhibition (PPI: reflecting attentional modulation) and prepulse facilitation (PPF: indicating orienting activation) were recorded and analysed. The aim of this study was to compare the respective neural oscillations associated with PPI and PPF in BDD vs healthy controls. Materials and Methods Event-related EEG oscillations elicited by PPI and PPF (26 and 25 trials, respectively, randomly presented) were explored in a sample of patients with BDD (N = 30) vs healthy controls (N = 25). The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale for BDD (BDD-YBOCS), the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Examination, the Dysmorphic Concern Questionnaire (DCQ) and the Brown Assessment of Belief Scale (BABS) were also administered. Results Analysis of the power spectrum in response to PPI and PPF revealed that the BDD patient group compared to healthy controls exhibited higher theta-1 oscillations (potentially indicative of disrupted thalamo-cortical activation) and reduced beta-1 oscillations (potentially indicative of reduced top-down-controlled processing during attentional orienting). Conclusion These findings offer novel contributions with regards to the neural mechanisms underlying attention processes in BDD patients, and demonstrate the potential of event-related EEG oscillations as a tool to better understand body dysmorphic disorder.

Subsequently changing the target location within a learned layout abolishes contextual cuing, which is difficult to relearn. Here, we used lateralized event-related electroencephalogram (EEG) potentials to explore memory-based attentional guidance (N = 16). The results revealed reliable contextual cuing during initial learning and an associated EEG-amplitude increase for repeated layouts in attention-related components, starting with an early posterior negativity (N1pc, 80-180 ms). When the target was relocated to the opposite hemifield following learning, contextual cuing was effectively abolished, and the N1pc was reversed in polarity (indicative of persistent misguidance of attention to the original target location). Thus, once learned, repeated layouts trigger attentional-priority signals from memory that proactively interfere with contextual relearning after target relocation.

The traditional machine study is to directly input EEG into Neural Networks and not to consider the influence of time series for data accuracy and Bi-LSTM is not only to inherit the treatment of LSTM to timely constraint, but also combine the influence of two-way factors on neutral network, which has good computing advantage. This essay adopts a kind of the study of EEG recognition of depression on Bi-LSTM based on ERP.

For this class of disorders, which are characterized by affective, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms, electroencephalography remains the dominant tool for providing insight into the physiological and molecular underpinnings of the disease state and predicting the effectiveness of investigational new drugs. Within the spectrum of electrical activity present in the CNS, high-frequency oscillations in the gamma band are frequently altered in these patient populations. Measurement of gamma oscillation can be further classified into baseline and evoked, each of which offers a specific commentary on disease state. Baseline gamma analysis provides a surrogate of pharmacodynamics and predicting the time course effects of clinical candidate drugs, while alterations in evoked (time-locked) gamma power may serve as a disease biomarker and have utility in assessing patient response to new drugs. Together, these techniques offer complimentary methods of analysis for discrete realms of clinical and translational medicine. In terms of drug development, comprehensive analysis containing aspects of both baseline and evoked gamma oscillations may prove more useful in establishing better workflow and more accurate criteria for the testing of investigational new drugs.

In patients with schizophrenia, MMN is consistently reduced, which makes it a promising biomarker. A non-human primate (NHP) model of MMN based on scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings can provide a useful translational tool, given the high structural homology of the prefrontal and auditory cortices between NHPs, such as macaques, and humans. However, in previous MMN studies, the NHP models used did not allow for comparison with humans because of differences in task settings. Moreover, duration-deviant MMN (dMMN), whose reduction is larger than that in the frequency-deviant MMN (fMMN) in patients with schizophrenia, has never been demonstrated in NHP models. In this study, we determined whether dMMN can be observed in macaque scalp EEG recordings. EEGs were recorded from frontal electrodes (Fz) in two Japanese macaques. Consistent with clinical settings, auditory stimuli consisted of two pure tones, a standard and a deviant tone, in an oddball paradigm. The deviant and standard tones differed in duration (50 and 100 ms for the standard and deviant tones, respectively). A robust dMMN with a latency of around 200 ms, comparable to that in humans, was observed in both monkeys. A comparison with fMMN showed that the dMMN latency was the longer of the two. By bridging the gap between basic and clinical research, our results will contribute to the development of innovative therapeutic strategies for schizophrenia.

J	van Vliet, M; Salmelin, R				van Vliet, Marijn; Salmelin, Riitta			Post-hoc modification of linear models: Combining machine learning with domain information to make solid inferences from noisy data	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Multivariate analysis; Linear model; Prior knowledge; Event-related potentials; N400; EEG	BRAIN; EEG; MEG; COMPONENT; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; SELECTION; PATTERNS; ARTIFACT; INVERSE	Linear machine learning models "learn" a data transformation by being exposed to examples of input with the desired output, forming the basis for a variety of powerful techniques for analyzing neuroimaging data. However, their ability to learn the desired transformation is limited by the quality and size of the example dataset, which in neuroimaging studies is often notoriously noisy and small. In these cases, it is desirable to fine-tune the learned linear model using domain information beyond the example dataset. To this end, we present a framework that decomposes the weight matrix of a fitted linear model into three subcomponents: the data covariance, the identified signal of interest, and a normalizer. Inspecting these subcomponents in isolation provides an intuitive way to inspect the inner workings of the model and assess its strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, the three subcomponents may be altered, which provides a straightforward way to inject prior information and impose additional constraints. We refer to this process as "post-hoc modification" of a model and demonstrate how it can be used to achieve precise control over which aspects of the model are fitted to the data through machine learning and which are determined through domain information. As an example use case, we decode the associative strength between words from electroencephalography (EEG) reading data. Our results show how the decoding accuracy of two example linear models (ridge regression and logistic regression) can be boosted by incorporating information about the spatio-temporal nature of the data, domain information about the N400 evoked potential and data from other participants.

Neural correlates underlying the effect of reward value on recognition memory	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; P300; ACTIVATION; MODULATION; DYNAMICS; RECOLLECTION; INFORMATION; PREDICTION; SUBSTRATE; COMPONENT	The prioritized encoding and retrieval of valuable information is an essential aspect of human memory. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to determine which of two hypothesized processes underlies the influence of reward value on episodic memory. One hypothesis is that value engages prefrontal executive control processes, so that valuable stimuli engage an elaborative rehearsal strategy that benefits memory. A second hypothesis is that value acts through the reward-related midbrain dopamine system to modulate synaptic plasticity in hippocampal and cortical efferents, thereby benefiting memory encoding. We used a value-directed recognition memory (VDR) paradigm in which participants encoded words assigned different point values and aimed to maximize the point value of subsequently recognized words. Subjective states of recollection (i.e., "remember") and familiarity (i.e., "know") were assessed at retrieval. Words assigned higher values at study were recognized more effectively than words assigned lower values, due to increased "remember" responses but no difference in "know" responses. Greater value was also associated with larger amplitudes of an EEG component at retrieval that indexes recollection (parietal old/new component), but had no relationship with a component that indexes familiarity (FN400 component). During encoding, we assessed a late frontal positivity (frontal slow wave, FSW) that has been related to elaborative rehearsal strategies and an early parietal component (P3) thought to index dopamine driven attention allocation. Our findings indicate that the effect of value on recognition memory is primarily driven by the dopamine-driven reward valuation system (P3) with no discernible effect on rehearsal processes (FSW).

Because of this, a large amount of resources has been allocated to assess the vulnerability to dependence, i.e., to identify the processes underlying the transition from substance use to dependence, as well as its course, in order to determine the key points in its prevention, treatment, and recovery. Consequently, knowledge \from neuroscience must be taken into account, which is why different initiatives have emerged with this objective, such as the "Research Domain Criteria" (RDoC), and the "Addiction Neuroclinical Assessment" (ANA). Particularly, neuropsychophysiological measures could be used as markers of cognitive and behavioral attributes or traits in alcohol dependence, and even trace clinical change. In this way, the aim of this narrative review is to provide an overview following ANA clinical framework, to the most robust findings in neuropsychophysiological changes in alcohol dependence, that underlie the main cognitive domains implicated in addiction: incentive salience, negative emotionality, and executive functioning. The most consistent results have been found in event-related potential (ERP) analysis, especially in the P3 component, that could show a wide clinical utility, mainly for the executive functions. The review also shows the usefulness of other components, implicated in affective and substance-related processing (P1, N1, or the late positive potential LPP), as well as event-related oscillations, such as theta power, with a possible use as vulnerability or clinical marker in alcohol dependence. Finally, new tools emerging from psychophysiology research, based on functional connectivity or brain graph analysis could help toward a better understanding of altered circuits in alcohol dependence, as well as communication efficiency and effort during mental operations. This review concludes with an examination of these tools as possible markers in the clinical field and discusses methodological differences, the need for more replicability studies and incipient lines of work. It also uses consistent findings in psychophysiology to draw possible treatment targets and cognitive profiles in alcohol dependence.

To explore the possible differences in the influence of motivation on behavioral performance and neural activity in high and low vigilance levels, we conducted a prolonged 2 h 20 min flanker task and provided monetary rewards during the 20- to 40- and 100- to 120-min intervals of task performance. Both the behavioral and electrophysiological measures were modulated by prolonged task engagement. Moreover, the effect of reward was different in high vs. low vigilance states. The monetary reward increased accuracy and decreased the reaction time (RT) and number of omitted responses in the low but not in the high vigilance state. The fatigue-related decrease in P300 amplitude recovered to its level in the high vigilance state by manipulating motivation, whereas the fatigue-related increase in P300 latency was not modulated by reward. Additionally, the fatigue-related increase in event-related spectral power at 1-4 Hz was sensitive to vigilance decrement and reward. However, the spectral power at 4-8 Hz was only affected by the decrease in vigilance. These electrophysiological measures were not influenced by motivation in the state of high vigilance. Our results suggest that neural processing capacity, but not the timing of processing, is sensitive to motivation. These findings also imply that the fatigue-related impairments in behavioral performance and neural activity underlying selective visual attention only partly recover after manipulating motivation. Furthermore, our results provide evidence for the dissociable neural mechanisms underlying the fatigue-related decrease vs. reward-related increase in attentional resources.

NEW & NOTEWORTHY For both basic and applied reasons, an important goal is to identify brain activity present while people study materials that enable us to predict whether they will remember those materials. We show that this is possible with the conventional event-related potential "subsequent-memory-effect" signals as well as with machine learning classifiers, but only to a small degree. This is in line with behavioral research, which supports many determinants of mem-ory apart from the cognitive processes during study.

J	Wolff, N; Beste, C				Wolff, Nicole; Beste, Christian			Short-term Smartphone App-Based Focused Attention Meditation Diminishes Cognitive Flexibility	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RESPONSE SELECTION; LATENCY VARIABILITY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; ERP COMPONENTS; TASK SETS; DECOMPOSITION; EEG; MECHANISMS; INHIBITION	Cognitive flexibility is an important aspect relevant to daily life situations, and there is an increasing public interest to optimize these functions, for example, using (brief) meditation practices. However, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. On the basis of theoretical considerations, both improvements and deteriorations of cognitive flexibility are possible through focused attention meditation (FAM). We investigated the effect of a brief smartphone app-based FAM on task switching using EEG methods, temporal signal decomposition, and source localization techniques (standardized low-resolution electromagnetic brain tomography). The study was conducted using a crossover study design. We show that even 15 min of FAM practicing modulates memory-based task switching, on a behavioral level and a neurophysiological level. More specifically, FAM hampers response selection and conflict resolution processes and seem to reduce cognitive resources, which are necessary to rapidly adapt to changing conditions. These effects are represented in the N2 and P3 time windows and associated with ACC. It seems that FAM increases the attention to one specific aspect, which may help to focus but carries also the risk that behavior becomes too rigid. FAM thus seems to modulate both the stimulus- and response-related aspects of conflict monitoring in ACC. Motor-related processes were not affected. The results can be explained using a cognitive control dilemma framework, suggesting that particularly alterations in background monitoring may be important to consider when explaining the effects of FAM during task switching.

Besides sensory-related cortical areas, the cerebellum has been suggested as a key structure in temporal processing and in the anticipation of future events. Hence, patients with cerebellum lesions show impaired precision in temporal processing as reflected in the reduced ability to exploit temporal regularity. Using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), we here aimed to draw further causal conclusions on the human cerebellum as functionally relevant in temporal processing of acoustic events. We focused on the electrophysiologic P3b, a large positive wave apparent in the electroencephalography (EEG), that represents encoding of task-relevant events and that has been demonstrated as sensitive to the exploitation of temporal regularities. Participants received 30 min of anodal, cathodal or sham tDCS over the cerebellum while they performed two oddball paradigms with different temporal regularities in that the acoustic stimuli were presented. Following clinical observations, we hypothesized that tDCS-effects will be present in the regular oddball paradigm only, thus, in the condition that allows anticipating the occurrence of subsequent stimuli. In result, we found that cathodal tDCS over the cerebellum reduced the P3b-amplitude specifically in response to target stimuli in the regular paradigm. Thereby, tDCS-induced changes mirror the effects of cerebellar lesions in clinical samples. Our data provides direct evidence for a causal link between the human cerebellum and auditory processing of temporal regularity and emphasize future work on a potential benefit of cerebellar-tDCS in clinical samples.

Behavioral studies show that FE recognition ability decreases with aging. Studying how event-related brain oscillations change with normal aging is important to better understand the underlying mechanisms of emotional processes. The aim of this study is to investigate changes in FE recognition due to normal aging using the EEG-Brain Oscillations approach. Fifteen young and fifteen elderly healthy subjects were included in the study. 15 photographs were used with 5 different FEs (angry, happy, neutral, sad, fearful). After each EEG recording session, subjects were asked to identify the FEs that were presented. Event-related delta, theta and, alpha phase-locking and frequency-band responses were analyzed. In the FE recognition part of the study, young subjects obtained better scores than the elderly subjects. There was a significant result regarding the locationXgroup comparison in the delta response; the young group had a higher delta response than the elderly group over the occipital area. There were significant locationXgroup differences in the theta and alpha phase locking values; the elderly group had higher theta and alpha phase locking values than the young group in the frontal area. Group differences were significant in the theta response and theta phase locking; the elderly individuals' theta response and phase locking values were higher compared to those of the young individuals. In elderly individuals, FE recognition impairment has been observed. It has been shown that the impairment may be characterized by decreased occipital delta responses and phase locking. This can be interpreted to mean that elderly individuals may have developed different brain dynamics as a compensating mechanism since they are not as efficient as young individuals in performing these functions.

In the visual domain, the representation of orthographically unfamiliar words at the phonological or conceptual levels may facilitate their orthographic learning. The neural correlates of this advantage were investigated by recording EEG activity during reading novel and familiar words across three different experiments (n = 22 each), manipulating the availability of previous knowledge on the novel written words. A different pattern of event-related potential (ERP) responses was found depending on the previous training, resembling cross-level top-down interactive effects during vocabulary acquisition. Thus, whereas previous phonological experience caused a modulation at the post-lexical stages of the visual recognition of novel written words (similar to 520 ms), additional semantic training influenced their processing at a lexico-semantic stage (similar to 320 ms). Moreover, early lexical differences (similar to 180 ms) elicited in the absence of previous training did not emerge after both phonological and semantic training, reflecting similar orthographic processing and word-form access.

Our goal was to provide an overview of a series of determining neurophysiological findings including neural source reconstruction data on distinct executive control processes and sub-processes involved in the Stroop task. Consistently, a fronto-central N2 component is found to reflect conflict monitoring processes, with its main neural generator being the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Then, for cognitive control tasks that involve a linguistic component like the Stroop task, the N2 is followed by a centro-posterior N400 and subsequently a late sustained potential (LSP). The N400 is mainly generated by the ACC and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and is thought to reflect interference suppression, whereas the LSP plausibly reflects conflict resolution processes. The present overview shows that ERP constitute a reliable methodological tool for tracing with precision the time course of different executive processes and sub-processes involved in experimental tasks involving a cognitive conflict. Future research should shed light on the fine-grained mechanisms of control respectively involved in linguistic and non-linguistic tasks.

Behavioral, Physiological and EEG Activities Associated with Conditioned Fear as Sensors for Fear and Anxiety dagger	SENSORS			English	Review						scalp EEG; Event Related Spectral Perturbation; Event Related Potential; fear conditioning; human; expectation; fear; anxiety		Anxiety disorders impose substantial costs upon public health and productivity in the USA and worldwide. At present, these conditions are quantified by self-report questionnaires that only apply to behaviors that are accessible to consciousness, or by the timing of responses to fear- and anxiety-related words that are indirect since they do not produce fear, e.g., Dot Probe Test and emotional Stroop. We now review the conditioned responses (CRs) to fear produced by a neutral stimulus (conditioned stimulus CS+) when it cues a painful laser unconditioned stimulus (US). These CRs include autonomic (Skin Conductance Response) and ratings of the CS+ unpleasantness, ability to command attention, and the recognition of the association of CS+ with US (expectancy). These CRs are directly related to fear, and some measure behaviors that are minimally accessible to consciousness e.g., economic scales. Fear-related CRs include non-phase-locked phase changes in oscillatory EEG power defined by frequency and time post-stimulus over baseline, and changes in phase-locked visual and laser evoked responses both of which include late potentials reflecting attention or expectancy, like the P300, or contingent negative variation. Increases (ERS) and decreases (ERD) in oscillatory power post-stimulus may be generalizable given their consistency across healthy subjects. ERS and ERD are related to the ratings above as well as to anxious personalities and clinical anxiety and can resolve activity over short time intervals like those for some moods and emotions. These results could be incorporated into an objective instrumented test that measures EEG and CRs of autonomic activity and psychological ratings related to conditioned fear, some of which are subliminal. As in the case of instrumented tests of vigilance, these results could be useful for the direct, objective measurement of multiple aspects of the risk, diagnosis, and monitoring of therapies for anxiety disorders and anxious personalities.

Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology based on motor imagery (MI) control has become a research hotspot but continues to encounter numerous challenges. BCI can assist in the recovery of stroke patients and serve as a key technology in robot control. Current research on MI almost exclusively focuses on the hands, feet, and tongue. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to establish a four-class MI BCI system, in which the four types are the four articulations within the right upper limbs, involving the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand. Approach. Ten subjects were chosen to perform nine upper-limb analytic movements, after which the differences were compared in P300, movement-related potentials(MRPS), and event-related desynchronization/event-related synchronization under voluntary MI (V-MI) and involuntary MI (INV-MI). Next, the cross-frequency coupling (CFC) coefficient based on mutual information was extracted from the electrodes and frequency bands with interest. Combined with the image Fourier transform and twin bounded support vector machine classifier, four kinds of electroencephalography data were classified, and the classifier's parameters were optimized using a genetic algorithm. Main results. The results were shown to be encouraging, with an average accuracy of 93.2% and 92.2% for V-MI and INV-MI, respectively, and over 95% for any three classes and any two classes. In most cases, the accuracy of feature extraction using the proximal articulations as the basis was found to be relatively high and had better performance. Significance. This paper discussed four types of MI according to three aspects under two modes and classed them by combining graph Fourier transform and CFC. Accordingly, the theoretical discussion and classification methods may provide a fundamental theoretical basis for BCI interface applications.

Frontal and parietal motor-related brain regions are generally engaged during MI. The present study aimed to investigate the time course and neural correlates of complex action imagery and possible effects of expertise on the underlying action representation processes. Professional ballet dancers and controls were presented with effortful and effortless ballet steps and instructed to mentally reproduce each movement during EEG recording. Time-locked MI was associated with an Anterior Negativity (AN) component (400-550 ms) that was larger in dancers relative to controls. The AN was differentially modulated by the motor content (effort) as a function of ballet expertise. It was more negative in response to effortful (than effortless) movements in control participants only. This effect also had a frontal distribution in controls and a centro-parietal distribution in dancers, as shown by the topographic maps of the scalp voltage. The source reconstruction (swLORETA) of the recorded potentials in the AN time-window showed enhanced engagement of prefrontal regions in controls (BA 10/47) relative to dancers, and occipitotemporal (BA 20) and bilateral sensorimotor areas in dancers (BA6/40) compared with controls. This evidence seems to suggest that kinesthetic MI of complex action relied on visuomotor simulation processes in participants with acquired dance expertise. Simultaneously, increased cognitive demands occurred in participants lacking in motor knowledge with the specific action. Hence, professional dance training may lead to refined action representation processes.

P300, theta (4-7 Hz), and alpha (8-13 Hz) power are related to cognitive functions. In this paper, we selected long-term cognitive tasks to induce mental fatigue. Sternberg-WM paradigm was performed before and after fatigue, and EEG data was collected and analyzed. P300 amplitude had no significant difference in the normal state, but significantly reduced with increasing of the workload in parietal region in the fatigue state. This indicated that mental fatigue reduced the allocatable cognitive resources in the high workload. P300 latency had no significant difference between the normal and fatigue state, indicating that mental fatigue had no significant effect on the speed of cognitive resource allocation. Theta power increased significantly with increasing of the workload only in the normal state, indicating that the high workload required more top-down attention resource input to promote memory retrieval. Mental fatigue weakened attention resource input. Alpha power significantly decreased with increasing of the workload only in the fatigue state, indicating that mental fatigue reduced the energy of suppressing irrelevant information interference in the high workload. Long-term cognitive tasks can impair the allocation of cognitive resources, reduce cognitive ability, and lead to behavioral errors in the high workload. P300 can be used as a biomarker for monitoring mental fatigue in the high workload, besides, theta and alpha rhythms can be used as potential targets for neural oscillations regulation.

To test this possibility, we use electroencephalography to record cortical neural activity after the presentation of reward and punishment feedback during a visuomotor rotation task. Participants were randomly placed into Reward, Punishment, or Control groups and performed the task under different conditions to assess the adaptation (learning) and retention (memory) of the motor task. These conditions featured an incongruent position between the cursor and the target, with the cursor trajectory, rotated 30 degrees counterclockwise, requiring the participant to adapt their movement to hit the target. Feedback based on error magnitude was provided during the Adaptation condition in the form of a positive number (Reward) or negative number (Punishment), each representing a monetary gain or loss, respectively. No reinforcement or visual feedback was provided during the No Vision condition (retention). Performance error and event-related potentials (ERPs) time-locked to feedback presentation were calculated for each participant during both conditions. Punishment feedback reduced performance error and promoted faster learning during the Adaptation condition. In contrast, punishment feedback increased performance error during the No Vision condition compared to Control and Reward groups, which suggests a diminished motor memory. Moreover, the Punishment group showed a significant decrease in the amplitude of ERPs during the No Vision condition compared to the Adaptation condition. The amplitude of ERPs did not change in the other two groups. These results suggest that punishment feedback impairs motor retention by altering the neural processing involved in memory encoding. This study provides a neurophysiological underpinning for the dissociative effects of punishment feedback on motor learning.

Identity-specific neural responses to three categories of face familiarity (own, friend, stranger) using fast periodic visual stimulation	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						EEG; Face identity; Face perception; Personally familiar face; Own-face; Person knowledge	SELF-FACE; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; UNFAMILIAR FACES; BRAIN RESPONSE; RECOGNITION; REPRESENTATIONS; PERCEPTION; REPETITION; ACQUISITION; SYSTEMS	Previous studies have focused on the modulatory effects of face familiarity on different components of an event-related potential (ERP), but there is controversy in the literature regarding the precise component that reflects the process of identity recognition. This may be partly explained by limits to this waveform analysis approach, as waveforms elicited by the presentation of a face are likely to reflect a variety of different cognitive processes that overlap in time. Using fast periodic visual stimulation and EEG (FPVS-EEG), we directly measured the electrophysiological response reflecting identity-specific recognition after isolating it from responses attributable to low-level visual processing and face-selective processes that are not identity-specific. The observed response therefore provides a robust and objective measure of the recognition of a personally familiar face generated bilaterally in the occipito-temporal region. We tested the magnitude of this identity-specific response to three categories of familiarity: the own-face (high familiarity), a friend's face (moderate familiarity), and a stranger's face (no familiarity). We found the largest response to the participant's own-face, followed by an intermediate response to a highly personally familiar face, and the smallest response to an unfamiliar face. An additional response was observed over the posterior cortical midline for familiar faces only, consistent with theories that familiar identity recognition also triggers post-perceptual semantic processing.

Early gamma-oscillations as correlate of localized nociceptive processing in primary sensorimotor cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; gamma-band oscillation; nociception; pain; time-frequency analyses	PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; LASER-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; A-DELTA-FIBER; HUMAN BRAIN; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; CEREBRAL POTENTIALS; CLINICAL-USEFULNESS; PAIN INTENSITY; TACTILE INPUT; MEDIAN-NERVE	Recent studies put forward the idea that stimulus-evoked gamma-band oscillations (GBOs; 30-100 Hz) play a specific role in nociception. So far, evidence for the specificity of GBOs for nociception, their possible involvement in nociceptive sensory discriminatory abilities, and knowledge regarding their cortical sources is just starting to grow. To address these questions. we used electroencephalography (EEG) to record brain activity evoked by phasic nociceptive laser stimuli and tactile stimuli applied at different intensities to the right hand and foot of 12 healthy volunteers. The EEG was analyzed in the time domain to extract phase-locked event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and in three regions of interest in the time-frequency domain (delta/theta, 40-Hz gamma, 70-Hz gamma) to extract stimulus-evoked changes in the magnitude of non-phase-locked brain oscillations. Both nociceptive and tactile stimuli, matched with respect to subjective intensity, elicited phase locked ERPs of increasing amplitude with increasing stimulus intensity. In contrast, only nociceptive stimuli elicited a significant enhancement of GBOs (65-85 Hz, 150-230 ms after stimulus onset), whose magnitude encoded stimulus intensity, whereas tactile stimuli led to a GBO decrease. Following nociceptive hand stimulation, the topographical distribution of GBOs was maximal at contralateral electrode C3. whereas maximum activity following foot stimulation was recorded at the midline electrode Cz. compatible with generation of GBOs in the representations of the hand and foot of the primary sensorimotor cortex, respectively. The differential behavior of high-frequency GBOs and low-frequency 40-Hz GBOs is indicating different functional roles and regions in sensory processing. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Gamma-band oscillations show hand-foot somatotopy compatible with generation in primary sensorimotor cortex and are present following nociceptive but not tactile stimulation of the hand and foot in humans.

Two groups of unbalanced bilinguals were enrolled in pre- and post-tests using the picture naming task, but only the experimental group participated in an eight-day dual-language training session. Event-related potentials (ERPs) showed that, in the experimental group, the N2 mean magnitude was comparable between two languages in the pre-test, but it was larger in the native language (L1) than the second language (L2) in the post-test. In addition, the delta band power was similar between L1 and L2 in the pre-test, but L2 was associated with stronger power than L1 after training. In contrast, the control group showed no significant changes. These findings suggest that increased experience of language use in the dual-language context induces stronger proactive inhibitory control on L1, resulting in its lower activation.

It is of particular interest in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) because individual differences in emotion dysregulation predict impairment. Despite growing recognition of its importance, an understanding of emotional functioning in ADHD needs to be better integrated with the well-known nonemotional attentional impairments in the disorder. Here, we assess differences in early, reactive and later, regulatory attention to emotional stimuli, as well as how impairments in attentional control to nonemotional stimuli are affected under different emotional contexts. METHODS: In all, 130 adolescents (n(ADHD) = 61) completed an emotional go/no-go task while 32-channel electroencephalography data were recorded. Reaction time and accuracy were analyzed using the linear ballistic accumulator model. RESULTS: The multimethod approach provided convergent evidence of increased early, reactive attention capture and overarousal (faster drift rates, increased P1) by positively valenced stimuli in ADHD, but no differences in later attention to emotional stimuli. Overarousal in positive-valence contexts appeared to exacerbate existing ADHD-related impairments in attentional control to nonemotional stimuli as well (reduced N2 amplitude). In contrast, positive-valence contexts facilitated attentional control to nonemotional stimuli for typically developing adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the dynamic interaction of emotion with attentional control in ADHD. Distinguishing reactive and regulatory contributions to emotion dysregulation has been informative for clarifying mechanisms and spurring the development of novel interventions in other disorders. It can be informative in ADHD as well.

BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						inner speech production; overt speech production; event-related brain potentials (ERPs); functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS); preparation of speech production	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LANGUAGE PRODUCTION; PRIVATE SPEECH; SENSORIMOTOR INTERFACE; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; PARIETAL CORTEX; SELF-REGULATION; WORD PRODUCTION	Studies in adults showed differential neural processing between overt and inner speech. So far, it is unclear whether inner and overt speech are processed differentially in children. The present study examines the pre-activation of the speech network in order to disentangle domain-general executive control from linguistic control of inner and overt speech production in 6- to 7-year-olds by simultaneously applying electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Children underwent a picture-naming task in which the pure preparation of a subsequent speech production and the actual execution of speech can be differentiated. The preparation phase does not represent speech per se but it resembles the setting up of the language production network. Only the fNIRS revealed a larger activation for overt, compared to inner, speech over bilateral prefrontal to parietal regions during the preparation phase. Findings suggest that the children's brain can prepare the subsequent speech production. The preparation for overt and inner speech requires different domain-general executive control. In contrast to adults, the children's brain did not show differences between inner and overt speech when a concrete linguistic content occurs and a concrete execution is required. This might indicate that domain-specific executive control processes are still under development.

To be used as such, sufficient test-retest reliability needs to be demonstrated. However, test-retest reliability is underinvestigated for event-related alpha asymmetry. The objective of this study was to examine both short-term within-session and long-term between-session reliability of stimulus-related medial and lateral frontal as well as parietal alpha EEG asymmetry in healthy subjects during a simple emotional face processing task. Twenty-three healthy adults participated in two sessions with a test-retest interval of about 1 week. Reliability was estimated with Pearson's correlation coefficient and paired t test. Results revealed moderate to high within-session reliability of stimulus-related alpha asymmetry for all electrode sites and both conditions. Alpha asymmetry mean values did not change significantly within sessions. Between-session reliability was fair for frontomedial and moderate for frontolateral stimulus-related asymmetry. Exploratory exclusion of subjects with unstable between-session self-rating scores of emotional state and empathy toward stimuli resulted in some higher reliability values. Our results indicate that stimulus-related alpha asymmetry may serve as a useful electrophysiological tool given its adequate within-session reliability. However, long-term stability of stimulus-related frontal alpha asymmetry over 1 week was comparatively low and varied depending on electrode position. Influencing state factors during EEG recording, such as current mood or stimulus engagement, should be considered in future study designs and analyses. Further, we recommend to analyze alpha asymmetry from both frontomedial and frontolateral sites.

J	Szewczyk, JM; Wodniecka, Z				Szewczyk, Jakub M.; Wodniecka, Zofia			The Mechanisms of Prediction Updating That Impact the Processing of Upcoming Word: An Event-Related Potential Study on Sentence Comprehension	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-LEARNING MEMORY AND COGNITION			English	Article						delayed N400; prediction updating; predictions; sentence comprehension; surprisal	LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; LEXICAL PREACTIVATION; SEMANTIC INTEGRATION; GRAMMATICAL GENDER; EYE-MOVEMENTS; EEG-DATA; BRAIN; N400; PREDICTABILITY; ANTICIPATION	One of the most compelling pieces of evidence for the presence of predictions in language comprehension comes from event-related potential (ERP) studies which show that encountering an adjective whose gender marking is inconsistent with that of a highly expectable noun leads to an effect at the adjective. Until now the mechanism underlying this effect has been unknown. The present study tests a novel hypothesis whereby the effect at adjectives reflects prediction updating, which in turn impacts the N400 generated by the upcoming noun. In 2 experiments, native speakers of Polish read short stories that made several nouns likely at the position of a direct object in the story's final sentence. The noun was preceded by a gender-marked adjective which was shown in either of the 2 grammatical forms: (a) informative about the following noun (adjectival gender marking constrained which nouns can follow), or (b) less informative (the grammatical marking did not disambiguate the gender of the following noun). Importantly, the same stories and critical words were used in both conditions, which was possible thanks to exploiting syncretisms in Polish adjectival inflection. The results provide support for I or more mechanisms of prediction updating at the adjective that impact the amplitude of the N400 elicited by the following noun. Together, these results show that when only morphosyntactic cues are available, they are instantly used to update predictions about upcoming words.

Event-related oscillations (EROs) as oscillatory responses in the EEG to specific events further provide the possibility to track the cognitive decline in a task-specific manner. Current study in search for potential ERO biomarkers to distinguish different stages of cognitive decline along the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) continuum re-analyzed a combined set of data collected and analyzed in previous studies by Basar and coworkers. Target responses of a visual oddball experiment recorded from 33 AD patients, 46 Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients and 48 age, gender, and education matched normal elderly controls were analyzed for both evoked (phase-locked) and total (phase-locked + non-phase-locked) ERO powers in delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands by applying continuous wavelet transform (WT) on averaged and single trial data, respectively. The cluster-based non-parametric permutation test implemented in the FieldTrip toolbox revealed significant differences among the three groups. While the total delta and theta responses already significantly declined in the MCI stage with further spatial expansion of the decline in AD, the evoked delta response reached a statistically significant reduction level in the AD stage. We obtained no significant difference among groups for alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands. These results suggest that total delta and theta EROs to oddball targets may be useful for early detection of the disease in MCI stage, while the evoked delta response allows detecting the conversion to AD.

An EEG marker of reward processing is diminished in Parkinson's disease	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; EEG; Reward positivity; Event related potential; Dopamine	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PREDICTION ERROR; NEURAL RESPONSE; POSITIVITY; DEPRESSION; DOPAMINE; SENSITIVITY; MEDICATION	The electroencephalographic signal known as the Reward Positivity (RewP) scales with the reward prediction error following reward receipt. This signal is computationally identical to the dopamine-driven learning process relating to the discrepancy between reward expectation and reward acquisition. The current study aimed to investigate if the RewP is diminished in Parkinsons disease (PD). In this study, 28 people with PD and 28 age- and sex-matched healthy controls completed a reinforcement-learning task. In line with expectations, the RewP was smaller in persons with PD than in controls. Yet contrary to expectations, RewP amplitude did not differ in on vs. off medication conditions, and it was positively correlated with the number of years diagnosed with PD. We propose that this symptom-specific alteration in RewP may be a consequence of a common methodological procedure in PD research (e.g. restricted recruitment) or it might truly be a marker of early-stage disease (e.g. prior to network re-adaptation). These surprising findings motivate separate testable hypotheses for assessing aspects of PD with this novel neural marker of reward.

Previous research has focused on individual variation in cognitive function following TSD, but we know less about how TSD influences the lateralization of spatial working memory. This study used event-related-potential techniques to explore asymmetry in spatial-working-memory impairment. Fourteen healthy male participants performed a two-back task with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings conducted at baseline and after 36 h of TSD. We selected 12 EEG points corresponding to left and right sides of the brain and then observed changes in N2 and P3 components related to spatial working memory. Before TSD, P3 amplitude differed significantly between the left and right sides of the brain. This difference disappeared after TSD. Compared with baseline, P3 amplitude decreased for a duration as extended as the prolonged latency of N2 components. After 36 h of TSD, P3 amplitude decreased more in the right hemisphere than the left. We therefore conclude that TSD negatively affected spatial working memory, possibly through removing the right hemisphere advantage.

BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						CSERP; OERP; EEG; spectra power; olfactory system; 3M syndrome; rare disease	3-M SYNDROME; AUTONOMIC RESPONSES; DISORDER; INSULIN; ODOR	3M syndrome is a rare disorder that involves the gene cullin-7 (CUL7). CUL7 modulates odour detection, conditions the olfactory response (OR) and plays a role in the development of the olfactory system. Despite this involvement, there are no direct studies on olfactory functional effects in 3M syndrome. The purpose of the present work was to analyse the cortical OR through chemosensory event-related potentials (CSERPs) and power spectra calculated by electroencephalogram (EEG) signals recorded in 3M infants: two twins (3M-N) and an additional subject (3M-O). The results suggest that olfactory processing is diversified. Comparison of N1 and Late Positive Component (LPC) indicated substantial differences in 3M syndrome that may be a consequence of a modified olfactory processing pattern. Moreover, the presence of delta rhythms in 3M-O and 3M-N clearly indicates their involvement with OR, since the delta rhythm is closely connected to chemosensory perception, in particular to olfactory perception.

Both the prevalence and emotional and financial burdens of AD on patients, their families, and society are predicted to grow significantly in the near future, due to a prolongation of the lifespan. Several lines of evidence suggest that modifications of risk-enhancing life styles and initiation of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments in the early stage of disease, although not able to modify its course, helps to maintain personal autonomy in daily activities and significantly reduces the total costs of disease management. Moreover, many clinical trials with potentially disease-modifying drugs are devoted to prodromal stages of AD. Thus, the identification of markers of conversion from prodromal form to clinically AD may be crucial for developing strategies of early interventions. The current available markers, including volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analysis are expensive, poorly available in community health facilities, and relatively invasive. Taking into account its low cost, widespread availability and non-invasiveness, electroencephalography (EEG) would represent a candidate for tracking the prodromal phases of cognitive decline in routine clinical settings eventually in combination with other markers. In this scenario, the present paper provides an overview of epidemiology, genetic risk factors, neuropsychological, fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers in AD and describes the potential role of EEG in AD investigation, trying in particular to point out whether advanced analysis of EEG rhythms exploring brain function has sufficient specificity/sensitiv ity/accuracy for the early diagnosis of AD.

Changes in Speech-Related Brain Activity During Adaptation to Electro-Acoustic Hearing	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						cochlear implant; auditory event-related potentials; speech intelligibility; electroencephalography; source localization; auditory rehabilitation	AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; COCHLEAR IMPLANT USERS; POSTLINGUALLY DEAFENED ADULTS; SPOKEN WORD RECOGNITION; CORTICAL MECHANISMS; EEG; PERCEPTION; LANGUAGE; COMPONENT; DYNAMICS	Objectives: Hearing improves significantly with bimodal provision, i.e., a cochlear implant (CI) at one ear and a hearing aid (HA) at the other, but performance shows a high degree of variability resulting in substantial uncertainty about the performance that can be expected by the individual CI user. The objective of this study was to explore how auditory event-related potentials (AERPs) of bimodal listeners in response to spoken words approximate the electrophysiological response of normal hearing (NH) listeners. Study Design: Explorative prospective analysis during the first 6 months of bimodal listening using a within-subject repeated measures design. Setting: Academic tertiary care center. Participants: Twenty-seven adult participants with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss who received a HiRes 90K CI and continued use of a HA at the non-implanted ear. Age-matched NH listeners served as controls. Intervention: Cochlear implantation. Main Outcome Measures: Obligatory auditory evoked potentials N1 and P2, and the event-related N2 potential in response to monosyllabic words and their reversed sound traces before, as well as 3 and 6 months post-implantation. The task required word/non-word classification. Stimuli were presented within speech-modulated noise. Loudness of word/non-word signals was adjusted individually to achieve the same intelligibility across groups and assessments. Results: Intelligibility improved significantly with bimodal hearing, and the N1-P2 response approximated the morphology seen in NH with enhanced and earlier responses to the words compared to their reversals. For bimodal listeners, a prominent negative deflection was present between 370 and 570 ms post stimulus onset (N2), irrespective of stimulus type. This was absent for NH controls; hence, this response did not approximate the NH response during the study interval. N2 source localization evidenced extended activation of general cognitive areas in frontal and prefrontal brain areas in the CI group. Conclusions: Prolonged and spatially extended processing in bimodal CI users suggests employment of additional auditory-cognitive mechanisms during speech processing. This does not reduce within 6 months of bimodal experience and may be a correlate of the enhanced listening effort described by CI listeners.

Given the known heterogeneity within the autistic population, it is crucial to design tests of semantic comprehension that are sensitive in individuals. Recent efforts to develop neural signals of language comprehension have focused on the N400, a robust marker of lexical-semantic violation at the group level. However, homogeneity of response in individual neurotypical children has not been established. Here, we presented 20 neurotypical children with congruent and incongruent visual animations and spoken sentences while measuring their neural response using electroencephalography (EEG). Despite robust group-level responses, we found high inter-individual variability in response to lexico-semantic anomalies. To overcome this, we analysed our data using temporally and spatially unconstrained multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA), supplemented by descriptive analyses to examine the timecourse, topography, and strength of the effect. Our results show that neurotypical children exhibit heterogenous responses to lexical-semantic violation, implying that any application to heterogenous disorders such as autism spectrum disorder will require individual-subject analyses that are robust to variation in topology and timecourse of neural responses.

In the past decades, abundant research efforts to study the effects of alcohol on inhibition have focused exclusively on stimulus-driven inhibition. The novel Chasing Memo task measures stimulus-driven and intentional inhibition within the same paradigm. Combined with the stop-signal task, we investigated how alcohol use affects behavioral and psychophysiological correlates of intentional inhibition, as well as stimulus-driven inhibition. Methods: Experiment I focused on intentional inhibition and stimulus-driven inhibition in relation to past-year alcohol use. The Chasing Memo task, the stop-signal task, and questionnaires related to substance use and impulsivity were administered to 60 undergraduate students (18-25 years old). Experiment II focused on behavioral and neural correlates acute alcohol use on performance on the Chasing Memo task by means of electroencephalography (EEG). Sixteen young male adults (21-28 years old) performed the Chasing Memo task once under placebo and once under the influence of alcohol (blood alcohol concentration around 0.05%), while EEG was recorded. Results: In experiment I, AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test) total score did not significantly predict stimulus-driven inhibition or intentional inhibition performance. In experiment II, the placebo condition and the alcohol condition were comparable in terms of behavioral indices of stimulus-driven inhibition and intentional inhibition as well as task-related EEG patterns. Interestingly, a slow negative readiness potential (RP) was observed with an onset of about 1.2 s, exclusively before participants stopped intentionally. Conclusions: These findings suggest that both past-year increases in risky alcohol consumption and moderate acute alcohol use have limited effects on stimulus-driven inhibition and intentional inhibition. These conclusions cannot be generalized to alcohol use disorder and high intoxication levels. The RP might reflect processes involved in the formation of an intention in general.

Attenuation of paired auditory clicks has repeatedly been shown to be affected in mental disorders, for example, schizophrenia. Neural gating has also been measured for respiratory and somatosensory sensations, however the attenuation of bodily relevant stimuli has not yet been systematically related to the subjective perception of bodily sensations. This research direction is potentially relevant to explaining disease trajectories in psychosomatic conditions characterized by chronic breathlessness and/or pain. In the present study, we recorded high-density EEG from 85 healthy young adults while they experienced brief paired respiratory occlusions and brief paired electrocutaneous stimulation of the wrist. The event-related potential N1 was measured centro-laterally in response to the second relative to the first stimulus to quantify neural gating in both sensory domains. Participants experienced resistive loaded breaths and electrocutaneous stimuli of various intensities, rated their perceived intensity and unpleasantness, and performed magnitude estimation. Relationships of respiratory and somatosensory neural gating to the subjective intensity and unpleasantness of sensations, as well as the ability to discriminate sensations of varying intensities, were investigated intra-modally and cross-modally. We report significant relationships of the somatosensory neural gating to perceived intensity and unpleasantness of respiratory and somatosensory sensations, with the stronger neural gating relating to a stronger subjective intensity and unpleasantness. We discuss these unexpected findings through the lens of individual differences and different theoretical accounts on the origins of cortical attenuation of repetitive stimuli.

An electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded when participants performed a Go/No-go task while listening to slow (54 bpm), medium-paced (104 bpm), fast (154 bpm), or no music. The behavioral results showed that the accuracies for the No-go trials were lower in the fast than in the slow tempo music conditions, while the accuracies for the Go trials were also lower in the fast tempo than in no music conditions. The event-related potential (ERP) study results showed that larger N2 and P3 amplitudes were elicited by No-go than by Go conditions. Moreover, the difference N2 (N2d) amplitudes observed by No-go vs. Go condition were larger in fast music than in medium-paced, slow, and no music conditions, indicating more consumption of cognitive resources in the process of conflict monitoring under the fast music condition. However, no such differences were observed among medium-paced, slow, and no music conditions. In addition, the difference P3 (P3d) amplitudes, an index of response inhibition, were not significant among these four music conditions. The present study showed a detrimental influence of music tempo on inhibition control. More specifically, listening to fast music might impair an individual's ability to monitor conflict when performing the inhibitory control task.

While previous electrophysiological research tested mismatches between prosody and information structure, the present study assessed contextually licensed, appropriate prosodic realizations of stimuli. Our EEG experiment revealed distinct topographic profiles for information structure and prosody. As to prosody, we found a biphasic pattern over anterior brain regions for (secondarily prominent) phrase accents (marking Second Occurrence Focus) and deaccentuation (marking Background) but not for pitch accents (marking First Occurrence Focus), indicating an inverse relation between processing effort and the level of perceived prominence. The event-related potentials for Quasi Second Occurrence Focus items resembled First Occurrence Focus items although the former were deaccented. As to information structural contrasts, First Occurrence Focus engendered a pronounced negativity over posterior sites relative to Second Occurrence Focus and Background. Quasi Second Occurrence Focus showed an intermediate negativity. These differences can probably be accounted for by (lexically) new rather than focused information. In general, the data indicate that both prosodic cues and information structural categories influence the incremental processing of spoken language and that pitch accents and newness fulfill independent prominence-lending functions.

Comparing the motivational value of rewards and losses in an EEG-pupillometry study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						FRN; P300; punishment; pupil size; reinforcement	FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; PREDICTION ERRORS; MONETARY REWARD; PROSPECT-THEORY; POWER ANALYSIS; VALENCE; GAIN; BIAS	We found earlier that performance-contingent rewards lead to faster performance than equivalent losses [Carsten, Hoofs, Boehler, & Krebs, 2019. Motivation Science, 5(3). ]. Here, we further tested the hypothesis that motivation to gain rewards is higher than to avoid losses, even when incentive values are matched. As implicit markers of motivation, we assessed electroencephalography (EEG) focusing on the P3 after target and feedback onset, and the Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN), as well as simultaneously recorded pupil size. Comparing only reward and loss prospect trials in Experiment 1, we found no consistent differences in behavior and electrophysiological markers of motivation, although pupil data suggested higher arousal after feedback in potential-loss trials. Including additional no-incentive trials in Experiment 2, we found consistent evidence that motivation to gain rewards was higher than to avoid losses: In line with behavior, the target-P3 was most pronounced for reward-related stimuli, followed by loss and no-incentive ones. This same ranking was found in the P3 and the FRN after positive outcomes (i.e., reward, avoided loss, and correct feedback in no-incentive trials). Negative outcomes featured a different pattern in line with the pupil response, which suggests that losses are emotionally salient events, without invigorating behavior proportionally. In sum, these findings suggest that the motivation to gain rewards is more pronounced than motivation to avoid equivalent losses, at least in tasks promoting transient increases in attention triggered by incentive prospect. These motivational differences may arise as avoided losses are not profitable in the long term, in contrast to gained rewards.	[Carsten, Thomas; Kostandyan, Mariam; Boehler, C.

It was important to resolve how these cues influenced consumers' online purchasing decision. We also knew little about how the human brain processed these cues simultaneously, and which cue would occupy a dominant position in neural activity. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the neural correlates of online shopping decisions and how online rating and product price jointly influenced such purchase decisions. Research Method: Eighteen undergraduates were recruited to participate in this research. Each participant was exposed to all four experimental conditions combining 2 (product price: high vs. low) x 2 (online rating: positive vs. negative) with a total of 192 trials. They were required to rate the degree of willingness-to-pay. EEG data were obtained with 64 electrodes placed on the Easy Cap according to the International 10-20 system. We conducted both the event-related potentials analysis and the time-frequency analysis for the EEG data. Results: The behavioral findings indicated that products with positive rating and low price increased the willingness-to-pay. The EEG results showed that larger late positive potentials were elicited by products with low price compared with high price under positive rating condition, but not under negative rating condition, reflecting the modulated effect of online rating on the emotional arousal elicited by product price. Furthermore, we found larger alpha event related desynchronization elicited by products with positive rating compared with negative rating, indicating that more cognitive resources were allocated for products with a positive rating. Conclusion: Combined with behavioral and EEG analysis, our results emphasized the more important position of product rating compared with price. The findings deepened the understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the online shopping decision process. More attention should be paid to online ratings on the webpage of the electronic store, because negative ratings made a product less appealing for prospective consumers regardless of price. Thus, the owners should build good reputations for their online products, which were fundamental to the consumers' online purchasing decisions.

Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording has recently created new horizons to locate foci in patients with epilepsy and, in comparison with single-modality methods, has yielded more promising results although it is still subject to limitations such as lack of access to information between interictal events. This study assesses its potential added value in the presurgical evaluation of patients with complex source localization. Adult candidates considered ineligible for surgery on account of an unclear focus and/or presumed multifocality on the basis of EEG underwent EEG-fMRI. Adopting a component-based approach, this study attempts to identify the neural behavior of the epileptic generators and detect the components-of-interest which will later be used as input in the GLM model, substituting the classical linear regressor. Twenty-eight sets interictal epileptiform discharges (IED) from nine patients were analyzed. In eight patients, at least one BOLD response was significant, positive and topographically related to the IEDs. These patients were rejected for surgery because of an unclear focus in four, presumed multifocality in three, and a combination of the two conditions in two. Component-based EEG-fMRI improved localization in five out of six patients with unclear foci. In patients with presumed multifocality, component-based EEG-fMRI advocated one of the foci in five patients and confirmed multifocality in one of the patients. In seven patients, component-based EEG-fMRI opened new prospects for surgery and in two of these patients, intracranial EEG supported the EEG-fMRI results. In these complex cases, component-based EEG-fMRI either improved source localization or corroborated a negative decision regarding surgical candidacy. As supported by the statistical findings, the developed EEG-fMRI method leads to a more realistic estimation of localization compared to the conventional EEG-fMRI approach, making it a tool of high value in pre-surgical evaluation of patients with refractory epilepsy. To ensure proper implementation, we have included guidelines for the application of component-based EEG-fMRI in clinical practice.

Boosts in brain signal variability track liberal shifts in decision bias	ELIFE			English	Article							PHYSIOLOGICAL TIME-SERIES; NEURAL VARIABILITY; ENTROPY; MODULATION; NOISE; EEG; MECHANISMS; PREDICTS; MODEL; POWER	Adopting particular decision biases allows organisms to tailor their choices to environmental demands. For example, a liberal response strategy pays off when target detection is crucial, whereas a conservative strategy is optimal for avoiding false alarms. Using conventional time-frequency analysis of human electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, we previously showed that bias setting entails adjustment of evidence accumulation in sensory regions (Kloosterman et al., 2019), but the presumed prefrontal signature of a conservative-to-liberal bias shift has remained elusive. Here, we show that a liberal bias shift is reflected in a more unconstrained neural regime (boosted entropy) in frontal regions that is suited to the detection of unpredictable events. Overall EEG variation, spectral power and event-related potentials could not explain this relationship, highlighting that moment-to-moment neural variability uniquely tracks bias shifts. Neural variability modulation through prefrontal cortex appears instrumental for permitting an organism to adapt its biases to environmental demands.

Previous work has found enhanced reactions to emotional stimuli in social situations, yet these changes might represent enhanced communicative or motivational purposes. This study examines whether viewing emotional stimuli in the presence of another person influences attention to or memory for the stimulus. Participants passively viewed emotionally-valenced stimuli while completing another task (counting flowers). Each participant performed this task both alone and in a shared attention condition (simultaneously with another person in the same room) while EEG signals were measured. Recognition of the emotional pictures was later measured. A significant shared attention behavioral effect was found in the attention task but not in the recognition task. Compared to event-related potential responses for neutral pictures, we found higher P3b response for task relevant stimuli (flowers), and higher Late Positive Potential (LPP) responses for emotional stimuli. However, no main effect was found for shared attention between presence conditions. To conclude, shared attention may therefore have a more limited effect on cognitive processes than previously suggested.

The aim of this study was to assess the acute therapeutic effect of TRPA1/M8 agonists in improving swallowing function in OD patients. Methods Fifty-eight patients with OD caused by aging, stroke, or neurodegenerative disease were included in a three-arm, quadruple-blind, randomized clinical trial (NCT02193438). Swallowing safety and efficacy and the kinematics of the swallow response were assessed by videofluoroscopy (VFS) during the swallow of 182 +/- 2 mPa center dot s viscosity (nectar) boluses of a xanthan gum thickener supplemented with (a) 756.6 mu mol/L cinnamaldehyde and 70 mu mol/L zinc (CIN-Zn) (TRPA1 agonists), (b) 1.6 mmol/L citral (CIT) (TRPA1 agonist), or (c) 1.6 mmol/L citral and 1.3 mmol/L isopulegol (CIT-ISO) (TRPA1 and TRPM8 agonists). The effects on pharyngeal event-related potentials (ERP) were assessed by electroencephalography. Key Results TRPA1 stimulation with either CIN-Zn or CIT reduced time to laryngeal vestibule closure (CIN-Zn P = .002, CIT P = .023) and upper esophageal sphincter opening (CIN-Zn P = .007, CIT P = .035). In addition, CIN-Zn reduced the penetration-aspiration scale score (P = .009), increased the prevalence of safe swallows (P = .041), and reduced the latency of the P2 peak of the ERP. CIT-ISO had no positive effect on biomechanics or neurophysiology. No significant adverse events were observed. Conclusions and Inferences TRPA1 stimulation with CIN-Zn or CIT improves the swallow response which, in the case of CIN-Zn, is associated with a significant improvement in cortical activation and safety of swallow. These results provide the basis for the development of new active treatments for OD using TRPA1 agonists.

Potential treatments, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), have not been exploited, in part because of the variability in behavioral response. This can be overcome with the use of response biomarkers. It has been however shown that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can the relieve positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH). This exploratory work aims to establish a quantitative methodological tool, based on high-density electroencephalogram (HD-EEG) data analysis, to assess the effect of rTMS on patients with schizophrenia and AVH. Ten schizophrenia patients with drug-resistant AVH were divided into two groups: the treatment group (TG) received 1 Hz rTMS treatment during 10 daily sessions (900 pulses/session) over the left T3-P3 International 10-20 location. The control group (CG) received rTMS treatment over the Cz (vertex) EEG location. We used the P300 oddball auditory paradigm, known for its reduced amplitude in schizophrenia with AVH, and recorded high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG, 256 channels), twice for each patient: pre-rTMS and 1 week post-rTMS treatment. The use of HD-EEG enabled the analysis of the data in the time domain, but also in the frequency and source-space connectivity domains. The HD-EEG data were linked with the clinical outcome derived from the auditory hallucinations subscale (AHS) of the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale (PSYRATS), the Quality of Life Scale (QoLS), and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS). The general results show a variability between subjects, independent of the group they belong to. The time domain showed a higher N1-P3 amplitude post-rTMS, the frequency domain a higher power spectral density (PSD) in the alpha and beta bands, and the connectivity analysis revealed a higher brain network integration (quantified using the participation coefficient) in the beta band. Despite the small number of subjects and the high variability of the results, this work shows a robust data analysis and an interplay between morphology, spectral, and connectivity data. The identification of a trend post-rTMS for each domain in our results is a first step toward the definition of quantitative neurophysiological parameters to assess rTMS treatment.

Autism Biomarkers Consortium	The Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials (ABC-CT): Scientific Context, Study Design, and Progress Toward Biomarker Qualification	FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						autism spectrum disorder; biomarker; neuroscience; clinical trial methodology; study design; EEG; ERP; eye-tracking	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BIOLOGICAL MOTION	Clinical research in neurodevelopmental disorders remains reliant upon clinician and caregiver measures. Limitations of these approaches indicate a need for objective, quantitative, and reliable biomarkers to advance clinical research. Extant research suggests the potential utility of multiple candidate biomarkers; however, effective application of these markers in trials requires additional understanding of replicability, individual differences, and intra-individual stability over time. The Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials (ABC-CT) is a multi-site study designed to investigate a battery of electrophysiological (EEG) and eye-tracking (ET) indices as candidate biomarkers for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The study complements published biomarker research through: inclusion of large, deeply phenotyped cohorts of children with ASD and typical development; a longitudinal design; a focus on well-evidenced candidate biomarkers harmonized with an independent sample; high levels of clinical, regulatory, technical, and statistical rigor; adoption of a governance structure incorporating diverse expertise in the ASD biomarker discovery and qualification process; prioritization of open science, including creation of a repository containing biomarker, clinical, and genetic data; and use of economical and scalable technologies that are applicable in developmental populations and those with special needs. The ABC-CT approach has yielded encouraging results, with one measure accepted into the FDA's Biomarker Qualification Program to date. Through these advances, the ABC-CT and other biomarker studies in progress hold promise to deliver novel tools to improve clinical trials research in ASD.

Human Neocortical Neurosolver (HNN), a new software tool for interpreting the cellular and network origin of human MEG/EEG data	ELIFE			English	Article							SYNAPTIC CONNECTIONS; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; INTERLAMINAR CONNECTIONS; INTRACELLULAR-RECORDINGS; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; RAT; MODEL; MECHANISMS; MEG	Magneto- and electro-encephalography (MEG/EEG) non-invasively record human brain activity with millisecond resolution providing reliable markers of healthy and disease states. Relating these macroscopic signals to underlying cellular- and circuit-level generators is a limitation that constrains using MEG/EEG to reveal novel principles of information processing or to translate findings into new therapies for neuropathology. To address this problem, we built Human Neocortical Neurosolver (HNN, https://hnn.brown.edu) software. HNN has a graphical user interface designed to help researchers and clinicians interpret the neural origins of MEG/EEG. HNN's core is a neocortical circuit model that accounts for biophysical origins of electrical currents generating MEG/EEG. Data can be directly compared to simulated signals and parameters easily manipulated to develop/test hypotheses on a signal's origin. Tutorials teach users to simulate commonly measured signals, including event related potentials and brain rhythms. HNN's ability to associate signals across scales makes it a unique tool for translational neuroscience research.

ANS acuity is a reliable predictive factor of mathematical achievements and is most likely not influenced by educational or cultural factors of general cognitive processing. It is well established that individuals with mathematics anxiety (MA) perform normally in general cognitive tasks but significantly below-average in mathematical tasks such as numerical magnitude processing, computation and mathematical problem solving. Previous behavioral study reported significant negative correlations between MA level and ANS acuity but it remained unclear whether MA individuals are deficient in their ANS functioning. The current study explored the approximate number processing in individuals with mathematics anxiety at a neural level and gathered electrophysiological evidences for ANS deficiency in MA individuals. We selected 31 individuals with high math anxiety and 29 individuals with low math anxiety who were matched for mean general intelligence, rapid visual perception ability, visual searching ability and mean general anxiety level. The participants completed a dot array task both actively and passively as their electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded. In the active dot array task, the participants were required to make judgements on the relative quantities of blue and yellow dots while the ratio of the dots were manipulated to be high or low. In the passive viewing task, the participants were required to complete an irrelevant task to ensure that proper attention was paid to the stimuli while the ratio was also manipulated. We found that the behavioral performances of the two groups were comparable in both active and passive viewing tasks. However, event-related potential (ERP) analysis revealed that the high anxiety group had larger P2p amplitudes at the occipital electrodes than the low anxiety group in both active and passive viewing tasks. Furthermore, time-frequency analysis was performed and significant ratio effects were found in the low anxiety group in delta band (1 similar to 5 Hz) event-related synchronization (ERS) and beta band (29 similar to 34 Hz) event-related desynchronization ( ERD) while no ratios effects were found in the low anxiety group. The current study provided electrophysiological evidences for ANS deficiencies in individuals with MA. The findings of this study have important theoretical implications for the causes of the impaired mathematical abilities in MA individuals as well as for effective interventions for MA.

Driver state monitoring is a potential method to alleviate such risk by detecting unsafe driver states. Monitoring systems can infer a driver's state based on physiological measurements, subjective report and/or performance. It is well-known that driver psychology, physiology and performance are affected by circadian rhythmicity independently from being affected by the psychological state. However, there is a paucity of research for the circadian effect on the interpretation of the driver state monitoring. This paper seeks to rectify this situation by reviewing the literature on the circadian effect on the physiological functions measured by the methods used in driver state monitoring. Systems tested in the laboratory as potential driver state monitoring and measures that are used to detect states are also considered. The findings suggest different circadian effects on electroencephalography, electrocardiography, electrooculography, electrodermal response, speech, event-related potential, electromyography, subjective report, blood pressure, facial expression, hormonal salivary content, body temperature, respiration, psychomotor performance, and body position. This study creates a theoretical basis for integrating studies about circadian rhythmicity into driver state monitoring. It shows the importance of circadian phase for the safety sciences, driver state monitoring, and systems design.	[Kaduk, Sylwia I.; Roberts, Aaron P.

Abnormal beta and gamma frequency neural oscillations mediate auditory sensory gating deficit in schizophrenia	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Gamma; Beta; EEG; P50; Gating; Schizophrenia	EVOKED RESPONSE SUPPRESSION; POOR P50 SUPPRESSION; POTENTIAL ABNORMALITIES; COMPUTER-MODEL; CA3 REGION; MODULATION; MECHANISMS; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; STIMULATION	Background: Sensory gating is a process in which the brain's response to irrelevant and repetitive stimuli is inhibited. The sensory gating deficit in schizophrenia (SZ) is typically measured by the ratio or difference score of the P50 event-related potential (ERP) amplitudes in response to a paired click paradigm. While the P50 gating effect has usually been measured in relation to the peak amplitude of the S1 and S2 P50 ERPs, there is increasing evidence that inhibitory processes may be reflected by evoked or induced oscillatory activity during the interclick interval in the beta (20-30 Hz) and gamma (30-50 Hz) frequency bands. We therefore examined the relationship between frequency specific activity in the inter-click interval with gating effects in the time and frequency domains. Method: Paired-auditory stimuli were presented to 131 participants with schizophrenia and 196 healthy controls (HC). P50 ERP amplitudes to S1 and S2as well as averaged- and single-trial beta (20-30 Hz) and gamma (30-50 Hz) frequency power during the inter-click interval were measured from the CZ electrode site. Results: In the time domain, P50 gating deficits were apparent in both ratio and difference scores. This effect was mainly due to smaller S1 amplitudes in the patient group. SZ patients exhibited less evoked beta and gamma power, particularly at the 0-100 ms time point, in response to S1. Early (0-100 ms) evoked beta and gamma responses were critical in determining the S1 amplitude and extent of P50 gating across the delay interval for both HC and SZ. Conclusion: Our findings support a disruption in initial sensory registration in those with SZ, and do not support an active mechanism throughout the delay interval. The degree of response to S1 and early beta and gamma frequency oscillations in the delay interval provides information about the mechanisms supporting auditory sensory gating, and may provide a framework for studying the mechanisms that support sensory inhibition.

All measures were repeated two months later to determine stability of the results. Correlation analyses revealed that within the range of 2-45 Hz, at rest, beta-2 band power correlated with the strength of frontoparietal connectivity and behavioral performance in both sessions. Participants with lower global beta-2 resting-state power (gB2rest) showed weaker frontoparietal connectivity and greater capacity for its modifications, as indicated by changes in phase correlations of the EEG signals. At the same time shorter reaction times and improved shooting accuracy were found, in both test and retest, in participants with low gB2rest compared to higher gB2rest values. We posit that weak frontoparietal connectivity permits flexible network reconfigurations required for improved performance in everyday tasks.

The time course of moral perception: an ERP investigation of the moral pop-out effect	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						morality; EEG; social neuroscience; conscious awareness; vision	ATTENTION; DYNAMICS; EMOTION; BRAIN; POTENTIALS; DOMINANCE; AWARENESS; COMPONENT; DISCRETE; JUDGMENT	Humans are highly attuned to perceptual cues about their values. A growing body of evidence suggests that people selectively attend to moral stimuli. However, it is unknown whether morality is prioritized early in perception or much later in cognitive processing. We use a combination of behavioral methods and electroencephalography to investigate how early in perception moral words are prioritized relative to non-moral words. The behavioral data replicate previous research indicating that people are more likely to correctly identify moral than non-moral words in a modified lexical decision task. The electroencephalography data reveal that words are distinguished from non-words as early as 200 ms after onset over frontal brain areas and moral words are distinguished from non-moral words 100 ms later over left-posterior cortex. Further analyses reveal that differences in brain activity to moral vs non-moral words cannot be explained by differences in arousal associated with the words. These results suggest that moral content might be prioritized in conscious awareness after an initial perceptual encoding but before subsequent memory processing or action preparation. This work offers a more precise theoretical framework for understanding how morality impacts vision and behavior.

Audio-visual spatial alignment improves integration in the presence of a competing audio-visual stimulus	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Audio-visual integration; Attention; Visual search; Electroencephalography; Temporal coherence; Spatial alignment	AUDITORY-VISUAL INTERACTIONS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TEMPORAL BINDING WINDOW; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; REACTION-TIME; CORTEX; HUMANS; RESPONSES	In order to parse the world around us, we must constantly determine which sensory inputs arise from the same physical source and should therefore be perceptually integrated. Temporal coherence between auditory and visual stimuli drives audio-visual (AV) integration, but the role played by AV spatial alignment is less well understood. Here, we manipulated AV spatial alignment and collected electroencephalography (EEG) data while human subjects performed a free-field variant of the "pip and pop" AV search task. In this paradigm, visual search is aided by a spatially uninformative auditory tone, the onsets of which are synchronized to changes in the visual target. In Experiment 1, tones were either spatially aligned or spatially misaligned with the visual display. Regardless of AV spatial alignment, we replicated the key pip and pop result of improved AV search times. Mirroring the behavioral results, we found an enhancement of early event-related potentials (ERPs), particularly the auditory N1 component, in both AV conditions. We demonstrate that both top-down and bottom-up attention contribute to these N1 enhancements. In Experiment 2, we tested whether spatial alignment influences AV integration in a more challenging context with competing multisensory stimuli. An AV foil was added that visually resembled the target and was synchronized to its own stream of synchronous tones. The visual components of the AV target and AV foil occurred in opposite hemifields; the two auditory components were also in opposite hemifields and were either spatially aligned or spatially misaligned with the visual components to which they were synchronized. Search was fastest when the auditory and visual components of the AV target (and the foil) were spatially aligned. Attention modulated ERPs in both spatial conditions, but importantly, the scalp topography of early evoked responses shifted only when stimulus components were spatially aligned, signaling the recruitment of different neural generators likely related to multisensory integration. These results suggest that AV integration depends on AV spatial alignment when stimuli in both modalities compete for selective integration, a common scenario in real-world perception.

Juveniles with a sexual preference for prepubescent children (PP) commit a large percentage of CSOs, but have been widely neglected in neuroscience research. Aberrant neural responses to face stimuli have been observed in men with pedophilic interest. Thus far, it is unknown whether such aberrations exist already in PP. A passive face-viewing paradigm, including the presentation of child and adult faces, was deployed and high-density electroencephalography data were recorded. The study group comprised 25 PP and the control group involved 22 juveniles with age-adequate sexual preference. Attractiveness ratings and evoked brain responses were obtained for the face stimuli. An aberrant pattern of attractiveness ratings for child vs. adult faces was found in the PP group. Moreover, elevated occipital P1 amplitudes were observed for adult vs. child faces in both groups. At longer latency (340-426 ms), a stronger negative deflection to child vs. adult faces, which was source localized in higher visual, parietal and frontal regions, was specifically observed in the PP group. Our study provides evidence for enhanced neural processing of child face stimuli in PP, which might reflect elevated attention capture of face stimuli depicting members from the sexually preferred age group. This study expands our understanding of the neural foundations underlying sexual interest in prepubescent children and provides a promising path for the uncovering of objective biomarkers of sexual responsiveness to childlike body schemes in juveniles.

The inattention associated with the disorder is likely to be due to functional deficits of the neural networks inhibiting irrelevant sensory input. In the presence of unnecessary information, a good decisional process is impaired and ADHD patients tend to take risky decisions. This study is aimed to test the hypothesis that the level of difficulty of a WM training (WMT) is affecting the top-down modulation of the attentional processes in a probabilistic gambling task. Methods: Event-related potentials (ERP) triggered by the choice of the amount wagered in the gambling task were recorded, before and after WMT with a the dual n-back task, in young ADHD adults and matched controls. For each group of participants, randomly assigned individuals were requested to perform WMT with a fixed baseline level of difficulty. The remaining participants were trained with a performance-dependent adaptive n-level of difficulty. Results: We compared the ERP recordings before and after 20 days of WMT in each subgroup. The analysis was focused on the time windows with at least three recording sites showing differences before and after training, after Bonferroni correction (p<0.05). In ADHD, the P1 wave component was selectively affected at frontal sites and its shape was recovered close to controls' only after adaptive training. In controls, the strongest contrast was observed at parietal level with a left hemispheric dominance at latencies near 900 ms, more after baseline than after adaptive training. Conclusion: Partial restoration of early selective attentional processes in ADHD patients might occur after WMT with a high cognitive load. Modified frontal sites' activities might constitute a neural marker of this effect in a gambling task. In controls, conversely, an increase in late parietal negativity might rather be a marker of an increase in transfer effects to fluid intelligence.

Emerging evidence suggests that a reduced flexibility in the balance between proactive and reactive control might be related to trait rumination. This study aimed to investigate the proactive-reactive control balance in the context of trait rumination. In the current study, we investigated behavioral performance and event-related potentials (ERPs) while participants were performing an AX- Continuous Performance Task, to evaluate whether a shift towards more reactive control (i.e., conflict monitoring and resolution) at the expense of proactive control (i.e., maintenance and updating of task-relevant information) is associated with increased trait rumination. Our behavioral results as well as our ERP results did not demonstrate that a shift towards more reactive control at the expense of proactive control was associated with increased trait rumination. Future research is needed to investigate the proactive-reactive control balance in the context of trait rumination. This study is the first to explore the recruitment dynamics of cognitive control using behavioral as well as electro-physiological measures in the context of rumination.

Thus, traditional brain-computer interface (BCI) systems require a calibration process in which the subject & x2019;s data are extracted in order to train machine-learning classifiers. Despite past efforts to eliminate this process, often referred to as & x201C;zero-training,& x201D; BCI systems & x2019; best performance is achievable only with some level of calibration. This tedious process is one of the factors that have limited the use of BCI systems in the real world. Meanwhile, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been proven to be useful in distinguishing neurophysiological features. In this study, we investigated whether an existing convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with large ERP samples (n & x003D; 99,000) can achieve zero-training in a P300 BCI speller system. As a result, the zero-trained CNN achieved comparable performance (89 & x0025;, p & x003C; 0.05) when compared to traditional approaches (94 & x0025;) in an offline study. We also demonstrate that the constructed CNN works successfully in an online experiment in which twelve BCI subjects achieved 85 & x0025; mean accuracy without calibration, compared to 82 & x0025; (but the difference was not significant, p & x003E; 0.05) with calibration. Additionally, we illustrate a hybrid approach in order to further enhance performance, which adaptively updates a linear classifier using label information generated from a zero-trained CNN. With this technique, the hybrid approach achieved reasonable performance (92 & x0025;), showing no statistical difference (p & x003E; 0.05) when compared to the traditional approach in the same offline data.

J	Burnside, R; Ullsperger, M				Burnside, Rebecca; Ullsperger, Markus			Social comparison impacts stimulus evaluation in a competitive social learning task	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DECISION-MAKING; FEEDBACK; BRAIN; PERFORMANCE; POTENTIALS; ATTENTION; FAILURE; OTHERS; REWARD	When we perform an action, the outcome that follows it can change the value we place on that behaviour, making it more or less likely to be repeated in the future. However, the values that we learn are not objective: we interpret the outcomes that we receive for ourselves relative to those that share our environment, i.e. we engage in social comparison. The temporal dynamics of physiological responses to stimulus valuation in social learning tasks are poorly understood, particularly in human participants. Therefore, we recorded stimulus-locked event-related potentials with 64-channel EEG to examine stimulus valuation, following the design of a study previously used in macaques. Pairs of participants performed a social learning task in which they received outcomes sequentially for a presented stimulus (partner first) by pressing a button in response to a cue. There were two conditions: one in which stimulus values varied for the participant but output a constant rate of reward for the partner (self-variable blocks), and another condition in which this payout was reversed (other-variable blocks). We then measured participants' self-reported competitiveness. Approximately 200 ms post-stimulus, an ERP related to stimulus evaluation and attentional processing appeared to encode own stimulus value in self-variable blocks. In other-variable blocks the same pattern of activity was reversed, even though the value of the stimulus for the participant did not depend on the stimulus presented. Outcome-locked analyses further showed that attention dedicated to the partner's outcome was greater in more competitive participants. We conclude that subjective stimulus value can be reflected in early stimulus-locked ERP responses and that competitive participants may be more invested in their own performance relative to the other player, hence their increased interest in the outcome of their partner.

To date, there is no study exploring the implications of specific neural networks during this phenomenon in patients suffering from schizophrenia. Methods: We compared 17 patients suffering from psychosis (SCZ) to 33 healthy controls (HC) performing a verbal memory task designed to produce false memories, i.e. the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm (DRM). Electroencephalography was used to specifically analyze the P2 and N400 event-related potentials components. Results: The SCZ patients showed a reduced ability to distinguish between true and false memories as assessed by the A' index which was calculated based on the false and true memory rates. The morphology of the P2 differed in frontal electrode region with a lower amplitude in SCZ. In addition, the amplitude of N400 was more pronounced (more negative) in HC than in SCZ in centro-parietal electrode site. Conclusions: We suggest that the differences found in P2 amplitude are associated with difficulties of SCZ patients to efficiently compare item-specific features of a mnesic elements to incoming stimuli which impair the subsequent verbal memory information processing reflected by the N400 component amplitude decrease. These results are consistent with the idea that SCZ use a different strategy while they perform the DRM paradigm.	[Favre, Gregoire; Horat, Sibylle K.; Merlo, Marco C.

J	Li, F; Teichert, T				Li, Fan; Teichert, Tobias			A surface metric and software toolbox for EEG electrode grids in the macaque	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; 10-20 system; Non-human primates	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; SCALP EEG; COMPONENT; MONKEYS; MODEL	Background: The past years have seen increased appreciation of electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in non-human primates (NHP) as a tool for translational research. In humans, even large EEG electrode grids can easily and quickly be placed on standardized positions using commercially available EEG caps. In the NHP, the identification of standardized EEG electrode positions is more complicated and time-consuming. New method: Here we introduce a surface metric and software package (NHP1020) that automates the planning of large, approximately evenly spaced electrode grids for EEG recordings in the NHP. Results: Based on one CT and one MRI image as well as two intracranial markers, the NHP1020 software defines electrode positions on the brain surface using a surface-based spherical metric similar to the one used by the international 10-20 system. Standardized electrode grids can be shared, imported or defined with few high-level commands. Existing methods: NHP EEG electrodes can be placed relative to extracranial markers and measurements or relative to underlying neural structures of interest. Both approaches are time-consuming and require manual intervention. Furthermore, the use of extracranial markers in this species may be more problematic than in humans, because cranial muscles and ridges are larger and keep maturing long into adulthood. Conclusion: The presented surface metric and the NHP1020 toolbox provide fast and automated identification of entire electrode grids in the non-human primate based on a two-dimensional metric on the brain surface.

ERPs were recorded while 20 designers and 20 novices made shape-match judgments for table and chair sets. All of the tables were in the normal style, and the chairs had different components and structures, including NormalChair, AllbyChair, and NonebyChair. The results show that the experts had fewer agreements than the novices did in matching the Normal table to the NormalChair used in the experiment. Furthermore, the experts' ERPs elicited by AllbyChair and NonebyChair conditions had higher N170 amplitudes than those of the novices. However, the novices, in response to these AllbyChair and NonebyChair conditions for N170 exhibited greater delay latency than the experts. Additionally, the design expertise effects in object recognition provided additional evidence and confirmed similar results from many previous N170 studies. The experts comprehended the content in their familiar field, and inferred the complex design structure to the abstract level to show the hierarchical association of the knowledge structure. However, novices could not clearly understand the different and varied structures, and could only speculate from the limited information presented in existing problems. This study infers that because they used visual thinking in their training, the designers showed stronger expert performances, and were more capable than ordinary people in recognizing novel objects from bizarre entity arrangements as familiar ones.

CMEs can record an electroencephalogram (EEG) even from hairy areas without any skin preparation, unlike conventional wet electrodes. In our previous research, we experimentally verified that CMEs can measure the spontaneous potential of EEG from the hairy occipital region without preparation with a signal-to-noise ratio as good as that of the conventional wet electrodes which require skin preparation. However, these results were based on frequency-based signals, which are relatively robust compared to noise contamination, and whether CMEs are sufficiently sensitive to capture finer signals remained unclear. Here, we first experimentally verified that CMEs can extract ERPs as good as conventional wet electrodes without preparation. In the auditory oddball tasks using pure tones, P300, which represent ERPs, was extracted with a signal-to-noise ratio as good as that of conventional wet electrodes. CMEs successfully captured perceptual activities. Then, we attempted to investigate cerebral cognitive activity using ERPs. In processing the vowel and prosody in auditory stimuli such as /itta/, /itte/, and /itta?/, laterality was observed that originated from the locations responsible for the process in near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and magnetoencephalography experiments. We simultaneously measured ERPs with CMEs and NIRS in the oddball tasks using the three words. Laterality appeared in NIRS for six of 10 participants, although laterality was not clearly shown in the results, suggesting that EEGs have a limitation of poor spatial resolution. On the other hand, successful capturing of MMN and P300 using CMEs that do not require skin preparation may be readily applicable for real-time applications of human perceptual activities.

EEGs recorded from non-human primates (monkeys) is useful for understanding of human pathologies of psychiatric disorders and development of new therapeutic agents. New methods: In this study, we expand a previous non-invasive head holding system with face masks for awake monkeys to be applied to scalp EEG recording. The new design of a head holding system allows to attach scalp EEG electrodes on the positions comparable to human electrode placement and to present auditory stimuli. Results: With this system, we could record auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) in auditory sensory gating and oddball paradigms, which are often used as biomarkers of psychiatric disorders in animal models and human patients. The recorded AEPs were comparable to previous human clinical data. Comparison with existing methods: Compared with previous non-invasive head holding systems, top, side (cheek and ears), and rear of the head can be open for attachment of EEG electrodes and auditory stimulation in the present system. Conclusions: The results suggest that the present system is useful in EEG recording from awake monkeys. Furthermore, this system can be applied to eye-tracking and chronic intra-cerebral recording experiments.

To better understand the differential dysfunction of the visual network in DLB, we compared auditory and visual event-related potentials and oscillations in patients with DLB. Methods: Event-related potentials elicited by visual and auditory oddball tasks were recorded in 23 patients with DLB and 22 healthy controls and analyzed in time and time-frequency domain. Results: DLB patients had decreased theta band activity related to both early sensory and later cognitive processing in the visual, but not in the auditory task. Patients had lower delta and higher alpha and beta bands power related to later cognitive processing in both auditory and visual tasks. Conclusions: In DLB visual event-related oscillations are characterized by a decrease in theta and lack of inhibition in alpha bands. Significance: Decreased theta and a lack of inhibition in alpha band power might be an oscillatory underpinning of some classical DLB symptoms such as fluctuations in attention and high-level visual disturbances (C) 2020 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

NEUROREPORT			English	Article						event-related potentials; facial trustworthiness; outcome evaluation; trust game	MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; BRAIN POTENTIALS; FEEDBACK; TRUST; NEGATIVITY; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEM	Facial trustworthiness can influence trust behavior. The outcome may be concordant (a person with a trustworthy face who engages in reciprocal behavior) or conflicting (a person with a trustworthy face who does not reciprocate). This study investigated the temporal features of processing different outcomes following trustworthy or untrustworthy faces. Thirty-one college students participated in a decision-making task in which they were shown a face and were asked to judge whether the person would behave in a trustworthy or an untrustworthy manner in a hypothetical scenario, and feedback was then provided about the target person's behavior in the scenario, while the event-related potential of the electroencephalography of participants' brains was recorded. In the feedback presentation stage, there was a significant interaction between face type and feedback. Trustworthy faces with losses induced the largest feedback-related negativity (FRN), whereas trustworthy faces with gains induced the smallest FRN. For untrustworthy faces, there was no significant difference between losses and gains. Trustworthy faces with losses and untrustworthy faces with gains induced more positive P300. FRN is possibly sensitive to both negative outcomes and expectation violations. P300 is mainly sensitive to expectation violations. Individuals have high positive expectations for trustworthy faces. When the behavior of a trustee with trustworthy face was negative, so as to violate the trustor's expectation, it will elicit a more serious conflict in the mind of the trustor.

Trait Emotional and Restrained Eating Style Predicts Food Cue Responding Under Negative Emotions	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						emotional eating; restrained eating; mood induction; food cue reactivity; multilevel modeling; P300; corrugator supercilii	SELF-REGULATORY-SUCCESS; STRESS; DISORDER; BEHAVIOR; MOOD; METAANALYSIS; PREVALENCE; CRAVINGS; ANXIETY; GENDER	In today's society, obesity rates are rising as food intake is no longer only a response to physiological hunger signals that ensure survival. Eating can represent a reward, a response to boredom, or stress reduction and emotion regulation. While most people decrease food intake in response to stress or negative emotions, some do the opposite. Yet, it is unclear who shows emotional overeating under which circumstances. Emotion regulation theories describe emotional overeating as a learned strategy to down-regulate negative emotions. Cognitive theories, by contrast, attribute emotional overeating to perceived diet breaches in individuals who chronically attempt to diet. After consuming "forbidden foods", they eat more than individuals who do not restrict their food intake. This laboratory study investigated emotional overeating by exposing individuals to a personalized emotion induction while showing images of palatable foods. Outcome variables indexed cue reactivity to food images through picture ratings (valence, desire to eat), facial expressions (electromyography of the corrugator supercilii muscle), and brain reactivity by detecting event-related potentials (ERPs) by means of electroencephalography (EEG). The influence of emotion condition (negative, neutral) and individual differences (self-reported trait emotional and restrained eating) on outcome variables was assessed. Valence ratings and appetitive reactions of the corrugator muscle to food pictures showed a relative increase in the negative condition for individuals with higher emotional eating scores, with the opposite pattern in lower scores. Desire to eat ratings showed a similar pattern in individuals who showed a strong response to the emotion induction manipulation, indicative of a dose-response relationship. Although no differences between conditions were found for ratings or corrugator activity with restrained eating as a predictor, an ERP at P300 showed increased activation when viewing food compared to objects in the negative condition. Findings support emotion regulation theories: Emotional eaters showed an appetitive reaction in rating patterns and corrugator activity. EEG findings (increased P300) suggest a motivated attention toward food in restrained eaters, which supports cognitive theories. However, this did not translate to other variables, which might demonstrate successful restraint. Future studies may follow up on these findings by investigating eating disorders with emotion regulation difficulties.

J	Li, X; Li, ZS; Xiang, BY; Meng, J				Li Xiong; Li Zuoshan; Xiang Binyang; Meng Jing			Empathy for pain in Individuals with autistic traits influenced by attention cues: Evidence from an ERP study	ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						empathy; empathy for pain; autism spectrum disorders (ASD); autistic traits; event related potentials (ERP)	SPECTRUM QUOTIENT AQ; FUNCTIONING AUTISM; FACE; BRAIN; CHILDREN; RECOGNITION; ADOLESCENTS; PERCEPTION; RESPONSES; OTHERS	Previous studies have found that the behavioral patterns of individuals with autistic traits are similar to those of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). That is, individuals with autistic traits show the impairment of empathy in daily life, but the severity of such impairment is not enough to meet the clinical diagnostic criteria for ASD. The similar behaviors between the two mean that studying individuals with autistic traits can help us understand the empathy characteristics of ASD. At present, the results of studies on the empathy for pain of autistic individuals are not consistent. It is possible that attention cues and specific face processing affect their empathy processing. Therefore, in this study, pictures of painful faces were used as stimulus materials, and the event-related potentials (ERP) technique was adopted to explore the effect of attention cues on the pain empathy processing in autistic individuals. The study randomly selected 30 healthy undergraduates (15 males) as the autistic trait group, and 30 healthy undergraduates (16 males) as the control group. The experiment, based on three-factor mixed design ( 2x2x2), included two tasks: 1) Pain judgment task: The subjects were required to judge whether there was pain in the pictures of the painful faces (with a needle in the cheek) and the pictures of the non-painful faces (touched gently with a cotton swab), where the subjects' attention was directed to the pain cues. 2) Attractiveness judgment task: The subjects were required to judge whether the faces were attractive or unattractive, where the subjects' attention did not point to the pain cues. EEG during the observation of pictures under different experiment tasks was recorded by a 64-channel amplifier using a standard 10-20 system (Brain Products). The ERP results revealed that the attention cues would influence the late cognitive processing stage component P3, but not the early automatic component. Compared with the control group, the autistic trait group induced a larger P3 amplitude by the painful face pictures in the attractiveness judgment task; however, in the pain judgment task, there was no significant difference between the two groups. This suggests that top-down attention to visual pain cues may modulate the late processing of pain empathy in autistic individuals, as manifested in the following fact: When autistic individuals pay attention to pain cues, they have similar empathic neural responses to the control group; when they do not pay attention to pain cues, they process other people's painful faces to a higher degree. This result also suggests that autistic individuals may avoid other people's face information, and provides evidence for the empathy deficit of autistic individuals. This conclusion is helpful for understanding the cognitive processing characteristics and influencing factors of pain empathy in ASD.

This psychophysics-electroencephalography (EEG) study investigated the influence of asynchrony on how the brain binds audiotactile (AT) signals to enable faster responses in a redundant target paradigm. Human participants actively responded (psychophysics) or passively attended (EEG) to noise bursts, "taps-to-the-face" and their AT combinations at seven AT asynchronies: 0, +/- 20, +/- 70 and +/- 500 ms. Behaviourally, observers were faster at detecting AT than unisensory stimuli within a temporal integration window: the redundant target effect was maximal for synchronous stimuli and declined within a <= 70 ms AT asynchrony. EEG revealed a cascade of AT interactions that relied on different neural mechanisms depending on AT asynchrony. At small (<= 20 ms) asynchronies, AT interactions arose for evoked response potentials (ERPs) at 110 ms and similar to 400 ms post-stimulus. Selectively at +/- 70 ms asynchronies, AT interactions were observed for the P200 ERP, theta-band inter-trial coherence (ITC) and power at similar to 200 ms post-stimulus. In conclusion, AT binding was mediated by distinct neural mechanisms depending on the asynchrony of the AT signals. Early AT interactions in ERPs and theta-band ITC and power were critical for the behavioural response facilitation within a <=+/- 70 ms temporal integration window.

Differential neurophysiological correlates of retrieval of consolidated and reconsolidated memories in humans: An ERP and pupillometry study	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MASS UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS; PUPIL SIZE CHANGES; RECOGNITION MEMORY; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; ASSOCIATIVE RECOGNITION; EPISODIC MEMORIES; BRAIN POTENTIALS; RECOLLECTION; UPDATE	Consolidated memories can return to a labile state if they are reactivated by unpredictable reminders. To persist, active memories must be re-stabilized through a process known as reconsolidation. Although there is consistent behavioral evidence about this process in humans, the retrieval process of reconsolidated memories remains poorly understood. In this context, one fundamental question is whether the same or different neurophysiological mechanisms are involved in retrieval of consolidated and reconsolidated memories. Because it has been demonstrated that the exposure to the reconsolidation process may restructure and strengthen memories, we hypothesized distinct neurophysiological patterns during retrieval of reconsolidated memories. In addition, we hypothesized that interfering with the reconsolidation process using a new learning can prevent these neurophysiological changes. To test it, consolidated, reconsolidated and declarative memories whose reconsolidation process was interfered (i.e., picture-word pairs) were evaluated in humans in an old/new associative recall task while the brain activity and the pupillary response were recorded using electroencephalography and eyetracking. Our results showed that retrieval of reconsolidated memories elicits specific patterns of brain activation, characterized by an earlier peak latency and a smaller magnitude of the left parietal ERP old/new effect compared to memories that were only consolidated or whose reconsolidation process was interfered by a new learning. Moreover, our results demonstrated that only retrieval of reconsolidated memories is associated with a late reversed mid-frontal effect in a 600-690 time window. Complementarily, memories that were reactivated showed an earlier peak latency of the pupil old/new effect compared to non-reactivated memories. These findings support the idea that reconsolidation has an important impact in how memories are retrieved in the future, showing that retrieval of reconsolidated memories is partially supported by specific brain mechanisms.

The current EEG study examined the ERP and oscillatory correlates of neural feedback processing under risky and ambiguous decision making. Participants performed a wheel-of-fortune task and received either gain or nongain feedback following risky or ambiguous gambles while their EEG was recorded. Results revealed that the early, obligatory detection of reward information was not dependent on the nature of the previous gamble, which was reflected by the reward positivity. However, risky gambling seemed to elicit an enhanced cognitive control signal as indexed by theta oscillation, whereas ambiguous gambling increased the affective and motivational salience during feedback processing as represented by the P3 and delta oscillation. Together, our findings suggest that feedback processing during risky and ambiguous decision making taps into common and distinct electrophysiological correlates.

J	Pascucci, D; Rubega, M; Plomp, G				Pascucci, D.; Rubega, M.; Plomp, G.			Modeling time-varying brain networks with a self-tuning optimized Kalman filter	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							PARTIAL DIRECTED COHERENCE; GRANGER CAUSALITY ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; VISUAL-MOTION; CORTICAL NETWORKS; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; AR MODELS; EEG	Brain networks are complex dynamical systems in which directed interactions between different areas evolve at the sub-second scale of sensory, cognitive and motor processes. Due to the highly non-stationary nature of neural signals and their unknown noise components, however, modeling dynamic brain networks has remained one of the major challenges in contemporary neuroscience. Here, we present a new algorithm based on an innovative formulation of the Kalman filter that is optimized for tracking rapidly evolving patterns of directed functional connectivity under unknown noise conditions. The Self-Tuning Optimized Kalman filter (STOK) is a novel adaptive filter that embeds a self-tuning memory decay and a recursive regularization to guarantee high network tracking accuracy, temporal precision and robustness to noise. To validate the proposed algorithm, we performed an extensive comparison against the classical Kalman filter, in both realistic surrogate networks and real electroencephalography (EEG) data. In both simulations and real data, we show that the STOK filter estimates time-frequency patterns of directed connectivity with significantly superior performance. The advantages of the STOK filter were even clearer in real EEG data, where the algorithm recovered latent structures of dynamic connectivity from epicranial EEG recordings in rats and human visual evoked potentials, in excellent agreement with known physiology. These results establish the STOK filter as a powerful tool for modeling dynamic network structures in biological systems, with the potential to yield new insights into the rapid evolution of network states from which brain functions emerge. Author summary During normal behavior, brains transition between functional network states several times per second. This allows humans to quickly read a sentence, and a frog to catch a fly. Understanding these fast network dynamics is fundamental to understanding how brains work, but up to now it has proven very difficult to model fast brain dynamics for various methodological reasons. To overcome these difficulties, we designed a new Kalman filter (STOK) by innovating on previous solutions from control theory and state-space modelling. We show that STOK accurately models fast network changes in simulations and real neural data, making it an essential new tool for modelling fast brain networks in the time and frequency domain.

There has been increasing interest in being able to predict an individual's decision-making response (i.e., acceptance or rejection). We proposed an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based computational intelligence framework to predict individual responses. Specifically, the discriminative spatial network pattern (DSNP), a supervised learning approach, was applied to single-trial EEG data to extract the DSNP feature from the single-trial brain network. A linear discriminate analysis (LDA) trained on the DSNP features was then used to predict the individual response trial-by-trial. To verify the performance of the proposed DSNP, we recruited two independent subject groups, and recorded the EEGs using two types of EEG systems. The performances of the trial-by-trial predictors achieved an accuracy of 0.88 +/- 0.09 for the first dataset, and 0.90 +/- 0.10 for the second dataset. These trial-by-trial prediction performances suggested that individual responses could be predicted trial-by-trial by using the specific pattern of single-trial EEG networks, and our proposed method has the potential to establish the biologically inspired artificial intelligence decision system.

The mu-based BCI is one of the most widely used systems, of which the related methods to improve users' accuracy are still poorly studied, especially for the BCI illiteracy. Here, we examined a way to enhance mu-based BCI performance by electrically stimulating the ulnar nerve of the contralateral wrist at the alpha frequency (10 Hz) during left- and right-hand motor imagination in two BCI groups (literate and illiterate). We demonstrate that this alpha frequency intervention enhances the classification accuracy between left- and right-hand motor imagery from 66.41% to 81.57% immediately after intervention and to 75.28% two days after intervention in the BCI illiteracy group, while classification accuracy improves from 82.12% to 91.84% immediately after intervention and to 89.03% two days after intervention in the BCI literacy group. However, the classification accuracy did not change before and after the sham intervention (no electrical stimulation). Furthermore, the ERD on the primary sensorimotor cortex during left- or right-hand motor imagery tasks was more visible at the mu-rhythm (8-13 Hz) after alpha frequency intervention. Alpha frequency intervention increases the mu-rhythm power difference between left- and right-hand motor imagery tasks. These results provide evidence that alpha frequency intervention is an effective way to improve BCI performance by regulating the mu-rhythm which might provide a way to reduce BCI illiteracy.

Performance Monitoring during Visual Priming	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							FRONTAL EYE FIELD; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; POP-OUT; ERROR-DETECTION; ATTENTIONAL SELECTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; MACAQUE	Repetitive performance of single-feature (efficient or pop-out) visual search improves RTs and accuracy. This phenomenon, known as priming of pop-out, has been demonstrated in both humans and macaque monkeys. We investigated the relationship between performance monitoring and priming of pop-out. Neuronal activity in the supplementary eye field (SEF) contributes to performance monitoring and to the generation of performance monitoring signals in the EEG. To determine whether priming depends on performance monitoring, we investigated spiking activity in SEF as well as the concurrent EEG of two monkeys performing a priming of pop-out task. We found that SEF spiking did not modulate with priming. Surprisingly, concurrent EEG did covary with priming. Together, these results suggest that performance monitoring contributes to priming of pop-out. However, this performance monitoring seems not mediated by SEF. This dissociation suggests that EEG indices of performance monitoring arise from multiple, functionally distinct neural generators.

Many clinical populations demonstrate reduced P50 and/or N100 suppression. Testing sensory gating in children may help to identify individuals at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders earlier, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which could lead to more optimal outcomes. Minimal research has been done with children because of the difficulty of performing lengthy EEG experiments with young children, requiring them to sit still for long periods of time. We designed a modified, potentially child-friendly version of the PCP and evaluated it in typically developing adults. The PCP was administered twice, once in a traditional silent room (silent movie condition) and once with an audible movie playing (audible movie condition) to minimize boredom and enhance behavioral compliance. We tested whether P50 and N100 suppression were influenced by the presence of the auditory background noise from the movie. N100 suppression was observed in both hemispheres in the silent movie condition and in the left hemisphere only during the audible movie condition, though suppression was attenuated in the audible movie condition. P50 suppression was not observed in either condition. N100 sensory gating was successfully elicited with an audible movie playing during the PCP, supporting the use of the modified task for future research in both children and adults.

However, it remains unclear if motor skills and cardiorespiratory fitness are related to different source activity patterns and if neurophysiological indices of response inhibition mediate the relation of these constructs with behavioral performance. We examined the relative contributions of motor skills and cardiorespiratory fitness to response inhibition and a potential mediation by the neurocognitive processes indexed by the N200 and P300 components of event-related potentials. About 92 children aged 9-13 years completed the Movement ABC-2, the PWC170 and a Go/NoGo task. We employed electroencephalography (EEG) to record the N200 and P300 components elicited by the task, which are considered to reflect conflict monitoring and the allocation of attentional resources toward task-relevant stimuli, respectively. Path-anlayses revealed a moderate association between motor skills and behavioral performance on the Go/NoGo task. This association was fully mediated by the P300 amplitude in the NoGo condition. In contrast, cardiorespiratory fitness was not related to behavioral performance, but accounted for variance in N200. Source analyses supported an association between cardiorespiratory fitness and N200 source activity in prefrontal and primary motor cortex, whereas motor skills were related to P300 source activity in the posterior cingulate cortex. Our findings provide novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the relation between motor skills and response inhibition. Moreover, we found that the neural generators of the P300 and N200 varied as a function of children's cardiorespiratory fitness and motor skills.

Test-retest reliability of brain oscillations in a prepulse inhibition and facilitation paradigm: effects of gender in healthy humans	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						electroencephalographic oscillations; gender; intraclass correlation; prepulse inhibition; prepulse facilitation; test-retest reliability	AUDITORY STARTLE REFLEX; ATTENTION; REPRESENTATIONS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PPI	There is a growing interest in assessing the reliability of electroencephalographic (EEG) measures in clinical and research settings. Prepulse inhibition (PPI: representing attentional modulation) and facilitation (PPF: reflecting selective attention) paradigms have been used to study inhibitory function and selective attention, respectively. However, to date, little has been known with regards to the stability of brain oscillatory activity during PPI and PPF. We investigated the stability of event-related EEG oscillations during PPI and PPF in healthy humans over two monthly sessions. Power spectral densities were analysed at traditional frequency bands (delta, alpha, beta sub-bands, and gamma). We assessed test-retest reliability by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs, absolute agreement definition) and examined potential effects of gender. The results showed good-to-excellent reproducibility of EEG power (both in PPI and PPF) over all frequency bands (ICCs > 0.75), except for delta (ICCs < 0.75), with alpha exhibiting the highest repeatability performance. In addition, females showed reduced reliability compared to males in both PPI and PPF, possibly attributed to menstrual cycle phase across our female participants. Overall, our findings suggest that brain oscillatory activity can be test-retest reliable, while gender needs to be controlled with caution. Finally, event-related EEG oscillations during both PPI and PPF could provide a complementary tool to study psychopathology in clinical practice.

Reduced Frontal Nogo-N2 With Uncompromised Response Inhibition During Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation-More Efficient Cognitive Control?

The current research focuses on whether non-invasive, transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) has similar effects to VNS. Furthermore, we aimed to assess whether tVNS has an impact on cognitive control in general or on underlying brain physiology in a task that mimics everyday life demands where multiple executive functions are engaged while encountering intervening emotional stimuli. Event-related potentials (ERP) evoked in such a task, specifically centro-parietal P3 and frontal N2 were used as biomarkers for attention allocation and cognitive control required to carry out the task. A single-blinded, sham-controlled, within-subject study on healthy subjects (n= 25) was conducted using Executive Reaction Time Test (RT-test), a Go/NoGo task engaging multiple executive functions along with intervening threat-related distractors while EEG was recorded. tVNS at the left tragus and sham stimulation at the left ear lobe was alternately delivered throughout the task. To assess the impact of tVNS on neural activity underlying attention and cognitive control, centro-parietal P3 and frontal N2 peak amplitudes were measured in Go and NoGo conditions. Task performance was assessed with RTs and different error types reflecting cognitive control in general and distinct executive functions, such as working memory and response inhibition.No significant effects due to tVNS on performance in the Executive RT-test were observed. For N2 there was a main effect of stimulator status and a significant interaction of trial type (Go, NoGo) and stimulator status.Post hocanalysis revealed that tVNS resulted in a significant reduction of frontal N2 only in the NoGo condition. No significant effects were observed for P3 nor were there any effects of emotion. Diminished NoGo-N2 potential along with unaltered task performance during tVNS suggests fewer cognitive control resources were required to successfully withhold a prepotent response. Though caution is warranted, we suggest that tVNS may lead to more efficient neural processing with fewer resources needed for successful cognitive control, providing promise for its potential use in cognitive enhancement.

These strategies are thought to favour the mechanisms of brain plasticity that take place after brain injury. However, the level of evidence is low. Markers of brain plasticity would favour validation of these rehabilitation programs. In this paper, we consider the study of mu rhythm for this goal by describing the characteristics of mu rhythm in adults and children with typical development, then review the current literature on mu rhythm in CP. Mu rhythm is composed of brain oscillations recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) over the sensorimotor areas. The oscillations are characterized by their frequency, topography and modulation. Frequency ranges within the alpha band (similar to 10 Hz, mu alpha) or beta band (similar to 20 Hz, mu beta). Source location analyses suggest that mu alpha reflects somatosensory functions, whereas mu beta reflects motor functions. Event-related desynchronisation (ERD) followed by event-related (re-)synchronisation (ERS) of mu rhythm occur in association with a movement or somatosensory input. Even if the functional role of the different mu rhythm components remains incompletely understood, their maturational trajectory is well described. Increasing age from infancy to adolescence is associated with increasing ERD as well as increasing ERS. A few studies characterised mu rhythm in adolescents with spastic CP and showed atypical patterns of modulation in most of them. The most frequent findings in patients with unilateral CP are decreased ERD and decreased ERS over the central electrodes, but atypical topography may also be found. The patterns of modulations are more variable in bilateral CP. Data in infants and young children with CP are lacking and studies did not address the questions of intra-individual reliability of mu rhythm modulations in patients with CP nor their modification after motor learning. Better characterization of mu rhythm in CP, especially in infants and young children, is warranted before considering this rhythm as a potential neurophysiological marker of brain plasticity.

Using an original backward priming paradigm, participants were exposed to muted point-light videos of violinists performing piano or forte nuances followed by a congruent vs. incongruent word. After the video presentation, participants were asked to decide whether the musician was playing a piano or forte musical nuance. EEG results showed a greater P200 event-related potential for trained participants at the occipital site, and a greater N400 effect for untrained participants at the central site. Musically untrained participants were more accurate when the word was semantically congruent with the gesture than when it was incongruent. Overall, language seems to influence the performance of untrained participants, for which perception-action couplings are less automatized.

Moreover, they have shown potential for training to control impulsive eating. To test the hypothesis that training modulates early neural markers of response inhibition, the current study investigated how the N2 event-related brain potential to high- and low-calorie food images changes along Go-/No-Go training and how the N2 is related to later eating behavior. 50 healthy adults, (m(BMI) = 23.01) first completed a food Go/No-Go task in which high- and low-calorie food images were accompanied by Go-and No-Go-cues with equal frequency. Participants then completed a training block in which high-calorie foods were predominantly paired with a No-Go cue and the low-calorie foods with a Go cue, followed by a block with reversed coupling (order of the training blocks counterbalanced between participants). After each training, there was a snacking opportunity during which calorie intake was measured. Against our preregistered hypotheses, the N2-amplitudes were not significantly affected by the calorie-content and there was no training-related modulation in the N2. In addition , food intake was not influenced by the preceding training blocks and the N2 amplitude did not predict the food intake. Our study suggests that the link between N2 obtained in a food-related Go/No-Go task and impulse control is not clear-cut and may be limited to specific task characteristics. The results are of high importance as they question the previously assumed mechanism of Go/No-Go training in food-related inhibitory control.

Here, we used event-related potentials to target the preparatory brain activities associated with different levels of CR during visuo-motor simple response tasks (SRTs) and discriminative response tasks (DRTs). EEG was recorded from 28 healthy old (Age: 72.2 +/- 4.7 years) and 14 young (Age: 22.2 +/- 2.4 years) individuals during an SRT and a DRT. Depending on the CR median score, old participants were divided into either a high (High-CR) or a low CR (Low-CR) group. Behavioral performance and electrophysiological data were compared across the 3 groups. Compared with the Low-CR, the High-CR group showed larger prestimulus prefrontal (prefrontal negativity) and premotor activity (Bereitschaftspotential-BP), in the SRT, and increased premotor readiness (BP), in the DRT. The High-CR was faster and more accurate than the Low-CR group in the DRT and SRT, respectively. The High-CR group revealed enhanced brain preparatory activities that, paralleled to their behavioral performance, might reflect neural compensation and maintenance effects possibly counteracting the age-related decline in cognitive functioning.

EEG/ERPs were recorded during face encoding and a successive memory session. ERP data showed a baby schema effect on N170, anterior N2 and P300 responses, which were larger to infant than adult faces, regardless of ethnicity. Conversely, an ORE was found, but only for adults faces, with N170 and N400 being larger to Caucasian than non-Caucasian adult faces. Consistently, reaction times were faster to unfamiliar faces of Caucasian than non-Caucasian adults, while no ORE was found for infants. SwLORETA, applied to the difference-waves (Caucasian - non Caucasian) elicited by adults faces (ORE), showed the strong activation of areas representing person-related information (i.e., inferior temporal gyrus), prejudice representation (i.e., the superior and middle frontal gyri), and theory of mind (i.e., the supramarginal gyrus and superior parietal lobe). The lack of ethnicity effect for infants faces is discussed in the light of their innate collative and attention capturing properties.

Constitutive and Stress-Induced Psychomotor Cortical Responses to Compound K Supplementation	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ginsenoside; cortical activity; EEG; event-related potentials; source localization; exercise; psychomotor performance; stress	BOUNDARY-ELEMENT METHOD; FRONTAL-MIDLINE THETA; SAPONIN METABOLITES; PHYSICAL-EXERCISE; GINSENG; GINSENOSIDES; OSCILLATIONS; 20(S)-PROTOPANAXADIOL; PERFORMANCE; ATTENTION	Isolated ginsenoside metabolites such as Compound K (CK) are of increasing interest to consumer and clinical populations as safe and non-pharmacological means to enhance psychomotor performance constitutively and in response to physical or cognitive stress. Nevertheless, the influence of CK on behavioral performance and EEG measures of cortical activity in humans is undetermined. In this double-blinded, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced within-group study, dose-dependent responses to CK (placebo, 160 and 960 mg) were assessed after 2 weeks of supplementation in nineteen healthy men and women (age: 39.9 +/- 7.9 year, height 170.2 +/- 8.6 cm, weight 79.7 +/- 11.9 kg). Performance on upper- and lower-body choice reaction tests (CRTs) was tested before and after intense lower-body anaerobic exercise. Treatment- and stress-related changes in brain activity were measured with high-density EEG based on event-related potentials, oscillations, and source activity. Upper- (-12.3 +/- 3.5 ms, p = 0.002) and lower-body (-12.3 +/- 4.9 ms, p = 0.021) response times improved after exercise, with no difference between treatments (upper: p = 0.354; lower: p = 0.926). Analysis of cortical activity in sensor and source space revealed global increases in cortical arousal after exercise. CK increased activity in cortical regions responsible for sustained attention and mitigated exercise-induced increases in arousal. Responses to exercise varied depending on task, but CK appeared to reduce sensory interference from lower-body exercise during an upper-body CRT and improve the general maintenance of task-relevant sensory processes.

Methods: To investigate clinical and electrophysiological correlates of these processes, 20 patients with AN and 20 healthy controls (HC) completed a computerized task during EEG recording, where they were instructed to down-regulate negative emotions or food craving. Participants also completed self-report measures of emotional regulation and food addiction. The P300 and Late Positive Potential (LPP) ERPs were analysed. Results: LPP amplitudes were significantly smaller during down-regulation of food craving among both groups. Independent of task condition, individuals with AN showed smaller P300 amplitudes compared to HC. Among HC, the self-reported use of re-appraisal strategies positively correlated with LPP amplitudes during emotional regulation task, while suppressive strategies negatively correlated with LPP amplitudes. The AN group, in comparison to the HC group, exhibited greater food addiction, greater use of maladaptive strategies, and emotional dysregulation. Conclusions: Despite the enhanced self-reported psychopathology among AN, both groups indicated neurophysiological evidence of food craving regulation as evidenced by blunted LPP amplitudes in the relevant task condition. Further research is required to delineate the mechanisms associated with reduced overall P300 amplitudes among individuals with AN.

This study examined the effects of arousal-evoking stimuli of various strengths on the severity of neuroticism. Materials and Methods: In the Event Related Potential (ERP)/electroencephalograph (EEG) recording session that was held at the Clinical Neuroscience Laboratory at a local hospital, Electroencephalogram was recorded in 58 participants (N=29 for moderate neuroticism and 29 for mild neuroticism) after they were screened for the severity of the neurotic trait. Universal emotional pictures were chosen randomly from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) and were used as visual stimuli in the experiment. Visual stimuli were divided into three categories (high, moderate, low) based on the IAPS normative mean values of arousal. Results: The significant interaction effect of P300 latency between neuroticism and arousal strength was found in the mid-frontal region. Meanwhile, independent of neuroticism, the main effects of arousal strength of the P300 (amplitude and latency) and N200 (latency) were observed in the mid-central region. Conclusion: There is a significant interaction between the severity of neuroticism and the emotional arousal strength, thus, points to the implication of the emotion process in the brain rewards system especially among individuals with neuroticism.

Dissociating the contributions of reward-prediction errors to trial-level adaptation and long-term learning	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Reinforcement learning; RewP; Adaptation	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FEEDBACK; MECHANISMS; DYNAMICS; MEMORY; ERPS; EEG	Reward positivity (RewP) is an EEG component reflecting reward-prediction errors. Using multilevel models, we measured single-trial RewP amplitude from trial-to-trial, while reward and prediction varied during learning. Sixty participants completed a category-learning task in either engaging or sterile conditions with the RewP time-locked to feedback. Sequential analysis of single-trial RewP showed its relationship to current and previous accuracy, and the probability of changing one's response to subsequent stimuli. Simulations show these effects can be explained in detail by the dynamics of participants' expectations according to principles of reinforcement learning. The single-trial RewP findings were consistent with previous literature linking RewP to reward-prediction error under reinforcement-learning theory. In contrast, the aggregate RewP was unrelated to the engagement manipulation or to delayed retention performance. Thus the present results provide a detailed computational account how RewP relates to acute adaptation, but suggest RewP plays little role in long-term learning.	[Lohse, K.

Here, we examined the roles of memory processes, emotional arousal and acute stress in attentional disengagement. To this end, 64 healthy participants encoded negative and neutral facial expressions and, after being exposed to a stress or control manipulation, performed an attention task in which they had to disengage from these previously encoded as well as novel face stimuli. During the attention task, electroencephalography (EEG) and pupillometry data were recorded. Our results showed overall faster reaction times after acute stress and when participants had to disengage from emotionally negative or old facial expressions. Further, pupil dilations were larger in response to neutral faces. During disengagement, our EEG data revealed a reduced N2pc amplitude when participants disengaged from neutral compared to negative facial expressions when these were not presented before, as well as earlier onset latencies for the N400f (for disengagement from negative and old faces), the N2pc, and the LPP (for disengagement from negative faces). In addition, early visual processing of negative faces, as reflected in the P1 amplitude, was enhanced specifically in stressed participants. Our findings indicate that attentional disengagement is improved for negative and familiar stimuli and that stress facilitates not only attentional disengagement but also emotional processing in general. Together, these processes may represent important mechanisms enabling efficient performance and rapid threat detection.

There is growing evidence for the use of biofeedback (BF) in affective disorders, dissocial personality disorder, and in children with histories of abuse. Electroencephalogram (EEG) markers could be used as neurofeedback in emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD) management especially for those at high risk of suicide when emotionally aroused. This narrative review investigates the evidence for EEG markers in EUPD.Methods. PRISMA guidelines were used to conduct a narrative review. A structured search method was developed and implemented in collaboration with an information specialist. Studies were identified via 3 electronic database searches of MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO. A predesigned inclusion/exclusion criterion was applied to selected papers. A thematic analysis approach with 5 criteria was used.Results. From an initial long list of 5250 papers, 229 studies were identified and screened, of which 44 met at least 3 of the predesigned inclusion criteria. No research to date investigates EEG-based neurofeedback in EUPD. A number of different EEG biomarkers are identified but there is poor consistency between studies.Conclusions. The findings heterogeneity may be due to the disorder complexity and the variable EEG related parameters studied. An alternative explanation may be that there are a number of different neuromarkers, which could be clustered together with clinical symptomatology, to give new subdomains. Quantitative EEGs in particular may be helpful to identify more specific abnormalities. EEG standardization of neurofeedback protocols based on specific EEG abnormalities detected may facilitate targeted use of neurofeedback as an intervention in EUPD.

We examined the extent of each hemispheres' access to a meaningful mental representation of language by recording electroencephalography while participants (N = 44) completed a computer-based task where auditory sentences described individual elements of an image. If integrated successfully, this allowed the construction of a meaningful mental representation. If unsuccessful, the individual elements were in themselves meaningless. Participants saw a lateralised image that was either an integrated representation of the object described in the previous auditory passage ("integrated"), an unintegrated representation of each of the individual elements ("unintegrated"), or an integrated representation of an object that did not match the previous passage ("unrelated"). Evidenced by the trend in N300 amplitudes, we found that both hemispheres accessed a mental representation that embodied the elements described in the preceding passage. However, only the RH distinguished integrated versus unintegrated targets, suggesting that the RH accessed a mental representation that embodied the correct spatial relationships between elements (i.e., perceptual integration) as well as the individual imagined elements (i.e., perceptual elaboration). These results provide evidence of a clear RH contribution to the integration of perceptual information during language comprehension.

As one of the most inheritable sleep EEG signatures, sleep spindles probably reflect the strength and malleability of thalamocortical circuits that underlie individual cognitive profiles. We review the characteristics, organization, regulation, and origins of sleep spindles and their implication in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS) and its functions, focusing on human and rodent. Spatially, sleep spindle-related neuronal activity appears on scales ranging from small thalamic circuits to functional cortical areas, and generates a cortical state favoring intracortical plasticity while limiting cortical output. Temporally, sleep spindles are discrete events, part of a continuous power band, and elements grouped on an infraslow time scale over which NREMS alternates between continuity and fragility. We synthesize diverse and seemingly unlinked functions of sleep spindles for sleep architecture, sensory processing, synaptic plasticity, memory formation, and cognitive abilities into a unifying sleep spindle concept, according to which sleep spindles 1) generate neural conditions of large-scale functional connectivity and plasticity that outlast their appearance as discrete EEG events, 2) appear preferentially in thalamic circuits engaged in learning and attention-based experience during wakefulness, and 3) enable a selective reactivation and routing of wake-instated neuronal traces between brain areas such as hippocampus and cortex. Their fine spatiotemporal organization reflects NREMS as a physiological state coordinated over brain and body and may indicate, if not anticipate and ultimately differentiate, pathologies in sleep and neurodevelopmental, -degenerative, and -psychiatric conditions.

Speech tempo affects both the separation of concurrent speech streams and information extraction from them. The current study varied the tempo of two concurrent speech streams to investigate these processes in a multi-talker situation. Listeners performed a target-detection and a content-tracking task, while target-related ERPs and functional brain networks sensitive to speech tempo were extracted from the EEG signal. At slower than normal speech tempo, building the two streams required longer processing times, and possibly the utilization of higher-order, for example, syntactic and semantic cues. The observed longer reaction times and higher connectivity strength in a theta band network associated with frontal control over auditory/speech processing are compatible with this notion. With increasing tempo, target detection performance decreased and the N2b and the P3b amplitudes increased. These data suggest an increased need for strictly allocating target-detection-related resources at higher tempo. This was also reflected by the observed increase in the strength of gamma-band networks within and between frontal, temporal, and cingular areas. At the fastest tested speech tempo, there was a sharp drop in recognition memory performance, while target detection performance increased compared to the normal speech tempo. This was accompanied by a significant increase in the strength of a low alpha network associated with the suppression of task-irrelevant speech. These results suggest that participants prioritized the immediate target detection task over the continuous content tracking, likely due to some capacity limit reached the fastest speech tempo.

Auditory Processing of Speech and Tones in Children With Tuberous Sclerosis Complex	FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Tuberous Sclerosis Complex; autism spectrum disorder; auditory evoked potential; MVPA; mismatch negativity	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; MOUSE MODEL; AUTISM; MYELINATION; DYNAMICS; INFANTS; TSC1	Individuals with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) have atypical white matter integrity and neural connectivity in the brain, including language pathways. To explore functional activity associated with auditory and language processing in individuals with TSC, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to examine basic auditory correlates of detection (P1, N2, N4) and discrimination (mismatch negativity, MMN) of speech and non-speech stimuli for children with TSC and age- and sex-matched typically developing (TD) children. Children with TSC (TSC group) and without TSC (typically developing, TD group) participated in an auditory MMN paradigm containing two blocks of vowels (/a/and/u/) and two blocks of tones (800 Hz and 400 Hz). Continuous EEG data were collected. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was used to explore functional specificity of neural auditory processing. Speech-specific P1, N2, and N4 waveform components of the auditory evoked potential (AEP) were compared, and the mismatch response was calculated for both speech and tones. MVPA showed that the TD group, but not the TSC group, demonstrated above-chance pairwise decoding between speech and tones. The AEP component analysis suggested that while the TD group had an increased P1 amplitude in response to vowels compared to tones, the TSC group did not show this enhanced response to vowels. Additionally, the TD group had a greater N2 amplitude in response to vowels, but not tones, compared to the TSC group. The TSC group also demonstrated a longer N4 latency to vowels compared to tones, which was not seen in the TD group. No group differences were observed in the MMN response. In this study we identified features of the auditory response to speech sounds, but not acoustically matched tones, which differentiate children with TSC from TD children.

Children completed two declarative learning tasks that differed in the number of object-name pairs they were required to learn, deeming the task with twice as many pairs as more difficult. EEG was recorded during the tasks, and event related potentials time-locked to the feedback presentation were analyzed. Additionally, Accuracy was measured in test block at the end of each task. Behaviorally, children achieved better accuracy on the easy task than on the difficult task. In line with previous findings in adults, the FRN was not found sensitive to task difficulty. However, a feedback-related P300 and a fronto-central positivity that followed the FRN were found sensitive to task difficulty such that their amplitudes were larger in the easy task. This pattern is opposite to that reported previously in adults and may reflect the effect of motivation on attention allocation in children.

Altered phase and nonphase EEG activity expose impaired maintenance of a spatial-object attentional focus in multiple sclerosis patients	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; ALERTING NETWORK DYSFUNCTION; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; ALPHA-BAND; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; MODULATIONS; POTENTIALS; FREQUENCY	Some of the anatomical and functional basis of cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS) currently remains unknown. In particular, there is scarce knowledge about modulations in induced EEG (nonphase activity) for diverse frequency bands related to attentional deficits in this pathology. The present study analyzes phase and nonphase alpha and gamma modulations in 26 remitting-relapsing multiple sclerosis patients during their participation in the attention network test compared with twenty-six healthy controls (HCs) matched in sociodemographic variables. Behavioral results showed that the MS group exhibited general slowing, suggesting impairment in alerting and orienting networks, as has been previously described in other studies. Time-frequency analysis of EEG revealed that the gamma band was related to the spatial translation of the attentional focus, and the alpha band seemed to be related to the expectancy mechanisms and cognitive processing of the target. Moreover, phase and nonphase modulations differed in their psychophysiological roles and were affected differently in the MS and HC groups. In summary, nonphase modulations can unveil hidden cognitive mechanisms for phase analysis and complete our knowledge of the neural basis of cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis pathology.

Awareness is related to reduced post-stimulus alpha power: a no-report inattentional blindness study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha oscillations; attention; awareness; neural oscillations; visual awareness negativity	BAND OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN EEG; ATTENTION; CAPTURE; CONSCIOUSNESS; PERCEPTION; RHYTHM; INCREASES; REFLECT; PREDICT	Delineating the neural correlates of sensory awareness is a key requirement for developing a neuroscientific understanding of consciousness. A neural signal that has been proposed as a key neural correlate of awareness is amplitude reduction of 8-14 Hz alpha oscillations. Alpha oscillations are also closely linked to processes of spatial attention, providing potential alternative explanations for past results associating alpha oscillations with awareness. We employed a no-report inattentional blindness (IB) paradigm with electroencephalography to examine the association between awareness and the power of 8-14 Hz alpha oscillations. We asked whether the alpha-power decrease commonly reported when stimuli are perceived is related to awareness, or other factors that commonly confound awareness investigations, specifically task-relevance and visual salience. Two groups of participants performed a target discrimination task at fixation while irrelevant non-salient shape probes were presented briefly in the left or right visual field. One group was explicitly informed of the peripheral probes at the commencement of the experiment (the control group), whereas the other was not told about the probes until halfway through the experiment (IB group). Consequently, the IB group remained unaware of the probes for the first half of the experiment. In all conditions in which participants were aware of the probes, there was an enhanced negativity in the event-related potential (the visual awareness negativity). Furthermore, there was an extended contralateral alpha-power decrease when the probes were perceived, which was not present when they failed to reach awareness. These results suggest alpha oscillations are intrinsically associated with awareness itself.

Previous research suggests that bilinguals use inhibition (e.g., Jackson et al., 2001), which should be reflected in the N2 component of the event-related potential (ERP) in the EEG. In the current study, we investigated the dynamics of inhibitory control by measuring the N2 during language switching and repetition in bilingual picture naming. Participants had to name pictures in Dutch or English depending on the cue. A run of same-language trials could be short (two or three trials) or long (five or six trials). We assessed whether RTs and N2 changed over the course of same-language runs, and at a switch between languages. Results showed that speakers named pictures more quickly late as compared to early in a run of same-language trials. Moreover, they made a language switch more quickly after a long run than after a short run. This run-length effect was only present in the first language (L1), not in the second language (L2). In ERPs, we observed a widely distributed switch effect in the N2, which was larger after a short run than after a long run. This effect was only present in the L2, not in the Ll, although the difference was not significant between languages. In contrast, the N2 was not modulated during a same-language run. Our results suggest that the nontarget language is inhibited at a switch, but not during the repeated use of the target language.

Behavioral measures included child performance in learning the concept during the pretest, practice, and posttest portions of the game. Neural correlates using electroencephalography focused on event-related potentials, N2 and P3, and joint-time frequencies specifically alpha at three sites; F3, F4, and Pz. Results indicate that all of the participants exhibited naive conceptions regarding the optics concept, and children 8-12 were successful in learning through video game play. Analyses of correct versus incorrect trials uncovered several interaction effects at the left superior frontal sulcus (F3). Suppression of alpha waves at F3 coincided with correct responses on the posttest. We conclude that suppression of alpha at F3 is essential for spatial concept learning and suggest further research into the field of optical spatial reasoning and spatial learning limitations exhibited by young children.

Early detection of such prevalent abnormality through EEG pattern analysis with the help of computer-aided diagnostic tools; provide significant relief to the health care professionals for better management and treatment of such patients. This work has been proposed as an investigation of the sensory responsiveness of the children affected by ASD. This ASD is analyzed by extracting the non-linear features of the EEG signal. A total of 73 EEG signals are collected from different patients out of which 41 are affected with ASD and 32 with normal neural activity. These signals are then pre-processed and filtered using a low pass filter and then separated using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) into additive subcomponents. Significant features are extracted, which can be further investigated to identify event-related potential and Non-biological Artifacts. These features are then classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an accuracy of 90.41%. As a result, appropriate sensory profiles can be obtained that may help proper diagnosis and treatment at an early stage.

This study attempted to influence this context with a placebo. Sixty-eight women were randomly assigned to three groups: Water, Bitter/No-Placebo, Bitter/Placebo. Participants in the 'bitter groups' first rinsed their mouth with wormwood tea that caused a bitter aftertaste. Subsequently, the placebo group received sham light therapy on the tongue to 'reduce the sensitivity of the taste buds'. All groups viewed disgusting and non-disgusting pictures while their electroencephalogram was recorded. The Bitter/Placebo group reported reduced bitterness and disgust for the aftertaste after the sham treatment. The LPP reduction (300 - 600 ms after picture onset) associated with the bitter aftertaste (as shown by the Bitter/No-Placebo group) was attenuated due to the placebo treatment. This is the first EEG study to demonstrate that a context-targeting placebo is able to change automatic attention allocation.

Here, we investigated how rapidly representations of facial attractiveness emerge in the human brain. In an EEG experiment, participants viewed 100 face photographs and rated them for their attractiveness. Using time-resolved representational similarity analysis on the EEG data, we reveal representations of facial attractiveness after 150-200 ms of cortical processing. Interestingly, we show that these representations are related to individual participants' personal attractiveness judgments, suggesting that already early perceptual representations of facial attractiveness convey idiosyncratic attractiveness preferences. Further, we show that these early representations are genuinely related to attractiveness, as they are neither explained by other high-level face attributes, such as face sex or age, nor by features extracted by an artificial deep neural network model of face processing. Together, our results demonstrate early, individually specific, and genuine representations of facial attractiveness, which may underlie fast attractiveness judgments.

This review systematically analyzes the available human studies to identify harmful stressors, vulnerable periods during pregnancy, specificities in the outcome and biological correlates of the relation between maternal stress and offspring outcome. Effects of maternal stress on offspring neurodevelopment, cognitive development, negative affectivity, difficult temperament and psychiatric disorders are shown in numerous epidemiological and case-control studies. Offspring of both sexes are susceptible to prenatal stress but effects differ. There is not any specific vulnerable period of gestation; prenatal stress effects vary for different gestational ages possibly depending on the developmental stage of specific brain areas and circuits, stress system and immune system. Biological correlates in the prenatally stressed offspring are: aberrations in neurodevelopment, neurocognitive function, cerebral processing, functional and structural brain connectivity involving amygdalae and (pre)frontal cortex, changes in hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis and autonomous nervous system.

In particular, nonhuman primate faces are poorly discriminated compared to human faces in behavioral tasks. So far however, a clear and consistent marker that quantifies our expertise in human over monkey face discrimination directly from brain activity is lacking. Here, using scalp electroencephalography (EEG), we isolate a direct signature of individuation abilities for human and nonhuman (i.e., macaque faces) primate faces. Human or monkey faces were rapidly presented at a base rate of 12 Hz in upright or inverted orientations while participants performed an orthogonal behavioral task. In each stimulation sequence, eight face images of one individual were used as base stimuli, while images of other individuals were briefly introduced every 9th stimulus to quantify an identity-change response at 1.33 Hz and harmonics (i.e., integer multiples) in the EEG frequency spectrum. The brain response to upright human faces was twice as large as to monkey faces, and reduced following picture-plane inversion for human faces only. This reflects the disruption of high-level face identity discrimination developed for the canonical upright human face. No difference was observed between upright monkey faces and inverted human faces, suggesting non-expert visual processes for those two face formats associated with little experience. In addition, the size of the inversion effect for human, but not monkey faces, was predictive of the expertise effect (i.e., difference between upright human and monkey faces) at the individual level. This result suggests a selective ability to discriminate human faces that does not contribute to the individuation of other unexperienced face morphologies such as monkey faces. Overall, these findings indicate that human expertise for conspecific face discrimination can be isolated and quantified in individual human brains.

Effect of Short-Term Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation (tVNS) on Brain Processing of Food Cues: An Electrophysiological Study	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						tVNS; food; ERP; P2 and N2; brain stimulation; human; healthy; Bayesian	BODY-WEIGHT; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; EATING-DISORDERS; OBESITY; NEUROMODULATION; POTENTIALS; COMPONENT; IDENTIFICATION; METABOLISM; ATTENTION	Background: The vagus nerve plays an important role in the regulation of food intake. Modulating vagal activityviaelectrical stimulation (VNS) in patients and animal studies caused changes in food intake, energy metabolism, and body weight. However, the moderating impact of cognitive processes on VNS effects on eating behavior has not been investigated so far. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) affects food intake by altering cognitive functions relevant to the processing of food-related information. Methods: Using a repeated-measurement design, we applied tVNS and a sham stimulation for 2 h on two different days in normal-weight subjects. We recorded standard scalp EEG while subjects watched food and object pictures presented in an oddball task. We analyzed the event-related potentials (ERPs) P1, P2, N2, and LPP and also examined the amount of consumed food and eating duration in a free-choice test meal. Results: Significant differences between stimulations were observed for the P1, P2, and N2 amplitudes. However, we found no tVNS-dependent modulation of food intake nor a specific food-related stimulation effect on the ERPs. Further analyses revealed a negative relationship between P2 amplitude and food intake for the sham stimulation. Significant effects are additionally confirmed by Bayesian statistics. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates tVNS' impact on visual processing. Since the effects were similar between food and object stimuli, a general effect on visual perceptual processing can be assumed. More detailed investigations of these effects and their relationship with food intake and metabolism seem reasonable for future studies.

The dataset of ASSRs without BF-PV stimulation (dataset 1) contains raw 36-channel EEG epochs of ASSRs elicited by 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50Hz click trains and time stamps of stimulations. The dataset of ASSRs with BF-PV stimulation (dataset 2) contains raw 36-channel EEG epochs of 40-Hz ASSRs during BF-PV stimulation with latencies of 0, 6.25, 12.5, and 18.75ms and time stamps of stimulations. We provide the datasets and step-by-step tutorial analysis scripts written in Python, allowing for descriptions of the event-related potentials, spectrograms, and the topography of power. We complement this experimental dataset with simulation results using a time-dependent perturbation on coupled oscillators. This publicly available dataset will be beneficial to the experimental and computational neuroscientists.

Neural Compensation Mechanisms of Siblings of Schizophrenia Patients as Revealed by High-Density EEG	SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN			English	Article						siblings; schizophrenia; compensation; GFP; EEG; backward masking	BACKWARD-MASKING PERFORMANCE; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ENDOPHENOTYPES; ACETYLCHOLINE; DISORDER; GENETICS; DEFICITS; SYSTEM	Visual backward masking (VBM) deficits are candidate endophenotypes of schizophrenia indexing genetic liability of the disorder. In VBM, a target is followed by a mask that deteriorates target perception. Schizophrenia patients and, to a lesser extent, their unaffected relatives show strong and reproducible VBM deficits. In patients, VBM deficits are associated with strongly decreased amplitudes in the evoked-related potentials (ERPs). Here, to unveil the neural mechanisms of VBM in schizophrenia, circumventing illness-specific confounds, we investigated the electroencephalogram correlates of VBM in unaffected siblings of schizophrenia patients. We tested 110 schizophrenia patients, 60 siblings, and 83 healthy controls. As in previous studies, patients showed strong behavioral deficits and decreased ERP amplitudes compared to controls. Surprisingly, the ERP amplitudes of siblings were even higher than the ones of controls, while their performances were similar. ERP amplitudes in siblings were found to correlate with performance. These results suggest that VBM is deteriorated in patients and siblings. However, siblings, unlike patients, can partially compensate for the deficits by over-activating a network of brain regions.

Altered proactive control in adults with ADHD: Evidence from event-related potentials during cued task switching	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Proactive control; Cued task switching; ERP; ADHD	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; REWARD ANTICIPATION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; MECHANISMS; FMRI; METAANALYSIS; INHIBITION; SCALE	Cognitive control has two distinct modes - proactive and reactive (Braver, T. S. (2012). The variable nature of cognitive control: a dual mechanisms framework. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 16(2), 105-112). ADHD has been associated with cognitive control impairments. However, studies have mainly focused on reactive control and not proactive control. Here we investigated neural correlates of proactive and reactive cognitive control in a group of adults with ADHD versus healthy controls by employing a cued switching task while cue informativeness was manipulated and EEG recorded. On the performance level, only a trend to generally slower responding was found in the ADHD group. Cue-locked analyses revealed an attenuated informative-positivity - a differential component appearing when contrasting informative with non-informative alerting cues - and potentially altered lateralisation of the switch-positivity - evident in the contrast between switch and repeat trials for informative cues - in ADHD. No difference in target-locked activity was found. Our results indicate altered proactive rather than reactive control in adults with ADHD, evidenced by less use of cued advance information and abnormal preparatory processes for upcoming tasks.

Research in Tourette syndrome has traditionally focused on the motor system. However, there is increasing evidence that perceptual and cognitive processes play a crucial role as well. Against this background it has been reasoned that processes linking perception and action might be particularly affected in these patients with the strength of perception-action binding being increased. However, this has not yet been studied experimentally. Here, we investigated adult Tourette patients within the framework of the `Theory of Event Coding' using an experimental approach allowing us to directly test the strength of perception-action binding. We included 24 adult patients with Tourette syndrome and n = 24 healthy control subjects using a previously established visual-motor event file task with four levels of feature overlap requiring repeating or alternating responses. Concomitant to behavioural testing, EEG was recorded and analysed using temporal signal decomposition and source localization methods. On a behavioural level, perception-action binding was increased in Tourette patients. Tic frequency correlated with performance in conditions where unbinding processes of previously established perception-action bindings were required with higher tic frequency being associated with stronger perception-action binding. This suggests that perception-action binding is intimately related to the occurrence of tics. Analysis of EEG data showed that behavioural changes cannot be explained based on simple perceptual or motor processes. Instead, cognitive processes linking perception to action in inferior parietal cortices are crucial. Our findings suggest that motor or sensory processes alone are less relevant for the understanding of Tourette syndrome than cognitive processes engaged in linking and restructuring of perception-action association. A broader cognitive framework encompassing perception and action appears well suited to opening new routes for the understanding of Tourette syndrome.

Augmenting these with neurophysiological measures of the construct in question may increase the accuracy and predictive power of these assessments. Moreover, thinking about neurophysiological measures from an assessment perspective may facilitate under-utilized research approaches (e.g., brain-based recruitment of participants). However, the lack of normative data for most neurophysiological measures has prevented the comparison of individual responses to the general population, precluding these approaches. The current work examines the distributions of two event-related potentials (ERPs) commonly used in individual differences research: the error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe). Across three lab sites, 800 unselected participants between the ages of 18 and 30 performed the arrow version of a Flanker task while EEG was recorded. Percentile scores and distributions for ERPs on error trials, correct trials, and the difference (Delta ERN, Delta Pe; error minus correct) at Fz, Cz and Pz are reported. The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile values for the Delta ERN at Cz were -2.37 mu V, -5.41 mu V, and -8.65 mu V, respectively. The same values for Delta Pe at Cz were 7.51 mu V, 11.18 mu V, and 15.55 mu V. Females displayed significantly larger Delta Pe magnitudes and smaller Delta ERN magnitudes than males. Additionally, normative data for behavioral performance (accuracy, post-error slowing, and reaction time) on the Flanker task is reported. Results provide a means by which ERN and Pe amplitudes of young adults elicited by the arrow Flanker task can be benchmarked, facilitating the classification of neural responses as 'large,' 'medium,' or 'small'. The ability to classify responses in this manner is a necessary step towards expanded use of these measures in assessment and research settings. These norms may not apply to ERPs elicited by other tasks, and future work should establish similar norms using other tasks.

Psychophysiological Correlates of Emotional-and Alcohol-Related Cues Processing in Offspring of Alcohol-Dependent Patients	ALCOHOL AND ALCOHOLISM			English	Article							THETA OSCILLATIONS; FAMILY-HISTORY; MODULATION; ATTENTION; DRINKERS; DRINKING; STIMULI; ANXIETY; MARKERS; PERIOD	Aims: To determinate if offspring of alcohol-dependent patients (OA) process affective stimuli and alcohol-related cues in a different manner than control subjects do. Methods: Event-related potentials (early posterior negativity [EPN]/ late positive potential [LPP]) and event-related oscillations (Theta) were obtained by electroencephalographic (EEG) recording during the viewing of International Affective Picture System (ZAPS) images with positive, negative and neutral valence, as well as alcohol-related cues. The total sample was comprised of 60 participants, divided into two groups: one group consisted of OA (30) and the control group of participants with negative family history of alcohol use disorders (30). Results: Theta power analysis implies a significant interaction between condition, region and group factors. Post-hoc analysis indicates an increased theta power for the OA at different regions, during pleasant (frontal, central, parietal, occipital, right temporal); unpleasant (frontal, central, occipital); alcohol (frontal, central, parietal, occipital, right and left temporal) and neutral (occipital) cues. There are no group differences regarding any of the event-related potential measurements (EPN/LPP). Conclusions: There is evidence of alterations in the processing of affective stimuli and alcohol-related information, evidenced by changes in theta brain oscillations. These alterations are characterized by an increased emotional reactivity, evidenced by increased theta at posterior sites. There is also an increased recruitment of emotion control, which could be a compensation mechanism, evidenced by increased theta power at anterior sites during affective stimuli and alcohol cues.

This approach can provide useful information about individual differences in information processing, such as the ability to adapt behavior based on attentional demands ("brain-behavioral adaptability"). Anxiety and depression are associated with maladaptive information processing implicating aberrant cognition-emotion interactions, but whether brain-behavioral adaptability predicts response to psychotherapy is not known. We used a novel person-centered, trial-level analysis approach to link neural indices of stimulus processing to behavioral responses and to predict treatment outcome. Thirty-nine patients with anxiety and/or depression received 12 weeks of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Prior to treatment, patients performed a speeded reaction-time task involving briefly-presented pairs of aversive and neutral pictures while electroencephalography was recorded. Multilevel modeling demonstrated that larger LPPs predicted slower responses on subsequent trials, suggesting that increased attention to the task-irrelevant nature of pictures interfered with reaction time on subsequent trials. Whereas using LPP and RT averages did not distinguish CBT responders from nonresponders, in trial-level analyses individuals who demonstrated greater ability to benefit behaviorally (i.e., faster RT) from smaller LPPs on the previous trial (greater brain-behavioral adaptability) were more likely to respond to treatment and showed greater improvements in depressive symptoms. These results highlight the utility of trial-level analyses to elucidate variability in within-subjects, brain-behavioral attentional coupling in the context of emotion processing, in predicting response to CBT for emotional disorders.

Moreover, diagnosing idiopathic hypersomnia is challenging as patients can report significant symptoms but may not meet diagnostic criteria on standard objective tests. Advanced analyses of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity could provide objective markers of idiopathic hypersomnia and explain part of its pathophysiology and heterogeneity. In fact, the EEG signal recorded during wakefulness and sleep not only captures sleep macroarchitecture but also homeostatic sleep process efficiency, strength of neural synchrony during sleep, sleep consolidation, and changes in cognitive processes. In this review, we will present current and potential markers of idiopathic hypersomnia, with a focus on sleep propensity. We will also discuss EEG changes occurring in sleep deprivation conditions and recovery nights, as well as those observed in other central hypersomnolence conditions, namely narcolepsy type-1 and type-2.Recent FindingsAmong EEG markers studied in sleep deprivation and narcolepsy are those derived from sleep macroarchitecture (sleep consolidation, sleep stage proportion, sleep-stage transitions, sleep onset in rapid-eye movement sleep) and microarchitecture (slow-wave activity, spindles), spectral analysis of the waking electroencephalographic signal, and cognitive event-related potentials. To date, no clear objective EEG markers of idiopathic hypersomnia exist, as studies were generally performed on small samples, used heterogeneous protocols (including changes of diagnostic criteria that occurred over time), and most of them focused on more traditional macroarchitecture sleep analyses.SummaryBased on studies of sleep deprivation and narcolepsy, further studies are needed to understand the EEG signal in idiopathic hypersomnia. Future studies should take advantage of the richness and the complexity of the EEG signal and verify whether subgroups of hypersomniac patients exist.

The aim of the current study was to investigate the neurotransmitter systems involved in the anticipation of reward value and probability. We hypothesized that dopaminergic and noradrenergic antagonism would affect anticipation of reward value and probability, respectively. Twenty-three healthy participants were included in a haloperidol (2 mg) x clonidine (0.150 mg) x placebo cross-over design and subjected to a Go/NoGo experimental task during which cues signaled the probability of subsequent target appearance. Reward value (amount of money that could be won for correct and fast responding to the target) as well as probability of target appearance was orthogonally manipulated across four task blocks. Cue-elicited EEG event-related potentials were recorded to assess anticipation of value and probability, respectively. The processing of reward value was affected by dopaminergic antagonism (haloperidol), as evidenced by reduction of the reward-related positivity and P300 to reward cues. This reduction was specifically significant for subjects with high baseline dopamine levels for the P300 and most pronounced for these subjects for the reward-related positivity. In contrast, the processing of reward probability was affected by noradrenergic antagonism (clonidine). In addition, both drugs reduced overall performance (omission rate, response speed variability). We conclude that at least anticipation of reward value and probability, respectively, is specifically affected by dopaminergic versus noradrenergic antagonism.	[Schutte, Iris; Kenemans, J.

Neural correlates of task-related refixation behavior	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Saccade planning; Free viewing; Task relevance; Visual search	EXECUTIVE WORKING-MEMORY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EYE-MOVEMENTS; VISUAL-SEARCH; SCENE PERCEPTION; ATTENTION; EEG; MECHANISMS; FIXATIONS; SALIENCY	Eye movement research has shown that attention shifts from the currently fixated location to the next before a saccade is executed. We investigated whether the cost of the attention shift depends on higher-order processing at the time of fixation, in particular on visual working memory load differences between fixations and refixations on task-relevant items. The attention shift is reflected in EEG activity in the saccade-related potential (SRP). In a free viewing task involving visual search and memorization of multiple targets amongst distractors, we compared the SRP in first fixations versus refixations on targets and distractors. The task-relevance of targets implies that more information will be loaded in memory (e.g. both identity and location) than for distractors (e.g. location only). First fixations will involve greater memory load than refixations, since first fixations involve loading of new items, while refixations involve rehearsal of previously visited items. The SRP in the interval preceding the saccade away from a target or distractor revealed that saccade preparation is affected by task-relevance and refixation behavior. For task-relevant items only, we found longer fixation duration and higher SRP amplitudes for first fixations than for refixations over the occipital region and the opposite effect over the frontal region. Our findings provide first neurophysiological evidence that working memory loading of task-relevant information at fixation affects saccade planning.

Each instance was represented by four features computed from two sub-bands, extracted using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) for each channel, and the feature vectors were used as input for one-class/multi-class support vector machines (SVMs). We tested the method on data from the event-related potentials (ERPs) of 26 subjects and 56 channels. The optimization process was performed by the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA), which found a three-channel combination that achieved an accuracy of 0.83, with both a true acceptance rate (TAR) and a true rejection rate (TRR) of 1.00. In the best case, we obtained an accuracy of up to 0.98 for subject identification with a TAR of 0.95 and a TRR 0.93, all using seven EEG channels found by NSGA-III in a subset of subjects manually created.

In previous EEG research enhanced event-related potentials (ERPs) in the late-positive potential (LPP) window have been observed. Further, studies with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and fMRI suggest that spider phobia is associated with enhanced activation within cortical and subcortical areas. In the current study we investigated the neuronal correlates of spider phobia in a combined fNIRS-EEG study. To this end, 37 spider phobic patients (PP) and 32 healthy controls (HC) underwent a symptom provocation paradigm during which subjects watched video clips of spiders and domestic animals (confrontation phase) after being primed on the content of the video (anticipation phase). Simultaneously, fNIRS, EEG, electromyography (EMG), electrocardiography and behavioral measures were assessed. Results showed increased LPP amplitudes, increased hemodynamic responses in the cognitive control network, and increased EMG activity and heart rate during spider conditions in PP in comparison to HC. Furthermore, in behavioral ratings PP showed higher emotional distress and avoidance. Behavioral ratings, fNIRS and EEG data showed positive correlations on a between-subject as well as on a within-subject level. Our results merge the existing data on neurophysiological correlates of phobic stimulus processing in hemodynamic and electrophysiological research and extend those of static visual material (pictures) to dynamic visual material (videos).

However, the neural mechanisms that underlie the effects of this intervention are poorly understood. Objectives The present study investigated the effects of a single session of CAT on event-related and readiness potentials during preparation of approach and avoidance movements to alcohol cues. Methods Heavy drinking young adults (N = 60) were randomly assigned to complete either CAT or control training. After training, we recorded participants' event-related and motor readiness potentials as they were preparing to respond. Results In the CAT group, N200 amplitude was higher when preparing to approach rather than avoid alcohol pictures. In the control group, N200 amplitudes did not differ for approach and avoidance to alcohol pictures. Regarding the late positive potential (LPP), in the CAT group, the negativity of this was blunted when preparing to avoid alcohol pictures relative to when preparing to avoid control pictures. In the control group, the negativity of the LPP was blunted when preparing to approach alcohol pictures relative to when preparing to approach control pictures. There were no effects on motor readiness potentials. Behavioural effects indicated short-lived effects of training on reaction times during the training block that did not persist when participants were given time to prepare their motor response before executing it during the EEG testing block. Conclusions After a single session of CAT, the enhanced N200 when approaching alcohol cues may indicate the engagement of executive control to overcome the associations learned during training. These findings clarify the neural mechanisms that may underlie the effects of CAT on drinking behaviour.	[Di Lemma, Lisa C.

Towards error categorisation in BCI: single-trial EEG classification between different errors	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						ErrP; EEG; classification; BCI; human machine interaction; neurophysiology; error detection	FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; ERP COMPONENTS; AWARENESS; RECOGNITION; POTENTIALS; PE	Objective. Error-related potentials (ErrP) are generated in the brain when humans perceive errors. These ErrP signals can be used to classify actions as erroneous or non-erroneous, using single-trial electroencephalography (EEG). A small number of studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using ErrP detection as feedback for reinforcement-learning-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI), confirming the possibility of developing more autonomous BCI. These systems could be made more efficient with specific information about the type of error that occurred. A few studies differentiated the ErrP of different errors from each other, based on direction or severity. However, errors cannot always be categorised in these ways. We aimed to investigate the feasibility of differentiating very similar error conditions from each other, in the absence of previously explored metrics. Approach. In this study, we used two data sets with 25 and 14 participants to investigate the differences between errors. The two error conditions in each task were similar in terms of severity, direction and visual processing. The only notable differences between them were the varying cognitive processes involved in perceiving the errors, and differing contexts in which the errors occurred. We used a linear classifier with a small feature set to differentiate the errors on a single-trial basis. Main results. For both data sets, we observed neurophysiological distinctions between the ErrPs related to each error type. We found further distinctions between age groups. Furthermore, we achieved statistically significant single-trial classification rates for most participants included in the classification phase, with mean overall accuracy of 65.2% and 65.6% for the two tasks. Significance. As a proof of concept our results showed that it is feasible, using single-trial EEG, to classify these similar error types against each other. This study paves the way for more detailed and efficient learning in BCI, and thus for a more autonomous human-machine interaction.

Generalization to an untrained vowel and a non-linguistic sound was also examined. Twelve adults underwent four sessions of listen-and-repeat training over two days with the pseudoword contrast /tite/-/ti:te/. Generalization effects were examined with another vowel contrast, /tote/-/to:te/ and a sinusoidal tone pair as a non-linguistic stimulus. Learning effects were measured with psychophysiological (EEG) event-related potentials (mismatch negativity and N1), behavioral discrimination tasks and production tasks. The results showed clear improvement in all perception measurements for the trained stimuli. The effects also affected the untrained vowel by eliciting an N1 response, and affected the behavioral perception of the non-linguistic stimuli. The MMN response for the untrained linguistic stimuli, however, did not increase. These findings suggest that the training was able to increase the sensitivity of preattentive auditory duration discrimination, but that phoneme-specific spectral information may also be needed to shape the neural representation of phoneme categories.

For this purpose, brain responses of the brain to changes in brightness were explored comparatively using different emotional images (pleasant, unpleasant and neutral) with different luminance levels. In the study, electroencephalography recordings from 12 different electrode sites of 31 healthy participants were used. The power spectra obtained from the analysis of the recordings using short time Fourier transform were analyzed, and a statistical analysis was performed on features extracted from these power spectra. Statistical findings were compared with those obtained from behavioral data. The results showed that the brightness of visual stimuli affected the power of brain responses depending on frequency, time and location. According to the statistically verified findings, the increase in the brightness of pleasant and neutral images increased the average power of responses in the parietal and occipital regions whereas the increase in the brightness of unpleasant images decreased the average power of responses in these regions. Moreover, the statistical results obtained for unpleasant images were found to be in accordance with the behavioral data. The results revealed that the brightness of visual stimuli could be represented by changing the activity power of the brain cortex. The findings emphasized that the brightness of visual stimuli should be viewed as an important parameter in studies using emotional image techniques such as image classification, emotion evaluation and neuro-marketing.

We recently demonstrated that the early (50-90 ms) event-related potential (ERP) response observed in sighted people during a spatial bisection task, is altered in early blind people and is influenced by the amount of time spent without vision in late blind individuals. Specifically, in late blind people a shorter period of blindness is associated with strong contralateral activation in occipital cortex and good performance during the spatial task-similar to that of sighted people. In contrast, non-lateralized occipital activation and lower performance characterize late blind individuals who have experienced a longer period of blindness-similar to that of early blind people. However, the same early occipital response activated in sighted individuals by spatial cues has been found to be activated by temporal cues in early blind individuals. Here, we investigate whether a similar temporal attraction can explain the neural and behavioral changes observed after many years of blindness in late blind people. An EEG recording was taken during a spatial bisection task where coherent and conflicting spatio-temporal information was presented. In participants with long blindness duration, the early recruitment of both visual and auditory areas is sensitive to temporal instead of spatial coordinates. These findings highlight some limits of neuroplasticity. Perceptual advantages from cross-sensory calibration during development seem to be subsequently lost following years of visual deprivation. This result has important implications for clinical outcomes following late blindness, highlighting the importance of timing in intervention and rehabilitation programs that activate compensatory strategies soon after sensory loss.

Neural responses to social acceptance predict behavioral adjustments following peer feedback in the context of a real-time social interaction task	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						event&#8208; related potentials; reward positivity; social behaviors; social rewards	ELECTROCORTICAL ACTIVITY; EXTERNALIZING PROBLEMS; EARLY ADOLESCENCE; HELPING-BEHAVIOR; POSITIVE AFFECT; SEX-DIFFERENCES; EEG RESPONSES; SELF-REPORT; REWARD; STRESS	Strong social connections are important predictors of both mental and physical health. The ability to effectively process social feedback from other people and adjust behavior accordingly is a critical part of skillfully navigating the social landscape. However, relatively few studies have considered neural systems driving these behavioral adjustments. In this study, 254 participants engaged in a peer interaction game while electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. In this game, participants repeatedly "interact" with a small set of virtual peers over a series of rounds, in which they provide feedback to their peers, and receive feedback from them in turn. A reward-sensitive event-related potential called the Reward Positivity (RewP) was extracted from the EEG following positive feedback from peers, and multilevel modeling was used to examine whether the RewP moderated associations between the feedback participants received during the task and their subsequent behavior. Participants were more likely to accept coplayers who had previously voted to accept them, and to like coplayers who had voted to accept them on the same round. A larger RewP was associated with a stronger tendency to modify behavior following feedback from peers, both in terms of voting behavior and expressions of liking. These data suggest that initial neural responsiveness to reward within 300 ms of positive social feedback may guide social behaviors. Thus, this line of research represents an important step toward a more complete understanding of the ways in which neural responses to feedback are involved in human social behaviors.

Objectives also include the development of an output device, that is capable of real time execution of the selected commands. Methods: A region based T9 BCI system with familiar face presentation cues capable of eliciting strong P300 responses was developed. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were collected from the Oz, POz, CPz and Cz electrode locations on the scalp and subsequently filtered, averaged and used to extract two features. These feature sets were classified using the Nearest Neighbour Approach (NNA). To complement the developed BCI system, a 'drone prototype' capable of simulating six different movements, each over a range of eight distinct selectable distances, was also developed. This was achieved through the construction of a body with 4 movable legs, capable of tilting the main body forward, backward, up and down, as well as a pointer capable of turning left and right. Results: From ten participants, with normal or corrected to normal vision, an average accuracy of 91.3 +/- 4.8% and an ITR of 2.2 +/- 1.1 commands/minute (12.2 +/- 6.0 bits/minute) was achieved. Conclusion: The proposed system was shown to elicit strong P300 responses. When compared to similar P300 BCI systems, which utilise a variety of more complex classifiers, competitive accuracy and ITR results were achieved, implying the superiority of the proposed GUI. Significance: This study supports the hypothesis that more research, time and care should be taken when developing GUIs for BCI systems.

However, the measurement of these associations presents a challenge, since the reliability and validity of behavioral tests (despite their widespread usage) is unsatisfactory by most accounts. As a possible alternative, an electroencephalographic (EEG) index (i.e., P3b amplitude) was examined in the present study. Design: We used a mixed-factor design, with one group of insufficiently and one group of sufficiently physically active participants being compared across different experimental conditions. Methods: Thirty-seven insufficiently and thirty-six sufficiently active participants viewed exercise-related images presented within series of negative, neutral, or positive images and rated all images as negative (unpleasant) or positive (pleasant) while EEG recordings were obtained. The amplitude of the P3b component of the EEG-derived event-related potential, time-locked to the onset of exercise images in each context (series), was extracted as the dependent variable. Results: Insufficiently active participants rated the exercise-related images as neutral-to-positive, whereas sufficiently active participants rated the images as positive. However, all participants exhibited the smallest P3b amplitude when the images were presented in the neutral context, suggesting that the images were registering as neutral. Conclusion: Exercise-related images may evoke neutral automatic associations, but these associations may differ from how individuals reflectively rate the same images. P3b amplitude may be useful in detecting such discrepancies and potentially a promising (evidence-based) option for assessing automatic associations of exercise stimuli.

The cognitive processes underlying dual tasking have been investigated extensively using EEG. Due to technological restrictions, however, this was not possible for dual-task scenarios including locomotion. With new technological opportunities, this became possible and cognitive-motor interference can be studied, even in outside-the-lab environments. In the present study, participants carried out a cognitive-motor interference task as they responded to cued, auditory task-switch stimuli while performing locomotive tasks with increasing complexity (standing, walking, traversing an obstacle course). We observed increased subjective workload ratings as well as decreased behavioural performance for increased movement complexity and cognitive task difficulty. A higher movement load went along with a decrease of parietal P2, N2 and P3 amplitudes and frontal Theta power. A higher cognitive load, on the other hand, was reflected by decreased frontal CNV amplitudes. Additionally, a connectivity analysis using inter-site phase coherence revealed that higher movement as well as cognitive task difficulty had an impairing effect on fronto-parietal connectivity. In conclusion, subjective ratings, behavioural performance and electrophysiological results indicate that less cognitive resources were available to be deployed towards the execution of the cognitive task when in locomotion compared to standing still. Connectivity results also show a scarcity of attentional resources when switching a task during the highest movement complexity condition. Summarized, all findings indicate a central role of attentional control regarding cognitive-motor dual tasking and an inherent limitation of cognitive resources.

The present study examined the electrophysiological correlates of a classic complex WM task often used in studies involving older adults, the Categorization Working Memory Span task (CWMS), by means of event-related potentials. Thirty-five healthy, right-handed older adults (64-75 years) were presented the CWMS task while a 38-channel EEG was measured, and the N1, P1, and word recognition potential (RP) were analyzed on four regions of interest (ROIs) of 5 electrodes each. Additionally, late positive components (P200 and P300) were analyzed in midline ROIs of 3 electrodes each. Participants also executed an n-back task (2-back condition) and an objective performance-based task (the Ability to solve Problems in Everyday life [APE]). At a behavioral level, significant correlations were found between the CWMS, the 2-back, and the APE tests. At a physiological level, N1 and word RP showed greater bilateral amplitude in posterior electrodes, but the better the CWMS and the 2-back performance, the greater the RP amplitude on posterior left sites. The CWMS task induced a clear P200 component, but its amplitude was not correlated with participants' behavioral performance. Altogether, notwithstanding that the bilateral RP pattern elicited by the CWMS is a clear marker of WM processing in older adults, better elderly performers on this complex WM test showed greater left hemisphere dominance to the automatic word RP.

Using high density EEG to assess TMS treatment in patients with schizophrenia	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MYOLOGY			English	Article						Transcranial magnetic stimulation; schizophrenia; high density EEG; P50; P300	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; P300 TOPOGRAPHY; P50; ABNORMALITIES; STIMULATION; WAVE	We present preliminary results from the ongoing study entitled "Icelandic AVH-TMS" which aim is to study the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment for patients with schizophrenia and with persistent auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) using symptoms and psychometric scales and high-density EEG system (256 channels). The aim of the present work was to describe cortical topography of the auditory evoked responses like P50 and N100-P300 complex in healthy participants and patients with schizophrenia and to define a robust methodology of signal quantification using dense-array EEG. Preliminary data is shown for three healthy participants and three patients in baseline conditions and for two patients we show the results recorded before and after 10 days rTMS treatment. Our results show differences in sensory gating (P50 suppresion) and a stronger N100-P300 response to rare audio stimulus after the treatment. Moreover we show the value of assessing brain electrical activity from high-density EEG (256 channels) analyzing the results in different regions of interest. However, it is premature and hazardous to assume that rTMS treatment effectiveness in patients with AVH can be assessed using P50 suppression ratio.

Motor Imagery Hand Movement Direction Decoding Using Brain Computer Interface to Aid Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; motor imagery; phase locking value; event-related desynchronization; synchronization; brain-computer interface; neurorehabilitation	EEG	Motor Imagery (MI)-based Brain Computer Interface (BCI) system is a potential technology for active neurorehabilitation of stroke patients by complementing the conventional passive rehabilitation methods. Research to date mainly focused on classifying left vs. right hand/foot MI of stroke patients. Though a very few studies have reported decoding imagined hand movement directions using electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCI, the experiments were conducted on healthy subjects. Our work analyzes MI-based brain cortical activity from EEG signals and decodes the imagined hand movement directions in stroke patients. The decoded direction (left vs. right) of hand movement imagination is used to provide control commands to a motorized arm support on which patient's affected (paralyzed) arm is placed. This enables the patient to move his/her stroke-affected hand towards the intended (imagined) direction that aids neuroplasticity in the brain. The synchronization measure called Phase Locking Value (PLV), extracted from EEG, is the neuronal signature used to decode the directional movement of the MI task. Event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) analysis on Mu and Beta frequency bands of EEG is done to select the time bin corresponding to the MI task. The dissimilarities between the two directions of MI tasks are identified by selecting the most significant channel pairs that provided maximum difference in PLV features. The training protocol has an initial calibration session followed by a feedback session with 50 trials of MI task in each session. The feedback session extracts PLV features corresponding to most significant channel pairs which are identified in the calibration session and is used to predict the direction of MI task in left/right direction. An average MI direction classification accuracy of 74.44% is obtained in performing the training protocol and 68.63% from the prediction protocol during feedback session on 16 stroke patients.

EEG phase synchronization during semantic unification relates to individual differences in children's vocabulary skill	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						children; EEG; language development; oscillations; phase synchrony; semantic unification	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; LANGUAGE; BRAIN; NETWORK; MEG; CONNECTIVITY; MEMORY; WORDS; LAG	As we listen to speech, our ability to understand what was said requires us to retrieve and bind together individual word meanings into a coherent discourse representation. This so-called semantic unification is a fundamental cognitive skill, and its development relies on the integration of neural activity throughout widely distributed functional brain networks. In this proof-of-concept study, we examine, for the first time, how these functional brain networks develop in children. Twenty-six children (ages 4-17) listened to well-formed sentences and sentences containing a semantic violation, while EEG was recorded. Children with stronger vocabulary showed N400 effects that were more concentrated to centroparietal electrodes and greater EEG phase synchrony (phase lag index; PLI) between right centroparietal and bilateral frontocentral electrodes in the delta frequency band (1-3 Hz) 1.27-1.53 s after listening to well-formed sentences compared to sentences containing a semantic violation. These effects related specifically to individual differences in receptive vocabulary, perhaps pointing to greater recruitment of functional brain networks important for top-down semantic unification with development. Less skilled children showed greater delta phase synchrony for violation sentences 3.41-3.64 s after critical word onset. This later effect was partly driven by individual differences in nonverbal reasoning, perhaps pointing to non-verbal compensatory processing to extract meaning from speech in children with less developed vocabulary. We suggest that functional brain network communication, as measured by momentary changes in the phase synchrony of EEG oscillations, develops throughout the school years to support language comprehension in different ways depending on children's verbal and nonverbal skill levels.

Unlike keys and tokens, biometrics are never lost or stolen. Unlike passwords, biometrics cannot be forgotten. However, existing biometric systems are with controversy: once divulged, they are compromised forever. To this end, this paper explores a truly cancelable brain-based biometric system for the first time. Specifically, we present a new psychophysiological protocol via non-volitional brain response for trustworthy user authentication, with an application example of smart headwear. More specifically, we address the following research challenges in a theoretical and experimental combined manner: (1) how to generate reliable brain responses with sophisticated visual stimuli; (2) how to acquire effective brain response and analyze unique features in them for authentication; and (3) how to reset and change brain biometrics when the current biometric credential is divulged. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, we conducted a pilot study and achieved an f-score accuracy of 95.46 percent and equal error rate (EER) of 2.503 percent, thereby demonstrating the potential feasibility of neurofeedback based biometrics for smart headwear applications. Further, the cancelability study proves the effectiveness of the reset brain password. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first in-depth research study on truly cancelable brain biometrics.

This study investigated the connection between peripheral hearing function and conscious attention during two different modality tasks, auditory and visual. Peripheral hearing function was evaluated by analyzing the amount of suppression of otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) by contralateral acoustic stimulation (CAS), a well-known effect of the MOC. Simultaneously, attention was evaluated by event-related potentials (ERPs). Although the ERPs showed clear differences in processing of auditory and visual tasks, there were no differences in the levels of OAE suppression. We also analyzed OAEs for the highest magnitude resonant mode signal detected by the matching pursuit method, but again did not find a significant effect of task, and no difference in noise level or number of rejected trials. However, for auditory tasks, the amplitude of the P3 cognitive wave negatively correlated with the level of OAE suppression. We conclude that there seems to be no change in MOC function when performing different modality tasks, although the cortex still remains able to modulate some aspects of MOC activity.

In this paradigm, an image of an unfamiliar "base" facial identity is repeated at a rapid rateF(e.g., 6 Hz) and different unfamiliar "oddball" facial identities are inserted everynth item, at aF/nrate (e.g., every 5th item, 1.2 Hz). This stimulation elicits FI responses atF/nand its harmonics (2F/n, 3F/n, etc.), reflecting neural discrimination between oddball versus base facial identities, which is quantified in the frequency domain of the electroencephalogram (EEG). This paradigm, used in 20 published studies, demonstrates substantial advantages for measuring FI in terms of validity, objectivity, reliability, and sensitivity. Human intracerebral recordings suggest that this FI response originates from neural populations in the lateral inferior occipital and fusiform gyri, with a right hemispheric dominance consistent with the localization of brain lesions specifically affecting facial identity recognition (prosopagnosia). Here, we summarize the contributions of the oddball FPVS framework toward understanding FI, including its (a)typical development, with early studies supporting the application of this technique to clinical testing (e.g., autism spectrum disorder). This review also includes an in-depth analysis of the paradigm's methodology, with guidelines for designing future studies. A large-scale group analysis compiling data across 130 observers provides insights into the oddball FPVS FI response properties. Overall, we recommend the oddball FPVS paradigm as an alternative approach to behavioral or traditional event-related potential EEG measures of face individuation.

However, it remains unclear to what extent the increase of FM theta power during response inhibition tasks is influenced by other non-inhibitory cognitive processes that are usually required for the tasks. In this study, we examined attention-related effects on FM theta during response inhibition by revisiting the EEG data from healthy young adults (N = 30) while performing a spatial cueing Go/NoGo task (Hong et al., 2017). Such an experimental design enabled us to manipulate selective attention that was voluntarily deployed to the stimuli triggering response inhibition. Although commission error rates were low for the NoGo trials, response preparation and prepotent motor activities were qualified by observing significant contingent negative variation (CNV) and lateralized readiness potential (LRP) in both the Go and the NoGo trials. We observed an increase of FM theta power in both attended and ignored conditions of the NoGo trials compared with the Go trials, while FM theta power was significantly smaller in the ignored condition than in the attended condition. Furthermore, source localization analysis suggested cingulate cortex as the main origin for FM theta in the NoGo trials, and FM theta power differences between the attended and ignored conditions were localized in cingulate gyrus. We further provided evidence for attention-dependent FM theta generation by correlating theta source density with ERP signatures of attention (N1), response preparation (CNV), and motor activity (LRP). Overall, our findings suggest that during the Go/NoGo task, the increase of FM theta power was not purely driven by response inhibition, and part of FM theta generators in cingulate gyrus was significantly modulated by attention-related processing (possibly conflict monitoring).

The combination of motor imaging and brain-computer interface technology can take advantage of patients' willingness to take the initiative to assist them in rehabilitation. Studies have shown that MI combined with BCI rehabilitation training is better than traditional rehabilitation training. Transient visual evoked potentials and motor imaging constructed a hybrid BCI system. Three healthy subjects were tested. EEG signals were superimposed preprocessing according to visual stimulus superimposed frequency and motor guidance frequency respectively. Transient visual evoked EEG segmentation is used as a control signal of choice, the use of wavelet decomposition helps to extract features, and then use BP neural network recognition for classification and identification. Visual guidance, motion-oriented event-related synchronization, or desynchronization feature signals as rehabilitation exercise control signals, are using time-domain sliding energy analysis to extract features, and then using BP neural network recognition for classification and identification. EEG signals collected in the experiment were superimposed signals of transient visual evoked and motorized EEG. There were 300 transient electroencephalogram (EEG) and 100 segments Imagine EEG segmentation. According to the results of the test, the average recognition rate of visual evoked EEG reached 95.42%; the average recognition rate of motor imaginary EEG was 73.08%, but there was a large individual difference in motor imaging EEG signals except 1 Name of the test rate of 85%, the remaining two subjects were less than 70% recognition rate. There is a large individual difference between motion imaging and signal feature recognition, and it takes a long time to train. Therefore, it is necessary to study further the selection of control signals for rehabilitation training. As the threshold feedback signal, controlling the amplitude feedback of rehabilitation training can promote the motivation of participants' motivation to stimulate and enhance the rehabilitation treatment effect.

NE is suspected to contribute to generation of the P3 event-related potential. Recent evidence has produced equivocal evidence whether taVNS influences the P3 in healthy individuals during oddball tasks. We examined the effect of taVNS on P3 amplitudes using a novel visual Bayesian oddball task, which presented 200 sequences of three stimuli. The three consecutive stimuli in each sequence are labelled Draw 1, Draw 2 and Draw 3. In total, 47 Subjects completed this visual Bayesian oddball task under randomised sham and active taVNS stimulation in parallel with an electroencephalographic (EEG) recording. We conducted exploratory analyses of the effect of taVNS on P3 amplitudes separately for Draws. We found typical oddball effects on P3 amplitudes at Draws 1 and 2, but not Draw 3. At Draw 2, the oddball effect was enhanced during active compared to sham taVNS stimulation. These data provide evidence that taVNS influences parietal P3 amplitudes under specific circumstances. Only P3 amplitudes at Draw 2 were affected, which may relate to closure of Bayesian inference after Draw 2. Our findings seemingly support previously reported links between taVNS and the NE system.

Implicit associations towards alcohol indicate the automatically attributed appeal of alcohol-related stimuli. First, behavioral studies indicate that negative alcohol associations are less pronounced in patients compared to controls, but potential neurophysiological differences remain unexplored. This study investigates neurophysiological correlates of implicit alcohol associations in recently abstinent patients with AUD for the first time, including possible gender effects. Methods A total of 62 patients (40 males and 22 females) and 21 controls performed an alcohol valence Implicit Association Test, combining alcohol-related pictures with positive (incongruent condition) or negative (congruent condition) words, while brain activity was recorded using 64-channel electroencephalography. Event-related potentials (ERPs) for alcohol-negative and alcohol-positive trials were computed. Microstate analyses investigated the effects of group (patients, controls) and condition (incongruent, congruent); furthermore, possible gender effects in patients were analyzed. Significant effects were localized with standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic topography analysis. Results Although no behavioral group differences were found, ERPs of patients and controls were characterized by distinct microstates from 320 ms onwards. ERPs between conditions differed only in patients with higher signal strength during incongruent trials. Around 600 ms, controls displayed higher signal strength than patients. A gender effect mirrored this pattern with enhanced signal strength in females as opposed to male patients. Around 690 ms, a group-by-valence interaction indicated enhanced signal strength in congruent compared to incongruent trials, which was more pronounced in controls. Conclusions For patients with AUD, the pattern, timing, and source localization of effects suggest greater effort regarding semantic and self-relevant integration around 400 ms during incongruent trials and attenuated emotional processing during the late positive potential timeframe. Interestingly, this emotional attenuation seemed reduced in female patients, thus corroborating the importance of gender-sensitive research and potential treatment of AUD.

For instance, locking the door could be construed either as putting the key into the lock or as securing the house. According to the construal level theory, the former (latter) is more likely to happen among people with a low (high) level of construal, who have an intrinsic inclination to focus on peripheral details (central features) of the phenomena or action. Given that object's peripheral details are more concrete and less abstract than its central features, people with a low (high) level of construal have better developed concrete-mindset (abstract-mindset). Previous research has been consistently assuming that people with a low (high) level of construal are better at cognitively processing the concrete (abstract) phenomenon or action. However, this assumption has not yet been empirically tested with EEG methodology. In this paper, we test this assumption through within-subject experimental design (n = 44) conducting EEG methodology. Results of the P-300 component of the event-related brain potential, which is an indicator of mental workload, demonstrated that people with a low (high) level of construal experienced a greater mental workload when they were processing abstract (concrete) phenomena.

However, few studies have directly compared active- and passive-transmission electrodes during a mobile task. In this repeated measurement study, we investigated the performance of active and passive signal transmission electrodes with the same amplifier system in their respective typical configurations, during a mobile auditory task. The task was an auditory discrimination (1,000 vs. 800 Hz; counterbalanced) oddball task using approximately 560 trials (15% targets) for each condition. Eighteen participants performed the auditory oddball task both while standing and walking in an outdoor environment. While walking, there was a significant decrease in P3 amplitude, post-trial rejection trial numbers, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). No significant differences were found in signal quality between the two electrode configurations. SNR and P3 amplitude were test-retest reliable between recordings. We conclude that adequate use of a passive EEG electrode system achieves signal quality equivalent to that of an active system during a mobile task.	[Scanlon, Joanna E.

We have recently shown that electrophysiological markers of motor preparation, rather than decision-making, differentiate PwP with freezing of gait (FOG +) and without (FOG -) while sitting. To examine the effect of locomotion on these results, we measured behavioural and electrophysiological responses in PwP with and without FOG during a target response time task while sitting (single-task) and stepping-in-place (dual-task). Behavioural and electroencephalographic data were acquired from 18 PwP (eight FOG +) and seven young controls performing the task while sitting and stepping-in-place. FOG + had slower response times while stepping compared with sitting. However, response times were significantly faster while stepping compared with sitting for controls. Electrophysiological responses showed no difference in decision-making potentials (centroparietal positivity) between groups or conditions but there were differences in neurophysiological markers of response inhibition (N2) and motor preparation (lateralized readiness potential, LRP) in FOG + while performing a dual-task. This suggests that the addition of a second complex motor task (stepping-in-place) impacts automatic allocation of resources in FOG +, resulting in delayed response times. The impact of locomotion on the generation of the N2 and LRP potentials, particularly in freezers, indirectly implies that these functions compete with locomotion for resources. In the setting of multiple complex tasks or cognitive impairment, severe motor dysfunction may result, leading to freezing of gait.

Here, 42 white participants underwent electroencephalographic recording while observing social encounters involving dynamic displays of nonverbal behaviors by racial in-group and out-group avatar characters. Dynamic behaviors included approach and avoidance poses and expressions, followed by the participants' ratings of the avatars displaying them. Behaviorally, participants showed longer RTs when evaluating in-group approach behavior compared with other behaviors, possibly suggesting increased interest and attention devoted to processing positive social encounters with their in-group members. Analyses of ERPs revealed differential sensitivity of the N450 and late positivity components to social cues, with the former showing initial sensitivity to the presence of a humanoid avatar character at the beginning of social encounters and the latter showing sensitivity to dynamic nonverbal behaviors displayed by the avatars. Moreover, time-frequency analysis of electroencephalography data also identified suppression of beta-range power linked to the observation of dynamic nonverbal behaviors. Notably, the magnitude of these responses was modulated by the degree of behavioral racial in-group bias. This suggests that differential neural sensitivity to nonverbal cues while observing social encounters is associated with subsequent in-group bias manifested in the evaluation of such encounters. Collectively, these findings shed light on the mechanisms of racial in-group bias in social cognition and have implications for understanding factors related to successful interactions with individuals from diverse racial backgrounds.

J	Dimigen, O				Dimigen, Olaf			Optimizing the ICA-based removal of ocular EEG artifacts from free viewing experiments	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; Eye tracking; Eye artifact correction; Independent component analysis (ICA); Fixation-related potentials (FRP); Beta and gamma oscillations	FIXATION-RELATED POTENTIALS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EYE-MOVEMENT; BRAIN POTENTIALS; WORD RECOGNITION; SUPPRESSION; VOLUNTARY; IDENTIFICATION; CONTAMINATION	Combining EEG with eye-tracking is a promising approach to study neural correlates of natural vision, but the resulting recordings are also heavily contaminated by activity of the eye balls, eye lids, and extraocular muscles. While Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is commonly used to suppress these ocular artifacts, its performance under free viewing conditions has not been systematically evaluated and many published reports contain residual artifacts. Here I evaluated and optimized ICA-based correction for two tasks with unconstrained eye movements: visual search in images and sentence reading. In a first step, four parameters of the ICA pipeline were varied orthogonally: the (1) high-pass and (2) low-pass filter applied to the training data, (3) the proportion of training data containing myogenic saccadic spike potentials (SP), and (4) the threshold for eye tracker-based component rejection. In a second step, the eye-tracker was used to objectively quantify the correction quality of each ICA solution, both in terms of undercorrection (residual artifacts) and overcorrection (removal of neurogenic activity). As a benchmark, results were compared to those obtained with an alternative spatial filter, Multiple Source Eye Correction (MSEC). With commonly used settings, Infomax ICA not only left artifacts in the data, but also distorted neurogenic activity during eye movement-free intervals. However, correction results could be strongly improved by training the ICA on optimally filtered data in which SPs were massively overweighted. With optimized procedures, ICA removed virtually all artifacts, including the SP and its associated spectral broadband artifact from both viewing paradigms, with little distortion of neural activity. It also outperformed MSEC in terms of SP correction. Matlab code is provided.

Abnormal microscale neuronal connectivity triggered by a proprioceptive stimulus in dystonia	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BASAL-GANGLIA; COHERENCE; PLASTICITY; SYNCHRONIZATION; SECONDARY	We investigated modulation of functional neuronal connectivity by a proprioceptive stimulus in sixteen young people with dystonia and eight controls. A robotic wrist interface delivered controlled passive wrist extension movements, the onset of which was synchronised with scalp EEG recordings. Data were segmented into epochs around the stimulus and up to 160 epochs per subject were averaged to produce a Stretch Evoked Potential (StretchEP). Event-related network dynamics were estimated using a methodology that features Wavelet Transform Coherency (WTC). Global Microscale Nodal Strength (GMNS) was introduced to estimate overall engagement of areas into short-lived networks related to the StretchEP, and Global Connectedness (GC) estimated the spatial extent of the StretchEP networks. Dynamic Connectivity Maps showed a striking difference between dystonia and controls, with particularly strong theta band event-related connectivity in dystonia. GC also showed a trend towards higher values in dystonia than controls. In summary, we demonstrate the feasibility of this method to investigate event-related neuronal connectivity in relation to a proprioceptive stimulus in a paediatric patient population. Young people with dystonia show an exaggerated network response to a proprioceptive stimulus, displaying both excessive theta-band synchronisation across the sensorimotor network and widespread engagement of cortical regions in the activated network.

Fearlessness About Death is Related to Diminished Late Positive Potential Responses When Viewing Threatening and Mutilation Images in Suicidal Ideators	COGNITIVE THERAPY AND RESEARCH			English	Article						Event-related potential; Suicide; Fearlessness about death; Capability for suicide	PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; ELECTROCORTICAL RESPONSE; INTERPERSONAL THEORY; ACQUIRED CAPABILITY; ANXIETY SENSITIVITY; CONSTRUCT-VALIDITY; NEURAL RESPONSE; IDEATION; RELIABILITY; DEPRESSION	Background Very few people who desire death by suicide ever make a suicide attempt, highlighting the importance of determining factors that influence the capability to enact lethal self-harm. One such factor is fearlessness about death, which has been found to be an important predictor of suicide attempts. Recently, longitudinal evidence found that fearlessness about death is positively associated with fluctuations in suicidal ideation. Efforts exploring biophysical mechanisms of suicide have found diminished physiological responses to threat/mutilation-related images in suicide attempters and in individuals who report being less fearful of death. These studies suggest that an individual with greater fearlessness about death may demonstrate a blunted response to threat/mutilation stimuli; however, this hypothesis has yet to be directly tested. Methods This study used an electroencephalography/event-related potential paradigm to examine late positive potential (LPP) amplitude differences in an adult community sample (N = 280), as well as a subsample with current suicidal ideation (n = 62), with a high rate of psychopathology (90.1%). It was hypothesized that participants with higher fearlessness about death would show diminished responses (smaller LPP amplitude) when viewing threat/mutilation images. Results Results indicated that participants with suicidal ideation and elevated fearlessness about death demonstrated a blunted emotional response to threat/mutilation images but similar reactions to rewarding pleasant stimuli. Conclusions These results suggest blunted LPP responses to threat/mutilation stimuli may be a potential biophysical mechanism for fearless about death.

Parental contact can successfully regulate general behavioural and physiological reactivity of the infant, but it is not known whether it can influence noxious-related activity in the brain. Brain activity is highly dependent upon maternal presence in animal models, and therefore this could be an important contextual factor in human infant pain-related brain activity. Methods Global topographic analysis was used to identify the presence and inter-group differences in noxious-related activity in three separate parental contexts. EEG was recorded during a clinically required heel lance in three age and sex-matched groups of neonates (a) while held by a parent in skin-to-skin (n = 9), (b) while held by a parent with clothing (n = 9) or (c) not held at all, but in individualized care (n = 9). Results The lance elicited a sequence of 4-5 event-related potentials (ERPs), including the noxious ERP (nERP), which was smallest for infants held skin-to-skin and largest for infants held with clothing (p=0.016). The nERP was then followed by additional and divergent long-latency ERPs (> 750 ms post-lance), not previously described, in each of the groups, suggesting the engagement of different higher level cortical processes depending on parental contact. Conclusions These results show the importance of considering contextual factors in determining infant brain activity and reveal the powerful influence of parental contact upon noxious-related activity across the developing human brain. Significance This observational study found that the way in which the neonatal brain processes a noxious stimulus is altered by the type of contact the infant has with their mother. Specifically, being held in skin-to-skin reduces the magnitude of noxious-related cortical activity. This work has also shown that different neural mechanisms are engaged depending on the mother/infant context, suggesting maternal contact can change how a baby's brain processes a noxious stimulus.

The proposed tEEG framework aims to investigate design activities with loosely controlled experiments and decompose a complex design process into multiple primitive cognitive activities, corresponding to which different research hypotheses on basic design activities can be effectively formulated and tested. Thereafter, existing EEG techniques and methods can be applied to analyse EEG signals related to design. Three application examples are presented at the end of this paper to demonstrate how the proposed framework can be applied to analyse design activities. The tEEG framework is presented to guide EEG-based cognitive and affective studies in the context of design. Existing methods and models are summarized, for the effective application of the tEEG framework, from the current literature spread in a wide spectrum of resources and fields.

EEG was recorded for stationary sounds and for three patterns of sound motion produced by changes in interaural time differences. In two different task conditions, the participants were either reading books of their choice (passive listening) or indicating the perceived sound trajectories using a graphic tablet (active listening). We explored the effects of listening conditions and motion velocity on the MOR potential, and also on the event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITC) calculated from the time-frequency decomposition of EEG signals. For all the velocities, passive cortical processing of sound motion caused phase resetting of delta-to-alpha oscillations. Besides, the abrupt sound displacement induced non-coherent slow oscillations which could also contribute to the passive MOR. Focusing attention on the moving stimuli affected the MOR only between cN1 and cP2 deflections, without any effect on their peak values. The clearest evidence of top-down influence on motion processing was given by the spectral measures. Active localization of the moving sounds involved phase alignment and amplitude change of the ongoing or evoked delta-alpha activity following the start of sound motion, along with attention-related activity which was not strictly phaselocked to the sound stimuli.

Artificially-generated scenes demonstrate the importance of global scene properties for scene perception	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Scene perception; Scene recognition; ERP; EEG; Vision; P2	PARAHIPPOCAMPAL PLACE AREA; TOP-DOWN FACILITATION; IMAGE STATISTICS; NATURAL SCENES; VISUAL SCENES; TIME-COURSE; CATEGORIZATION; REPRESENTATION; COMPLEX; OBJECT	Recent electrophysiological research highlights the significance of global scene properties (GSPs) for scene perception. However, since real-world scenes span a range of low-level stimulus properties and high-level contextual semantics, GSP effects may also reflect additional processing of such non-global factors. We examined this question by asking whether Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) to GSPs will still be observed when specific low- and high-level scene properties are absent from the scene. We presented participants with computer-based artificially-manipulated scenes varying in two GSPs (spatial expanse and naturalness) which minimized other sources of scene information (color and semantic object detail). We found that the peak amplitude of the P2 component was sensitive to the spatial expanse and naturalness of the artificially-generated scenes: P2 amplitude was higher to closed than open scenes, and in response to manmade than natural scenes. A control experiment showed that the effect of Naturalness on the P2 is not driven by local texture information, while earlier effects of naturalness, expressed as a modulation of the P1 and N1 amplitudes, are sensitive to texture information. Our results demonstrate that GSPs are processed robustly around 220 ms and that P2 can be used as an index of global scene perception.

Here, we investigated whether attention shifts in visual and tactile WM are regulated independently. Participants memorized visual and tactile targets in a first memory sample set (S1) before encoding targets in a second sample set (S2). Importantly, visual or tactile S2 targets could appear on the same side as the corresponding S1 targets, or on opposite sides, thus, requiring shifts of spatial attention in visual or tactile WM. The activation of WM representations in modality-specific visual and somatosensory areas was tracked by recording visual and tactile contralateral delay activity (CDA/tCDA). CDA/tCDA components emerged contralateral to the side of visual or tactile S1 targets, and reversed polarity when S2 targets in the same modality appeared on the opposite side. Critically, the visual CDA was unaffected by the presence versus absence of concurrent attention shifts in tactile WM, and the tactile CDA remained insensitive to visual attention shifts. Visual and tactile WM performance was also not modulated by attention shifts in the other modality. These results show that the dynamic control of visual and tactile WM activation processes operates in an independent modality-specific fashion.

Audiovisual Multisensory Processing in Young Adults With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder	MULTISENSORY RESEARCH			English	Article						ADHD; multisensory integration; EEG; event-related potentials; response time	DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; SUPERIOR PARIETAL LOBULE; FOLLOW-UP; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; INTEGRATION; ADHD; INHIBITION; METAANALYSIS; ADOLESCENTS; CHILDREN	Multisensory integration is a fundamental form of sensory processing that is involved in many everyday tasks. Those with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have characteristic alterations to various brain regions that may influence multisensory processing. The overall aim of this work was to assess how adults with ADHD process audiovisual multisensory stimuli during a complex response time task. The paradigm used was a two-alternative forced-choice discrimination task paired with continuous 64-electrode electroencephalography, allowing for the measurement of response time and accuracy to auditory, visual, and audiovisual multisensory conditions. Analysis revealed that those with ADHD (n = 10) respond faster than neurotypical controls (n = 12) when presented with auditory, visual, and audiovisual multisensory conditions, while also having race model violation in early response latency quantiles. Adults with ADHD also had more prominent multisensory processing over parietal-occipital brain regions at early post-stimulus latencies, indicating that altered brain structure may have important outcomes for audiovisual multisensory processing. The present study is the first to assess how those with ADHD respond to multisensory conditions during a complex response time task, and demonstrates that adults with ADHD have unique multisensory processing when assessing both behavioral response time measures and neurological measures.

Specifically, we investigated whether data augmentation could remedy this problem and improve BCI performance. We investigated a data augmentation technique, borderline-Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). We focused on the effects of data augmentation on users with poor BCI performance. The EEG data were obtained from experiments with the P300-based BCI system developed for controlling 3 home appliances (Lamp, Door lock, Bluetooth speaker), where the classifier was designed by a support vector machine (SVM) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). As a result, although Borderline-SMOTE did not significantly change the overall BCI performance, it significantly improved the performance of poor performers. This suggests that data augmentation can offer an effective way to increase the performance of users illiterate to P300-based BCIs.

High-voltage, diffuse delta rhythms coincide with wakeful consciousness and complexity in Angelman syndrome	NEUROSCIENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS			English	Article						disorders of consciousness; neurology; sleep and dreaming; states of consciousness; theories and models	LEMPEL-ZIV COMPLEXITY; CYCLIC ALTERNATING PATTERN; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INTEGRATED INFORMATION; IMPAIRED CONSCIOUSNESS; PROPOFOL ANESTHESIA; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; SPECTRAL EEG; SLOW WAVES; SLEEP	Abundant evidence from slow wave sleep, anesthesia, coma, and epileptic seizures links high-voltage, slow electroencephalogram (EEG) activity to loss of consciousness. This well-established correlation is challenged by the observation that children with Angelman syndrome (AS), while fully awake and displaying volitional behavior, display a hypersynchronous delta (1-4 Hz) frequency EEG phenotype typical of unconsciousness. Because the trough of the delta oscillation is associated with down-states in which cortical neurons are silenced, the presence of volitional behavior and wakefulness in AS amidst diffuse delta rhythms presents a paradox. Moreover, high-voltage, slow EEG activity is generally assumed to lack complexity, yet many theories view functional brain complexity as necessary for consciousness. Here, we use abnormal cortical dynamics in AS to assess whether EEG complexity may scale with the relative level of consciousness despite a background of hypersynchronous delta activity. As characterized by multiscale metrics, EEGs from 35 children with AS feature significantly greater complexity during wakefulness compared with sleep, even when comparing the most pathological segments of wakeful EEG to the segments of sleep EEG least likely to contain conscious mentation and when factoring out delta power differences across states. These findings (i) warn against reverse inferring an absence of consciousness solely on the basis of high-amplitude EEG delta oscillations, (ii) corroborate rare observations of preserved consciousness under hypersynchronization in other conditions, (iii) identify biomarkers of consciousness that have been validated under conditions of abnormal cortical dynamics, and (iv) lend credence to theories linking consciousness with complexity.

Adapted cabling of an EEG cap improves simultaneous measurement of EEG and fMRI at 7T	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; fMRI; 7T; EEG cap; ERP; Oscillations	RESTING STATE NETWORKS; ALPHA-RHYTHM; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSE; NEURONAL MECHANISMS; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; GAMMA; BOLD; FREQUENCY; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS	Background: The combination of EEG and ultra-high-field (7T and above) fMRI holds the promise to relate electrophysiology and hemodynamics with greater signal to noise level and at higher spatial resolutions than conventional field strengths. Technical and safety restrictions have so far resulted in compromises in terms of MRI coil selection, resulting in reduced, signal quality, spatial coverage and resolution in EEG-fMRI studies at 7 T. New method: We adapted a 64-channel MRI-compatible EEG cap so that it could be used with a closed 32-channel MRI head coil thus avoiding several of these compromises. We compare functional and anatomical as well as the EEG quality recorded with this adapted setup with those recorded with a setup that uses an open-ended 8-channel head-coil. Results: Our set-up with the adapted EEG cap inside the closed 32 channel coil resulted in the recording of good quality EEG and (f)MRI data. Both functional and anatomical MRI images show no major effects of the adapted EEG cap on MR signal quality. We demonstrate the ability to compute ERPs and changes in alpha and gamma oscillations from the recorded EEG data. Comparison with existing methods: Compared to MRI recordings with an 8-channel open-ended head-coil, the loss in signal quality of the MRI images related to the adapted EEG cap is considerably reduced. Conclusions: The adaptation of the EEG cap permits the simultaneous recording of good quality whole brain (f) MRI data using a 32 channel receiver coil, while maintaining the quality of the EEG data.

Dissociating activation and integration of discourse referents: Evidence from ERPs and oscillations	CORTEX			English	Article						Reference resolution; Anaphora; Proper names; Theta; Gamma	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; RECOGNITION MEMORY; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; WORD REPETITION; SENTENCE-LEVEL; PROPER-NAMES; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE	A key challenge in understanding stories and conversations is the comprehension of 'anaphora', words that refer back to previously mentioned words or concepts ('antecedents'). In psycholinguistic theories, anaphor comprehension involves the initial activation of the antecedent and its subsequent integration into the unfolding representation of the narrated event. A recent proposal suggests that these processes draw upon the brain's recognition memory and language networks, respectively, and may be dissociable in patterns of neural oscillatory synchronization (Nieuwland & Martin, 2017). We addressed this proposal in an electroencephalogram (EEG) study with pre-registered data acquisition and analyses, using event-related potentials and neural oscillations. Dutch participants read two-sentence mini stories containing proper names, which were repeated or new (ease of activation) and semantically coherent or incoherent with the preceding discourse (ease of integration). Repeated names elicited smaller N400 and Late Positive Component amplitude than new names, and also an increase in theta-band (4-7 Hz) synchronization, which was largest around 240-450 ms after name onset. Discourse-coherent names elicited an increase in gamma-band (60-80 Hz) synchronization compared to discourse-incoherent names. This effect was largest around 690-1000 ms after name onset and exploratory beamformer analysis suggested a left frontal source. We argue that the initial activation and subsequent discourse-level integration of referents can be dissociated with event-related EEG activity, and are associated with respectively theta- and gamma-band activity. These findings further establish the link between memory and language through neural oscillations. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

BCIs often use event-related potentials (ERPs) like the P300 which signals the presence of a target in a stream of stimuli. The P300 and related approaches, however, are inherently limited, as they require many stimulus presentations to obtain a usable control signal. Many approaches depend on gaze direction to focus the target, which is also not a viable approach in many cases, because eye movements might be impaired in potential users. Here we report on a BCI that avoids both shortcomings by decoding spatial target information, independent of gaze shifts.Approach.We present a new method to decode from the electroencephalogram (EEG) covert shifts of attention to one out of four targets simultaneously presented in the left and right visual field. The task is designed to evoke the N2pc component-a hemisphere lateralized response, elicited over the occipital scalp contralateral to the attended target. The decoding approach involves decoding of the N2pc based on data-driven estimation of spatial filters and a correlation measure.Main results.Despite variability of decoding performance across subjects, 22 out of 24 subjects performed well above chance level. Six subjects even exceeded 80% (cross-validated: 89%) correct predictions in a four-class discrimination task. Hence, the single-trial N2pc proves to be a component that allows for reliable BCI control. An offline analysis of the EEG data with respect to their dependence on stimulation time and number of classes demonstrates that the present method is also a workable approach for two-class tasks.Significance.Our method extends the range of strategies for gaze-independent BCI control. The proposed decoding approach has the potential to be efficient in similar applications intended to decode ERPs.

Autonomic/central coupling benefits working memory in healthy young adults	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article						Nap; Working memory; Parasympathetic; NREM; Autonomic; Sleep; Heart rate	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; VAGUS NERVE-STIMULATION; SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; IMPROVING FLUID INTELLIGENCE; NEUROCOGNITIVE CONSEQUENCES; EXECUTIVE-CONTROL; EEG; PERFORMANCE; IMPROVEMENT; CONSOLIDATION	Working memory (WM) is an executive function that can improve with training. However, the precise mechanism for this improvement is not known. Studies have shown greater WM gains after a period of sleep than a similar period of wake, and correlations between WM improvement and slow wave activity (SWA; 0.5-1 Hz) during slow wave sleep (SWS). A different body of literature has suggested an important role for autonomic activity during wake for WM. A recent study from our group reported that the temporal coupling of Autonomic/Central Events (ACEs) during sleep was associated with memory consolidation. We found that heart rate bursts (HR bursts) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep are accompanied by increases in SWA and sigma (12-15 Hz) power, as well as increases in the high-frequency (HF) component of the RR interval, reflecting vagal rebound. In addition, ACEs predict long-term, episodic memory improvement. Building on these previous results, we examined whether ACEs also contribute to gains in WM. We tested 104 young adults in an operation span task (OSPAN) in the morning and evening, with either a nap (n = 53; with electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG)) or wake (n = 51) between testing sessions. We identified HR bursts in the ECG and replicated the increases in SWA and sigma prior to peak of the HR burst, as well as vagal rebound after the peak. Furthermore, we showed sleep-dependent WM improvement, which was predicted by ACE activity. Using regression analyses, we discovered that significantly more variance in WM improvement could be explained with ACE variables than with overall sleep activity not time-locked with ECG. These results provide the first evidence that coordinated autonomic and central events play a significant role in sleep-related WM improvement and implicate the potential of autonomic interventions during sleep for cognitive enhancement.

Target detection in healthy 4-week old piglets from a passive two-tone auditory oddball paradigm	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Auditory oddball paradigm; EEG; Event-related potential; Porcine	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; ANIMAL-MODELS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; CHILDREN; POTENTIALS; NEUROPATHOLOGY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; IMPAIRMENT; CONCUSSION; DISABILITY	Background Passive auditory oddball tests are effort independent assessments that evaluate auditory processing and are suitable for paediatric patient groups. Our goal was to develop a two-tone auditory oddball test protocol and use this clinical assessment in an immature large animal model. Event-related potentials captured middle latency P1, N1, and P2 responses in 4-week old (N = 16, female) piglets using a custom piglet 32- electrode array on 3 non-consecutive days. The effect of target tone frequency (250 Hz and 4000 Hz) on middle latency responses were tested in a subset of animals. Results Results show that infrequent target tone pulses elicit greater N1 amplitudes than frequent standard tone pulses. There was no effect of day. Electrodes covering the front of the head tend to elicit greater waveform responses. P2 amplitudes increased for higher frequency target tones (4000 Hz) than the regular 1000 Hz target tones (p < 0.05). Conclusions Two-tone auditory oddball tests produced consistent responses day-to-day. This clinical assessment was successful in the immature large animal model.	[Oeur, R.

Effects of Noise on the Behavioral and Neural Categorization of Speech	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory event-related potentials (ERPs); categorical perception; speech-in-noise (SIN) perception; cocktail party effect; EEG	PRIMARY AUDITORY-CORTEX; CATEGORICAL PERCEPTION; LANGUAGE EXPERIENCE; BRAIN-STEM; BACKGROUND-NOISE; REPRESENTATION; RESPONSES; DISCRIMINATION; PHONEME; ORGANIZATION	We investigated whether the categorical perception (CP) of speech might also provide a mechanism that aids its perception in noise. We varied signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) [clear, 0 dB, -5 dB] while listeners classified an acoustic-phonetic continuum (/u/ to /a/). Noise-related changes in behavioral categorization were only observed at the lowest SNR. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) differentiated category vs. category-ambiguous speech by the P2 wave (similar to 180-320 ms). Paralleling behavior, neural responses to speech with clear phonetic status (i.e., continuum endpoints) were robust to noise down to -5 dB SNR, whereas responses to ambiguous tokens declined with decreasing SNR. Results demonstrate that phonetic speech representations are more resistant to degradation than corresponding acoustic representations. Findings suggest the mere process of binning speech sounds into categories provides a robust mechanism to aid figure-ground speech perception by fortifying abstract categories from the acoustic signal and making the speech code more resistant to external interferences.

Neural responses to interpersonal requests: Effects of imposition and vocally-expressed stance	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Attitudes; Im/politeness; Speech prosody; Face threat; EEG	SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; DISCOURSE COMPREHENSION; SEMANTIC INTEGRATION; PROSODIC ATTITUDES; RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; ERP EVIDENCE; POLITENESS; SPEAKER; EMOTION; SPEECH	The way that speakers communicate their stance towards the listener is often vital for understanding the interpersonal relevance of speech acts, such as basic requests. To establish how interpersonal dimensions of an utterance affect neurocognitive processing, we compared event-related potentials elicited by requests that linguistically varied in how much they imposed on listeners (e.g., Lend me a nickel vs. hundred) and in the speaker's vocally-expressed stance towards the listener (polite or rude tone of voice). From utterance onset, effects of vocal stance were robustly differentiated by an early anterior positivity (P200) which increased for rude versus polite voices. At the utterance-final noun that marked the 'cost' of the request (nickel vs. hundred), there was an increased negativity between 300 and 500 ms in response to high-imposition requests accompanied by rude stance compared to the rest of the conditions. This N400 effect was followed by interactions of stance and imposition that continued to inform several effects in the late positivity time window (500-800 ms postonset of the critical noun), some of which correlated significantly with prosody-related changes in the P200 response from utterance onset. Results point to rapid neural differentiation of voice-related information conveying stance (around 200 ms post-onset of speech) and exemplify the interplay of different sources of interpersonal meaning (stance, imposition) as listeners evaluate social implications of a request. Data show that representations of speaker meaning are actively shaped by vocal and verbal cues that encode interpersonal features of an utterance, promoting attempts to reanalyze and infer the pragmatic significance of speech acts in the 500-800 ms time window.

Neurophysiological correlates of sexually evocative speech	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Sexual innuendo; Speech processing; Prosody; Pragmatics; Nonliteral communication; EEG; P600; LPC; Early negativity	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SEMANTIC INTEGRATION; BRAIN MECHANISMS; EMOTIONAL WORDS; SPEAKER; ATTENTION; PROSODY; CONTEXT; CONSTRUCTION; EXPECTATION	Speakers modulate their voice (prosody) to communicate non-literal meanings, such as sexual innuendo (She inspected his package this morning, where "package" could refer to a man's penis). Here, we analyzed event-related potentials to illuminate how listeners use prosody to interpret sexual innuendo and what neurocognitive processes are involved. Participants listened to third-party statements with literal or 'sexual' interpretations, uttered in an unmarked or sexually evocative tone. Analyses revealed: 1) rapid neural differentiation of neutral vs. sexual prosody from utterance onset; (2) N400-like response differentiating contextually constrained vs. unconstrained utterances following the critical word (reflecting integration of prosody and word meaning); and (3) a selective increased negativity response to sexual innuendo around 600 ms after the critical word. Findings show that the brain quickly integrates prosodic and lexical-semantic information to form an impression of what the speaker is communicating, triggering a unique response to sexual innuendos, consistent with their high social relevance.

Studies have shown extensive evidence that the brain's response to language is affected both by lower-level features, such as word-length and frequency, and syntactic and semantic violations within sentences. However, our understanding on cognitive processes at discourse level remains limited: How does the relationship between words and the wider topic one is reading about affect language processing? We propose an information theoretic model to explain cognitive resourcing. In a study in which participants read sentences from Wikipedia entries, we show information gain, an information theoretic measure that quantifies the specificity of a word given its topic context, modulates word-synchronised brain activity in the EEG. Words with high information gain amplified a slow positive shift in the event related potential. To show that the effect persists for individual and unseen brain responses, we furthermore show that a classifier trained on EEG data can successfully predict information gain from previously unseen EEG. The findings suggest that biological information processing seeks to maximise performance subject to constraints on information capacity.

Their approach enables the identification of spatial and temporal neurophysiological features that are predictive of the response control during the Simon task. The results confirm cognitive theory-driven approaches on the relationship between neurophysiology and human behavior. Efficient action control is indispensable for goal-directed behaviour. Different theories have stressed the importance of either attention or response selection sub-processes for action control. Yet, it is unclear to what extent these processes can be identified in the dynamics of neurophysiological (EEG) processes at the single-trial level and be used to predict the presence of conflicts in a given moment. Applying deep learning, which was blind to cognitive theory, on single-trial EEG data allowed to predict the presence of conflict in 95% of subjects 33% above chance level. Neurophysiological features related to attentional and motor response selection processes in the occipital cortex and the superior frontal gyrus contributed most to prediction accuracy. Importantly, deep learning was able to identify predictive neurophysiological processes in single-trial neural dynamics. Hence, mathematical (artificial intelligence) approaches may be used to foster the validation and development of links between cognitive theory and neurophysiology of human behavior.

Electrophysiological Evidence of Early Cortical Sensitivity to Human Conspecific Mimic Voice as a Distinct Category of Natural Sound	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; FUNDAMENTAL PITCH; N2 COMPONENT; SPEECH; ERP; VOCALIZATIONS; BRAIN; EEG	Purpose: From an anthropological perspective of hominin communication, the human auditory system likely evolved to enable special sensitivity to sounds produced by the vocal tracts of human conspecifics whether attended or passively heard. While numerous electrophysiological studies have used stereotypical human-produced verbal (speech voice and singing voice) and nonverbal vocalizations to identify human voice-sensitive responses, controversy remains as to when (and where) processing of acoustic signal attributes characteristic of "human voiceness" per se initiate in the brain. Method: To explore this, we used animal vocalizations and human-mimicked versions of those calls ("mimic voice") to examine late auditory evoked potential responses in humans. Results: Here, we revealed an N1b component (96-120 ms poststimulus) during a nonattending listening condition showing significantly greater magnitude in response to mimics, beginning as early as primary auditory cortices, preceding the time window reported in previous studies that revealed species-specific vocalization processing initiating in the range of 147-219 ms. During a sound discrimination task, a P600 (500-700 ms poststimulus) component showed specificity for accurate discrimination of human mimic voice. Distinct acoustic signal attributes and features of the stimuli were used in a classifier model, which could distinguish most human from animal voice comparably to behavioral data-though none of these single features could adequately distinguish human voiceness. Conclusions: These results provide novel ideas for algorithms used in neuromimetic hearing aids, as well as direct electrophysiological support for a neurocognitive model of natural sound processing that informs both neurodevelopmental and anthropological models regarding the establishment of auditory communication systems in humans.

Participants with FXS (N= 41) and controls (N= 27) underwent auditory event-related potentials during presentation of an oddball paradigm. Data was adequate for analysis for 33 participants with FXS and 27 controls (age 4-51 y, 13 females [FXS]; 4-54 y, 11 females [control]). Participants with FXS showed larger N1 and P2 amplitudes, abnormal lack of modulation of P1 and P2 amplitudes and P2 latency in response to oddball stimuli) relative to controls: Females with FXS were more similar to controls. Participants with FXS showed a marginal speeding of the P2 latency, suggesting potentiation to oddball stimuli rather than habituation. Participants with FXS showed a heightened N1 habituation effect compared to controls. Gamma power was significantly higher for participants with FXS. Groups did not differ on mismatch negativity. Both controls and participants with FXS showed similar developmental trajectories in P1 and N1 amplitude, P2 latency, and gamma power, but not for P2 amplitude. One month retest analyses performed in 14 participants suggest strong test-retest reliability for most measures. Individuals with FXS show previously demonstrated increased response amplitude and high frequency neural activity. Despite an overall normal developmental trajectory for most measures, individuals with FXS show age-independent but gender-dependent decreases in complex processing of novel stimuli. Many markers show strong retest reliability even in children and thus are potential biomarkers for clinical trials in FXS.

What is the difference between the visual language and expression methods of VR video and ordinary desktop video? Continuous content creation, viewing feedback are a path of exploration. It is also a potential method to explore the basic VR video language and its aesthetic characteristics through neuroscience. In order to build an electroencephalogram (EEG) signal acquisition platform that meets the needs of VR video language research, VR video incentive and management software was developed to realize the management functions of sequencing, hot loading, playback, scoring, and synchronization of VR videos. The necessity of adding hardware synchronization was verified. Finally, the EEG signal acquisition experiment was successfully completed with the help of video management software.

Beyond the positive and negative clinical symptoms, deficits in early auditory prediction-error processes are also observed in SCZ. Regularity violations activate these mechanisms that are indexed by electroencephalography-derived mismatch negativity (MMN) event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to auditory deviance. Objectives/methods This pilot study in thirty-three healthy humans assessed the effects of an optimized alpha 7 nAChR strategy combining CDP-choline (500 mg) with galantamine (16 mg) on speech-elicited MMN amplitude and latency measures. The randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, and counterbalanced design with a baseline stratification method allowed for assessment of individual response differences. Results Increases in MMN generation mediated by the acute CDP-choline/galantamine treatment in individuals with low baseline MMN amplitude for frequency, intensity, duration, and vowel deviants were revealed. Conclusions These results, observed primarily at temporal recording sites overlying the auditory cortex, implicate alpha 7 nAChRs in the enhancement of speech deviance detection and warrant further examination with respect to dysfunctional auditory deviance processing in individuals with SCZ.

Based on the sea battlefield, this paper studies the pros and cons of the color matching of military symbols on sea situation maps. Fifteen colors, where each Hue had five colors, were chosen using the Munsell Color System according to Chroma axis and the Value axis on a span of 2 and 4. By collecting and analyzing the P300 EEG data, reaction time data, and accuracy data of 20 subjects, a better color matching selection of military symbols on pure color (L = 85, a = -10, and b = -23) sea situation maps is put forward, and the conclusions are as follows: (1) the different colors all cause the P300 component in EEG experiment. Among them, the P300 amplitude that is caused by military symbols with lower Chroma is smaller and the latency is shorter, indicating that the user experience and efficiency of low Chroma color symbols will be better than those with high Chroma color symbols. (2) High Value color map military symbols cause higher P300 amplitude and longer latency. According to the results above, this paper puts forward three optimized colors, namely, blue (L = 39, a = 20, and b = -49), green (L = 80, a = -72, and b = 72), and red (L = 20, a = 41, and b = 28). Additionally, three map interfaces were designed to confirm the validity of these colors. By means of applying the NASA-TLX (Task Load Index) scale to evaluate the task load of the confirmation interfaces, it can be concluded that these three optimized colors are preferred by users who are skilled in GIS and interface design. Therefore, the research conclusion of this paper can provide important reference values for military map design, which is helpful in shortening the identification and judgment time during the use of situation maps and it can improve users' operation performance.

Learning similarly depends on outcome values from previous experience. In the current study, we evaluate a possible link between the sense of agency and learning, by investigating how intentional binding, an implicit measure of agency, changes during a probabilistic learning task. In two experiments, we show increased intentional binding in trials that follow losses, compared with trials that follow wins. Experiment 1 demonstrated that this post-error agency boost (PEAB) effect is rule-specific, as it did not occur if the trial following an error involved different action-outcome contingencies. Furthermore, PEAB was not modulated by the type of outcome presentation (monetary vs. affective). Experiment 2 showed that the PEAB effect can also occur when the current action involves a forced (as opposed to free) choice, but only when the previous, loss-provoking action was chosen freely. Thus, PEAB occurs when current actions are informed by outcomes of one's own previous action choices. Electroencephalography (EEG) data linked these effects to two event-related potential components, namely, the Feedback Related Negativity and the P300. Taken together, these results support the notion that PEAB reflects an adaptive property of human sense of agency, facilitating effective learning about the action-outcome structure of a specific task, to optimise future performance. By clarifying the conditions for enhancing the sense of agency through learning, this work adds to our understanding of human learning and agency.

Immature performance monitoring may contribute to suboptimal cognitive control engagement in childhood, potentially explaining why children engage control reactively even when proactive control would be more effective. This study investigated whether encouraging children to actively monitor their performance results in more mature control engagement. Electroencephalography data were collected while children and adults performed a flanker task in three conditions in which they were provided no feedback, standard feedback, or were asked to estimate their own feedback. Both age groups accurately estimated their own feedback. Critically, feedback estimation promoted online performance monitoring and proactive engagement of attention and inhibition during the flanker period in children. These findings indicate that proactive control engagement in childhood can be effectively supported by encouraging performance monitoring.

This prediction was derived from the theory of cognitive dissonance and its effort justification paradigm. Young adult participants (n= 82) engaged in multiple trails of a low or high effort task that resulted in a loss or reward on each trial. Neural responses to the reward (loss) cue were measured using EEG so that the event-related potential known as the Reward Positivity (RewP) could be assessed. Results revealed no significant differences between low and high effort conditions on the RewP. However, within the high effort condition, a more subjective experience of effort was associated with a larger RewP. This research extends past research on the effort justification paradigm of cognitive dissonance theory by suggesting that effort justification is associated with an implicit measure of reward valuation. It, therefore, challenges recent perspectives on dissonance processes that posit that these evaluative changes should only occur on explicit but not implicit measures.

A key event-related potential component involved in emotional processing is the late positive potential (LPP). In healthy controls, LPP amplitude is greater in response to negative stimuli than to positive or neutral stimuli. In the current study, we aimed to compare LPP amplitudes between individuals with psychopathic traits and control subjects when presented with negative, positive or neutral stimuli. We hypothesized that LPP amplitude evoked by emotional stimuli would be reduced in individuals with psychopathic traits compared to healthy controls. Methods After a systematic review of the literature, we conducted a meta-analysis to compare LPP amplitude elicited by emotional stimuli in individuals with psychopathic traits and healthy controls. Results Individuals with psychopathic traits showed significantly reduced LPP amplitude evoked by negative stimuli (mean effect size = -0.47; 95% CI -0.60 to -0.33;p< 0.005) compared to healthy controls. No significant differences between groups were observed for the processing of positive (mean effect size = -0.15; 95% CI -0.42 to 0.12;p= 0.28) and neutral stimuli (mean effect size = -0.12; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.07;p= 0.21). Conclusions Measured by LPP amplitude, individuals with psychopathic traits displayed abnormalities in the processing of emotional stimuli with negative valence whereas processing of stimuli with positive and neutral valence was unchanged as compared with healthy controls.

The effects of roflumilast, a phosphodiesterase type-4 inhibitor, on EEG biomarkers in schizophrenia: A randomised controlled trial	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Schizophrenia; roflumilast; PDE4; PDE4 inhibition; cognition; EEG	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; FRONTAL THETA; ROLIPRAM; P300; ABNORMALITIES	Background: Patients with schizophrenia have significant cognitive deficits, which may profoundly impair quality of life. These deficits are also evident at the neurophysiological level with patients demonstrating altered event-related potential in several stages of cognitive processing compared to healthy controls; within the auditory domain, for example, there are replicated alterations in Mismatch Negativity, P300 and Auditory Steady State Response. However, there are no approved pharmacological treatments for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Aims: Here we examine whether the phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, roflumilast, can improve neurophysiological deficits in schizophrenia. Methods: Using a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design study in 18 patients with schizophrenia, the effect of the phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, roflumilast (100 mu g and 250 mu g) on auditory steady state response (early stage), mismatch negativity and theta (intermediate stage) and P300 (late stage) was examined using electroencephalogram. A total of 18 subjects were randomised and included in the analysis. Results: Roflumilast 250 mu g significantly enhanced the amplitude of both the mismatch negativity (p=0.04) and working memory-related theta oscillations (p=0.02) compared to placebo but not in the other (early- or late-stage) cognitive markers. Conclusions: The results suggest that phosphodiesterase-4 inhibition, with roflumilast, can improve electroencephalogram cognitive markers, which are impaired in schizophrenia, and that phosphodiesterase-4 inhibition acts at an intermediate rather than early or late cognitive processing stage. This study also underlines the use of neurophysiological measures as cognitive biomarkers in experimental medicine.

J	Schlichting, N; de Jong, R; van Rijn, H				Schlichting, Nadine; de Jong, Ritske; van Rijn, Hedderik			Performance-informed EEG analysis reveals mixed evidence for EEG signatures unique to the processing of time	PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH-PSYCHOLOGISCHE FORSCHUNG			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DISCRIMINATION SENSITIVITY; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; BETA OSCILLATIONS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; SUBJECTIVE TIME; STIMULUS ORDER; DURATION; CNV; MAINTENANCE	Certain EEG components (e.g., the contingent negative variation, CNV, or beta oscillations) have been linked to the perception of temporal magnitudes specifically. However, it is as of yet unclear whether these EEG components are really unique to time perception or reflect the perception of magnitudes in general. In the current study we recorded EEG while participants had to make judgments about duration (time condition) or numerosity (number condition) in a comparison task. This design allowed us to directly compare EEG signals between the processing of time and number. Stimuli consisted of a series of blue dots appearing and disappearing dynamically on a black screen. Each stimulus was characterized by its duration and the total number of dots that it consisted of. Because it is known that tasks like these elicit perceptual interference effects that we used a maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) procedure to determine, for each participant and dimension separately, to what extent time and numerosity information were taken into account when making a judgement in an extensive post hoc analysis. This approach enabled us to capture individual differences in behavioral performance and, based on the MLE estimates, to select a subset of participants who suppressed task-irrelevant information. Even for this subset of participants, who showed no or only small interference effects and thus were thought to truly process temporal information in the time condition and numerosity information in the number condition, we found CNV patterns in the time-domain EEG signals for both tasks that was more pronounced in the time-task. We found no substantial evidence for differences between the processing of temporal and numerical information in the time-frequency domain.

Studies have shown that such resources diminish with aging and disease. EEG spectral analysis is a method that has the potential to provide insight into neural alterations affecting motor-cognitive performance. The aim of this study was to assess changes in spectral analysis during dual-task walking in aging and disease Methods 10 young adults, ten older adults, and ten patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) completed an auditory oddball task while standing and while walking on a treadmill. Spectral power within four frequency bandwidths, delta (< 4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), and beta (12-30 Hz), was calculated using Event-Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP) analyses and compared between single task and dual task and between groups. Results Differences in ERSP were found in all groups between the single and dual-task conditions. In response to dual-task walking, beta increased in all groups (p < 0.026), delta decreased in young adults (p = 0.03) and patients with PD (0.015) while theta increased in young adults (p = 0.028) but decreased in older adults (p = 0.02) and patients with PD (p = 0.015). Differences were seen between the young, the older adults, and the patients with PD. Conclusions These findings are the first to show changes in the power of different frequency bands during dual-task walking with aging and disease. These specific brain modulations may reflect deficits in readiness and allocation of attention that may be responsible for the deficits in dual-task performance.

In music, discrete elements are always organized into complex nested structures to convey emotion. However, the processing of music tension in the nested structure remains unknown. The present study investigated the tension experience induced by the nested structure and the underlying neural mechanisms, using a continuous tension rating task and electroencephalography (EEG) at the same time. Thirty musicians listened to music chorale sequences with non-nested, singly nested and doubly nested structures and were required to rate their real-time tension experience. Behavioral data indicated that the tension experience induced by the nested structure had more fluctuations than the non-nested structure, and the difference was mainly exhibited in the process of tension induction rather than tension resolution. However, the EEG data showed that larger late positive components (LPCs) were elicited by the ending chords in the nested structure compared with the non-nested structure, reflecting the difference in cognitive integration for long-distance structural dependence. The discrepancy between resolution experience and neural responses revealed the non-parallel relations between emotion and cognition. Furthermore, the LPC elicited by the doubly nested structure showed a smaller scalp distribution than the singly nested structure, indicating the more difficult processing of the doubly nested structure. These findings revealed the dynamic tension experience induced by the nested structure and the influence of nested type, shedding new light on the relationship between structure and tension in music.

Test-Retest Reliability of Time-Domain EEG Features to Assess Cognitive Load Using a Wireless Dry-Electrode System	42ND ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY: ENABLING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR GLOBAL HEALTHCARE EMBC'20	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	42nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 20-24, 2020	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE	Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) can provide critical support and improve daily task functionality for prosthesis users or social interaction for patients with locked-in syndrome using an assistive communication device. One goal in the development of sophisticated HMIs is to reduce the cognitive load (CL) they place on the user to promote the use of the technology. Electroencephalogram (EEG)-derived measures collected with wired wet-electrode systems have been used to assess CL in laboratory environments and have demonstrated acceptable test-retest reliability. Assessment of CL during real-world unconstrained HMI operation, however, requires the use of a wireless dry-electrode EEG system which provides easier electrode application and untethered movement. However, the test-retest reliability of wireless dry-electrode systems to quantify CL has not been explored. Ensuring the consistent capture of CL-related signals across multiple sessions is critical if these devices are to be used to assess how improvements in HMIs affect CL. Therefore, the current study used a wireless dry-electrode EEG system to compare Evoked Response Potential (ERP) features of a simple auditory oddball task to measure CL during two separate testing sessions a week apart. ERPs of 11 subjects were recorded while participants performed a virtual task at two difficulty levels. A significant correlation was found between the P300 component of the ERPs and subjective ratings of CL during both testing sessions. Furthermore, there was a statistically significant test-retest reliability for this same ERP feature and similar signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) across sessions.

We investigated the neural correlates of subliminal vs. conscious stimulus deviations of color constancy manipulations. Methods: Behavioral and Oddball EEG/ERP experiments were conducted (n = 20). Psychophysical illuminant variation discrimination thresholds were first estimated, to establish individual perceptual awareness ranges, allowing for simulation of natural daylight spectral and spatial variations on colored surfaces, at different ambiguity levels. Results: Behavioral results validated illuminant choice. ERPs showed a significant modulation of posterior P1 component specifically for the subliminal global uniform deviation condition, respecting color constancy. Neural correlates of conscious percepts were identified at posterior N2-P3 latencies, parietal (P3b) and frontal regions. Conclusions: We identified an early subliminal correlate of low-level illuminant change, which reflects automatic unconscious detection of global color constancy deviations. Its suppression under conscious perception is probably due to top-down suppression according to prediction error models.

However, the impact of early visual processes on performance has been largely ignored. To clarify this issue, we explored the time-course of early visual processing (from 0 to 450 ms poststimulus) using event-related potentials topographic analyses. The main findings demonstrated a significant link between early attentional processes and accuracy scores occurring more than five seconds later, as well as a strong association between spatial covariance and microstate topographies exhibiting substantial gender differences. More specifically, the results indicated that, in a classical mental rotation task, the male brain expends more time processing visual-spatial information resulting in a longer bilateral positive potential at posterior-occipital sites. In comparison, the female brain initiates earlier processing of non-spatial information resulting in a faster transition from a bilateral positive potential of posterior-occipital sites to a negative potential at central-frontal sites. These findings illustrate how a more complete utilization of the spatiotemporal information contained in EEG recordings can provide important insights about the impact of early visual processes on interindividual differences, particularly across gender, and thus shed new light on alternate cognitive strategies.

Understanding and Modeling Brain Activity in Source Credibility Evaluation	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						credibility; EEG; source localization; ERP; trust		Understanding how humans evaluate credibility is an important scientific question in the era of fake news. Source credibility is among the most important aspects of credibility evaluations. One of the most direct ways to understand source credibility is to use measurements of brain activity of humans performing credibility evaluations. Nevertheless, source credibility has never been investigated using such a method before. This article reports the results of an experiment during which we have measured brain activity during source credibility evaluation, using EEG. The experiment allowed for identification of brain areas that were active when a participant made positive or negative source credibility evaluations. Based on experimental data, we modeled and predicted human source credibility evaluations using EEG brain activity measurements with F1 score exceeding 0.7 (using 10-fold cross-validation).

In total, 200 sentences written in Russian with varying emotional coloring were presented during the task, with half of the sentences containing a grammatical error that the participants were asked to identify. The EEG was recorded in age-matched control individuals (n = 17) and two groups of Samatha meditators with relatively short- (3-5 years' experience, n = 18) and long-term (10-30 years' experience, n = 18) practice experience. Task performance time (TPT) and accuracy of error detection (AED) were chosen as behavioral values. Amplitude, time latency and cortical distribution of P300 and P600 peaks of ERP were used as a value of speech-related brain activity. All statistical effects of meditation were estimated, controlling for age and sex. No behavioral differences between two groups of meditators were found. General TPT was shorter for both groups of meditators compared to the control group. Non-meditators reacted significantly slower to sentences about aggression than to sentences about anxiety or non-emotional sentences, whereas no significance was found between meditator groups. Non-meditators had better AED for the sentences about one-self than for the sentences about other people, whereas the meditators did not show any significant difference. The amplitude of P300 peak in frontal and left temporal scalp regions was higher for long-term meditators in comparison with both intermediate and control groups. The latency of P300 and P600 in left frontal and temporal regions positively correlated with TPT, whereas the amplitude of P300 in these regions had a negative correlation with TPT. We demonstrate that long-term meditation practice increases the ability of an individual to process negative emotional stimuli. The differences in behavioral reactions after onset of negative information that was self-related and non-self-related, which is typical for non-meditators, disappeared due to the influence of meditation. ERP results could be interpreted as a value of increase in voluntary control over emotional state during meditational practice.

A recently proposed theory that attempts to account for these symptoms, states that autistic individuals have a decreased ability to anticipate upcoming sensory stimulation due to overly precise internal prediction models. Here, we tested this hypothesis by comparing the electrophysiological markers of prediction errors in auditory prediction by vision between a group of autistic individuals and a group of age-matched individuals with typical development. Between-group differences in prediction error signaling were assessed by comparing event-related potentials evoked by unexpected auditory omissions in a sequence of audiovisual recordings of a handclap in which the visual motion reliably predicted the onset and content of the sound. Unexpected auditory omissions induced anincreasedearly negative omission response in the autism spectrum disorder group, indicating that violations of the prediction model produced larger prediction errors in the autism spectrum disorder group compared to the typical development group. The current results show that autistic individuals have alterations in visual-auditory predictive coding, and support the notion of impaired predictive coding as a core deficit underlying atypical sensory perception in autism spectrum disorder. Lay abstract Many autistic individuals experience difficulties in processing sensory information (e.g. increased sensitivity to sound). Here we show that these difficulties may be related to an inability to process unexpected sensory stimulation. In this study, 29 older adolescents and young adults with autism and 29 age-matched individuals with typical development participated in an electroencephalography study. The electroencephalography study measured the participants' brain activity during unexpected silences in a sequence of videos of a handclap. The results showed that the brain activity of autistic individuals during these silences was increased compared to individuals with typical development. This increased activity indicates that autistic individuals may have difficulties in processing unexpected incoming sensory information, and might explain why autistic individuals are often overwhelmed by sensory stimulation. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the different sensory perception experienced by autistic individuals.

Theories differ on whether early stages of speech processing, like sublexical processing during which articulatory features and portions of speech sounds are identified, are strictly feed-forward or are influenced by semantic and lexical context. In the current study, we investigate the time-course of lexical context effects on judgments about the individual sounds we perceive by recording electroencephalography as an online measure of speech processing while subjects engage in a lexically biasing phoneme categorization task. We find that lexical context modulates the amplitude of the N100, an ERP component linked with sublexical processes in speech perception. We demonstrate that these results can be modeled in an interactive speech perception model and are not well fit by any established feed-forward mechanisms of lexical bias. These results support interactive speech perception theories over feed-forward theories in which sublexical speech perception processes are only driven by bottom-up information.

Recent studies using brain imaging have significantly contributed towards the understanding of this concept, but only as a binary notion, i.e. a document being judged as relevant or non-relevant. While such a binary division is prevalent in IR, seminal theories have proposed relevance as a graded variable; i.e. having different degrees. In this paper, we aim to investigate the brain activity associated with relevance when it is treated as a graded concept. Twenty-five participants provided graded relevance judgements in the context of a Question Answering (Q/A) Task, during assessment with an electroencephalogram (EEG). Our findings show that significant differences in event-related potentials (ERPs) were observed in response to information segments processed in the context of high-relevance, low-relevance and no-relevance, supporting the concept of graded relevance. We speculate that differences in attentional engagement, semantic mismatch (between the question and answer) and memory processing underpin the electrophysiological responses to the graded relevance judgements. We believe our conclusions constitute an important step in unravelling the nature of graded relevance and knowledge of the electrophysiological modulation to each grade of relevance will help to improve the design and evaluation of IR systems.

Because the transition to motherhood from pregnancy to birth constitutes a sensitive period in cortical reorganization linked to the quality of mother-infant interactions, evaluating attention processes in the maternal cortex prior to the experience of mother-infant face-to-face interactions is critical. To assess behavioural attention and neural responses to infant faces in pregnant mothers, behavioral and electrocortical indices were collected using a Go/No Go task, in which infant and adult faces served as distractors. Results showed that heightened processing of infant faces relative to adult faces (behavioral and electrocortical indices) was related to observations of greater maternal sensitivity. These findings show that prenatal maternal attention bias to and the perceived salience of infant faces serves as an individual cognitive hallmark of maternal sensitivity that acts independently of caregiving experience.

Response dependence of reversal-related ERP components in perception of ambiguous figures	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; ERPs; perceptual multistability; reversible figures; sensation; perception; visual perception	NECKER CUBE REVERSALS; MULTISTABLE PERCEPTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; BISTABLE PERCEPTION; NEURAL ACTIVITY; TASK RELEVANCE; EEG; BIAS; POTENTIALS; CORTEX	Perceptual multi-stability is characterized by alternating interpretations of an unchanging stimulus input. The reversal negativity (RN) and reversal positivity (RP) ERP components show differences in electrophysiological responses between trials on which participants experience a perceptual reversal of a multi-stable stimulus versus trials without a reversal (i.e., stable). However, it is unclear to what extent these two ERP components reflect reversal-related perceptual processing rather than task and response processes. To address this, we varied task and response requirements while measuring the RN and RP. In the standard reversal task, participants indicated whether they saw a perceptual reversal on each trial. In contrast, in the identity task participants reported perceived identity of the stimulus (e.g., face or vase) without any reference to reversals. In some blocks, reversal trials required a response whereas in other blocks stable trials required a response. We found that the RN appeared independently of task and response style. However, the early latency RP component was only present when participants responded manually. For non-response trials, a component was found during the same latency as the RP but with inverted polarity. Our results suggest that the early RP component is dependent on response-related processes rather than being a pure neural signature of perceptual processes related to endogenous perceptual reversals.

Effects of an Orexin-2 Receptor Antagonist on Sleep and Event-Related Oscillations in Female Rats Exposed to Chronic Intermittent Ethanol During Adolescence	ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Alcohol; Adolescence; Sleep; Orexin; Hypocretin	ALCOHOL-USE; UNITED-STATES; VAPOR EXPOSURE; EEG POWER; DEPENDENCE; DRINKING; REM; CONSEQUENCES; ARCHITECTURE; CONSUMPTION	Background Alcohol use is on the rise among women in the United States which is especially concerning since women who drink have a higher risk of alcohol-related problems. Orexin (hypocretin) receptor antagonists may have some therapeutic value for alcohol-induced insomnia; however, the use of this class of drugs following female adolescent binge drinking is limited. The current study will address whether adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) in female rats can result in lasting changes in sleep pathology and whether orexin-targeted treatment can alleviate these deficits. Methods Following a 5-week AIE vapor model, young adult rats were evaluated on waking event-related oscillations (EROs) and EEG sleep. Subsequently, AIE rats were treated with orexin receptor 2 (OX2R) antagonist (MK-1064; 10, 20mg/kg) to test for modifications in sleep pathology and waking ERO. Results Female AIE rats exhibited lasting changes in sleep compared to controls. This was demonstrated by increased fragmentation of slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement sleep, as well as reductions in delta and theta power during SWS. There was no impact of AIE on waking EROs. Acute MK-1064 hastened SWS onset and increased the number of SWS episodes, without increasing sleep fragmentation in AIE and controls. While treatment with MK-1064 did not impact sleep EEG spectra, waking ERO energy was increased in delta, theta, and beta frequency bands. Conclusions These results demonstrate that AIE can produce lasting changes in sleep in female rats, highly similar to what we previously found in males. Additionally, while the OX2R antagonist promoted sleep in both alcohol-exposed and unexposed rats, it did not reverse most of the alcohol-induced disruptions in sleep. Thus, OX2R antagonism may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of insomnia, but not the specific signs of alcohol-induced insomnia.

A more detailed characterization of the spatial distribution and timing of the synchronization of frequency bands would contribute substantially to the clarification of neural mechanisms that underlie performance of the Go/NoGo task. Methods The present study used a machine learning approach to learn the features that distinguish between ERSPs involved in selection and inhibition in a Go/NoGo task. A single-layer neural network classifier was used to predict task conditions for each subject to characterize ERSPs associated with Go versus NoGo trials. Results The final classifier accurately identified individual task conditions at an overall rate of 92%, estimated by fivefold cross-validation. The detailed accounting of EEG time-frequency patterns localized to brain regions (i.e., thalamus, pre-SMA, orbitofrontal cortex, and superior parietal cortex) corroborates and also elaborates upon previous findings from fMRI and EEG studies, and expands the information about EEG power changes in multiple frequency bands (i.e., primarily theta power increase, alpha decreases, and beta increases and decreases) within these regions underlying the selection and inhibition processes engaged in the Go and NoGo trials. Conclusion This time-frequency-based classifier extends previous spatiotemporal findings and provides information about neural mechanisms underlying selection and inhibition processes engaged in Go and NoGo trials, respectively. This neural network classifier can be used to assess time-frequency patterns from an individual subject and thus may offer insight into therapeutic uses of neuromodulation in neural dysfunction.

Patients with fibromyalgia show increased beta connectivity across distant networks and microstates alterations in resting-state electroencephalogram	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							SF-36 HEALTH SURVEY; WORKING-MEMORY; EVOKED POTENTIALS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA RHYTHMS; EEG; PAIN; DYNAMICS; SYNCHRONIZATION; MODULATION	Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic condition characterized by widespread pain of unknown etiology associated with alterations in the central nervous system. Although previous studies demonstrated altered patterns of brain activity during pain processing in patients with FM, alterations in spontaneous brain oscillations, in terms of functional connectivity or microstates, have been barely explored so far. Here we recorded the EEG from 43 patients with FM and 51 healthy controls during open-eyes resting-state. We analyzed the functional connectivity between different brain networks computing the phase lag index after group Independent Component Analysis, and also performed an EEG microstates analysis. Patients with FM showed increased beta band connectivity between different brain networks and alterations in some microstates parameters (specifically lower occurrence and coverage of microstate class C). We speculate that the observed alterations in spontaneous EEG may suggest the dominance of endogenous top-down influences; this could be related to limited processing of novel external events and the deterioration of flexible behavior and cognitive control frequently reported for FM. These findings provide the first evidence of alterations in long-distance phase connectivity and microstate indices at rest, and represent progress towards the understanding of the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia and the identification of novel biomarkers for its diagnosis.

The processing of IDS evolves during the first years of life. In order to serve as an effective tool of language acquisition, already very young infants should be able to distinguish IDS from adult directed speech (ADS). We tested whether the ability to discriminate these two speech registers is functional in neonates, by recording EEG from 98 newborn infants in response to Hungarian words naturally spoken in the IDS and the ADS register. Words presented in the ADS register elicited a centro-parietal slow positivity in the 200-600 ms time window whereas words in IDS register elicited a small frontal negativity in the 700-900 ms time window. We conclude that newborn infants differentiate natural speech sounds based on speech register.

Sleep disruption is not observed with brain-responsive neurostimulation for epilepsy	EPILEPSIA OPEN			English	Article						arousal; brain-responsive neurostimulation; epilepsy; polysomnography; RNS; sleep	VAGUS NERVE-STIMULATION; BILATERAL SUBTHALAMIC STIMULATION; EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; ANTERIOR NUCLEUS; MOTOR EVENTS; SEIZURES; APNEA; PATTERNS; OUTCOMES; AROUSAL	Objective: Neurostimulation devices that deliver electrical impulses to the nervous system are widely used to treat seizures in patients with medically refractory epilepsy, but the effects of these therapies on sleep are incompletely understood. Vagus nerve stimulation can contribute to obstructive sleep apnea, and thalamic deep brain stimulation can cause sleep disruption. A device for brain-responsive neurostimulation (RNS (R) System, NeuroPace, Inc) is well tolerated in clinical trials, but potential effects on sleep are unknown. Methods: Six adults with medically refractory focal epilepsy treated for at least six months with the RNS System underwent a single night of polysomnography (PSG). RNS System lead locations included mesial temporal and neocortical targets. Sleep stages and arousals were scored according to standard guidelines. Stimulations delivered by the RNS System in response to detections of epileptiform activity were identified by artifacts on scalp electroencephalography. Results: One subject was excluded for technical reasons related to unreliable identification of stimulation artifact on EEG during PSG. In the remaining five subjects, PSG showed fragmented sleep with frequent arousals. Arousal histograms aligned to stimulations revealed a significant peak in arousals just before stimulation. In one of these subjects, the arousal peak began before stimulation and extended similar to 1 seconds after stimulation. A peak in arousals occurring only after stimulation was not observed. Significance: In this small cohort of patients, brain-responsive neurostimulation does not appear to disrupt sleep. If confirmed in larger studies, this could represent a potential clinical advantage of brain-responsive neurostimulation over other neurostimulation modalities.

However, the acute effect of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise (VIAE) on the prefrontal, the insular, and the occipito-parietal activities linked to proactive control, early perceptual, arid attentional processing is indeterminate. Thus, the present study investigated the acute effect of VIAE on the neurobehavioral correlates of these proactive and reactive neurocognitive functions. Young, healthy subjects participated in two separate experimental sessions: 30 min of VIAE and 30 min of internet browsing. Before and immediately after the two sessions, we recorded high-resolution electroencephalograms while performing a visuomotor discriminative response task. For testing the effect of VIAE on cognitive processing, we analyzed the behavioral performance and event-related potentials (ERPs). The analysis of behavioral data did not reveal any VIAE effect on task performance. The analysis of ERPs showed no significant VIAE effect on the proactive functions in the premotor and the prefrontal areas, but significant effects on the reactive functions related to selective attention in parietal areas (indexed by the N1 amplitude) and perceptual awareness in the anterior insula (indexed by the pN1 latency). We concluded that a single bout of VIAE does not affect the proactive functions in the premotor and the prefrontal areas, but modulates the early reactive neural mechanisms underlying perceptual awareness of stimuli in the insular cortex and selective attention in the parieto-occipital areas.

Heartfulness is a popular meditation technique that includes in its repertoire, a unique passive form of meditation. We carried out a pilot study recruiting male heartfulness meditators (proficient n = 24, with 6-28 years of meditation experience; novice n = 24, 5 to 16 months of experience) and subsequently recruited matched controls (n = 15). We examined well-being, and carried out high-density EEG recordings to examine indices of meditation and cognition in these groups. Well-being scores were significantly higher for the proficient meditators as compared to novice and intermediate for the controls. We did not find any group differences in cognitive processing. During meditation, enhanced occipital gamma was found in proficient meditators as compared to controls. We discuss the findings from this pilot study and suggest avenues for future research.

The proposed BCI exploits the P300 signal, an event-related potential (ERP) typically induced by visual/audio oddball paradigm stimulation protocol. For the driving purpose, in our application a four-choice synchronous BCI has been implemented. The neural interface architecture is made up by (i) the acquisition unit, (ii) the processing unit and (iii) the navigation unit. The former unit collects brain signals by 6 smart wireless electrodes from the parietal-cortex area. The processing unit is composed of a dedicated mu PC (Raspberry Pi, RPi) performing stimuli delivery, the machine learning (ML) stage and the real-time classification. Specifically, the processing unit bases its ML stage working on a typical classification problem approach (i.e., feature extraction and classification). In this context, the main contribution of the work lies in the introduction of a P300 spatio-temporal characterization approach (t-RIDE), which allows to analyze all the available choices in a one-vs-all discrimination scenarios. It permits the implementation of very common binary classifiers despite the hyper dimensionality of the classification problem. Finally, the RPi-based navigation unit actuates the received commands and supports the vehicle by using peripheral sensors. As a proof of concept, the BCI operation has been tested on 7 subjects (aged 26 +/- 3), using an acrylic prototype car. The experimental results showed that in the online free-drive mode (testing set), the BCI accuracy reached 84.28 +/- 0.87% all over 4 choices, on singletrials.

In contrast, Western classical musicians read music that specifies particular realizations so that they rarely make such functional substitutions. We advance a theory that experienced improvisers more readily perceive musical structures with similar functions as sounding similar by virtue of this categorization, and that this categorization partly enables the ability to improvise by allowing performers to make substitutions. We tested this with an oddball task while recording electroencephalography. In the task, a repeating standard chord progression was randomly interspersed with two kinds of deviants: one in which one of the chords was substituted with a chord from the same functional class ("exemplar deviant"), and one in which the substitution was outside the functional class ("function deviant"). For function compared to exemplar deviants, participants with more improvisation experience responded more quickly and accurately and had more discriminable N2c and P3b ERP components. Further, N2c and P3b signal discriminability predicted participants' behavioral ability to discriminate the stimuli. Our research contributes to the cognitive science of creativity through identifying differences in knowledge organization as a trait that facilitates creative ability.

Active mindfulness training has been shown to help improve attentional control. Here, we examined alcohol cue-related hypersensitivity among individuals with AUD who received rolling group mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP) in combination with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), over right inferior frontal gyrus. Methods: Participants (n = 68) viewed a series of emotionally negative, emotionally neutral and alcohol-related images. Following image presentation, participants were asked to rate their level of craving for the alcohol cues, and their level of negative affect evoked by neutral and negative cues. During the task, electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded to capture an event-related component shown to relate to emotionally salient stimuli: the late positive potential (LPP). Participants who completed a follow-up EEG (n = 37) performed the task a second time after up to eight sessions of MBRP coupled with active or sham tDCS. Results: We found that both craving ratings and the LPP significantly decreased in response to alcohol cues from pre- to post-treatment, but not for other image cues. The magnitude of alcohol image craving reductions was associated with the number of MBRP group sessions attended. Active tDCS was not associated with craving ratings, but it was associated with greater LPP amplitudes across image types. Conclusions: Taken together, these results suggest that disruption of alcohol-cue hypersensitivity in people with AUD may be a target mechanism of MBRP.	[Brown, Darin R.; Jackson, Trevor C.

GM-IVH presents during the first postnatal week and can impinge on somatosensory circuits resulting in aberrant somatosensory cortical events straight after injury. Subsequently, somatosensory circuits undergo significant plastic changes, sometimes allowing the reinstatement of a somatosensory cortical response. However, it is not known whether this restructuring results in a full recovery of somatosensory functions. To investigate this, we compared somatosensory responses to mechanical stimulation measured with 18-channels EEG between infants who had high-grade GM-IVH (with ventricular dilatation and/or intraparenchymal lesion; n = 7 studies from 6 infants; mean corrected gestational age = 33 weeks; mean postnatal age = 56 days) and age-matched controls (n = 9 studies from 8 infants; mean corrected gestational age = 32 weeks; mean postnatal age = 36 days). We showed that infants who had high-grade GM-IVH did not recruit the same cortical source configuration following stimulation of the foot, but their response to stimulation of the hand resembled that of controls. These results show that somatosensory cortical circuits are reinstated in infants who had GM-IVH, during the several weeks after injury, but remain different from those of infants without brain injury. An important next step will be to investigate whether these evidences of neural reorganisation predict neurodevelopmental outcome.

Non-invasive recording from the human olfactory bulb	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ODOR IDENTIFICATION; BETA-OSCILLATIONS; HABITUATION; RATS; DISCRIMINATION; RELIABILITY; DYSFUNCTION; TESTS; GAMMA	Measures of neural processing can be obtained non-invasively from all areas of the human brain but one, the olfactory bulb. Here, the authors show that signals obtained from EEG electrodes at the nasal bridge represent responses from the human olfactory bulb, the so-called Electrobulbogram. Current non-invasive neuroimaging methods can assess neural activity in all areas of the human brain but the olfactory bulb (OB). The OB has been suggested to fulfill a role comparable to that of V1 and the thalamus in the visual system and have been closely linked to a wide range of olfactory tasks and neuropathologies. Here we present a method for non-invasive recording of signals from the human OB with millisecond precision. We demonstrate that signals obtained via recordings from EEG electrodes at the nasal bridge represent responses from the human olfactory bulb - recordings we term Electrobulbogram (EBG). The EBG will aid future olfactory-related translational work but can also potentially be implemented as an everyday clinical tool to detect pathology-related changes in human central olfactory processing in neurodegenerative diseases. In conclusion, the EBG is localized to the OB, is reliable, and follows response patterns demonstrated in non-human animal models.

Interaction of Background Noise and Auditory Hallucinations on Phonemic Mismatch Negativity (MMN) and P3a Processing in Schizophrenia	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						schizophrenia; hallucinations; mismatch negativity; electroencephalography; ERP; event-related potentials; P3a; P300	CLINICAL HIGH-RISK; SPEECH SOUNDS; 1ST-EPISODE PSYCHOSIS; VERBAL HALLUCINATIONS; BIPOLAR DISORDER; REDUCTION; DEFICITS; INFORMATION; PERCEPTION; GENERATION	Auditory hallucinations (AHs) are among the cardinal symptoms of schizophrenia (SZ). During the presence of AHs aberrant activity of auditory cortices have been observed, including hyperactivation during AHs alone and hypoactivation when AHs are accompanied by a concurrent external auditory competitor. Mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a are common ERPs of interest within the study of SZ as they are robustly reduced in the chronic phase of the illness. The present study aimed to explore whether background noise altered the auditory MMN and P3a in those with SZ and treatment-resistant AHs. Methods MMN and P3a were assessed in 12 hallucinating patients (HPs), 11 non-hallucinating patients (NPs) and 9 healthy controls (HCs) within an auditory oddball paradigm. Standard (P = 0.85) and deviant (P = 0.15) stimuli were presented during three noise conditions: silence (SL), traffic noise (TN), and wide-band white noise (WN). Results HPs showed significantly greater deficits in MMN amplitude relative to NPs in all background noise conditions, though predominantly at central electrodes. Conversely, both NPs and HPs exhibited significant deficits in P3a amplitude relative to HCs under the SL condition only. Significance These findings suggest that the presence of AHs may specifically impair the MMN, while the P3a appears to be more generally impaired in SZ. That MMN amplitudes are specifically reduced for HPs during background noise conditions suggests HPs may have a harder time detecting changes in phonemic sounds during situations with external traffic or "real-world" noise compared to NPs.

As the brain activity of the prestimulus and encoding phases has a crucial effect on subsequent memory outcomes (e.g., remembered or forgotten), previous studies have tried to predict the memory performance in this period. Conventional studies have used the spectral power or event-related potential of specific regions as the classification feature. However, as multiple brain regions work collaboratively to process memory, it could be a better option to use functional connectivity within the memory-related brain network to predict subsequent memory performance. In this study, we acquired the EEG signals while performing an associative memory task that remembers scene-word pairs. For the connectivity analysis, we estimated the cross-mutual information within the default mode network with the time-frequency spectra at the prestimulus and encoding phases. Then, we predicted the success or failure of subsequent memory outcome with the connectivity features. We found that the classifier with support vector machine achieved the highest classification accuracy of 80.83% +/- 12.65% (mean +/- standard deviation) using the beta (13-30 Hz) connectivity at encoding phase among the multiple frequency bands and task phases. Using the prestimulus beta connectivity, the classification accuracy of 72.45% +/- 12.52% is also achieved. Among the features, the connectivity related to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex was found to contribute to successful memory encoding. The connectivity related to the posterior cingulate cortex was found to contribute to the failure of memory encoding. The present study showed for the first time the successful prediction with high accuracy of subsequent memory outcome using single-trial functional connectivity.

Inhibition of a previous response and mismatch interference induced by response-repetition have been proposed as sources of negative response-repetition effects by the response inhibition account and episodic binding and retrieval model, respectively. The present study utilized electroencephalograph (EEG) to investigate the mechanism underlying negative response-repetition effects. Lateralized enhancements in the upper-alpha and beta bands served as indexes of response inhibition, and significant lateralized beta enhancements appeared after the previous response execution. About 500-600 ms after the onset of current stimuli, event-related potentials presented significant response-repeat negativity in the task-switch sequence, indicating the occurrence of mismatch interference induced by response repetition. Moreover, lateralized beta enhancements and response-repeat negativity were each positively related to behavioral negative response-repetition effects. These results suggest that both response inhibition and mismatch interference induced by response repetition make contributions to negative response-repetition effects.

In addition to symptomatic treatments, corticosteroids represent the cornerstone of the high-grade CERS treatment. Drugs targeting IL-6 should be restricted to severe forms, especially those associated with cytokine release syndrome. The purpose of this workshop is to provide practical help in dealing with this complication.

However, the neurophysiological basis for stimulation effects as well as their inter-individual differences is not yet understood. In the present study, we used a closed-loop electroencephalography-tACS(EEG-tACS) protocol to examine the modulation of alpha oscillations generated in occipito-parietal areas. In particular, we investigated the effects of a repeated short-time intermittent stimulation protocol (1 s in every trial) applied over the visual cortex (Cz and Oz) and adjusted according to the phase and frequency of visual alpha oscillations on the amplitude of these oscillations. Based on previous findings, we expected higher increases in alpha amplitudes for tACS applied in-phase with ongoing oscillations as compared to an application in anti-phase and this modulation to be present in low-alpha amplitude states of the visual system (eyes opened, EO) but not high (eyes closed, EC). Contrary to our expectations, we found a transient suppression of alpha power in inter-individually derived spatially specific parieto-occipital components obtainedviathe estimation of spatial filters by using the common spatial patterns approach. The amplitude modulation was independent of the phase relationship between the tACS signal and alpha oscillations, and the state of the visual system manipulatedviaclosed- and open-eye conditions. It was also absent in conventionally analyzed single-channel and multi-channel data from an average parieto-occipital region. The fact that the tACS modulation of oscillations was phase-independent suggests that mechanisms driving the effects of tACS may not be explained by entrainment alone, but rather require neuroplastic changes or transient disruption of neural oscillations. Our study also supports the notion that the response to tACS is subject-specific, where the modulatory effects are shaped by the interplay between the stimulation and different alpha generators. This favors stimulation protocols as well as analysis regimes exploiting inter-individual differences, such as spatial filters to reveal otherwise hidden stimulation effects and, thereby, comprehensively induce and study the effects and underlying mechanisms of tACS.

However, precise discrimination of the temporal relationship between stimuli is imperative for successful perception of and interaction with the complex, multimodal environment. Although the properties of cross-modal temporal processing have been extensively studied in neurotypical populations, remarkably little is known about how the loss of one sense impacts the integrity of temporal interactions among the remaining senses. To understand how auditory deprivation affects multisensory temporal interactions, ED and age-matched normal hearing (NH) controls performed a visual-tactile temporal order judgment task in which visual and tactile stimuli were separated by varying stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) and subjects had to discern the leading stimulus. Participants performed the task while EEG data were recorded. Group averaged event-related potential waveforms were compared between groups in occipital and fronto-central electrodes. Despite similar temporal order sensitivities and performance accuracy, ED had larger visual P100 amplitudes for all SOA levels and larger tactile N140 amplitudes for the shortest asynchronous (+/- 30 ms) and synchronous SOA levels. The enhanced signal strength reflected in these components from ED adults are discussed in terms of compensatory recruitment of cortical areas for visual-tactile processing. In addition, ED adults had similar tactile P200 amplitudes as NH but longer P200 latencies suggesting reduced efficiency in later processing of tactile information. Overall, these results suggest that greater responses by ED for early processing of visual and tactile signals are likely critical for maintained performance in visual-tactile temporal order discrimination.

To investigate audiovisual semantic integration, we utilized bimodal stimuli (AV, simultaneous presentation of an auditory sound and a visual picture; An, simultaneous presentation of an auditory sound and a visual noise; Vn, simultaneous presentation of a visual picture and an auditory noise; Fn, simultaneous presentation of an auditory noise and a visual noise) to remove the effect of co-stimulation integration and extract data regarding high-order semantic integration. Electroencephalography with a high temporal resolution was used to examine the neural mechanisms associated with co-stimulationremoved audiovisual semantic integration in attended and unattended conditions. By comparing the (AV + Fn) and (An+Vn), we identified three effects related to co-stimulation-removed audiovisual semantic integration. In the attended condition, two semantic integration effects over bilateral occipito-temporal regions at 220-240 ms and over frontal region at 560-600 ms were observed. In the unattended condition, only one semantic integration effect over centro-frontal region at 340-360 ms was observed. These effects reflected the semantic integration processes of pictures and sounds after removing the co-stimulation caused by spatiotemporal consistency. Moreover, the discrepancy in these effects in temporal and spatial distribution implied distinct neural mechanisms underlying attended and unattended semantic integration. In the attended condition, the audiovisual semantic information was initially integrated based on the semantic congruency (220-240 ms) and then reanalyzed according to the current task (560-600 ms), which was a goal-driven process and influenced by topdown attention. Contrastingly, in the unattended condition, no attention resources were allocated and the semantic integration (340-360 ms) was an unconscious automatic process.

We used EEG to investigate cortical oscillatory activities during the tactile discrimination task and characterize the correlation between the EEG features and subjects' discrimination performance. Approach. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) was applied on two finger areas (thumb and index for healthy hands, thumb and index-projected areas for disabled hands) to evoke two kinds of tactile sensations (vibration and pressure) with three levels of intensities (low, medium and high). Four forearm amputees and thirteen able-bodied subjects were recruited to discriminate the specific intensity and area of the applied stimulation. We assessed the discrimination performance [discrimination accuracy rate (AR) and response time (RT)] to quantify the tactile acuity. During the stimulation, EEG signals were recorded and the evoked cortical oscillatory activities were analyzed. Linear regression analyses were performed between EEG features and tactile discrimination performance. Main results. Spectral analysis revealed that alpha ERD over somatosensory regions persisted the whole task period and was related to the sensory information processing. Alpha ERD over prefrontal regions was only found during the stimulation judgement period and might reflect advanced cognitive process. There was no linear correlation between prefrontal alpha ERD and tactile discrimination performance. While contralateral somatosensory alpha ERDs exhibited significantly negative correlations with ARs (r < -0.7, p < 0.05) and positive correlations with RTs (r > 0.65, p < 0.05). Specifically, the fitting results of higher alpha band (10-13 Hz) were superior to lower alpha band (8-10 Hz). Significance. Alpha ERD over contralateral somatosensory cortex could be used as an objective index for the evaluation of tactile acuity and might have the potential to be applied in sensory rehabilitation for amputees.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is now the most common cause of dementia in advanced countries, while dementia due to neurosyphilis was the leading cause a century ago. Many challenges remain for diagnosing dementia definitively. Some of these include variability of early symptoms and overlap with similar disorders, as well as the possibility of combined, or mixed, etiologies in some cases. Newer technologies, including the incorporation of PET neuroimaging and other biomarkers (genomics and proteomics), are being incorporated into revised diagnostic criteria. However, the application of novel diagnostic methods at clinical sites is plagued by many caveats including availability and access. This review surveys new diagnostic methods as well as remaining challenges-for clinical care and clinical research.	[Turner, R.

Here, we follow the hypothesis that specific musical demands further shape neural processing. To test this assumption, we subjected groups of professional drummers, professional woodwind players, and nonmusicians to pure tone sequences and drum sequences in which infrequent anticipations of tones or drum beats had been inserted. Passively listening to these sequences elicited a mismatch negativity to the temporally deviant stimuli which was greater in the musicians for tone series and particularly large for drummers for drum sequences. In active listening conditions drummers more accurately and more quickly detected temporally deviant stimuli.

Here we present a protocol that combines mindfulness meditation training, an episodic memory task, and EEG to examine how mindfulness meditation changes behavioral performance and the neural correlates of episodic memory. Subjects in a mindfulness meditation experimental group were compared to a waitlist control group. Subjects in the mindfulness meditation experimental group spent four weeks training and practicing mindfulness meditation. Mindfulness was measured before and after training using the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). Episodic memory was measured before and after training using a source recognition task. During the retrieval phase of the source recognition task, EEG was recorded. The results showed that mindfulness, source recognition behavioral performance, and EEG theta power in right frontal and left parietal channels increased following mindfulness meditation training. In addition, increases in mindfulness correlated with increases in theta power in right frontal channels. Therefore, results obtained from combining mindfulness meditation training, an episodic memory task, and EEG reveal the behavioral and neural effects of mindfulness meditation on episodic memory.

Maternal depression and adolescent attention to self- or other-directed emotional faces	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						Face viewing; Adolescence; EEG; Parental depression	CHILD PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; AVERTED GAZE; PERCEPTION; MOTHERS; SYMPTOMS; MODEL; EYE; RELIABILITY; MECHANISMS	Background: Maternal depression history represents a significant risk factor for developing psychopathology in children, altered emotional responding may represent a central risk pathway. However, additional research is needed on factors that affect the strength or direction of response alterations in relation to depression-risk in youth. In particular, facial orientation and gaze direction may alter personal relevance, with emotions directed towards an individual heightening motivational salience, compared to emotions directed away. Methods: Mother-daughter dyads (N = 56) were recruited based on presence or absence of maternal depression history and absence of youth depression. In line with theoretical perspectives suggesting diminished sensitivity to emotional context in relation to depression risk, we examined three Event-Related Potential (ERP) components in relation to forward versus averted emotional faces in a sample of girls with and without a maternal history of depression: the N200, N400, and Late Positive Potential (LPP). Results: Results showed a significant maternal depression history by face-orientation effect. Low-risk girls exhibited more negative N200 and N400 amplitudes for straight (M = - 3.72, SE = 0.83; M = - 3.57, SE = 0.86) versus averted (M = - 2.15, SE = 0.76; M = -1.68, SE = 0.81) faces, while girls of mothers with histories of depression showed undifferentiated N200 or N400 responses in relation to face orientation. For LPP amplitudes, low-risk girls exhibited significantly more positive LPP amplitudes than high-risk girls, but only for averted faces (M = 0.69, SE = 0.59 and M = - 2.63, SE = 0.74, respectively). Limitations: Cross-sectional design and limited sample. Conclusions: Results indicate that familial depression risk is associated with altered responsivity to face-orientation, these were interpreted as representing differential sensitivity to the personal-relevance of emotional stimuli.

An open question for researchers is how sensitive the results of EEG analyses are to variations in preprocessing methods and parameters. To address this issue, we analyze the effect of preprocessing methods on downstream EEG analysis using several simple signal and event-related measures. Signal measures include recording-level channel amplitudes, study-level channel amplitude dispersion, and recording spectral characteristics. Event-related methods include ERPs and ERSPs and their correlations across methods for a diverse set of stimulus events. Our analysis also assesses differences in residual signals both in the time and spectral domains after blink artifacts have been removed. Using fully automated pipelines, we evaluate these measures across 17 EEG studies for two ICA-based preprocessing approaches (LARG, MARA) plus two variations of Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR). Although the general structure of the results is similar across these preprocessing methods, there are significant differences, particularly in the low-frequency spectral features and in the residuals left by blinks. These results argue for detailed reporting of processing details as suggested by most guidelines, but also for using a federation of automated processing pipelines and comparison tools to quantify effects of processing choices as part of the research reporting.

We investigated this framework in the context of two-alternative forced-choice tasks on linguistic stimuli, words and pseudowords. In two experiments, we assessed the impact of lexical frequency and action semantics on two effector-selective EEG indexes of motor-response activation: the lateralized readiness potential and the lateralization of beta-frequency power. This allowed us to track potentially continuous streams of processing progressively mapping the evaluation of linguistic stimuli onto corresponding response channels. Whereas action semantics showed no influence on EEG indexes of motor-response activation, lexical frequency affected the lateralization of response-locked beta-frequency power. We argue that these observations point toward a continuity between linguistic processing of word input stimuli and implementation of corresponding choice in terms of motor behavior. This interpretation challenges the commonly held assumption of a discrete processing distinction between decisional and motor-response processes in the context of decisions based on symbolic stimuli.

Enrolled in our study were 26 patients diagnosed with SAD and 26 healthy volunteers. They were administered the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), Reading Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), and Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. EEG monitoring was performed for electrophsiologic investigation. In the patient group, total reading the mind scores were lower (P = .027) while P300 latencies and emotion recognition latency during the Emotion Recognition Task (ERT) were longer (P = .038 and P = .012, respectively). The false alarm scores in the Rapid Visual Information Processing Task (RVP) were higher in the patient group (P = .038). In a model created using multivariate linear regression analysis, an effect of ERT and RVP scores on LSAS scores was found. Results of our study confirm that particularly impairment of cognitive functions such as sustained attention and emotion recognition may seriously affect the clinical presentation negatively. P300 latency in the parietal region may has the potential to be a biological marker that can be used in monitoring treatment.

We wanted to delineate neurodevelopmental changes in adult ADHD using an electrophysiological measure, the fronto-central NoGo P3 event-related potential (ERP), which is an important neurophysiological index of brain functioning in ADHD, and biomarker for response inhibition and aging. ERPs were obtained from 45 ADHD and 41 healthy subjects using a 128-channel BioSemi recording-system, applying emotionally-valenced and neutral stimuli in a response inhibition task. Our results indicated that ADHD subjects manifested delayed developmental P3-trajectory in young-adulthood as compared to controls; they also showed P3 reduction across all emotional valences, and the reduction was most pronounced at younger ages. The differences in P3 diminished by mid-adulthood, and started to increase again at more advanced ages. Thus, similar to structural-MRI indices, developmental brain differences in the fronto-central NoGo P3 in ADHD largely normalize in young-adulthood. However, a reduction of P3 occurs again starting from mid-adulthood. As the fronto-central NoGo P3 reflects the functioning of the frontal areas (which show delayed maturation in ADHD), our findings are consistent with the "last in, first out'' hypothesis, which refers to a mirroring pattern of brain development and aging, and posits that brain regions that develop relatively late degenerate relatively early with age. Thus, ADHD may not only be associated with delayed neurodevelopment, but also with a premature age-related deterioration, at least in some measures of electrophysiological functioning.

The present study tested the hypothesis that task switching is subject to higher-level "metacontrol" regulation that is reflected, for example, in contextual influences on switching efficiency. such as the global probability of task switches. 'this hypothesis was tested in 5 experiments using an instruction manipulation to dissociate expectancy-based control from experience-based practice effects: Participants' beliefs about switch probability were manipulated across trial sequences via explicit instruction, while objective frequency was matched for a subset of sequences. The behavioral results of Experiments 1-3 indicated that instruction played a role above experience in modulating task switching efficiency, and that this effect was motivation-dependent. Experiment 4 used electroencephalogram (EEG) methods to characterize the mechanism by which instructions affected processing via established event-related potential and oscillatory markers of task preparation. Experiment 5 demonstrated that the influence of instructions extended to participants' voluntary task choices. Collectively, the present findings demonstrate that instruction-induced expectancy prompts the adoption of distinct metacontrol modes across sequences. but does not modulate trial-by-trial, task-specific motor preparation.

Two main threads of thought guided Basar's scientific labor: i) the study of brain oscillations and ii) its marriage to basic principles of physics. These two threads provided him with the crucial element to introduce nonlinear random theory into brain research. Until the decade of the seventies, the underling paradigm in studying the electrical activity of the brain was dominated by a simplistic linear systems model that entailed absolute separation between a determinist evoked responses to stimuli and a superimposed background electrical activity considered as "noise". Basar questioned this simplistic linear model and its interpretation. Basar underscored the nonlinear dynamics of the brain, demonstrated for the first time the interaction between evoked and background activity, and widened the study of event-related activity from the time domain to the frequency and time-frequency domain, heralding a new understanding of the event-related dynamics. These advances were a consequence of Basar's fascination with the physics and mathematics of dynamical physical systems which he rightly believed to be the key to understanding the brain. Here we carry out a selected review, based on a scientometric analysis of Basar's scientific trajectory in the field of Brain Dynamics as embodied in 278 peer-reviewed papers. We also report the geographical distribution of Basar's collaborators, distribution of his citations, and his interaction with many international groups. This analysis illustrates the importance of his innovative contributions and the impact it had on our field. It underscores that he is one of the initiators of a "scientific revolution" in neurophysiology: from linear systems to random non-linear systems analysis and the new vision of the brain as a dynamical system.

To better understand how these warning signs prompted hazard, this study investigated the intrinsic mechanism of hazard perception of warning signs, including warning words (low versus high hazard levels) and surrounding shapes (upright triangle versus circle). We recruited 18 participants and recorded electroencephalogram (EEG). We found that a combination of high-hazard-level words and an upright triangle shape significantly elicited more negative N300 and increased theta-band (3-8 Hz) synchronization, but reduced beta-band (15-30 Hz) desynchronization. The N300 component represented the emotional arousal strength, theta oscillations reflected the engagement of retrieval of emotional experiences from episodic memory, and beta oscillation connoted the semantic encoding. Thus, these findings suggested that a high-hazard-level combination had the ability to obtain high priority in cognitive processing. The EEG pattern changes allowed us to assess whether the hazard perception of warning signs was high or low, which could be an accurate indicator to better evaluate the design of warning signs.

J	Cohen, MA; Ortego, K; Kyroudis, A; Pitts, M				Cohen, Michael A.; Ortego, Kevin; Kyroudis, Andrew; Pitts, Michael			Distinguishing the Neural Correlates of Perceptual Awareness and Postperceptual Processing	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention; awareness; consciousness; EEG; perception; vision	VISUAL AWARENESS; CONSCIOUSNESS; ACCESS; NEUROSCIENCE; MASKING; P300	To identify the neural correlates of perceptual awareness, researchers often compare the differences in neural activation between conditions in which an observer is or is not aware of a stimulus. While intuitive, this approach often contains a critical limitation: to link brain activity with perceptual awareness, observers traditionally report the contents of their perceptual experience. However, relying on observers' reports is problematic because it is difficult to know whether the neural responses being measured are associated with conscious perception or with postperceptual processes involved in the reporting task (e.g., working memory, decision-making). To address this issue, we combined a standard visual masking paradigm with a recently developed "no-report" paradigm in male/female human participants. In the visual masking paradigm, observers saw images of animals and objects that were visible or invisible, depending on their proximity to masks. Meanwhile, on half of the trials, observers reported the contents of their perceptual experience (i.e., report condition), while on the other half of trials they refrained from reporting about their experiences (i.e., no-report condition). We used electroencephalography to examine how visibility interacts with reporting by measuring the P3b event-related potential, one of the proposed canonical "signatures" of conscious processing. Overall, we found a robust P3b in the report condition, but no P3b whatsoever in the no-report condition. This finding suggests that the P3b itself is not a neural signature of conscious processing and highlights the importance of carefully distinguishing the neural correlates of perceptual awareness from postperceptual processing.

Decoding Categorical Speech Perception from Evoked Brain Responses	2020 IEEE REGION 10 SYMPOSIUM (TENSYMP) - TECHNOLOGY FOR IMPACTFUL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT	IEEE Region 10 Symposium		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE-Region-10 Symposium (TENSYMP) - Technology for Impactful Sustainable Development	JUN 05-07, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE Reg 10, IEEE Bangladesh Sect		EEG; categorical perception (CP); event-related potentials (ERPs); reaction time; latency; support vector machine (SVM)	NEURAL ORGANIZATION; CORTEX	Categorical perception (CP) is important to understand how fast and accurately speech sounds are invariantly perceived by humans despite widespread variability in their physical acoustic properties. In this work, we built a framework to understand the temporal (when in time) characteristics of speech evoked responses that differentiate prototypical vowels (true phonetic categories) from ambiguous ones (lacking a clear phonetic identity). We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) from in young, healthy adults as they rapidly classified speech sounds along an acoustic-phonetic continuum. Source derived response features were submitted to support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Whole-brain data provided the best decoding of prototypical from ambiguous speech with an accuracy of 95.16% [area under the curve (AUC) 95.14%; F1-score 95.00%] at 120 ms. Separate analyses using left hemisphere (LH) and right hemisphere (RH) data showed that LH activity was a better predictor of speech categorization as compared to RH (89.03% vs. 86.45% accuracy). Notably, CP was decoded less robustly and later in time using hemisphere-specific data compared to whole-brain data. Our results are consistent with notions that the early ERPs (e.g., P2) are sensitive to CP and the general dominance of LH in auditory-linguistic processing.

Prior research has shown that Event-Related-Potentials (ERPs) are specifically modulated by the observation of action mistakes interfering with goal achievement. However, in complex and modular actions, embedded motor errors do not necessarily produce an immediate effect on the global goal. Here we dissociate embedded motor goals from global action goals by asking subjects to observe familiar but untrained knotting actions. During knotting an embedded motor error (i.e. the rope is inserted top-down instead of bottom-up during the formation of a loop) while not producing any immediate mistake, may strongly affect the final result. We found that embedded errors elicit in the observer specific early fronto-central negativity (120-180 ms). In a second experiment, we online administered exicitatory transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over central (C3) or occipital (Oz) scalp locations, at the timing of the ERP components observed in the first experiment. C3 stimulation produced a significant improvement in embedded error discrimination performance. These results show that sensorimotor areas are instrumental in the early detection of embedded motor errors. We conclude that others' embedded errors provide fundamental cues which, inserted within a complex hierarchical action plan, might be used by the observer to anticipate whether an action will eventually fail.

With an extension of implantation candidacy, today many CI listeners use a hearing aid on their contralateral ear, referred to as bimodal listening. It is uncertain, however, whether the brains of bimodal listeners can combine the electrical and acoustical sound information and how much CI experience is needed to achieve an improved performance with bimodal listening. Patients with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss undergoing implant surgery were tested in their ability to understand speech in quiet and in noise, before and again 3 and 6 months after provision of a CI. Results of these bimodal listeners were compared to age-matched, normal hearing controls (NH). The benefit of adding a contralateral hearing aid was calculated in terms of head shadow, binaural summation, binaural squelch, and spatial release from masking from the results of a sentence recognition test. Beyond that, bimodal benefit was estimated from the difference in amplitudes and latencies of the N1, P2, and N2 potentials of the brains' auditory evoked response (AEP) toward speech. Data of fifteen participants contributed to the results. CI provision resulted in significant improvement of speech recognition with the CI ear, and in taking advantage of the head shadow effect for understanding speech in noise. Some amount of binaural processing was suggested by a positive binaural summation effect 6 month post-implantation that correlated significantly with symmetry of pure tone thresholds. Moreover, a significant negative correlation existed between binaural summation and latency of the P2 potential. With CI experience, morphology of the N1 and P2 potentials in the AEP response approximated that of NH, whereas, N2 remained different. Significant AEP differences between monaural and binaural processing were shown for NH and for bimodal listeners 6 month post-implantation. Although the grand-averaged difference in N1 amplitude between monaural and binaural listening was similar for NH and the bimodal group, source localization showed group-dependent differences in auditory and speech-relevant cortex, suggesting different processing in the bimodal listeners.

While behavioral assessment remains the gold standard to determine conscious state, EEG has proven to be a promising complementary tool to monitor the effect of new therapeutics. Encouraging results have been obtained with invasive electrical stimulation of the brain, and recent studies identified transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as an effective approach in randomized controlled trials. This non-invasive and inexpensive tool may turn out to be the preferred treatment option. However, its mechanisms of action and physiological effects on brain activity remain unclear and debated. Here, we stimulated 60 DoC patients with the anode placed over left-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in a prospective open-label study. Clinical behavioral assessment improved in twelve patients (20%) and none deteriorated. This behavioral response after tDCS coincided with an enhancement of putative EEG markers of consciousness: in comparison with non-responders, responders showed increases of power and long-range cortico-cortical functional connectivity in the theta-alpha band, and a larger and more sustained P300 suggesting improved conscious access to auditory novelty. The EEG changes correlated with electric fields strengths in prefrontal cortices, and no correlation was found on the scalp. Taken together, this prospective intervention in a large cohort of DoC patients strengthens the validity of the proposed EEG signatures of consciousness, and is suggestive of a direct causal effect of tDCS on consciousness.

Does aerobic fitness moderate age-related cognitive slowing? Evidence from the P3 and lateralized readiness potentials	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Aging; Exercise; Cognition; Event-related potentials; Aerobic fitness	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EXECUTIVE CONTROL; OLDER-ADULTS; BRAIN; EXERCISE; EEG; QUESTIONNAIRE; PROGRAM; DECLINE	Reaction time (RT) slowing occurs among older adults, although it remains unclear whether general or specific aspects of information-processing are implicated in this phenomenon. Aerobic fitness moderates age-related RT slowing, although it is unknown whether fitness benefits earlier versus later stages of information-processing. To test these hypotheses, 40 younger and 43 older adults classified by level of aerobic fitness were tested using a visual oddball paradigm to assess behavioral measures of RT and accuracy along with the P3 wave and lateralized readiness potential (LRP) to index stimulus categorization and response selection and execution processes, respectively. Older adults had slower RT, decreased P3 amplitude, and increased P3 latency and LRP amplitude, suggestive of generalized age-related cognitive slowing decline. While aerobic fitness was significantly correlated with median RT and P3 latency across the entire sample, these correlations did not persist when adjusting for age. Subsequent moderation analysis also failed to support an influence of aerobic fitness on any of the cognitive outcomes. These findings indicate that, at least in simple discrimination tasks, aging is associated with slower processing that occurs proximal to stimulus categorization and extends to motor response and execution processing. These age-related deficits, however, are not moderated by aerobic fitness.	[Brush, C.

However, because of the long transitional periods involved, the internal dynamics of such changes are typically inaccessible. Here, we present a new approach to examining language change via its connection to language comprehension. By means of an EEG experiment on Icelandic, a prominent current example of a language in transition, we show that the neurophysiological responses of native speakers already reflect projected changes that are not yet apparent in their overt behavior. Neurocognitive measures thus offer a means of predicting, rather than only retracing, language change.

In present study the habituation to standard tones following deviants and the auditory discriminative processes were examined in two conditions: electronic and human sounds, in a sample of 16 ASD children. ASD children presented a reduced habituation in the P1 component and a decrease in the amplitude of the mismatch negativity indicating a lower auditory discrimination with respect to controls. MMN amplitude was related to sensory sensitivity. Results suggest an increased activation to repeatedly auditory stimulus and a poor auditory discrimination, for both: electronic and human sounds with consequences on the impaired sensory behavior of ASD subjects.

J	Zhang, Q; Deng, NL; Jiang, XM; Li, WJ				Zhang Qi; Deng Nali; Jiang Xiumin; Li Weijun			The time course of self-relevance affecting emotional word processing	ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						emotional words; self-relevance; EPN; LPP	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SUBJECTS OWN NAME; NEURAL MECHANISMS; ATTENTION; ERP; ADJECTIVES; IMPLICIT; RESPONSES; YOURSELF; LANGUAGE	In successful social interactions, distinguishing between our own and another person's emotions is important. For individuals, both self-related information (such as self-name) and emotional stimuli with high sociality or adaptive meaning can automatically capture one's attention, leading to prior and deep processing. Previous studies have confirmed that self-relevance can affect the processing of emotional words. However, there is currently no research using name as a self-relevance clue to investigate whether and how name influences the cognitive processing of emotional words. In the current study, we used names as self-relevance clues to explore the dynamic temporal characteristics of self-related information affecting emotional information and its integration mechanism. In this study, we used ERP technology and created a 3 (name type: self, friend, unknown) x 3 (emotion type: positive, neutral, negative) within-subjects design. A total of 21 college students (9 males, M-age = 20.4) participated in the experiment. Prior to the experiment, we gathered the participants' own names and their best friends' names, then we found a name that we confirmed was unfamiliar to all participants. All names included three characters. The experimental stimuli were 171 two-character words taken from the Chinese Affective Words System, which included 57 positive, 57 negative and 57 neutral words. The participants were asked to silently read the names (self-name, friend-name and unfamiliar name) and emotional words (positive, neutral and negative) presented in succession, unaware that the presented words were emotional words, while their EEG was recorded. The ERP results showed the following. (1) The main effect of the emotional words was significant in the early processing stage, and the negative words elicited larger EPN amplitudes (200-300 ms) than the positive and neutral words. (2) In the late processing stage, the emotional words were further processed. The negative words elicited reduced N400 (300-450 ms) compared to the neutral words, and they enhanced LPP compared with the neutral and positive words during 450-650 ms. (3) More importantly, a significant interaction between the names and emotional words was discovered in the LPP time window. The negative words paired with self-names elicited significantly more positive LPP than the neutral words paired with self-names, while the negative words paired with friend-names elicited significantly larger LPP than the positive words and neutral words paired with friend-names. Nevertheless, no significant difference was found among the LPP amplitudes elicited by the three kinds of emotional words paired with unknown names. Overall, our study demonstrates that there is a processing advantage for negative words in different stages, and self-relevance contained in a name can affect the cognitive processing of emotional words, which mainly occurs in the late stage of emotional lexical processing. Importantly, it seems that individuals first filter information according to whether it is self-related and then process the emotional content (especially negative stimuli) related to themselves or their friends more deeply and elaborately. The negative bias can be explained by the fact that negative stimuli are considered to carry greater informational value than positive stimuli. Therefore, negative stimuli automatically capture more attention and cognitive resources than neutral and positive stimuli, resulting in higher order coding.

Evaluating the Mental Workload During Robot-Assisted Surgery Utilizing Network Flexibility of Human Brain	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Robot-assisted surgery; mental workload; brain functional network; convolutional neural network	DYNAMIC RECONFIGURATION; EEG-ALPHA; SKILLS; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; COGNITION; INDEXES	Mental Workload (MWL) is traditionally evaluated by psychophysiological signals using spectral analysis and event-related potentials. Robot-assisted Surgery (RAS) is a complex task that involves human-robot interaction, multitasking, quick and appropriate reactions to various stimuli and unforeseen circumstances, as well as frequent switches between surgical subtasks. There is a lack of standardized methodology for objectively monitoring a surgeon's MWL during RAS. In this study, we propose an innovative framework, using dynamic functional brain network measurements and a deep convolutional neural network, to assess MWL. A model was developed and validated using Electroencephalogram (EEG) data from 22 trainees who performed basic surgical tasks, as well as four surgical fellows and an expert surgeon who carried out cystectomies and prostatectomies. The resulting accuracies of the MWL classification into low, intermediate and high were 93%, 89%, and 91% respectively. The proposed method can be used for continually monitoring mental workload levels in an objective fashion.

The decoding of ErrP has the potential to apply for Brain Computer System (BCI). Although various methods have been applied to the decoding of ErrPs, existing classification methods have room for improvement. Using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is a viable approach to ErrP classification but its performance can be compromised by insufficient training data being available. Using a form of generative adversarial network (GAN) enables data augmentation, which has offered significant performance improvement in a variety of fields such as signal processing, robotics, and unmanned vehicles. We therefore propose a novel approach to ErrP classification that combines GAN with DCNN to form a data-augmented DCNN. The proposed method has two main components: a GAN that offers data augmentation and a DCNN that performs the classification. We applied our method to the BNCI2020 dataset 22: Monitoring ErrPs, evaluating the results in terms of classification accuracy in various categories, including single-subject single-session, cross-subject single session, cross-session single-subject, and cross-subject cross-session versions for the entire dataset. The evaluations showed that the classification results had been improved comprehensively in comparison with existing published results. The maximum accuracy of the classification performance for the entire dataset reached 87%, which is 3% above the previous best result.

However, it has not been established whether the association between reward-related brain activity and risk-taking varies across adolescence. The present study investigated how neural reward sensitivity is associated with laboratory risk -taking in a sample of female adolescents as a function of age. Sixty-three female adolescents ages 10-19 completed the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, a laboratory measure of risk-taking behavior, as well as a forced choice monetary gambling task while an electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. This gambling task elicits the reward positivity (RewP), a frontocentral event-related potential component that is sensitive to feedback signaling reward. We observed a negative quadratic association between age and risk-taking, such that those in early and late adolescence had lower relative risk-taking compared to mid-adolescence, with risk-taking peaking at around 15 years of age. In predicting risk-taking, we observed an interaction between age and RewP, such that reward-related brain activity was not associated with risk-taking in early adolescence but was associated with a greater propensity for risk in later adolescence. These findings suggest that for females, neural response to rewards is an important factor in predicting risk-taking only in later adolescence.

To test whether this effect is selective to faces, we recorded scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) in 4-month-old infants presented with variable exemplars of a nonface visual category - cars - appearing every 6 stimuli in 6-Hz streams of natural object images. At the same time, infants were exposed to the maternal or to a control odor context. A relatively weak neural categorization response to cars (i.e., a differential response to cars that generalizes across exemplars) was observed at 1 Hz over the right occipital cortex in both odor conditions, revealing rapid categorization of an unfamiliar object in the infant brain. However, the car categorization response was not modulated by maternal odor, suggesting that odors selectively prime neural activity in the infant visual cortex to categorize congruent incoming inputs.

There is undoubtedly basal ganglia involvement, which are also important for cognitive processes including performance monitoring and interference resolution. We investigated these functions in adult patients with GTS compared to healthy controls (HCs). Methods: We compared a group of N = 23 adult patients with GTS to N = 27 HC on a flanker task during an EEG recording. Reaction times and error rates were recorded, as well as N2 and N-e/ERN amplitudes. The N2 is an index of interference resolution. The N-e/ERN is a negative fronto-central component, occurring when participants make mistakes. Results: Patients' reaction times were enhanced on incongruent trials compared to HC. Electrophysiological data revealed more frontal components, as well as significantly increased N-e/ERN amplitudes in patients with GTS compared to HC (p = 0.026). Conclusions: Altered electrophysiological correlates of error processing in adult patients with GTS compared to HC cannot be attributed to differential error probabilities. Potentially, patients recruit compensatory resources from frontal networks to maintain behavioural performance. Significance: This study gives further insight into cognitive deficits of patients with GTS, and the underlying neural processes of these functions.

Participants performed a visual temporal bisection task along with high-level and low-level arousing auditory stimuli, while we simultaneously recorded EEG. In accordance with previous studies, arousing stimuli were temporally overestimated and led to higher EPN amplitude. Yet, we observed that time dilation and EPN amplitude were significantly correlated and this effect cannot be explained by confounds from stimulus valence. We interpret our findings in terms of the pacemaker-accumulator model of human timing, and suggest that EPN indicates an arousal-based increasing of the speed of our mental clock.

Our previous study using a virtual object selection task demonstrated an impact of the level of avatar realism on the PEN, reflecting a mismatch between visual and proprioceptive feedback about the object selection. To investigate the role of temporal integration of different sensory information on the PEN, this article investigated the impact of task completion times on the PEN amplitude, using the same virtual object selection task. Trials from each participant were divided into slow trials and fast trials based on the task completion time, and their associated PEN amplitudes were separately aggregated and analyzed. The result shows that PEN amplitudes are significantly more pronounced in slow trials than in fast trials. This finding suggests that task completion times modulate the PEN amplitude-a long task completion time allowed for a better integration of information from both visual and proprioceptive systems as the basis to detect a mismatch between the expected hand trajectory during a reaching motion and the perceived visual feedback in the virtual environment.

In this paper, we consider a screen-free Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), where the robot highlights candidate objects in the environment using a laser pointer, and the user goal is decoded from the evoked responses in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Having the robot present stimuli in the environment allows for more direct commands than traditional BCIs that require the use of graphical user interfaces. Yet bypassing a screen entails less control over stimulus appearances. In realistic environments, this leads to heterogeneous brain responses for dissimilar objects-posing a challenge for reliable EEG classification. We model object instances as subclasses to train specialized classifiers in the Riemannian tangent space, each of which is regularized by incorporating data from other objects. In multiple experiments with a total of 19 healthy participants, we show that our approach not only increases classification performance but is also robust to both heterogeneous and homogeneous objects. While especially useful in the case of a screen-free BCI, our approach can naturally be applied to other experimental paradigms with potential subclass structure.

However, what would it be if lies come from in-group members compared with that from out-group members? In the current Electroencephalography (EEG) study, we recruited thirty-six participants to play a modified estimator and advisor game to investigate the mental and neural processes to lies and truth conveyed by in-group and out-group members. At the behavioral level, lies are less morally acceptable, arose less positive emotion, and made participants distribute less money to the advisor in a dictator game. Meanwhile, participants liked the in-group university more than the out-group university and they thought they were more similar to in-group members than to out-group members. However, there were no significant interactions of group type (i.e., in-group and out-group) and message type (i.e., lies and truth) in the aforementioned behavioral assessments. At the neural level, significant interaction effects were found in the parietal N1 and P3 amplitude. More importantly, no significant N1 and P3 amplitude differences between in-group lies and truth were found, while outgroup lies elicited larger P3 amplitude than outgroup truth and out-group truth elicited larger N1 amplitude than outgroup lies. What's more, P3 amplitude differences between lies vs. truth positively correlated with fairness scores only in the in-group condition but not in the out-group condition. Current study showed that the P3 component was sensitive in capturing subtle differences when participants were processing different types of lies and truth that could not be captured by behavioral measurements. Besides, the fairness trait modulated the in-group bias related P3 patterns. The current study provides insight into the neurobiological mechanism underlying the mental process of in-group and out-group lies and truth, and suggests individuals' tendency of general in-group favoritism and out-group discrimination toward moral behaviors.

Studies using averaged neurophysiological signals (e.g., event-related potentials) have shown varying degree of expertise-related differences in neural activity. As a result, the precise mechanisms underlying these differences remain to be described. Here we used multiscale entropy analysis (MSE) to investigate whether the complexity of underlying neural systems working in a wide-range time scales can better explain the cognitive characteristics of athletes with different domains of expertise. Behavioral and electroencephalograms (EEG) measures of athletes practicing an interceptive sport (badminton; n = 17) or a static sport (long-distance running; n = 17) were assessed during a flanker task with varying degrees of response conflict. The interceptive sport players showed superior behavioral performance overall on the task relative to the static sport players. Although both groups exhibited greater sample entropy across most time scales in high-conflict relative to low-conflict trials over the parietal site, this effect was only evident at coarser time scales over the midfrontal site for the interceptive sport players. Together, our results suggest that individual differences in motor expertise may be associated with difference in information-processing capacity and information integration during cognitive processing, as demonstrated by differential cognitive modulation of brain signal variability.

Specifically, the present research wanted to explore if gift exchange, increased emotional sharing, gratitude and interpersonal cooperation, leading to an improvement in cognitive and behavioral performance. In this regard, neural connectivity and cognitive performance of 14 pairs of friends were recorded during the development of a joint attention task that involved a gift exchange at the beginning or halfway through the task. The moment of gift exchange was randomized within the pairs: for seven couples, it happened at task beginning, for the remaining seven later. Individuals' simultaneous brain activity was recorded through the use of two electroencephalograms (EEG) systems that were used in hyperscanning. Results The results showed that after gift exchange there was an improvement in behavioral performance in terms of accuracy. For what concerns EEG, instead, an increase of delta and theta activation was observed in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) when gift exchange occurred at the beginning of the task. Furthermore, an increase in neural connectivity for delta and theta bands was observed. Conclusion The present research provides a significant contribution to the exploration of the factors contributing to the strengthening of social bonds, increasing cooperation, gratitude and prosocial behavior.

Nonspatial Features Reduce the Reliance on Sustained Spatial Auditory Attention	EAR AND HEARING			English	Article						Auditory attention; Auditory event-related potentials; Electroencephalography; Nonspatial attention; Parietal alpha oscillations; Spatial attention	SURFACE LAPLACIAN; DYNAMICS; MODULATION; MECHANISMS; CONTINUITY; COMPONENTS; RESPONSES; CORRELATE; SYSTEM	Objective: Top-down spatial attention is effective at selecting a target sound from a mixture. However, nonspatial features often distinguish sources in addition to location. This study explores whether redundant nonspatial features are used to maintain selective auditory attention for a spatially defined target. Design: We recorded electroencephalography while subjects focused attention on one of three simultaneous melodies. In one experiment, subjects (n = 17) were given an auditory cue indicating both the location and pitch of the target melody. In a second experiment (n = 17 subjects), the cue only indicated target location, and we compared two conditions: one in which the pitch separation of competing melodies was large, and one in which this separation was small. Results: In both experiments, responses evoked by onsets of events in sound streams were modulated by attention, and we found no significant difference in this modulation between small and large pitch separation conditions. Therefore, the evoked response reflected that target stimuli were the focus of attention, and distractors were suppressed successfully for all experimental conditions. In all cases, parietal alpha was lateralized following the cue, but before melody onset, indicating that subjects initially focused attention in space. During the stimulus presentation, this lateralization disappeared when pitch cues were strong but remained significant when pitch cues were weak, suggesting that strong pitch cues reduced reliance on sustained spatial attention. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that once a well-defined target stream at a known location is selected, top-down spatial attention plays a weak role in filtering out a segregated competing stream.

The analysis corpus represents 1,155 recordings containing approximately 7.8 million event instances acquired under several different experimental paradigms. Such large-scale analysis is predicated on consistent data organization and event annotation as well as an effective automated preprocessing pipeline to transform raw EEG into a form suitable for comparative analysis. A key component of this analysis is the annotation of study-specific event codes using a common vocabulary to describe relevant event features. We demonstrate that Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED tags) capture statistically significant cognitive aspects of EEG events common across multiple recordings, subjects, studies, paradigms, headset configurations, and experimental sites. We use representational similarity analysis (RSA) to show that EEG responses annotated with the same cognitive aspect are significantly more similar than those that do not share that cognitive aspect. These RSA similarity results are supported by visualizations that exploit the non-linear similarities of these associations. We apply temporal overlap regression, reducing confounds caused by adjacent event instances, to extract time and time-frequency EEG features (regressed ERPs and ERSPs) that are comparable across studies and replicate findings from prior, individual studies. Likewise, we use second-level linear regression to separate effects of different cognitive aspects on these features across all studies. This work demonstrates that EEG mega-analysis (pooling of raw data across studies) can enable investigations of brain dynamics in a more generalized fashion than single studies afford. A companion paper complements this event-based analysis by addressing commonality of the time and frequency statistical properties of EEG across studies at the channel and dipole level.

For each subject, the data contained two groups ("A" and "B"). Each group contained two blocks, and each block included 40 trials that corresponded to 40 stimulus sequences. Each sequence contained 100 images presented at 10 Hz (10 images per second). The stimulus images were street-view images of two categories: target images with human and non-target images without human. Target images were presented randomly in the stimulus sequence with a probability of 1 similar to 4%. During the stimulus presentation, subjects were asked to search for the target images and ignore the non-target images in a subjective manner. To keep all original information, the dataset was the raw continuous data without any processing. On one hand, the dataset can be used as a benchmark dataset to compare the algorithms for target identification in RSVP-based BCIs. On the other hand, the dataset can be used to design new system diagrams and evaluate their BCI performance without collecting any new data through offline simulation. Furthermore, the dataset also provides high-quality data for characterizing and modeling event-related potentials (ERPs) and steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) in RSVP-based BCIs.

J	Sun, Y; Lv, JJ; Lan, F; Zhang, LN				Sun Yan; Lv Jiaojiao; Lan Fan; Zhang Lina			Emotion regulation strategy of self-focused and situation-focused reappraisal and their impact on subsequent cognitive control	ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						emotion regulation; self-focused and situation-focused reappraisal; cognitive control; event-related potential	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NUMERICAL STROOP TASK; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; POSITIVE REAPPRAISAL; NEGATIVE EMOTIONS; TIME-COURSE; CONFLICT; MEMORY; P300; CONSEQUENCES	It is important to explore the relationship between emotional regulation and cognitive control for a better understanding of diseases involving emotional control failure. Cognitive reappraisal is the most effective and commonly used emotional regulation strategy to improve individual emotional state. Will it consume cognitive resources needed for subsequent cognitive control tasks? The results of previous studies on this issue are not consistent. The reason may be that previous studies treated reappraisal as a single strategy, and did not distinguish sub-types of reappraisal to explore this issue. Reappraisal can be divided into self-focused and situation-focused reappraisal. According to previous studies, this two reappraisal strategies may have different effects on subsequent cognitive control tasks. However, there is no direct experimental comparison of this issue has been explored. In this study, self-focused reappraisal (n = 23) and situation-focused reappraisal (n = 26) were used to investigate whether attempts to increase or decrease negative emotions had different effects on subsequent cognitive control tasks. All participants completed a cross-combination paradigm of cognitive reappraisal and Stroop task. Event-related potential (ERP) was used to assess the effectiveness of the regulated emotion (late positive potential, LPP) during the reappraisal phase, as well as to assess the cognitive resource (P300) and cognitive control (sustained potential: SP) during the Stroop task. The results showed that both reappraisal strategies could effectively regulate emotion at the level of subjective reporting. In addition, on the level of arousal, increase negative > view negative > decrease negative > watch neutral, as opposite to the valence rating. Furthermore, EEG results of the reappraisal stage showed that self-focused reappraisal will trigger larger LPP amplitude than situation-focused reappraisal whether it increases or decreases negative emotions. This proved that situation-focused reappraisal was more effective than self-focused reappraisal when negative emotions decreased. On the contrary, self-focused reappraisal Emotions was more effective than situation-focused reappraisal when negative emotions increased. Compared with the three emotional regulation conditions that appear in negative stimulus pictures, the interference scores of accuracy rate for viewing neutral picture conditions were significantly greater. While, compared with the other three emotional regulation conditions, the P300 interference score of increases negative emotional conditions was significantly smaller. The result of situation-focused reappraisal inconsistent condition SP amplitude minus the consistent condition difference was higher than the self-focused reappraisal. It could be considered the SP amplitude interference score of situation-focused reappraisal was more positive than that of self-focused reappraisal. In conclusion, the results of this study indicated that (1) self-focused reappraisal and situation-focused reappraisal can effectively regulate emotions, while the regulate effects were different; (2) compared to neutral stimuli, negative stimuli trigger higher levels of negative emotions and subsequent poorer cognitive control of conflicting tasks from a behavioral perspective; (3) compared with watching and reducing negative emotions, increasing negative emotions may further deplete the available cognitive resources for subsequent tasks at the level of neural mechanisms. Furthermore, situational focus reappraisal had a greater impact on cognitive control of subsequent conflict tasks after decreasing negative emotions than self-focus reappraisal.

We systematically varied color and luminance contrast using a visual search task for a higher contrast target to assess the degree to which the salience-computing attentional mechanisms are constrained by low-level visual inputs. In our first experiment, stimuli were defined by contrast that isolated chromatic or luminance mechanisms. In our second experiment, targets were defined by contrasts that isolated or combined achromatic and chromatic mechanisms. In both experiments, event-related potential waveforms contralateral and ipsilateral to the target were qualitatively different for chromatic-compared to luminance-defined stimuli. The same was true of the difference waves computed from these waveforms, with isoluminant stimuli eliciting a mid-latency posterior contralateral negativity (PCN) component and achromatic stimuli eliciting a complex of multiple components, including an early posterior contralateral positivity followed by a late-latency PCN. Combining color with luminance resulted in waveform and difference wave patterns equivalent to those of achromatic stimuli. When large levels of chromaticity contrast were added to targets with small levels of luminance contrast, PCN latency was speeded. In conclusion, the mechanisms underlying attentional salience are constrained by the low-level inputs they receive. Furthermore, speeded PCN latencies for stimuli that combine color and luminance signals compared to stimuli that contain luminance alone demonstrate that color and luminance channels are integrated during pre-attentive visual processing, before top-down allocation of attention is triggered.

Here, we asked how L2 speakers learn to process syntactic constructions that are in direct conflict between L1 and L2, in comparison to structures without such a conflict. To do so, we measured EEG during sentence reading in three groups of German learners of Dutch with different degrees of L2 experience (from 3 to more than 18 months of L2 immersion) as well as a control group of Dutch native speakers. They read grammatical and ungrammatical Dutch sentences that, in the conflict condition, contained a structure with opposing word orders in Dutch and German (sentence-final double infinitives) and, in the no-conflict condition, a structure for which word order is identical in Dutch and German (subordinate clause inversion). Results showed, first, that beginning learners showed N400-like signatures instead of the expected P600 for both types of violations, suggesting that, in the very early stages of learning, different neurocognitive processes are employed compared with native speakers, regardless of L1-L2 similarity. In contrast, both advanced and intermediate learners already showed native-like P600 signatures for the no-conflict sentences. However, their P600 signatures were significantly delayed in processing the conflicting structure, even though behavioral performance was on a native level for both these groups and structures. These findings suggest that L1-L2 word order conflicts clearly remain an obstacle to native-like processing, even for advanced L2 learners.

Validation of SOBI-DANS method for automatic identification of horizontal and vertical eye movement components from EEG	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						event&#8208; related potentials (ERPs); eye&#8208; tracking; natural viewing; ocular artifact; saccadic eye movement	BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; INDEPENDENT COMPONENTS; ARTIFACT REMOVAL; OCULAR ARTIFACT; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; SIGNALS; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; SUPPRESSION; EXTRACTION	Neurophysiological investigation of neural processes are hindered by the presence of large artifacts associated with eye movement. Although blind source separation (BSS)-based hybrid algorithms are useful for separating, identifying, and removing these artifacts from EEG, it remains unexamined to what extent neural signals can remain mixed with these artifact components, potentially resulting in unintended removal of critical neural signals. Here, we present a novel validation approach to quantitatively evaluate to what extent horizontal and vertical saccadic eye movement-related artifact components (H and V Comps) are indeed ocular in origin. To automate the identification of the H and V Comps recovered by the second-order blind identification (SOBI), we introduced a novel Discriminant ANd Similarity (DANS)-based method. Through source localization, we showed that over 95% of variance in the SOBI-DANS identified H and V Comps' scalp projections were ocular in origin. Through the analysis of saccade-related potentials (SRPs), we found that the H and V Comps' SRP amplitudes were finely modulated by eye movement direction and distance jointly. SOBI-DANS' component selection was in 100% agreement with human experts' selection and was 100% successful in component identification across all participants indicating a high cross-individual consistency or robustness. These results set the stage for future work to transform the to-be-thrown-away artifacts into signals indicative of gaze position, thereby providing readily co-registered eye movement and neural signal without using a separate eye tracker.

However, there is much less information on RPE in individuals at risk of alcohol misuse, prior to neurobiological adaptations that might result from sustained alcohol use. Here, participants (mean age 23.77 years, range 18-32 years) performed the electrophysiological monetary incentive delay task. This task involved responding to a target stimulus following reward incentive cues to win, or avoid losing, the cued reward while brain activity was recorded under 64-channel EEG. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) was used to quantify at-risk alcohol use, with high (n = 22, mean AUDIT score: 13.82) and low (n = 22, mean AUDIT score: 5.77) alcohol use groups. Trial-by-trial RPEs were estimated using a Rescorla-Wagner reinforcement model based on behavioral data. A single-trial analysis revealed that the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and feedback P3 (fb-P3) event-related potential components were significantly modulated by RPEs. There was increased RPE-related fb-P3 amplitude for those in the high alcohol use group. Next, the mean amplitude of ERPs elicited by positive and negative RPEs were compared between groups. We found that high alcohol use participants had attenuated FRN amplitude in contrast with low alcohol use participants for both positive and negative RPEs but enhanced fb-P3 for both positive and negative RPE. These results, with differences in RPE in an at-risk group, suggest that RPE a potential vulnerability marker for alcohol use disorder.

Ketamine improves short-term plasticity in depression by enhancing sensitivity to prediction errors	EUROPEAN NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						MMN; Depression; EEG; Dynamic causal modelling; Predictive coding	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; MODEL; DISORDER; METAANALYSIS; GENERATION; RESPONSES; BRAIN; NMDA; PHARMACOKINETICS; PHARMACODYNAMICS	Major depressive disorder negatively impacts the sensitivity and adaptability of the brain's predictive coding framework. The current electroencephalography study into the antidepressant properties of ketamine investigated the downstream effects of ketamine on predictive coding and short-term plasticity in thirty patients with depression using the auditory roving mismatch negativity (rMMN). The rMMN paradigm was run 3-4 h after a single 0.44 mg/kg intravenous dose of ketamine or active placebo (remifentanil infused to a target plasma concentration of 1.7 ng/mL) in order to measure the neural effects of ketamine in the period when an improvement in depressive symptoms emerges. Depression symptomatology was measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS); 70% of patients demonstrated at least a 50% reduction their MADRS global score. Ketamine significantly increased the MMN and P3a event related potentials, directly contrasting literature demonstrating ketamine's acute atten-uation of the MMN. This effect was only reliable when all repetitions of the post-deviant tone were used. Dynamic causal modelling showed greater modulation of forward connectivity in response to a deviant tone between right primary auditory cortex and right inferior temporal cortex, which significantly correlated with antidepressant response to ketamine at 24 h. This is consistent with the hypothesis that ketamine increases sensitivity to unexpected sensory input and restores deficits in sensitivity to prediction error that are hypothesised to underlie depres-sion. However, the lack of repetition suppression evident in the MMN evoked data compared to studies of healthy adults suggests that, at least within the short term, ketamine does not improve deficits in adaptive internal model calibration.

J	Forgacs, B				Forgacs, Balint			An Electrophysiological Abstractness Effect for Metaphorical Meaning Making	ENEURO			English	Article						concreteness effect; EEG; embodiment; figurative language; metaphor; novel language	ERP EVIDENCE; CONCEPTUAL INTEGRATION; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; MOTOR SYSTEM; LANGUAGE; BRAIN; CONCRETENESS; CONTEXT; ACCESS	Neuroimaging studies show that metaphors activate sensorimotor areas. These findings were interpreted as metaphors contributing to conceptual thought by mapping concrete, somatosensory information onto abstract ideas. But is sensorimotor information a necessary constituent of figurative meaning? The present study employed event-related potentials (ERPs) in a divided visual field paradigm with healthy adults to explore the role of sensorimotor feature processing in the comprehension of novel metaphors via the electrophysiological concreteness effect. Participants read French, novel adjective-noun expressions that were either metaphorical ("fat sentence") or literal ("fat hip"). While literal expressions evoked a typical concreteness effect, an enhanced frontal negativity during right hemisphere (RH) as opposed to left hemisphere (LH) presentation, metaphors showed no such sign of sensorimotor feature processing. Relative to literals, they evoked a sustained frontal negativity during LH presentation and similar amplitudes during RH presentation, but both of these effects were the greater the more abstract the metaphors were. It is the first time such an electrophysiological abstractness effect is reported, just the opposite of a concreteness effect. It is particularly noteworthy that ERPs evoked by metaphors were not contingent on figurativeness, novelty, meaningfulness, imageability, emotional valence, or arousal, only on abstractness. When compared with similarly novel literal expressions, metaphors did not evoke a typical N400 and did not activate the RH either. The findings shed new light on the neurocognitive machinery of figurative meaning construction, pervasive in everyday communication. Contrary to embodied cognition, the conceptual system might be organized around abstract representations and not sensorimotor information, even for lush, metaphorical language.

Developmental changes in the processing of faces as revealed by EEG decoding	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Development; Face-processing; Children; Multivariate pattern analysis; EEG; N170	PATTERN-ANALYSIS; ADULTS EVIDENCE; ERP EVIDENCE; RECOGNITION; INVERSION; PERCEPTION; INFORMATION; CHILDREN; UPRIGHT; ACTIVATION	Rapidly and accurately processing information from faces is a critical human function that is known to improve with developmental age. Understanding the underlying drivers of this improvement remains a contentious question, with debate continuing as to the presence of early vs. late maturation of face-processing mechanisms. Recent behavioural evidence suggests an important 'hallmark' of expert face processing - the face inversion effect - is present in very young children, yet neural support for this remains unclear. To address this, we conducted a detailed investigation of the neural dynamics of face processing in children spanning a range of ages (6-11 years) and adults. Uniquely, we applied multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to the electroencephalogram signal (EEG) to test for the presence of a distinct neural profile associated with canonical upright faces when compared both to other objects (houses) and to inverted faces. Results revealed robust discrimination profiles, at the individual level, of differentiated neural activity associated with broad face categorization and further with its expert processing, as indexed by the face inversion effect, from the youngest ages tested. This result is consistent with an early functional maturation of broad face processing mechanisms. Yet, clear quantitative differences between the response profile of children and adults is suggestive of age-related refinement of this system with developing face and general expertise. Standard ERP analysis also provides some support for qualitative differences in the neural response to inverted faces in children in contrast to adults. This neural profile is in line with recent behavioural studies that have reported impressively expert early face abilities during childhood, while also providing novel evidence of the ongoing neural specialisation between child and adulthood.

BMC GERIATRICS			English	Article						Distraction; Older adults; Working memory; ERP	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INVOLUNTARY ATTENTION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; TASK-DIFFICULTY; AGE; BRAIN; P3A; STIMULI	BackgroundPast research indicates that when younger adults are engaged in a visual working memory task, they are less distracted by novel auditory stimuli than when engaged in a visual task that does not require working memory. The current study aimed to determine whether working memory affords the same protection to older adults.MethodWe examined behavioral and EEG responses in 16 younger and 16 older adults to distractor sounds when the listeners performed two visual tasks; one that required working memory (W1) and the other that did not (W0). Auditory distractors were presented in an oddball paradigm, participants were exposed to either standard tones (600Hz: 80%) or various novel environmental sounds (20%).ResultsIt was found that: 1) when presented with novel vs standard sounds, older adults had faster correct response times in the W1 visual task than in the W0 task, indicating that they were less distracted by the novel sound; there was no difference in error rates. Younger adults did not show a task effect for correct response times but made slightly more errors when a novel sound was presented in the W1 task compared to the W0 task. 2) In older adults (but not the younger adults), the amplitude of N1 was smaller in the W1 condition compared to the W0 condition. 3) The working memory manipulation had no effect on MMN amplitude in older adults. 4) For the W1 compared to W0 task, the amplitude of P3a was attenuated for the older adults but not for the younger adults.ConclusionsThese results suggest that during the working memory manipulation older adults were able to engage working memory to reduce the processing of task-irrelevant sounds.

Neuronal activation in the human centromedian-parafascicular complex predicts cortical responses to behaviorally significant auditory events	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Attention; CM-Pf; Intracranial ERPs; P3a; P3b	CM-PF COMPLEX; BRAIN-STEM; THALAMOSTRIATAL PROJECTION; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; RETICULAR-FORMATION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; THALAMIC NEURONS; NOVELTY ODDBALL; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; P300	Studies with non-human primates have suggested an excitatory influence of the thalamus on the cerebral cortex, with the centromedian-parafascicular complex (CM-PO being particularly involved in processes of sensory event-driven attention and arousal. To define the involvement of the human CM-Pf in bottom-up and top-down auditory attention, we simultaneously recorded cortical EEG activity and intracranial local field potentials (LFPs) via electrodes implanted for deep brain stimulation for the treatment of neuropathic pain. The patients (N = 6) performed an auditory three-class oddball paradigm with frequent standard stimuli and two types of infrequent deviant stimuli (target and distractor). We found a parietal P3b to targets and a central P3a to distractors at the scalp level. Subcortical recordings in the CM-Pf revealed enhanced activation to targets compared to standards. Interarea-correlation analyses showed that activation in the CM-Pf predicted the generation of longer latency P3b scalp potentials specifically in the target condition. Our results provide first direct human evidence for a functional temporal relationship between target-related activation in the CM-Pf and an enhanced cortical target response. These results corroborate the hypothetical model of a cortico-basal ganglia loop system that switches from top-down to bottom-up mode in response to salient, task-relevant external events that are not predictable.

In this study, we evaluated how a third factor, an individual's selection history, interacts with top-down control mechanisms during visual search. Participants in our task were assigned to one of two groups in which they developed a history of either shape or color selection in one task, while searching for a shape singleton in a second task. A voluntary task selection procedure allowed participants to choose which task they would perform on each trial, thereby maximizing their top-down preparation. We recorded EEG throughout and extracted lateralized ERP components that index target selection (N-T) and distractor suppression (P-D). Our results showed that selection history continued to guide attention during visual search, even when top-down control mechanisms were maximized with voluntary task selection. For participants with a history of color selection, the N(T)component elicited by a shape target was attenuated when accompanied by a color distractor, and the distractor itself elicited a larger P(D)component. In addition, task-switching results revealed that participants in the color group had larger, asymmetric switch costs implying increased competition between task sets. Our results support the notion that selection history is a significant factor in attention guidance, orienting the visual system reflexively to objects that contradict an individual's current goals-even when these goals are intrinsically selected and prepared ahead of time.

Finding Suitable Clinical Endpoints for a Potential Treatment of a Rare Genetic Disease: the Case of ARID1B	NEUROTHERAPEUTICS			English	Article						ARID1B; Endpoint; Biomarkers; Electrophysiology; Executive functioning; Eye tracking; Cognition	SMOOTH-PURSUIT; NORMATIVE DATA; CHILDREN; AGE; PERFORMANCE; MUTATIONS; EDUCATION	There is a lack of reliable, repeatable, and non-invasive clinical endpoints when investigating treatments for intellectual disability (ID). The aim of this study is to explore a novel approach towards developing new endpoints for neurodevelopmental disorders, in this case for ARID1B-related ID. In this study, twelve subjects with ARID1B-related ID and twelve age-matched controls were included in this observational case-control study. Subjects performed a battery of non-invasive neurobehavioral and neurophysiological assessments on two study days. Test domains included cognition, executive functioning, and eye tracking. Furthermore, several electrophysiological assessments were performed. Subjects wore a smartwatch (Withings (R) Steel HR) for 6 days. Tests were systematically assessed regarding tolerability, variability, repeatability, difference with control group, and correlation with traditional endpoints. Animal fluency, adaptive tracking, body sway, and smooth pursuit eye movements were assessed as fit-for-purpose regarding all criteria, while physical activity, heart rate, and sleep parameters show promise as well. The event-related potential waveform of the passive oddball and visual evoked potential tasks showed discriminatory ability, but EEG assessments were perceived as extremely burdensome. This approach successfully identified fit-for-purpose candidate endpoints for ARID1B-related ID and possibly for other neurodevelopmental disorders. Next, results could be replicated in different ID populations or the assessments could be included as exploratory endpoint in interventional trials in ARID1B-related ID.

Previous studies suggest attentional deficits in amblyopic individuals. However, spatial cues which orient attention to a visual field improved performance. Here, we investigate the neural correlates of auditory-visual spatial selective attention in amblyopia during EEG recording. An auditory cue, that was followed by the presentation of two Gabor patches presented in the lower left and right visual fields, indicated the most likely location of an upcoming target Gabor. The target Gabor differed in orientation from the more frequently presented non-target Gabor patches. Adults with amblyopia and neurotypical observers were asked to detect the target Gabor monocularly at the cued location, while withholding their response to targets presented at the uncued location and to all non-target Gabor patches. Higher response rates were observed for cued compared to uncued targets in both groups. However, amblyopic individuals detected targets less efficiently with their amblyopic eye as compared to their fellow eye. Correspondingly, event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded to the onset of the non-target Gabor patches were delayed at early processing stages (150-300 ms: posterior N100) and reduced in amplitude at later time windows (150-350 ms: P200, 300-500 ms: sustained activity) in the amblyopic eye compared to the fellow eye. Such interocular differences were not observed in neurotypical observers. These findings suggest that neural resources allocated to the early formation of visual discrimination as well as later stimulus recognition processes are altered in the amblyopic eye.

This study aimed to assess the interindividual variation in first-hand physical pain and empathy for pain, and whether their relationship is dependent upon attention. We recruited participants exhibiting high and low sensitivity to first-hand pain (HPS and LPS), and adopted pain empathy paradigms involving attention directed toward or withdrawn from pain of another. Relative to the LPS group, participants in the HPS group estimated greater pain intensity experienced by others, felt greater unpleasantness when viewing others in pain, and exhibited greater sensitivity in discriminating others' pain. Electroencephalographic data showed that when attention was directed toward others' pain, only participants in the HPS group exhibited significant pain empathic effects on the N1 component of event-related potentials and on the alpha-oscillation response. These empathic neural responses mediated the linkage between first-hand pain sensitivity and empathic behavioral responses. Nevertheless, empathic responses were comparable between two groups when attention was withdrawn from others' pain. These results demonstrate a shared sensitivity to first-hand pain and empathy for pain provided that attention is directed toward pain.

Expressive language deficits, especially in speech production, are nearly ubiquitous among individuals with fragile X, but understanding of the neurological bases for these deficits remains limited. Speech production depends on feedforward control and the synchronization of neural oscillations between speech-related areas of frontal cortex and auditory areas of temporal cortex. Interaction in this circuitry allows the corollary discharge of intended speech generated from an efference copy of speech commands to be compared against actual speech sounds, which is critical for making adaptive adjustments to optimize future speech. We aimed to determine whether alterations in coherence between frontal and temporal cortices prior to speech production are present in individuals with fragile X and whether they relate to expressive language dysfunction. Twenty-one participants with full-mutation fragile X syndrome (aged 7-55 years, eight females) and 20 healthy controls (matched on age and sex) completed a talk/listen paradigm during high-density EEG recordings. During the talk task, participants repeated pronounced short vocalizations of 'Ah' every 1-2s for a total of 180s. During the listen task, participants passively listened to their recordings from the talk task. We compared pre-speech event-related potential activity, N1 suppression to speech sounds, single trial gamma power and fronto-temporal coherence between groups during these tasks and examined their relation to performance during a naturalistic language task. Prior to speech production, fragile X participants showed reduced pre-speech negativity, reduced fronto-temporal connectivity and greater frontal gamma power compared to controls. N1 suppression during self-generated speech did not differ between groups. Reduced pre-speech activity and increased frontal gamma power prior to speech production were related to less intelligible speech as well as broader social communication deficits in fragile X syndrome. Our findings indicate that coordinated pre-speech activity between frontal and temporal cortices is disrupted in individuals with fragile X in a clinically relevant way and represents a mechanism contributing to prominent speech production problems in the disorder.

A review of the literature suggests that the evidence regarding circadian synchrony effects (better performance at optimal vs. non-optimal times of day according to chronotype) on decision-making is mixed, likely due to the use of different approaches to estimate chronotype. The current experiment studied economic decision-making as a function of both chronotype and the time of day when decisions are made. The influence of chronotype (Morning-type: N = 28 vs. Evening-type: N = 30) and time of day (8 am vs. 10 pm) on decision-making was measured by the acceptance rate of unfair and fair offers in the Ultimatum Game, and the event-related potentials time-locked to such offers. Subjective affect (PANAS), and appraisal of emotional images (IAPS) were also measured. Chronotype was estimated through questionnaires (MEQ, rMEQ, MCTQ) and the circadian rhythm of wrist temperature. Synchrony effects were found for both wrist temperature and subjective affect, but not for behavioral performance. Morning-types showed earlier phases of circadian rhythms in temperature, reported better sleep quality, more positive affective balance, accepted more unfair offers, and their frontal P200 potential was attenuated as compared to Evening-types in the Ultimatum Game. Acceptance rate of unfair offers correlated with the chronotype measured by questionnaires (positive correlation with rMEQ and MEQ scores, and negative correlation with Midsleep time in workdays -MSWsc from MCTQ) but not with midsleep time estimated through wrist temperature. Finally, participants who accepted more unfair offers later judged positive IAPS stimuli as more pleasant. We did not observe a synchrony effect in the Ultimatum Game, but morningness was related to rational decision-making as indexed by increased acceptance of unfair offers. Since morning-types show higher emotional regulation and positive mood than evening-types, it is possible that unfair offers did not elicit negative emotions as intense in morning-types as in evening-types, making it easier for them to accept.

In addition to the verbal transcription, it includes information such as sound effects, speaker identification, or music tagging. However, it just takes into account a limited spectrum of the whole acoustic information available in the soundtrack, and hence, an important amount of emotional information is lost when attending just to the normative compliant captions. In this article, it is shown, by means of behavioral and EEG measurements, how emotional information related to sounds and music used by the creator in the audiovisual work is perceived differently by normal hearing group and hearing disabled group when applying standard captioning. Audio and captions activate similar processing areas, respectively, in each group, although not with the same intensity. Moreover, captions require higher activation of voluntary attentional circuits, as well as language-related areas. Captions transcribing musical information increase attentional activity, instead of emotional processing.

Individual test-retest reliability of evoked and induced alpha activity in human EEG data	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; BAND; SYNCHRONIZATION; VARIABILITY; CONSISTENCY; POTENTIALS; MODULATION; COMPONENTS; STABILITY	Diverse psychological mechanisms have been associated with modulations of different EEG frequencies. To the extent of our knowledge, there are few studies of the test-retest reliability of these modulations in the human brain. To assess evoked and induced alpha reliabilities related to cognitive processing, EEG data from twenty subjects were recorded in 58 derivations in two different sessions separated by 49.5 +/- 48.9 (mean +/- standard deviation) days. A visual oddball was selected as the cognitive task, and three main parameters were analyzed for evoked and induced alpha modulations (latency, amplitude and topography). Latency and amplitude for evoked and induced modulations showed stable behavior between the two sessions. The correlation between sessions for alpha evoked and induced topographies in the grand average (group level) was r = 0.923, p<0.001; r = 0.962, p<0.001, respectively. The within-subject correlation values for evoked modulation ranged from 0.472 to 0.974 (mean: 0.766), whereas induced activity showed a different range, 0.193 to 0.892 (mean: 0.655). Individual analysis of the test-retest reliability showed a higher heterogeneity in the induced modulation, probably due to the heterogeneous phases found in the second case. However, despite this heterogeneity in phase values for induced activity relative to the onset of the stimuli, an excellent correlation score was obtained for group topography, with values that were better than those of the grand average evoked topography. As a main conclusion, induced alpha activity can be observed as a stable and reproducible response in the cognitive processing of the human brain.

In a popular implementation, called P300 speller, a subject looks at a display where characters are flashing and selects one character by attending to it. The selection is recognized as the item with the strongest ERP. The speller performs well when cortical responses to target and non-target stimuli are sufficiently different. Although many strategies have been proposed for improving the BCI spelling, a relatively simple one received insufficient attention in the literature: reduction of the visual field to diminish the contribution from non-target stimuli. Previously, this idea was implemented in a single-stimulus switch that issued an urgent command like stopping a robot. To tackle this approach further, we ran a pilot experiment where ten subjects operated a traditional P300 speller or wore a binocular aperture that confined their sight to the central visual field. As intended, visual field restriction resulted in a replacement of non-target ERPs with EEG rhythms asynchronous to stimulus periodicity. Changes in target ERPs were found in half of the subjects and were individually variable. While classification accuracy was slightly better for the aperture condition (84.3 +/- 2.9%, mean +/- standard error) than the no-aperture condition (81.0 +/- 2.6%), this difference was not statistically significant for the entire sample of subjects (N = 10). For both the aperture and no-aperture conditions, classification accuracy improved over 4 days of training, more so for the aperture condition (from 72.0 +/- 6.3% to 87.0 +/- 3.9% and from 72.0 +/- 5.6% to 97.0 +/- 2.2% for the no-aperture and aperture conditions, respectively). Although in this study BCI performance was not substantially altered, we suggest that with further refinement this approach could speed up BCI operations and reduce user fatigue. Additionally, instead of wearing an aperture, non-targets could be removed algorithmically or with a hybrid interface that utilizes an eye tracker. We further discuss how a P300 speller could be improved by taking advantage of the different physiological properties of the central and peripheral vision. Finally, we suggest that the proposed experimental approach could be used in basic research on the mechanisms of visual processing.

Methods Patients in vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS) or in minimally conscious state (MCS) were enrolled within 3 months from their brain injury in 12 specialized medical institutions. Demographic, anamnestic, clinical, and neurophysiologic data were collected at study entry. Patients were then followed up for assessing the primary outcome, that is, clinical diagnosis according to standardized criteria at 6 months postinjury. Results We enrolled 147 patients (44 women; mean age 49.4 [95% confidence interval 46.1-52.6] years; VS/UWS 71, MCS 76; traumatic 55, vascular 56, anoxic 36; mean time postinjury 59.6 [55.4-63.6] days). The 6-month follow-up was complete for 143 patients (VS/UWS 70; MCS 73). With respect to study entry, the clinical diagnosis improved in 72 patients (VS/UWS 27; MCS 45). Younger age, shorter time postinjury, higher Coma Recovery Scale-Revised total score, and presence of EEG reactivity to eye opening at study entry predicted better outcome, whereas etiology, clinical diagnosis, Disability Rating Scale score, EEG background activity, acoustic reactivity, and P300 on event-related potentials were not associated with outcome. Conclusions Multimodal assessment could identify patients with higher likelihood of clinical improvement in order to help clinicians, families, and funding sources with various aspects of decision-making. This multicenter, international study aims to stimulate further research that drives international consensus regarding standardization of prognostic procedures for patients with DoC.

J	Das Chakladar, D; Dey, S; Roy, PP; Dogra, DP				Das Chakladar, Debashis; Dey, Shubhashis; Roy, Partha Pratim; Dogra, Debi Prosad			EEG-based mental workload estimation using deep BLSTM-LSTM network and evolutionary algorithm	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; LSTM; Mental workload; GWO; BCI		The mental workload can be estimated by monitoring different mental states from neural activity. The spectral power of EEG and Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) are the two mediums for monitoring the mental states. In this paper, we estimate the workload during the multitasking mental activities of human subjects. The estimation of mental workload is done using the "STEW" dataset [16]. The dataset consists of two tasks, namely "No task" and "simultaneous capacity (SIMKAP)-based multitasking activity". Different workload levels of two tasks have been estimated using the composite framework consists of Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) and deep neural network. GWO has been used to select optimized features related to mental activities. Other optimization techniques such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are generally slower compared to the convergence rate of GWO. A deep hybrid model based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has been proposed for the classification of workload levels. The proposed deep model achieves 86.33% and 82.57% classification accuracy for "No task" and "SIMKAP-based multitasking activity," respectively. A judicious distinction between different workload levels at higher accuracy will essentially increase the performance of an operator, which effectively improves the efficiency of the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems.

Task-specific signatures in the expert brain: Differential correlates of translation and reading in professional interpreters	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Bilingualism; Simultaneous interpreting; Expertise; Lexical processing; Electroencephalography; Oscillatory activity	ALPHA-BAND; OSCILLATORY RESPONSES; LEXICAL DECISION; EEG THETA; LANGUAGE; CONCRETENESS; SPEECH; MEMORY; POWER; ERP	Insights on the neurocognitive particularities of expert individuals have benefited from language studies on professional simultaneous interpreters (PSIs). Accruing research indicates that behavioral advantages in this population are restricted to those skills that are directly taxed during professional practice (e.g., translation as opposed to reading), but little is known about the neural signatures of such selective effects. To illuminate the issue, we recruited 17 PSIs and 15 non-interpreter bilinguals and compared behavioral and electrophysiological markers of word reading and translation from and into their native and non-native languages (L1 and L2, respectively). PSIs exhibited greater delta-theta (1-8 Hz) power across all tasks over varying topographies, but these were accompanied by faster performance only in the case of translation conditions. Moreover, neural differences in PSIs were most marked for L2-L1 translation (the dominant interpreting direction in their market), which exhibited maximally widespread modulations that selectively correlated with behavioral outcomes. Taken together, our results suggest that interpreting experience involves distinct neural signatures across reading and translation mechanisms, but that these are systematically related with processing efficiency only in domains that face elevated demands during everyday practice (i.e., L2-L1 translation). These findings can inform models of simultaneous interpreting, in particular, and expert cognitive processing, in general.

Olfaction Modulates Inter-Subject Correlation of Neural Responses	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						inter-subject correlation (ISC); electroencephaloagraphy (EEG); attention; reliability; fragrance; olfaction	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ODOR QUALITY; SLEEP; ATTENTION; AROMATHERAPY; PERFORMANCE; MOOD; STIMULATION; PARAMETERS; PAIN	Odors can be powerful stimulants. It is well-established that odors provide strong cues for recall of locations, people and events. The effects of specific scents on other cognitive functions are less well-established. We hypothesized that scents with different odor qualities will have a different effect on attention. To assess attention, we used Inter-Subject Correlation of the EEG because this metric is strongly modulated by attentional engagement with natural audiovisual stimuli. We predicted that scents known to be "energizing" would increase Inter-Subject Correlation during watching of videos as compared to "calming" scents. In a first experiment, we confirmed this for eucalyptol and linalool while participants watched animated autobiographical narratives. The result was replicated in a second experiment, but did not generalize to limonene, also considered an "energizing" odorant. In a third, double-blind experiment, we tested a battery of scents including single molecules, as well as mixtures, as participants watched various short video clips. We found a varying effect of odor on Inter-Subject Correlation across the various scents. This study provides a basis for reliably and reproducibly assessing effects of odors on brain activity. Future research is needed to further explore the effect of scent-based up-modulation in engagement on learning and memory performance. Educators, product developers and fragrance brands might also benefit from such objective neurophysiological measures.

Martin, O. Postal, J.J. Eggermont. Oscillations in the auditory system, their possible role. NEUROSCI BIOBEHAV REV XXX XXX-XXX, 2020. - Neural oscillations are thought to have various roles in brain processing such as, attention modulation, neuronal communication, motor coordination, memory consolidation, decision-making, or feature binding. The role of oscillations in the auditory system is less clear, especially due to the large discrepancy between human and animal studies. Here we describe many methodological issues that confound the results of oscillation studies in the auditory field. Moreover, we discuss the relationship between neural entrainment and oscillations that remains unclear. Finally, we aim to identify which kind of oscillations could be specific or salient to the auditory areas and their processing. We suggest that the role of oscillations might dramatically differ between the primary auditory cortex and the more associative auditory areas. Despite the moderate presence of intrinsic low frequency oscillations in the primary auditory cortex, rhythmic components in the input seem crucial for auditory processing. This allows the phase entrainment between the oscillatory phase and rhythmic input, which is an integral part of stimulus selection within the auditory system.

However, researchers still lack effective measures to establish the association between neurophysiological activity and this behavioral variability. Here, the present study recorded reaction time (RT) and cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) in healthy subjects when they continuously performed an alternative responding task. The frontal theta activity and reaction-time variability were examined trial by trial using the measures of standard deviation (SD) in the time domain and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in the frequency domain. Our results showed that the SD of reaction-time variability did not have any correlation with the SD of trial-by-trial frontal theta activity, and the ALFF of reaction-time variability has a significant correlation with the ALFF of trial-by-trial frontal theta activity in 0.01-0.027 Hz. These results suggested the methodological significance of ALFF in establishing the association between neurophysiological activity and reaction-time variability. Furthermore, these findings also support the low-frequency fluctuation as a potential feature of sustained attention.

Stimuli were 200 infant faces displaying Happiness, Relaxation, Sadness, Distress and 32 piano musical pieces conveying the same emotional states (as specifically assessed). Music and faces were presented simultaneously, and paired so that in half cases they were emotionally congruent or incongruent. Twenty subjects were told to pay attention and respond to infrequent targets (adult neutral faces) while their EEG was recorded from 128 channels. The face-related N170 (160-180 ms) component was the earliest response affected by the emotional content of faces (particularly by distress), while visual P300 (250-450 ms) and auditory N400 (350-550 ms) responses were specifically modulated by the emotional content of both facial expressions and musical pieces. Face/music emotional incongruence elicited a wide N400 negativity indicating the detection of a mismatch in the expressed emotion. A swLORETA inverse solution applied to N400 (difference wave Incong. - Cong.), showed the crucial role of Inferior and Superior Temporal Gyri in the multimodal representation of emotional information extracted from faces and music. Furthermore, the prefrontal cortex (superior and medial, BA 10) was also strongly active, possibly supporting working memory. The data hints at a common system for representing emotional information derived by social cognition and music processing, including uncus and cuneus.

The current study addressed the electrophysiological correlates underlying perceived control, as exercised by choice, in the processing of feedback valence. Thirty-six participants performed an EEG choice task during which they received positive or negative feedback following choices made either by themselves or by a computer. Perceived control resulted in an enhanced reward positivity for positive feedback but increased theta power for negative feedback. Further, perceived control led to greater feedback P3 amplitude and delta power, regardless of feedback valence. These results suggest functional heterogeneity of perceived control in feedback processing as diverse as magnifying the reward signal, enhancing the need for control and increasing the motivational salience of outcome irrespective of valence.

Large effects of brief meditation intervention on EEG spectra in meditation novices	IBRO REPORTS			English	Article						Stress; Brain waves; Meditation; States of consciousness; Electroencephalogram (EEG)	COGNITIVE THERAPY; STRESS REDUCTION; MINDFULNESS; BRAIN; NEUROSCIENCE; STIMULATION; INTEGRATION; DISORDERS; STATES; ERP	This study investigated the impact of a brief meditation workshop on a sample of 223 novice meditators. Participants attended a three-day workshop comprising daily guided seated meditation sessions using music without vocals that focused on various emotional states and intentions (open focus). Based on the theory of integrative consciousness, it was hypothesized that altered states of consciousness would be experienced by participants during the meditation intervention as assessed using electroencephalogram (EEG). Brainwave power bands patterns were measured throughout the meditation training workshop, producing a total of 5616 EEG scans. Changes in conscious states were analysed using pre-meditation and post-meditation session measures of delta through to gamma oscillations. Results suggested the meditation intervention had large varying effects on EEG spectra (up to 50 % increase and 24 % decrease), and the speed of change from pre-meditation to post-meditation state of the EEG co-spectra was significant (with 0.76 probability of entering end-meditation state within the first minute). There was a main 5 % decrease in delta power (95 % HDI = [-0.07, -0.03]); a global increase in theta power of 29 % (95 % HDI = [0.27, 0.33]); a global increase of 16 % (95 % HDI = [0.13, 0.19]) in alpha power; a main effect of condition, with global beta power increasing by 17 % (95 % HDI = [0.15, 0.19]); and an 11 % increase (95 % HDI = [0.08, 0.14]) in gamma power from pre-meditation to end-meditation. Findings provided preliminary support for brief meditation in altering states of consciousness in novice meditators. Future clinical examination of meditation was recommended as an intervention for mental health conditions particularly associated with hippocampal impairments.

We investigate adjective-noun composition using EEG, focusing on the effects of the intensional and denotational semantics of the modifying adjective. We used NPs from 4 semantic conditions in Bokmal Norwegian: privative modal (e.g. "fake president"), privative temporal ("former president"), non-privative modal ("real president"), and non-privative temporal ("current president"). In 2 non-semantic conditions, the adjective was replaced by either a non-word or a pseudo-word. Thecompositioncontrast (semanticvsnon-semantic trials) revealed a larger P600 component after the noun in the semantic trials. The effects ofintensionality(modalvstemporal adjective) were found in the N400 time frame, while the effects ofdenotation(privativevsnon-privative adjective) were found in a post-N400 window. We discuss some implications of these results for neurocognitive theories of compositional language processing.

Research on the RewP has frequently used simple guessing tasks. In the doors task, participants receive either feedback denoting monetary gain or loss on each trial after choosing one of two doors to "open." Typically, these tasks present visual stimuli on a computer monitor. The current study developed and validated a version of the doors task utilizing auditory stimuli to indicate gains and losses. Thirty-eight young adults completed both a standard visual doors task and a novel auditory doors task. Results indicated that the audio RewP was more positive and peaked earlier than the visual RewP. Additionally, the audio RewP both moderately correlated with and demonstrated similar internal consistency as the visual RewP. These results suggest that the auditory doors task elicits the same feedback-monitoring processes as the visual doors task.	[Threadgill, A.

Neurophysiological markers of cognitive deficits and recovery in concussed adolescents	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Concussion; mTBI; Event-related potentials; EEG; Adolescence; Recovery	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; COLLEGIATE FOOTBALL PLAYERS; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; HIGH-SCHOOL; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; REACTION-TIME; HEAD-INJURY; NOVELTY P3	Objective: The present study sought to determine: 1) whether concussed adolescents exhibited deficits in neurocognitive functioning as reflected by neurophysiological alterations; 2) if neurophysiological alterations could be linked to supplementary data such as the number of previous concussions and days since injury; and 3) if deficits in psychological health and behavioural tests increased during diagnosis duration. Methods: Twenty-six concussed adolescents were compared to twenty-eight healthy controls with no prior concussions. Self-report inventories evaluated depressive and concussive symptomatology, while behavioral tests evaluated cognitive ability qualitatively. To assess neurophysiological markers of cognitive function, two separate auditory oddball tasks were employed: 1) an active oddball task measuring executive control and attention as reflected by the N2b and P300, respectively; and 2) a passive oddball task assessing the early, automatic pre-conscious awareness processes as reflected by the MMN. Results: Concussed adolescents displayed delayed N2b and attenuated P300 responses relative to controls; showed elevated levels of depressive and concussive symptomatology; scored average-to- low-average in behavioral tests; and exhibited N2b response latencies that correlated with number of days since injury. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that concussed adolescents exhibit clear deficiencies in neurocognitive function, and that N2b response latency may be a marker of concussion recovery.

Here we show in a simple variant of the continuous performance task that this "oddball effect" does not universally apply. Stimuli were a continuous series of (A or B) - > (X or Y) pairs, with the letter X requiring a key-press response and occurring in 80% of trials after A and in 20% after B (vice versa the Y). P3b amplitudes were equally large with probable and improbable occurrence of X. This was in contrast to visual Mismatch Negativity which was consistently larger with less probable stimuli, and also in contrast to no-go P3 amplitudes, which were larger with improbable than probable Y. The only effect on P3b amplitude was due to stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA): P3b was larger with SOAs of 2000 ms compared to 1500 ms. This result dovetails with previous evidence in the oddball task that the main determinant of the oddball effect is not event probability but rather time interval between stimuli. The absence of probability effects on P3b was in sharp contrast to the presence of these effects on no-go P3. Implications are discussed for theories about the psychological meaning of the P3b component.

To investigate the neural underpinnings of the effect of phasic alerting on endogenous orienting, we recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) in a variant of the spatial cueing task with a tone presented 100 ms before the cue as a phasic alerting signal, and calculated cue-evoked event-related lateralizations (ERLs) providing a precise assessment of preparatory visuospatial attention. Behavioral results showed that the spatial orienting effect was increased under the phasic alerting condition, as expected. The EEG results showed that an orienting-related ERL component called a late directing attention positivity (LDAP) had shorter onset latency and larger amplitude in the alerting condition than in the no-alerting (no-tone) condition. In conclusion, phasic alerting seems to both accelerate and enhance orienting-related preparatory modulations within the ventral visual stream.

The present study explores the ability of the quasi-stable resting EEG asymmetry information and the associated neurovascular synchronization/desynchronization in bringing more insight into the understanding of neural-mechanisms of affect and approach/withdrawal behavior. For this purpose, a novel frontal alpha-asymmetry based on microstates, that assess quasi-stable EEG scalp topography information, is proposed and compared against standard frontal-asymmetry. Both proposed and standard frontal alpha-asymmetries were estimated from thirty-nine healthy volunteers resting-EEG simultaneously acquired with resting-fMRI. Further, neurovascular mechanisms of these asymmetry measures were estimated through EEG-informed fMRI. Subsequently, the Hemodynamic Lateralization Index (HLI) of the neural-underpinnings of both asymmetry measures was assessed. Finally, the robust correlation of both asymmetry-measures and their HLI's with PANAS, BIS/BAS was carried out. The standard resting frontal-asymmetry and its HLI yielded no significant correlation with any psychological-measures. However, the microstate resting frontal-asymmetry correlated significantly with negative affect and its neural underpinning's HLI significantly correlated with Positive/Negative affect and BIS/BAS measures. Finally, alpha-BOLD desynchronization was observed in neural-underpinning whose HLI correlated significantly with negative affect and BIS. Hence, the proposed resting microstate-frontal asymmetry better assesses the neural-mechanisms of affect, approach/withdrawal behavior.

However, the efficacy of these processes depends on previous trial history/experience, which is reflected in the "congruency sequence effect" (CSE). Several theoretical accounts have been put forward to explain this effect. Some accounts stress the role of perceptual processes in the emergence of the CSE. As yet, it is elusive how these perceptual processes are implemented on a neural level. We examined this question using a newly developed moving dots flanker task. We combine decomposition methods of EEG data and source localization. We show that perceptual processes modulate the CSE and can be isolated in neurophysiological signals, especially in the N2 ERP time window. However, mechanisms relating perception to action are also coded and modulated in this time window. We show that middle frontal regions (BA 6) are associated with processes dealing with purely perceptual processes. Inferior frontal regions (BA 45) are associated with processes dealing with stimulus-response transition processes. Likely, the neurophysiological modulations reflect unbinding processes at the perceptual level, and stimulus-response translation level needed to respond correctly on the presented (changed) stimulus-response relationships. The data establish a direct relationship between psychological concepts focusing on perceptual processes during conflict monitoring and neurophysiological processes using signal decomposition.

Moreover, autistic symptoms show a continuity in the general population and are referred to as autistic traits in people without an ASD diagnosis. One of the symptoms of ASD is sensory processing differences both in sensitivity and perception. To investigate sensory processing differences in autistic traits, we examined auditory and visual processing in a healthy population. We recruited 75 individuals (39 females and 36 males, mean age = 23.01 years, SD = 3.23 years) and assessed autistic traits using the Autism Spectrum Quotient, and sensory sensitivity using the Sensory Sensitivity Scales. Sensory processing in the visual domain was examined with the radial motion stimulus and the auditory domain was assessed with the 1,000 Hz pure tone stimulus with electroencephalography-evoked potentials. The results showed that the auditory sensitivity scores of the males (r(aud) (34) = 0.396, p(aud) = 0.017) and the visual sensitivity scores of females were correlated with autistic traits (r(vis) (37) = 0.420, p(vis) = 0.008). Moreover, the P2 latency for the auditory stimulus was prolonged in the participants with a higher level of autistic traits (r(s) (61) = 0.411, p = 0.008), and this correlation was only observed in males (r(s) (31) = 0.542, p = 0.001). We propose that auditory processing differences are related to autistic traits in neurotypicals, particularly in males. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering sex differences in autistic traits and ASD.

This is true for both, visuo-motor and somatosensory-motor integration. However, while perception-action integration has been extensively investigated for the visual modality, data on how somatosensory and action-related information is associated are scarce. We use the Theory of Event Coding (TEC) as a framework to investigate perception-action integration in the somatosensory-motor domain. Based on studies examining the neural mechanisms underlying stimulus-response binding in the visuo-motor domain, the current study investigates binding mechanisms in the somatosensory-motor domain using EEG signal decomposition and source localization analyses. The present study clearly demonstrates binding between somatosensory stimulus and response features. Importantly, repetition benefits but no repetition costs are evident in the somatosensory modality, which differs from findings in the visual domain. EEG signal decomposition indicates that response selection mechanisms, rather than stimulus-related processes, account for the behavioral binding effects. This modulation is associated with activation differences in the left superior parietal cortex (BA 7), an important relay of sensorimotor integration.

J	Bogels, S				Bogels, Sara			Neural correlates of turn-taking in the wild: Response planning starts early in free interviews	COGNITION			English	Article						Conversation; Turn-taking; Pragmatics; Language production; EEG	LANGUAGE PRODUCTION; COMPREHENSION; BRAIN; CONVERSATION; UTTERANCES; PREDICTION; SIGNATURES; SAY	Conversation is generally characterized by smooth transitions between turns, with only very short gaps. This entails that responders often begin planning their response before the ongoing turn is finished. However, controversy exists about whether they start planning as early as they can, to make sure they respond on time, or as late as possible, to minimize the overlap between comprehension and production planning. Two earlier EEG studies have found neural correlates of response planning (positive ERP and alpha decrease) as soon as listeners could start planning their response, already midway through the current turn. However, in these studies, the questions asked were highly controlled with respect to the position where planning could start (e.g., very early) and required short and easy responses. The present study measured participants' EEG while an experimenter interviewed them in a spontaneous interaction. Coding the questions in the interviews showed that, under these natural circumstances, listeners can, in principle, start planning a response relatively early, on average after only about one third of the question has passed. Furthermore, ERP results showed a large positivity, interpreted before as an early neural signature of response planning, starting about half a second after the start of the word that allowed listeners to start planning a response. A second neural signature of response planning, an alpha decrease, was not replicated as reliably. In conclusion, listeners appear to start planning their response early during the ongoing turn, also under natural circumstances, presumably in order to keep the gap between turns short and respond on time. These results have several important implications for turn-taking theories, which need to explain how interlocutors deal with the overlap between comprehension and production, how they manage to come in on time, and the sources that lead to variability between conversationalists in the start of planning.

Designing those paradigms can be very time-consuming and this traditional approach is necessarily data-limited. In contrast, in computational and corpus linguistics, analyses are often based on large text corpora, which allow a vast variety of hypotheses to be tested by repeatedly re-evaluating the data set. Furthermore, text corpora also allow exploratory data analysis in order to generate new hypotheses. By drawing on the advantages of both fields, neuroimaging and computational corpus linguistics, we here present a unified approach combining continuous natural speech and MEG to generate a corpus of speech-evoked neuronal activity.

Firstly, deconstructing product shape to obtain form design elements, and then recombining those elements in different ways to get experimental samples. Next, EEG and ET techniques were introduced to obtain bioelectric data of eye-brain physiological cognition when subjects view the experimental samples, and a space containing user kansei needs was established. Finally, the kansei image value of the product, the form design elements, and eye-brain physiological data were associated together to establish a kansei image prediction model. To verify the effectiveness of this model, smartphones were used as validation cases in this research. User's kansei prediction model for smartphones was established based on subjects' evaluation of 30 experimental samples, and the model's performance was evaluated by a comparison verification method. The research results showed that the kansei image prediction model based on eye-brain physiological cognition can more accurately predict kansei image in the process of user interaction with product, thus helping the designer to find out the key product from that trigger kansei image, and design a product that was more in line with the user' kansei experience.

Interference inhibition constitutes a subcomponent of response inhibition and refers to inhibitory control over responses that are automatically triggered by irrelevant stimulus dimensions as measured by the Simon task. While there is evidence that the area-specific modulation of tactile information affects the act of action withholding, effects in the context of interference inhibition remain elusive. We conducted a tactile version of the Simon task with stimuli designed to be predominantly processed in the primary (40Hz) or secondary (150Hz) somatosensory cortex. On the basis of EEG recordings, we performed signal decomposition and source localization. Behavioral results reveal that response execution is more efficient when sensory information is mainly processed via SII, compared to SI sensory areas during non-conflicting trials. When accounting for intermingled coding levels by temporally decomposing EEG data, the results show that experimental variations depending on sensory area-specific processing differences specifically affect motor and not sensory processes. Modulations of motor-related processes are linked to activation differences in the superior parietal cortex (BA7). It is concluded that the SII cortical area supporting cognitive preprocessing of tactile input fosters automatic tactile information processing by facilitating stimulus-response mapping in posterior parietal regions.

To date, the mechanisms underlying attacks, characterised by a painless perception of abrupt, loud noises at transitional sleep-wake or wake-sleep states, are by and large unclear. Methods and results In order to address the current gap in the knowledge of potential underlying pathophysiology, a retrospective case-control study of polysomnographic recordings of patients presenting to a tertiary sleep disorders clinic with exploding head syndrome was conducted. Interictal (non-attack associated) electroencephalographic biomarkers were investigated by performing macrostructural and event-related dynamic spectral analyses of the whole-night EEG. In patients with exploding head syndrome, additional oscillatory activity was recorded during wakefulness and at sleep/wake periods. This activity differed in its frequency, topography and source from the alpha rhythm that it accompanied. Conclusion Based on these preliminary findings, we hypothesise that at times of sleep-wake transition in patients with exploding head syndrome, aberrant attentional processing may lead to amplification and modulation of external sensory stimuli.

Few studies have documented the effects of a history of adolescent binge drinking on neurophysiological consequences in young adulthood. Synchrony of phase (phase locking (PL)) of event-related oscillations (EROs) within and between different brain areas reflects communication exchange between neural networks and is a sensitive measure of adolescent development in both rats and humans, and thus may be a good translational measure of the potential harmful effects of alcohol exposure during adolescence. In this study, EROs were collected from 1041 young adults of Mexican American and American Indian ancestry (age 18-30 years) with and without a history of adolescent binge drinking (five drinks for boys and four for girls per occasion at least once per month) and in 74 young adult rats with and without a history of 5 weeks of adolescent alcohol vapor exposure. PL of theta and beta frequencies between frontal and parietal cortex were estimated using an auditory-oddball paradigm in the rats and a visual facial expression paradigm in the humans. Significantly lower PL between frontal and parietal cortices in the theta frequencies was seen in both the humans and the rats with a history of adolescent alcohol exposure as compared with their controls. These findings suggest that alcohol exposure during adolescence may result in decreases in synchrony between cortical neuronal networks, suggesting a developmental delay, in young adult humans and in rats.

In our study, we relied on the unique spatio-temporal resolution provided by intracranial stereotactic electroencephalographic (SEEG) recordings in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy to characterize the signal extracted from early visual (calcarine and pericalcarine) and auditory (Heschl's gyrus and planum temporale) regions during a simple audio-visual oddball task. We provide evidences that both cross-modal responses (visual responses in auditory cortex or the reverse) and multisensory processing (alteration of the unimodal responses during bimodal stimulation) can be observed in intracranial event-related potentials (iERPs) and in power modulations of oscillatory activity at different temporal scales within the first 150 msec after stimulus onset. The temporal profiles of the iERPs are compatible with the hypothesis that MSI occurs by means of direct pathways linking early visual and auditory regions. Our data indicate, moreover, that MSI mainly relies on modulations of the low-frequency bands (foremost the theta band in the auditory cortex and the alpha band in the visual cortex), suggesting the involvement of feedback pathways between the two sensory regions. Remarkably, we also observed high-gamma power modulations by sounds in the early visual cortex, thus suggesting the presence of neuronal populations involved in auditory processing in the calcarine and pericalcarine region in humans.

Classification of a counterpart as sexually attractive likely occurs rapidly, and involves both conscious and unconscious attentional and cognitive processes. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is an imaging method especially well-suited to examine visual and attentional processes triggered by sexual images within the range of milliseconds. Methods We investigated brain responses to sexual images depicting adults (frequent) and children (infrequent stimulus) in seventeen paedophilic patients with a history of child sexual offending (P + CSO) and twenty healthy controls (HC) during a passive visual oddball paradigm. Event-related fields (ERF) were measured to extract the magnetic visual mismatch negativity (vMMNm), and how it relates to the processing of different classes of sexual stimuli. Results P + CSO exhibited significantly longer vMMNm latencies (100-180 ms post-stimulus) than HC. Moreover, P + CSO showed widespread increased amplitudes in response to child images starting from P3a and P3b components and lasting up to 400 ms post-stimulus presentation localised in frontal and temporal brain regions. Conclusions This study uncovers the first MEG differences in automatic change detection between P + CSO and HC during the presentation of subliminal sexual images of adults and children, contributing towards a better understanding of the neurobiological processes of P + CSO.

Methods: we use the Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and the Skin Potential Response (SPR) signal, which has several advantages with respect to other Electrodermal (EDA) signals. We record one SPR signal for each hand, and use an algorithm that, selecting the smoother signal, is able to remove motion artifacts. We extract statistical features from the ECG and SPR signals in order to classify signal segments and identify the presence or absence of emotional events via a Supervised Learning Algorithm. The experiments were carried out in a company which specializes in driving simulator equipment, using a motorized platform and a driving simulator. Different subjects were tested with this setup, with different challenging events happening on predetermined locations on the track. Results: we obtain an Accuracy as high as 79.10% for signal blocks and as high as 91.27% for events. Conclusion: results demonstrate the good performance of the presented system in detecting sympathetic reactions, and the effectiveness of the motion artifact removal procedure. Significance: our work demonstrates the possibility to classify the emotional state of the driver, using the ECG and EDA signals and a slightly invasive setup. In particular, the proposed use of SPR and of the motion artifact removal procedure are crucial for the effectiveness of the system.

Feedback processing is enhanced following exploration in continuous environments	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Computational modelling; Explore-exploit dilemma; P300	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; REWARD MAGNITUDE; EMOTIONAL PICTURES; NEURAL RESPONSES; DECISION-MAKING; ATTENTION; RISK; INFORMATION; VALENCE; HUMANS	Decision-making is typically studied by presenting participants with a small set of options. However, real-world behaviour, like foraging, often occurs in continuous environments. The degree to which human decision-making in discrete tasks generalizes to continuous tasks is questionable. For example, successful foraging comprises both exploration (learning about the environment) and exploitation (taking advantage of what is known). Although progress has been made in understanding the neural processes related to this trade-off in discrete tasks, it is currently unclear how, or whether, the same processes are involved in continuous tasks. To address this, we recorded electroencephalographic data while participants "dug for gold" by selecting locations on a map. Participants were cued beforehand that the map contained either a single patch of gold, or many patches of gold. We then used a computational model to classify participant responses as either exploitations, which were driven by previous reward locations and amounts, or explorations. Our participants were able to adjust their strategy based on reward distribution, exploring more in multi-patch environments and less in single-patch environments. We observed an enhancement of the feedback-locked P300, a neural signal previously linked to exploration in discrete tasks, which suggests the presence of a general neural system for managing the explore-exploit trade-off. Furthermore, the P300 was accompanied by an exploration-related enhancement of the late positive potential that was greatest in the multi-patch environment, suggesting a role for motivational processes during exploration.

The global Beta test for hidden periodicities in signals and its extensions to multivariate systems	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Objective response detection; F test; Beta test; EEG; MORD	SPECTRAL F-TEST; MULTIPLE COHERENCE; MULTICHANNEL EEG; EVOKED-RESPONSES; STIMULATION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; PRODUCTS; RATIOS; SUMS	Background and objective: There are many phenomena that lead to changes in the power spectrum of a given signal, and their detection has been a challenge that has received considerable attention over the years. Objective Response Detection (ORD) techniques are a set of tools that perform automated tests for such a task, allowing thus to automatically track changes in the spectrum. The performance of these detectors is affected by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the recorded signal as well as the length of the available data. The Global F Test (GFT) is a promising detector that can be used to test whether there is a statistically significant difference between the spectrum before and during an event. In fact, this detector has proved useful in the detection of event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS), where only amplitude, but not the phase, changes are locked to the stimulus. In order to improve the statistical power of the GFT (for the same length of recording), multiple channels recorded simultaneously can be included. This concept is called Multivariate Response Detection. The aim of the current work is to extend the GFT to the multivariate (multichannel) case. Methods: Firstly, the single channel normalization of the GFT is presented as a new ORD detector the global Beta test (GBT). After that, three multivariate extensions of this new test are derived. The critical values used in the detection of spectral changes are obtained by using theoretical distributions, and where this is intractable, by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The probability of detection (PD) of each technique was estimated using simulation and was used in order to compare the detectors performance. A practical example with the electroencephalogram (EEG) from 10 volunteers under intermittent photic stimulation was also provided. Results: The statistics under both the null and alternative hypothesis could be obtained for all detectors. Simulated results for PD demonstrate the strong potential of the proposed method and the performances in EEG data are always improved with increasing number of signals. Conclusion: If more than one signal is available, then the multivariate extensions may provide significant benefit compared to the original GFT. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, phonological complexity is known to be challenging for young typically developing children and pathological populations. We investigated brain correlates of phonological processing and their age-related changes with a passive change-detection protocol including stimuli of varying phonological complexity, which allowed comparing responses to simple and complex phonological deviancies. Mismatch Negativity (MMN) and Late Discriminative Negativity (LDN) responses were recorded in both school-age children (n = 22) and adults (n = 24). MMN was similar for simple and complex phonological deviancy in both groups, whereas LDN appeared to be modulated by phonological complexity, albeit with different patterns according to age. In response to complex phonological change, children displayed a larger LDN response with a typical fronto-central scalp distribution, while adults showed an additional right-posterior activity but no larger amplitude than for simple change. Thus, LDN appears to be a good electrophysiological index of phonological complexity processing. This study validated the use of the LDN through this protocol for the investigation of phonological complexity processing throughout the development.

To evoke and detect pareidolias in patients, a noise pareidolia test was recently developed, although its task-dependent mechanisms are yet to be revealed. When subjected to this test, we hypothesized that patients exhibiting pareidolias would show altered top-down influence of visual processing allowing us to demonstrate the influence of pareidolic illusionary behaviour in Parkinson's disease patients. To that end, we evaluated eye-movement strategies and fixation-related presaccadic activity on scalp EEG when participants performed the test. Twelve healthy controls and 21 Parkinson's disease patients, evaluated for cognitive, visuo-spatial and executive functions, took a modified computer-based version of the noise pareidolia test in a free-viewing EEG eye-tracking experiment. Eye-tracking metrics (fixation-related durations and counts) documented the eye movement behaviour employed in correct responses (face/noise) and misperceptions (pareidolia/missed) during early and late visual search conditions. Simultaneously, EEG recorded the presaccadic activity in frontal and parietal areas of the brain. Based on the noise pareidolia test scores, we found certain Parkinson's disease patients exhibited pareidolias whereas others did not. ANOVA on eyetracking data showed that patients dwelled significantly longer to detect faces and pareidolias which affected both global and local search dynamics depending on their visuo-perceptual status. Presaccadic activity in parietal electrodes for the groups was positive for faces and pareidolias, and negative for noise, though these results depended mainly on saccade size. However, patients sensitive to pareidolias showed a significantly higher presaccadic potential on frontal electrodes independent of saccade sizes, suggesting a stronger frontal activation for pareidolic stimuli. We concluded with the following interpretations (i) the noise pareidolia test specifically characterizes visuo-perceptual inadequacies in patients despite their wide range of cognitive scores, (ii) Parkinson's disease patients dwell longer to converge attention to pareidolic stimuli due to abnormal saccade generation proportional to their visuoperceptual deficit during early search, and during late search, due to time-independent alteration of visual attentional network and (iii) patients with pareidolias show increased frontal activation reflecting the allocation of attention to irrelevant targets that express the pareidolic phenomenon. While the disease per se alters the visuo-perceptual and oculomotor dynamics, pareidolias occur in Parkinson's disease due to an abnormal top-down modulation of visual processing that affects visual attention and guidance to ambiguous stimuli.

Neural mechanisms underlying expectation-dependent inhibition of distracting information	ELIFE			English	Article							WORKING-MEMORY; VISUAL-SEARCH; STATISTICAL REGULARITIES; ATTENTION; TARGET; SUPPRESSION; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; SOFTWARE; CAPTURE	Predictions based on learned statistical regularities in the visual world have been shown to facilitate attention and goal-directed behavior by sharpening the sensory representation of goal-relevant stimuli in advance. Yet, how the brain learns to ignore predictable goal-irrelevant or distracting information is unclear. Here, we used EEG and a visual search task in which the predictability of a distractor's location and/or spatial frequency was manipulated to determine how spatial and feature distractor expectations are neurally implemented and reduce distractor interference. We find that expected distractor features could not only be decoded pre-stimulus, but their representation differed from the representation of that same feature when part of the target. Spatial distractor expectations did not induce changes in preparatory neural activity, but a strongly reduced Pd, an ERP index of inhibition. These results demonstrate that neural effects of statistical learning critically depend on the task relevance and dimension (spatial, feature) of predictions.

J	Opitz, A; Beste, C; Stock, AK				Opitz, Antje; Beste, Christian; Stock, Ann-Kathrin			Using temporal EEG signal decomposition to identify specific neurophysiological correlates of distractor-response bindings proposed by the theory of event coding	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Distractor-response binding; EEG; Residue iteration decomposition; Temporo-parietal junction; Theory of event coding	LATENCY VARIABILITY; COGNITIVE CONTROL; STROOP TASK; CONFLICT; INTEGRATION; ATTENTION; ERP; PERCEPTION; RESOLUTION; CORTEX	The ability to cope with distracting information is a major requirement for goal-directed behavior. It is particularly challenged when distracting information is either potentially relevant or temporally close to goal-directed responses, resulting in so-called distractor-response bindings. According to the theory of event coding (TEC), distractor-response bindings should be reflected by processes in the event file, but not in object file (which stores stimulus features) or the action file (which stores response features). But even though the predictions of this theory are quite elaborated, their electrophysiological underpinnings and the associated functional neuroanatomical structures have remained largely elusive. To examine this, we used a distractor-response binding paradigm in combination with temporal EEG signal decomposition (RIDE) and source localization techniques. We showed that distractor-response binding effects are exclusively evident in the N450 time window of the central C-cluster. Source reconstructions revealed that distractor-response binding effects were associated with brain regions involved in updating internal representations by using task-relevant information to decide on response execution (temporo-parietal junction, BA40), alongside with brain regions involved in conflict resolution processes (right middle frontal gyrus, BA8). Our results suggest that RIDE can be used to dissociate binding processes from stimulus- and response-related processes. On top of this, the results of EEG decomposition match the key assumption of the TEC, that distractor-response bindings occur in event files, but not in object files or action files. The results show how cognitive-theoretical frameworks, such as the TEC, can directly be mapped onto the underlying neurophysiological processes using EEG signal decomposition.

Conflict monitoring processes are required to cope with situations where one or multiple conflicts occur. It has been suggested, that medial-frontal theta oscillations are associated with the implementation of cognitive control and that conflicts increase theta band activity. Still, a causal mechanistic understanding of theta oscillations during the resolution of combined subliminal and conscious conflicts is missing. To investigate this, we combined EEG signal decomposition methods with EEG beamforming approaches and used the obtained information to modulate theta oscillations with tACS in a second experiment. This showed that theta oscillations in the superior frontal cortex (BA6) and the left paracentral lobule encoded stimulus-related processes during the resolution of conflicts arising from both conscious and subliminal information processing. Response selection and motor-related processes encoded by theta oscillations were not similarly modulated. Thus, the joint modulation of conflicts by conscious and subliminal information affects very specific aspects of the information coded in theta oscillations. Results indicate, that entraining theta-oscillations using tACS modulates conflict resolution depending on the already existing theta activity level. In summary, the study provides further evidence that frontal theta oscillations play a crucial role in conflict monitoring and control. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

P300 amplitude stability is critical for operation of the P300 speller. The P300 has good long-term stability, but to our knowledge, short-term habituation in the P300 speller has not been studied. In the current study, 15 participants: 8 ALS patients and 7 age-matched healthy volunteers (HVs), used 2 versions of P300 spellers, Face speller and Flash speller, each for 30 minutes. The ALS group performed as well as the HVs in both spellers and HVs did better with the Face speller than Flash speller while the ALS group performed equally well in both spellers. Neither intra-run P300 habituation nor inter-run P300 habituation was found. The P300 speller could be a reliable communication device for individuals with ALS.

Temporal Dynamics of Memory-guided Cognitive Control and Generalization of Control via Overlapping Associative Memories	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						associative memory; cognitive control; EEG; generalization	ITEM-SPECIFIC CONTROL; AUTOMATIC PROCESSES; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EPISODIC MEMORY; CONFLICT; HIPPOCAMPAL; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS; ERP; REINSTATEMENT	Goal-directed behavior can benefit from proactive adjustments of cognitive control that occur in anticipation of forthcoming cognitive control demands (CCD). Predictions of forthcoming CCD are thought to depend on learning and memory in two ways: First, through direct experience, associative encoding may link previously experienced CCD to its triggering item, such that subsequent encounters with the item serve to cue retrieval of (i.e., predict) the associated CCD. Second, in the absence of direct experience, pattern completion and mnemonic integration mechanisms may allow CCD to be generalized from its associated item to other items related in memory. While extant behavioral evidence documents both types of CCD prediction, the neurocognitive mechanisms giving rise to these predictions remain largely unexplored. Here, we tested two hypotheses: (1) memory-guided predictions about CCD precede control adjustments due to the actual CCD required; and (2) generalization of CCD can be accomplished through integration mechanisms that link partially overlapping CCD-item and item-item associations in memory. Supporting these hypotheses, the temporal dynamics of theta and alpha power in human electroencephalography data (n = 43, 26 females) revealed that an associative CCD effect emerges earlier than interaction effects involving actual CCD. Furthermore, generalization of CCD from one item (X) to another item (Y) was predicted by a decrease in alpha power following the presentation of the X-Y pair. These findings advance understanding of the mechanisms underlying memory-guided adjustments of cognitive control.

Previous research has demonstrated that quantitative feedback results in better performance than qualitative feedback. However, the data supporting a quantitative feedback advantage are not conclusive and further little work has been done to examine the mechanistic neural differences that underlie the relative benefits of quantitative and qualitative feedback. To address these issues, participants learned a simple motor task in quantitative and qualitative feedback conditions while electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded. We found that participants were more accurate and had a larger neural response - the feedback related negativity - when qualitative feedback was provided. Our data suggest that qualitative feedback is more advantageous than quantitative feedback during the early stages of skill acquisition. Additionally, our findings support previous work suggesting that a reinforcement learning system within the human medial-frontal cortex plays a key role in motor skill acquisition.

Recent theories have suggested that the P3b is triggered by phasic activation of the locus-coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) system, an important control center implicated in facilitating optimal task-relevant behavior. Previous research has reported strong correlations between pupil dilation and LC activity, suggesting that pupil diameter is a useful indicator for ongoing LC-NE activity. Given the strong relationship between LC activity and pupil dilation, if the P3b is driven by phasic LC activity, there should be a robust trial-to-trial relationship with the phasic pupillary dilation response (PDR). However, previous work examining relationships between concurrently recorded pupillary and P3b responses has not supported this. One possibility is that the relationship between the measures might be carried primarily by either inter-individual (i.e., between-participant) or intra-individual (i.e., within-participant) contributions to coupling, and prior work has not systematically delineated these relationships. Doing so in the current study, we do not find evidence for either inter-individual or intra-individual relationships between the PDR and P3b responses. However, baseline pupil dilation did predict the P3b. Interestingly, both the PDR and P3b independently predicted inter-individual and intra-individual variability in decision response time. Implications for the LC-P3b hypothesis are discussed.

However, few studies have investigated the electrophysiological mechanisms of response activation and response inhibition in these patients. In this study, we employ an event-related potentials (ERPs) technique to quantitatively assess response activation and inhibition before and after the surgical treatment of prolactinomas. A 64-electrode electroencephalogram (EEG) skullcap was used to record the brain activity in 20 pre-operative patients, 20 follow-up post-operative patients, and 20 healthy controls (HCs) while performing the visual Go/Nogo task. As expected, we identified P300 across all study populations that could reflect response activation and inhibition. Across the three groups, the Nogo stimuli evoked larger frontal-central P300 than the Go stimuli did. In contrast, the Go trials elicited larger parietal P300 than the Nogo trials did. The peak latency of P300 was significantly delayed in both the pre-operative and the post-operative groups compared to the HCs. The amplitude of P300 in both the Go and the Nogo conditions was significantly decreased in the pre-operative patients compared with that of the HCs. At 6 months post-operatively, the prolactinoma patients showed an increase in amplitude of P300 during both the Go and the Nogo tasks. These findings indicate that the prolactinoma patients suffer from deficits in response activation and inhibition, which could be improved by surgical treatment.

Nevertheless, many deaf bilinguals master a spoken language with input merely based on visual cues like mouth representations of spoken words and orthographic representations of written words. Recent findings further suggest that processing of words involves cross-language cross-modal co-activation of signs in deaf and hearing bilinguals. Extending these findings in the present ERP-study, we recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) of fifteen congenitally deaf bilinguals of German Sign Language (DGS) (native L1) and German (early L2) as they saw videos of semantically and grammatically acceptable sentences in DGS. Within these DGS-sentences, two signs functioned as prime and target. Prime and target signs either had an overt phonological overlap as signs (phonological priming in DGS), or were phonologically unrelated as signs but had a covert orthographic overlap in their written German translation (orthographic priming in German). Results showed a significant priming effect for both conditions. Target signs that were either phonologically related as signs or had an underlying orthographic overlap in their written German translation engendered a less negative going polarity in the electrophysiological signal compared to overall unrelated control targets. We thus provide first evidence that deaf bilinguals co-activate their secondly acquired `spoken/written' language German during whole sentence processing of their native sign language DGS.

Cognitive modelling reveals distinct electrophysiological markers of decision confidence and error monitoring	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Metacognition; Confidence; Event-related potentials; Cognitive modelling; ERN/Ne; Pe	SIGNAL-DETECTION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; CHOICE; METACOGNITION; PERFORMANCE; COMPONENTS; AWARENESS; COMPUTATION; POTENTIALS; NEGATIVITY	Is confidence in perceptual decisions generated by the same brain processes as decision itself, or does confidence require metacognitive processes following up on the decision? In a masked orientation task with varying stimulus-onset-asynchrony, we used EEG and cognitive modelling to trace the timing of the neural correlates of confidence. Confidence reported by human observers increased with stimulus-onset-asynchrony in correct and to a lesser degree in incorrect trials, a pattern incompatible with established models of confidence. Electrophysiological activity was associated with confidence in two different time periods, namely 350-500 ms after stimulus onset and 250-350 ms after the response. Cognitive modelling revealed that only the activity following on the stimulus exhibited the same statistical regularities as confidence, while the statistical pattern of the activity following the response was incompatible with confidence. It is argued that electrophysiological markers of confidence and error awareness are at least in parts distinct.

J	Schreiter, ML; Beste, C				Schreiter, Marie L.; Beste, Christian			Inflexible adjustment of expectations affects cognitive-emotional conflict control in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder	CORTEX			English	Article						Autism spectrum disorder; Conflict control; Emotion; EEG; Precision weighting	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; INSULA ACTIVATION; DECISION-MAKING; VARIABILITY; MECHANISMS; RESOLUTION; DECOMPOSITION; INFORMATION	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is marked by a range of challenges including cognitive and socio-emotional differences as well as difficulties to flexibly adjust to unpredictable situations. It has recently been suggested that people with ASD hold rigid expectations about upcoming events that tend to be shaped by information that is unlikely to repeat in the future. Prior expectations play an important role for proactive conflict control exemplified in the Gratton, or the congruency sequence effect (CSE). Here, we examine cognitive-emotional conflict control in ASD compared to neuro-typical controls and the underlying neurophysiological and functional neuroanatomical processes using EEG methods and an emotional Stroop task with sequentially manipulated trial transitions. We show that, in ASD the presence of cognitive-emotional conflict in a previous trial affects the ability to process emotional conflict in a subsequent trial. That is, ASD individuals show a prominent CSE effect on emotional stimuli while neuro-typical controls do not. The neurophysiological data revealed that this proactive reconfiguration of stimulus-response associations during conflict resolution is associated with activation within anterior cingulate (BA24 and 32) and insular cortices (BA13). Purely perceptual, attentional and motor response-related processes could not explain these effects. Our results suggest that when faced with cognitive-emotional conflict, ASD individuals seem to rely on their subjective expectation about an upcoming trial type independent of the objective likelihood of that upcoming trial transition. The present results lend support to theoretical propositions on precision weighting of prediction error in ASD and have theoretical and clinical implications in the context of cognitive-emotional regulation and conflict control.

Transcranial random noise stimulation is more effective than transcranial direct current stimulation for enhancing working memory in healthy individuals: Behavioural and electrophysiological evidence	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						tDCS; tRNS; DLPFC; EEG; Working memory	DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NONINVASIVE BRAIN-STIMULATION; SERIAL-ADDITION TASK; OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA; TDCS; ENHANCEMENT; MAINTENANCE; COGNITION; LOAD	Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to improve working memory (WM) performance in healthy individuals, however effects tend to be modest and variable. Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) can be delivered with a direct-current offset (DC-offset) to induce equal or even greater effects on cortical excitability than tDCS. To-date, no research has directly compared the effects of these techniques on WM performance or underlying neurophysiological activity. Objective: To compare the effects of anodal tDCS, tRNS + DC-offset, or sham stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on WM performance and task-related EEG oscillatory activity in healthy adults. Methods: Using a between-subjects design, 49 participants were allocated to receive either anodal tDCS (N = 16), high-frequency tRNS + DC-offset (N = 16), or sham stimulation (N = 17) to the left DLPFC. Changes in WM performance were assessed using the Sternberg WM task completed before and 5- and 25-min post-stimulation. Event-related synchronisation/desynchronisation (ERS/ERD) of oscillatory activity was analysed from EEG recorded during WM encoding and maintenance. Results: tRNS induced more pronounced and consistent enhancements in WM accuracy when compared to both tDCS and sham stimulation. Improvements in WM performance following tRNS were accompanied by increased theta ERS and diminished gamma ERD during WM encoding, which were significantly greater than those observed following anodal tDCS or sham stimulation. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the potential of tRNS + DC-offset to modulate cognitive and electrophysiological measures of WM and raise the possibility that tRNS + DC-offset may be more effective and reliable than tDCS for enhancing WM performance in healthy individuals.

Autistic traits modulate cortical responses to affective but not discriminative touch	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						C-tactile afferent; pleasant touch; social touch; EEG; ultra-late potential	UNMYELINATED TACTILE AFFERENTS; SPECTRUM QUOTIENT AQ; PLEASANT TOUCH; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; HAIRY SKIN; ATTENTION; BRAIN; P300; REPRESENTATION; STIMULATION	The sense of touch is primarily considered a discriminative and exteroceptive sense, facilitating the detection, manipulation and exploration of objects, via an array of low-threshold mechanoreceptors and fast conducting A-beta (A beta) afferents. However, a class of unmyelinated, low-threshold mechanoreceptors identified in the hairy skin of mammals have been proposed to constitute a second, anatomically distinct system coding the affective qualities of touch. Unlike A beta s, which increase their firing rate linearly with the velocity of a stimulus moving across their receptive field, the response of these C-tactile afferents (CTs) is described by an inverted 'U' curve fit, responding optimally to a skin temperature stimulus moving at between 1 and 10 cm/s. Given the distinct velocity tuning of these fast and slow touch fibres, here we used event-related potentials to compare the time course of neural responses to 1st (fast) and 2nd (slow) touch systems. We identified a higher amplitude P300 in response to fast, A beta-targeted, versus slow CT-targeted, stroking touch. In contrast, we identified a previously described, C-fibre specific, ultra-late potential (ULP) associated with CT-targeted input. Of special note as regards the function of CTs is that the amplitude of the ULP was negatively correlated with self-reported levels of autistic traits, which is consistent with the hypothesized affective and social significance of this response. Taken together, these findings provide further support for distinct discriminative and affective touch systems and suggests the temporal resolution of EEG provides an as yet underutilized tool for exploring individual differences in response sensitivity to CT-targeted touch.

Signal-driven and expectation-driven processing of accent types	LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Prosodic prominence; accent types; attention; rERPs; positivity	REGRESSION-BASED ESTIMATION; BASE-LINE CORRECTION; HIGH-PASS FILTERS; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; INFORMATION STATUS; NEURAL MECHANISMS; ERP; FOCUS; ATTENTION	This paper investigates neurophysiological correlates of prosodic prominence in German with two EEG experiments. Experiment 1 tested different degrees of prominence (three accent types: L+H*, H*, H+L* and deaccentuation) in the absence of context, making the acoustic signal the only source for attention orienting. Experiment 2 tested L+H* and H+L* accents in relation to contexts such as "Guess what happened today" triggering expectations as to how exciting the following utterance will be. Results reveal that prominence cues that attract attention, such as a signal-driven high level of prosodic prominence or a content-driven expression of excitement, engender positivities of varying latency. Furthermore, contextual expectations trigger prediction errors, e.g. deviations from an appropriate level of prosodic prominence result in a negative ERP deflection. Hence, the data suggest that the two core processes - attentional orientation and predictive processing - reflect discrete stages in the construction of a mental representation during real-time comprehension.

In a previous study, we showed that task modulation of print-tuning started at around 170 ms after stimulus presentation in the N1 offset of the ERP, while the N1 onset was yet unaffected. Here we test how prior category-level expectation affects visual-orthographic processing. Familiar, left/right-structured Chinese characters and stroke number matched, unfamiliar Korean characters were presented, while expectation about the upcoming stimuli was manipulated with green and blue colored frames (high Chinese vs. high Korean expectation). EEG data of 18 native Chinese speakers were recorded while participants performed an expectation judgment task. Results from occipito-temporal and whole map analyses revealed that effects of prior expectation changed throughout the N1. Accordingly in the N1 onset, a print tuning main effect was found, with a stronger N1 to Chinese characters than Korean characters, irrespective of expectation. In the N1 offset, an expectation-bycharacter interaction was observed at the whole map level, with a more negative N1 to Korean characters than Chinese characters when expecting a Chinese character, but no such difference when expecting a Korean character. Moreover, the expectation-by-character interaction continued to the N250, with similar responses to Chinese and Korean characters under the Chinese expectation condition, while less negative N250 to Korean than Chinese under the Korean expectation condition. Taken together, the current study provides evidence that prior category-level expectation starts to take effect at an early stage even within 200 ms by facilitating the processing of expected stimuli, suggesting that category-level expectation can influence early visual-orthographic processing during word recognition.

If we are to measure such individual interoceptive processes objectively and validly, we need an appropriate method.This study tests the validity of an evaluation method of motor heartbeat detection tasks, which accounts for valid reactions (hits) and invalid reactions in order to obtain a measure of cardiac sensitivity.This method is based on the signal-detection theory, and its sensitivity index (d') is intended to map actual cardiac sensitivity independently of the individual response bias. Two questions were central: (1) Is it possible to identify valid reactions in the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP) by means of a P300 component? (2) Is d' a valid indicator of cardiac sensitivity? The results of the current study support both assumptions.Thus, the (visceroceptive) P300 proves to be an indicator of heartbeat detection, and d" functions as a parameter for separating good from bad heartbeat detectors - and in doing so it performs even better than a (comparatively good) conventional parameter.The study validates d` as a measure of cardiac sensitivity and provides new insights into the functional significance of the HEP as a signature of cortical processing of afferent cardiovascular signals.

However, while there is some neurophysiological evidence for mechanisms that underlie the phenomenon, the neural basis of visually induced effects on auditory perception remains unknown. Combining fMRI and EEG with psychophysical measurements in two independent studies, we identified the neural underpinnings and temporal dynamics of visually induced auditory enhancement. Lower- and higher-intensity sounds were paired with a non-informative visual stimulus, while participants performed an auditory detection task. Behaviourally, visual co-stimulation enhanced auditory sensitivity. Using fMRI, enhanced BOLD signals were observed in primary auditory cortex for low-intensity audiovisual stimuli which scaled with subject-specific enhancement in perceptual sensitivity. Concordantly, a modulation of event-related potentials could already be observed over frontal electrodes at an early latency (30-80 ms), which again scaled with subject-specific behavioural benefits. Later modulations starting around 280 ms, that is in the time range of the P3, did not fit this pattern of brain-behaviour correspondence. Hence, the latency of the corresponding fMRI-EEG brain-behaviour modulation points at an early interplay of visual and auditory signals in low-level auditory cortex, potentially mediated by crosstalk at the level of the thalamus. However, fMRI signals in primary auditory cortex, auditory thalamus and the P50 for higher-intensity auditory stimuli were also elevated by visual co-stimulation (in the absence of any behavioural effect) suggesting a general, intensity-independent integration mechanism. We propose that this automatic interaction occurs at the level of the thalamus and might signify a first step of audiovisual interplay necessary for visually induced perceptual enhancement of auditory perception.

Individuals With Autism Have No Detectable Deficit in Neural Markers of Prediction Error When Presented With Auditory Rhythms of Varied Temporal Complexity	AUTISM RESEARCH			English	Article						auditory perceptual disorders; autism spectrum disorder; communication disorders; electroencephalography; evoked potentials; auditory; mismatch negativity	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; SPECTRUM DISORDER; ASPERGER-SYNDROME; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; SPEECH SOUNDS; CHILDREN; ATTENTION; DISCRIMINATION	The brain's ability to encode temporal patterns and predict upcoming events is critical for speech perception and other aspects of social communication. Deficits in predictive coding may contribute to difficulties with social communication and overreliance on repetitive predictable environments in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Using a mismatch negativity (MMN) task involving rhythmic tone sequences of varying complexity, we tested the hypotheses that (1) individuals with ASD have reduced MMN response to auditory stimuli that deviate in presentation timing from expected patterns, particularly as pattern complexity increases and (2) amplitude of MMN signal is inversely correlated with level of impairment in social communication and repetitive behaviors. Electroencephalography was acquired as individuals (age 6-21 years) listened to repeated five-rhythm tones that varied in the Shannon entropy of the rhythm across three conditions (zero, medium-1 bit, and high-2 bit entropy). The majority of the tones conformed to the established rhythm (standard tones); occasionally the fourth tone was temporally shifted relative to its expected time of occurrence (deviant tones). Social communication and repetitive behaviors were measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale and Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised. Both neurotypical controls (n= 19) and individuals with ASD (n= 21) show stepwise decreases in MMN as a function of increasing entropy. Contrary to the result forecasted by a predictive coding hypothesis, individuals with ASD do not differ from controls in these neural mechanisms of prediction error to auditory rhythms of varied temporal complexity, and there is no relationship between these signals and social communication or repetitive behavior measures. Lay summary We tested the idea that the brain's ability to use previous experience to influence processing of sounds is weaker in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) than in neurotypical individuals. We found no difference between individuals with ASD and neurotypical controls in brain wave responses to sounds that occurred earlier than expected in either simple or complex rhythms. There was also no relationship between these brain waves and social communication or repetitive behavior scores.

However, the extent to which this frequency-tagged response goes beyond the association of common physical features of the periodically repeated face identity remains unknown. Here we compare participants who know or do not know the very same periodically repeated face celebrity and show that long-term familiarity accounts for about 80% of the neural face identity recognition response. This familiarity advantage disappears with upside-down images. Variability in response amplitude between face identities is preserved for inverted faces and in unfamiliar participants, suggesting a contribution of within-person physical face variability and distinctiveness to about 20% of the face identity response. These observations provide the strongest difference to date in human brain response between the same famous face identities perceived as familiar or unfamiliar in an implicit task. The frequency-tagged neural response largely reflects the strengthening effect of long-term memory in the human occipito-temporal cortex, and may serve to index automatic familiar face identity recognition in individual observers.

Thus far clinical effectiveness data have only been published in a small sample of 21 ADHD patients. Therefore, this manuscript aims to replicate this effectiveness in a new sample of 114 patients treated with QEEG-informed neurofeedback, from a large multicentric dataset and to investigate potential predictors of neurofeedback response. Methods: A sample of 114 patients were included as a replication sample. Patients were treated with standard neurofeedback protocols (Sensori-Motor-Rhythm (SMR), Theta-Beta (TBR), or Slow Cortical Potential (SCP) neurofeedback), in combination with coaching and sleep hygiene advice. The ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were assessed at baseline, every 10th session, and at outtake. Holland Sleep Disorder Questionnaire (HSDQ) was assessed at baseline and outtake. Response was defined as >= 25% reduction (R25), 5 >= 0% reduction (R50), and remission. Predictive analyses were focused on predicting remission status. Results: In the current sample, response rates were 85% (R25), 70% (R50), and remission was 55% and clinical effectiveness was not significantly different from the original 2012 sample. Non-remitters exhibited significantly higher baseline hyperactivity ratings. Women who remitted had significantly shorter P300 latencies and boys who remitted had significantly lower iAPF's. Discussion: In the current sample, clinical effectiveness was replicated, suggesting it is possible to assign patients to a protocol based on their individual baseline QEEG to enhance signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, remitters had lower baseline hyperactivity scores. Likewise, female remitters had shorter P300 latencies, whereas boys who remitted have a lower iAPF. Our data suggests initial specificity in treatment allocation, yet further studies are needed to replicate the predictors of neurofeedback remission.

Our objective was to investigate the pathophysiology underlying the task specificity of this disorder using EEG. We hypothesized that premotor-parietal connectivity will be lower in WC patients specifically during handwriting and motor imagery of handwriting. Methods: We recruited 15 WC patients and 15 healthy controls. EEG was recorded while participants performed 4 tasks - writing with a pencil, sharpening a pencil, imagining writing and imagining sharpening. We determined the connectivity changes between relevant brain regions during these tasks. Results: We found reduced interhemispheric alpha coherence in the sensorimotor areas in WC patients exclusively during handwriting. WC patients also showed less reduction of task-related beta spectral power and a trend for reduced premotor-parietal coherence during motor tasks. Conclusion: We could not confirm an abnormality in premotor-parietal connectivity specific to handwriting by this method. However, there was a task-specific reduction in interhemispheric alpha connectivity in WC patients, whose behavioral correlate remains unknown. Significance: Interhemispheric alpha connectivity can be a potential interventional target in WC.

However, it remains unclear whether these changes are driven by increased reward sensitivity, altered reward predictions, enhanced cognitive control, or a combination of these effects. To address this question, we asked 36 participants to perform a simple gambling task where feedback valence (reward vs. no-reward), its magnitude (small vs. large reward), and expectancy (expected vs. unexpected) were manipulated in a factorial design, while 64-channel EEG was recorded concurrently. We performed standard ERP analyses (FRN and RewP) as well as time-frequency decompositions (FM theta) of feedback-locked EEG data. Subjective reports showed that large rewards were more liked and expected than small ones. At the EEG level, increasing magnitude led to a larger RewP irrespective of expectancy, whereas the FRN was not influenced by this manipulation. In comparison, FM theta power was overall increased when reward magnitude was large, except if it was unexpected. These results show dissociable effects of reward magnitude on the RewP and FM theta power. Further, they suggest, that although large reward magnitude boosts reward processing (RewP), it can nonetheless undermine the need for enhanced cognitive control (FM theta) in case reward is unexpected. We discuss these new results in terms of optimistic bias or positive mood resulting from an increased reward magnitude.

In this case series, we explored the association between topographic and global brain network properties and prognosis in patients with DOC. We recorded high-density electroencephalograms in three patients with acute or chronic DOC, two of whom also underwent an anesthetic protocol. In these two cases, we compared functional network motifs, network hubs and power topography (i.e. topographic network properties), as well as relative power and graph theoretical measures (i.e. global network properties), at baseline, during exposure to anesthesia and after recovery from anesthesia. We also compared these properties to a group of healthy, conscious controls. At baseline, the topographic distribution of nodes participating in alpha motifs resembled conscious controls in patients who later recovered consciousness and high relative power in the delta band was associated with a negative outcome. Strikingly, the reorganization of network motifs, network hubs and power topography under anesthesia followed by their return to a baseline patterns upon recovery from anesthesia, was associated with recovery of consciousness. Our findings suggest that topographic network properties measured at the single-electrode level might provide more prognostic information than global network properties that are averaged across the brain network. In addition, we propose that the brain network's capacity to reorganize in response to a perturbation is a precursor to the recovery of consciousness in DOC patients.

However, the electrophysiological mechanisms of response activation and response inhibition in prolactinomas remain unclear. We recorded participants' scalp electmencephalography (EEG) in a visual Go/Nogo task. Compared to the healthy controls (HCs), the patients demonstrated worse performance and their prolactin (PRL) levels negatively correlated with behavioral results. Meanwhile, patients' P300 amplitudes in the Go and Nogo conditions were smaller than the HCs. The amplitudes of N200nogo in patients were smaller than the HCs as well. Lower frontal theta power was found in the patients than the HCs in both Go and Nogo conditions, which indicated a deficit in response activation and inhibition. Moreover, the PRL levels mediated the relationship between frontal theta power and behavior performance, implying that lower frontal theta power caused the dysfunction of response control by abnormally high PRL levels. Patients also showed lower occipital alpha power than the HCs, which suggested that the impaired response inhibition may arise from deficient attention control.

In the current study we aimed to extend the neurophysiological studies regarding body perception by investigating the perception of human body posture to provide insights into the cognitive mechanisms responsive to bodily form, and the processing of its attractiveness. To achieve these aims, we used the contrapposto posture which creates an exaggeration of low waist to hip ratio (WHR), an indicator of women's attractiveness. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded while participants completed both (i) an oddball task presenting female body forms differing in pose (contrapposto vs. standing) and viewing angle (anterior vs. posterior), and (ii) a subsequent active attractiveness judgement task. Behavioral results showed that a contrapposto pose is considered more attractive than a neutral standing pose. Results at the neural level showed that body posture modulates the visual information processing in early ERP components, indicating attentional variations depending on human body posture; as well as in late components, indicating further differences in attention and attractiveness judgement of stimuli varying in body pose. Furthermore, the LORETA results identified the middle temporal gyrus as well as angular gyrus as the key brain regions activated in association with the perception and attractiveness judgment of females' bodies with different body poses. Overall, the current paper suggests the evolutionary adaptive preference for lower WHRs as in the contrapposto pose activating brain regions associated with visual perception and attractiveness judgement.

Physical Salience and Value-Driven Salience Operate through Different Neural Mechanisms to Enhance Attentional Selection	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention; attentional capture; EEG; N2pc; reward; value	VISUAL-ATTENTION; CAPTURE; DYNAMICS; PRIORITY; COLOR	Previous studies have indicated that both increased physical salience and increased reward-value salience of a target improve behavioral measures of attentional selection. It is unclear, however, whether these two forms of salience interact with attentional networks through similar or different neural mechanisms, and what such differences might be. We examined this question by separately manipulating both the value-driven and physical salience of targets in a visual search task while recording response times (RTs) and event-related potentials, focusing on the attentional-orienting-sensitive N2pc event-related potential component. Human participants of both sexes searched arrays for targets of either a high-physical-salience color or one of two low-physical-salience colors across three experimental phases. The first phase ("baseline") offered no rewards. RT and N2pc latencies were shorter for high-physical-salience targets, indicating faster attentional orienting. In the second phase ("equal-reward"), a low monetary reward was given for fast correct responses for all target types. This reward context improved overall performance, similarly shortening RTs and enhancing N2pc amplitudes for all target types, but with no change in N2pc latencies. In the third phase ("selective-reward"), the reward rate was made selectively higher for one of the two low-physical-salience colors, resulting in their RTs becoming as fast as the high-physical-salience targets. Despite the equally fast RTs, the N2pc's for these low-physical-salience, high-value targets remained later than for high-physical-salience targets, instead eliciting significantly larger N2pc's. These results suggest that enhanced physical salience leads to faster attentional orienting, but value-driven salience to stronger attentional orienting, underscoring the utilization of different underlying mechanisms.

A Minimal Biophysical Model of Neocortical Pyramidal Cells: Implications for Frontal Cortex Microcircuitry and Field Potential Generation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						biophysical modeling; cognitive control; cortical microcircuitry; EEG; LFP sources; pyramidal cells	PERSISTENT SODIUM CURRENT; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DISTAL APICAL DENDRITES; GATED K+ CHANNELS; COINCIDENCE DETECTION; CELLULAR MECHANISM; CA2+ CHANNELS; NEURONS; INTEGRATION; CONNECTIONS	Ca2+ spikes initiated in the distal trunk of layer 5 pyramidal cells (PCs) underlie nonlinear dynamic changes in the gain of cellular response, critical for top-down control of cortical processing. Detailed models with many compartments and dozens of ionic channels can account for this Ca(2+)spike-dependent gain and associated critical frequency. However, current models do not account for all known Ca2+-dependent features. Previous attempts to include more features have required increasing complexity, limiting their interpretability and utility for studying large population dynamics. We overcome these limitations in a minimal two-compartment biophysical model. In our model, a basal-dendrites/somatic compartment included fast-inactivating Na+ and delayed-rectifier K+ conductances, while an apical-dendrites/trunk compartment included persistent Na+, hyperpolarization-activated cation (I h ), slow-inactivating K+, muscarinic K+, and Ca2+ L-type. The model replicated the Ca2+ spike morphology and its critical frequency plus three other defining features of layer 5 PC synaptic integration: linear frequency-current relationships, back-propagation-activated Ca2+ spike firing, and a shift in the critical frequency by blocking Th. Simulating 1000 synchronized layer 5 PCs, we reproduced the current source density patterns evoked by Ca2+ spikes and describe resulting medial-frontal EEG on a male macaque monkey. We reproduced changes in the current source density when I-h was blocked. Thus, a two-compartment model with five crucial ionic currents in the apical dendrites reproduces all features of these neurons. We discuss the utility of this minimal model to study the microcircuitry of agranular areas of the frontal lobe involved in cognitive control and responsible for event-related potentials, such as the error-related negativity.

Due to the fact that literature shows that even low doses of caffeine may improve cognitive performance, we investigated an acute effect of a single dose of a caffeinated energy dietary supplement, on attention and motor responses by means of event related potentials. Healthy volunteers were examined in double blind, placebo controlled study. EEG recordings from 32 channels were performed in three sessions: before the supplementation (session 1), 30 min after the supplementation (session 2) and 90 min after the supplementation (session 3) in three tasks: visual P3, auditory P3, and motor task. Repeated measures ANOVA analysis showed reduced P3 amplitude increase after energy dietary supplementation (compared to placebo group) throughout all sessions (up to 90 min after consumption) in the visual task, and speeding the classification process observed as a decrease of P3 midpoint latency, but only 30 min after supplementation. The latter effect was present in both, but more pronounced in the visual task. Nonparametric cluster based permutation analysis showed one significant duster in the placebo group from visual P3 task (approximately between 400 and 520 ms) over the centro-parietal area, which was absent in the study group. Our results suggest that caffeinated energy dietary supplement containing only 55 mg of caffeine may enhance some attentional processes observed by changes in P3 features, but not in motor performance.

Our results show that ASD individuals present an MMN decreased amplitude and prolonged latency, without being influenced by concurrent APS. Additionally, when correlating the MMN indexes to clinical features, in the ASD + APS group, we found a negative correlation between the severity of autistic symptoms and the MMN latency in both frequency (f-MMN r = -0.810; p < 0.0001) and duration (d-MMN r = -0.650; p = 0.006) deviants. Thus, our results may provide a more informative characterization of the ASD sub-phenotype when associated with APS, highlighting the need for further longitudinal investigations.

A panel of Australasian sleep professionals developed the commentary. Each member was tasked with reviewing an assigned section and reporting back with potential AASM Manual clarifications and alterations. These suggestions were evaluated by the panel and ultimately resulted in the recommendations in this document. The panel recognised that the AASM manual significantly advanced the standardisation of polysomnography recording, analysis, and reporting; however, there were sections of the AASM Manual where the panel determined there were clarifications, additions, or alterations required. Some of the key panel recommendations included: (1) advice to exclude arousals in awake epochs in the arousal index, (2) recommendation of a single hypopnoea definition, as well as single options for EEG and EOG placements, (3) a minimum duration for the central and mixed components of a mixed apnoea, (4) the addition of a baseline definition for scoring respiratory events, (5) the addition of criteria for defining oxygen desaturation, and (6) advice change so that the scoring and reporting of respiratory effort-related arousals (RERAs) and snoring is 'recommended' rather than 'optional'. While it is anticipated that the recommendations will improve standardisation across Australasian sleep services many of the recommendations are also relevant in a global setting and should be considered for inclusion in future updates of the AASM Manual.

Heart rate, skin conductance responses (SCRs) and electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded. A spatiotemporal principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the EEG, and ANCOVAs controlling for participants' state- and trait-anxiety and patients' medication were performed to assess the effects of visual eccentricity and emotion. Unlike HC, DP showed for CV stimulation 1/ greater sensitivity with a response bias toward unpleasant pictures, 2/ larger SCRs, especially to unpleasant pictures, and 3/ deeper cardiac deceleration. Furthermore, eccentricity and emotion modulated cerebral components. Finally, results bring a new vista on visual capture of negative information and support methods to enlarge the attentional span of depressed patients.

This paper explores (1) how such ads affect consumers' product preferences at the gazing stage (initial stage of exposure to the ad) and evaluation stage (final product preference), and (2) which type of product (utilitarian vs. hedonic) is more suited to such ads. We used an electroencephalogram to record participants' product preferences at the gazing stage and self-reported product preferences at the evaluation stage. The results indicated that participants preferred ads with high sex appeal at the gazing stage and ads with low sex appeal at the evaluation stage. Further, compared to utilitarian products, hedonic products were more suited to sexually appealing ads. The findings suggest that the effect of such ads on consumers' product preferences varies depending on their cognitive stage and the type of product advertised.

Interestingly, an individual's behavior and neurophysiological activity under outcome- versus intention-based interactions has not been compared directly using different endowments in the same subject and during the same session. Here, we used a mixed version of the Dictator and the Investment games, together with electroencephalography, to uncover a subject's behavior and brain activity when challenged with endowments of different sizes in contexts that call for an altruistic (outcome-based) versus a reciprocal (intention-based) response. We found that subjects displayed positive or negative reciprocity (reciprocal responses greater or smaller than that for altruism, respectively) depending on the amount of trust they received. Furthermore, a subject's late frontal negativity differed between conditions, predicting responses to trust in intentions-based trials. Finally, brain regions related with mentalizing and cognitive control were the cortical sources of this activity. Thus, our work disentangles the behavioral components present in the repayment of trust, and sheds light on the neural activity underlying the integration of outcomes and perceived intentions in human economic interactions.

Here, we investigated whether 3- to 4.5-month-old infants build causal action-effect models by focusing on behavioral and neural measures of violation of expectation. Infants had time to explore the causal link between their movements and audiovisual effects before the action-effect contingency was discontinued. We tested their ability to predict the consequences of their movements and recorded neural (EEG) and movement measures. If infants built a causal action-effect model, we expected to observe their violation of expectation in the form of a mismatch negativity (MMN) in the EEG and an extinction burst in their movement behavior after discontinuing the action-effect contingency. Our findings show that the group of infants who showed an MMN upon cessation of the contingent effect demonstrated a more pronounced limb-specific behavioral extinction burst, indicating a causal action-effect model, compared to the group of infants who did not show an MMN. These findings reveal that, in contrast to previous claims, the sense of agency is only beginning to emerge at this age.

Seeing the Intensity of a Sound-producing Event Modulates the Amplitude of the Initial Auditory Evoked Response	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; SENSORY ATTENUATION; IDENTITY PREDICTION; DEPENDENCE; LOUDNESS; SPEECH; POTENTIALS; PERCEPTION; CORTEX	An auditory event is often accompanied by characteristic visual information. For example, the sound level produced by a vigorous handclap may be related to the speed of hands as they move toward collision. Here, we tested the hypothesis that visual information about the intensity of auditory signals are capable of altering the subsequent neurophysiological response to auditory stimulation. To do this, we used EEG to measure the response of the human brain (n = 28) to the audiovisual delivery of handclaps. Depictions of a weak handclap were accompanied by auditory handclaps at low (65 dB) and intermediate (72.5 dB) sound levels, whereas depictions of a vigorous handclap were accompanied by auditory handclaps at intermediate (72.5 dB) and high (80 dB) sound levels. The dependent variable was the amplitude of the initial negative component (N1) of the auditory evoked potential. We find that identical clap sounds (intermediate level; 72.5 dB) elicited significantly lower N1 amplitudes when paired with a video of a weak clap, compared with when paired with a video of a vigorous clap. These results demonstrate that intensity predictions can affect the neural responses to auditory stimulation at very early stages (<100 msec) in sensory processing. Furthermore, the established sound-level dependence of auditory N1 amplitude suggests that such effects may serve the functional role of altering auditory responses in accordance with visual inferences. Thus, this study provides evidence that the neurally evoked response to an auditory event results from a combination of a person's beliefs with incoming auditory input.

Brain Vital Signs Detect Information Processing Differences When Neuromodulation Is Used During Cognitive Skills Training	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain vital signs; electroencephalography; event-related potential; neuromodulation; neuroplasticity; PoNS(R); cognitive training	STIMULATION; POTENTIALS; EXERCISE	Background: Neuromodulation through translingual neurostimulation (TLNS) has been shown to initiate long-lasting processes of neuronal reorganization with a variety of outcomes (i.e., neuroplasticity). Non-invasive TLNS is increasingly accessible through the Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator (PoNS(R)), a medical device that delivers electrical stimulation to the tongue to activate the trigeminal (V) and facial (VII) cranial nerves. Anecdotal reports from previous clinical studies have suggested incidental improvements in cognitive function. To objectively explore this observation, we examined TLNS-related effects on the semantic N400 brain vital sign cognitive response during cognitive skills training in healthy individuals. Methods: Thirty-seven healthy volunteers were randomized to receive simultaneous TLNS (treatment) or no TLNS (control) while undergoing cognitive skills training. Cognitive training was conducted for two 20-min sessions (morning and afternoon/evening) over 3 consecutive days. Brain vital signs were evaluated at baseline, Day 1, and Day 3. Analyses focused on cognitive processing as measured by N400 changes in amplitude and latency. Results: Over the 3-day course of cognitive training, the N400 amplitude decreased significantly in the control group due to habituation (p= 0.028). In contrast, there was no significant change in the TLNS treatment group. Conclusion: TLNS led to a sustained N400 response during cognitive skills training, as measured by the brain's vital signs framework. The study findings suggest differential learning effects due to neuromodulation, consistent with increased attention and cognitive vigilance.

Previous research showed that both tool-related (e.g., syringe) and action-related (e.g., use of the syringe) drug cues can elicit craving. However, whether the two types of drug related cues can elicit the same brain reactivity and similar degree of disinhibition is still unclear, especially because of the scarcity of ERP studies on this topic. Using a behavioral task and the ERP technique, the present study investigated the behavior reactivity and EEG characteristics shown by men addicted to heroin and healthy controls in response to tool-related and action-related drug cues. Participants were 36 men, 19 of whom were addicted to heroin and 17 of whom were healthy non-drug users, matched on age and years of education. Participants engaged in the two-choice Oddball task, which included two conditions: A. the tool condition, with a picture of a "cup" serving as the standard stimulus and pictures of drug-use tools serving as deviant stimuli; B. the action condition, with a picture of "drinking water" serving as the standard stimulus and pictures of drug-use actions serving as deviant stimuli. In this experiment, the probabilities of standard stimuli and deviant stimuli were 70% and 30%. Participants were asked to press different keys on the keyboard in response to standard stimuli and deviant stimuli as rapidly and accurately as possible. Behavioral results indicated that in men who were addicted to heroin, greater disinhibition was seen in a longer reaction time in response to action cues than tool cues. Between-group analyses of the ERP data showed that compared to the healthy controls, men who were addicted to heroin demonstrated a smaller N2 and larger P3 amplitude in response to drug related cues. Moreover, action cues elicited a smaller N2 amplitude in the heroin addicted group than the control group, especially in the frontal, central and central-parietal areas of the brain, and a larger P3 amplitude, especially in the central and parietal areas of the brain. Within-group analyses in just the heroin addicted group showed that the N2 was smaller in response to action cues versus tool cues. Meanwhile, the action cues elicited a larger amplitude of P3 than the tool cues, especially in the central, central-parietal and parietal regions of the brain. These findings provide behavioral and ERP evidence for the hypothesis that different types of drug-related cues produce different cue-induced reactivity. More specifically, drug use action stimuli, which appear to trigger greater disinhibition and greater ERP reactivity in the brain areas associated with motor resonance, should be considered in the treatment of addiction and in relapse prevention.

However, it is unclear whether the relationship holds for people with WM deficits. People with schizophrenia have marked WM deficits, and such deficits are most prominent when patients are required to process relationships between items, such as temporal order. Here, we used EEG to compare the relationship between oscillatory activity and WM performance in patients and controls. EEG was recorded as participants performed tasks requiring maintenance of complex objects ("Item") or the temporal order of objects ("Order"). In addition to testing for group differences, we examined individual differences in EEG power and WM performance across groups. Behavioral results demonstrated that patients showed impaired performance on both Item and Order trials. EEG analyses revealed that patients showed an overall reduction in alpha power, but the relationship between alpha activity and performance was preserved. In contrast, patients showed a reduction in theta power specific to Order trials, and theta power could predict performance on Order trials in controls, but not in patients. These findings demonstrate that WM impairments in patients may reflect two different processes: a general deficit in alpha oscillations and a specific deficit in theta oscillations when temporal order information must be maintained. At a broader level, the results highlight the value of characterizing brain-behavior relationships, by demonstrating that the relationship between neural oscillations and WM performance can be fundamentally disrupted in those with WM deficits.

Indirect measures of configural processing in visual cognition are the face and body inversion effects (FIE and BIE), which refer to the drop in performance when these stimuli are perceived upside-down. Albeit FIE and BIE have been well characterized at the behavioral level, much still needs to be understood in terms of the neurophysiological correlates of these effects. Thus, in the current study, the brain's electrical activity has been recorded by a 128 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) in 24 healthy participants while perceiving (upright and inverted) faces, bodies and houses. EEG data were analyzed in both the time domain (i.e., event-related potentials-ERPs) and the frequency domain [i.e., induced theta (5-7 Hz) and gamma (28-45 Hz) oscillations]. ERPs amplitude results showed increased N170 amplitude for inverted faces and bodies (compared to the same stimuli presented in canonical position) but not for houses. ERPs latency results showed delayed N170 components for inverted (vs. upright) faces, houses, but not bodies. Spectral analysis of induced oscillations indicated physiological FIE and BIE; that is decreased gamma-band synchronization over right occipito-temporal electrodes for inverted (vs. upright) faces, and increased bilateral frontoparietal theta-band synchronization for inverted (vs. upright) faces. Furthermore, increased left occipito-temporal and right frontal theta-band synchronization for upright (vs. inverted) bodies was found. Our findings, thus, demonstrate clear differences in the neurophysiological correlates of face and body perception. The neurophysiological FIE suggests disruption of feature binding processes (decrease in occipital gamma oscillations for inverted faces), together with enhanced feature-based attention (increase in frontoparietal theta oscillations for inverted faces). In contrast, the BIE may suggest that structural encoding for bodies is mediated by the first stages of configural processing (decrease in occipital theta oscillations for inverted bodies).

Decoding Hearing-Related Changes in Older Adults' Spatiotemporal Neural Processing of Speech Using Machine Learning	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						speech perception; aging; event-related potentials; hearing loss; machine learning; stability selection and control; support vector machine	AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; BOUNDARY-ELEMENT METHOD; AUDITORY-CORTEX; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; HUMAN BRAIN; PERCEPTION; NOISE; LATENCY; EEG; LATERALIZATION	Speech perception in noisy environments depends on complex interactions between sensory and cognitive systems. In older adults, such interactions may be affected, especially in those individuals who have more severe age-related hearing loss. Using a data-driven approach, we assessed the temporal (whenin time) and spatial (wherein the brain) characteristics of cortical speech-evoked responses that distinguish older adults with or without mild hearing loss. We performed source analyses to estimate cortical surface signals from the EEG recordings during a phoneme discrimination task conducted under clear and noise-degraded conditions. We computed source-level ERPs (i.e., mean activation within each ROI) from each of the 68 ROIs of the Desikan-Killiany (DK) atlas, averaged over a randomly chosen 100 trials without replacement to form feature vectors. We adopted a multivariate feature selection method called stability selection and control to choose features that are consistent over a range of model parameters. We use parameter optimized support vector machine (SVM) as a classifiers to investigate thetime courseandbrain regionsthat segregate groups and speech clarity. For clear speech perception, whole-brain data revealed a classification accuracy of 81.50% [area under the curve (AUC) 80.73%; F1-score 82.00%], distinguishing groups within similar to 60 ms after speech onset (i.e., as early as the P1 wave). We observed lower accuracy of 78.12% [AUC 77.64%; F1-score 78.00%] and delayed classification performance when speech was embedded in noise, with group segregation at 80 ms. Separate analysis using left (LH) and right hemisphere (RH) regions showed that LH speech activity was better at distinguishing hearing groups than activity measured in the RH. Moreover, stability selection analysis identified 12 brain regions (among 1428 total spatiotemporal features from 68 regions) where source activity segregated groups with >80% accuracy (clear speech); whereas 16 regions were critical for noise-degraded speech to achieve a comparable level of group segregation (78.7% accuracy). Our results identify critical time-courses and brain regions that distinguish mild hearing loss from normal hearing in older adults and confirm a larger number of active areas, particularly in RH, when processing noise-degraded speech information.

To shed light on this issue, behavioral and electroencephalographic responses were recorded while healthy heterosexual men and women completed an oddball task, which was then followed by an attractiveness judgement task. In both cases participants were presented with female body forms that combined 0.6, 0.7 or 0.8 WHRs with small or large breast sizes. Brain activity dynamics were explored using temporal principal component analysis of the event-related potentials data. Variance in the data was explained mostly by eight temporal factors for the oddball task and six for the attractiveness judgement task. Lower WHRs seemed to gather larger processing resources than higher WHRs at early perceptual-related processes during the oddball task. The less attractive WHRs and breast sizes, in contrast, seemed to boost allocation of resources later in the processing stream, which may be due to a negativity bias enhancing evaluation and decision-making processes. This inference is supported by results from the attractiveness judgement task, although the observer's gender may also play a role. Finally, LORETA analysis of the temporal factors indicate that variations in WHR may modulate activation of frontal regions, such as the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex, that are related with reward processing and decision-making; while variations in breast size may influence activity in posterior parietal regions involved in human body perception. This paper highlights the biological importance of female body physical features in defining attractiveness, and the neurophysiological correlates that are implicated.

Changes in motor preparation affect the sensory consequences of voice production in voice hearers	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Voice; Action; Feedback; Auditory verbal hallucinations; Psychosis; Continuum	COROLLARY DISCHARGE DYSFUNCTION; AUDITORY VERBAL HALLUCINATIONS; SELF-INITIATED SOUNDS; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; POTENTIAL COMPONENT; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; GENERAL-POPULATION; PREDICTION ERRORS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; INTERNAL-MODELS	Background: Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are a cardinal symptom of psychosis but are also present in 6-13% of the general population. Alterations in sensory feedback processing are a likely cause of AVH, indicative of changes in the forward model. However, it is unknown whether such alterations are related to anomalies in forming an efference copy during action preparation, selective for voices, and similar along the psychosis continuum. By directly comparing psychotic and nonclinical voice hearers (NCVH), the current study specifies whether and how AVH proneness modulates both the efference copy (Readiness Potential) and sensory feedback processing for voices and tones (N1, P2) with event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Methods: Controls with low AVH proneness (n = 15), NCVH (n = 16) and first-episode psychotic patients with AVH (n = 16) engaged in a button-press task with two types of stimuli: self-initiated and externally generated self-voices or tones during EEG recordings. Results: Groups differed in sensory feedback processing of expected and actual feedback: NCVH displayed an atypically enhanced N1 to self-initiated voices, while N1 suppression was reduced in psychotic patients. P2 suppression for voices and tones was strongest in NCVH, but absent for voices in patients. Motor activity preceding the button press was reduced in NCVH and patients, specifically for sensory feedback to self-voice in NCVH. Conclusions: These findings suggest that selective changes in sensory feedback to voice are core to AVH. These changes already show in preparatory motor activity, potentially reflecting changes in forming an efference copy. The results provide partial support for continuum models of psychosis.

Indoor Navigation for Assistive Robots using EEG Signals as Feedback	IEEE SOUTHEASTCON 2020	IEEE SoutheastCon-Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	Annual IEEE SoutheastCon Conference	2020	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE, IEEE Reg 3		assistive robots; error-related potentials; brain-computer interface; robot navigation; convolution nerual network	ERROR-RELATED POTENTIALS	Assistive robots are used by various individuals with medical disabilities to help with tasks such as movement. A subset of these individuals are patients with the locked-in syndrome; these patients cannot communicate with a robot through traditional means, such as with a joystick. This work designs a navigation scheme which allows for an assistive robot to be controlled by patients suffering locked-in syndrome, thus allowing the patient to move about their environment. Navigation is accomplished using an algorithm that combines autonomous robot movement and communicated commands from the patient. To bridge the communication gap between the patient and robot, naturally occurring error-related potentials are used. These ERPs can be used to establish communication between the patient and robot without relying on the patient interacting with physical stimuli, such as a keyboard or joystick. The commands communicated to the robot comes in the form of a binary: correct or incorrect command in response to the movements of the robot at an intersection in a structured building. While more complicated commands can be classified from event-realted potentials (ERPs), such as directional movement, this simple command allows for fast reliable classifications and responses. To make up for the lack of complexity from patient commands, the robot is leveraged to handle tasks such as wall avoidance, while a navigation algorithm is designed to minimize the inputs required by the user when taking a commonly traveled path. The benefits of using a semi-controlled robot for navigation vs a fully autonomous robot is compared in terms of the time taken to discover and navigate an initial path to a destination. This work serves as a proof of concept for the proposed semi-autonomous navigation scheme to validate future work into the proposed design.

Uniquely among sensorimotor regions, the somatosensory cortex (SCx) plays an especially important role in human emotion understanding. While distinct emotions are experienced in specific parts of the body, it remains unknown whether the SCx exhibits somatotopic activations to different emotional expressions. In the current study, we investigated if the affective response triggered by observing others' emotional face expressions leads to differential activations in SCx. Participants performed a visual facial emotion discrimination task while we measured changes in SCx topographic EEG activity by tactually stimulating two body-parts representative of the upper and lower limbs, the finger and the toe respectively. The results of the study showed an emotion specific response in the finger SCx when observing angry as opposed to sad emotional expressions, after controlling for carry-over effects of visual evoked activity. This dissociation to observed emotions was not present in toe somatosensory responses. Our results suggest that somatotopic activations of the SCx to discrete emotions might play a crucial role in understanding others' emotions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Disentangling the Effects of Processing Speed on the Association between Age Differences and Fluid Intelligence	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						intelligence; aging; mental speed; reaction time; diffusion model; EEG; ERP	DIFFUSION-MODEL ANALYSIS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; REACTION-TIME; LONGITUDINAL CHANGES; MEMORY; LIFE; SPAN; TASK; INSIGHTS; WORKING	Several studies have demonstrated that individual differences in processing speed fully mediate the association between age and intelligence, whereas the association between processing speed and intelligence cannot be explained by age differences. Because measures of processing speed reflect a plethora of cognitive and motivational processes, it cannot be determined which specific processes give rise to this mediation effect. This makes it hard to decide whether these processes should be conceived of as a cause or an indicator of cognitive aging. In the present study, we addressed this question by using a neurocognitive psychometrics approach to decompose the association between age differences and fluid intelligence. Reanalyzing data from two previously published datasets containing 223 participants between 18 and 61 years, we investigated whether individual differences in diffusion model parameters and in ERP latencies associated with higher-order attentional processing explained the association between age differences and fluid intelligence. We demonstrate that individual differences in the speed of non-decisional processes such as encoding, response preparation, and response execution, and individual differences in latencies of ERP components associated with higher-order cognitive processes explained the negative association between age differences and fluid intelligence. Because both parameters jointly accounted for the association between age differences and fluid intelligence, age-related differences in both parameters may reflect age-related differences in anterior brain regions associated with response planning that are prone to be affected by age-related changes. Conversely, age differences did not account for the association between processing speed and fluid intelligence. Our results suggest that the relationship between age differences and fluid intelligence is multifactorially determined.

The possible negative consequences of this behavior and its proximity to behavioral addictions are discussed. Since deficits of response inhibition and performance monitoring have been associated with substance use and addictive behaviors, we examined the hypothesis whether frequent binge watching is characterized by alterations in these processes. The current study examined response inhibition in a go/nogo task and performance monitoring in a flanker task using electroencephalography. Participants reported frequent binge-watching episodes (HBW, n = 35) or no binge-watching behavior (NBW, n = 33) during the past four weeks. Compared to the NBW group, HBW showed larger P3a and P3b during response inhibition and larger error-related negativity (ERN) for errors in the flanker task. Group differences in behavioral measures were not observed. The neurocognitive profile associated with frequent binge watching differs from externalizing disorders, such as substance use disorders and addictive behaviors, which are more likely to be associated with diminished amplitudes during response inhibition and performance monitoring. Current findings of increased activity in performance monitoring and inhibition tend to be associated with internalizing disorders. Therefore, symptoms such as anxiety and worry may play a role in the development of binge-watching behavior.

The mismatch negativity (MMN), a passive auditory evoked potential, offers insight into the brain's ability to direct attention to novel sounds. Since exposure to speech is necessary for learning to map meaning onto phonemes, we predicted slower MMN responses to speech sounds would indicate presence of language impairment in ASD. Methods: We explored the relationship between MMN latency in children ages 5-10 with ASD plus language impairment (ASD + LI), ASD minus language impairment (ASD-LI), and typically developing children (TD) during an auditory oddball experiment presenting speech and pure tone sounds. Results: Contrary to our prediction, children with ASD + LI demonstrated decreased MMN latency in the left hemisphere in response to novel vowel sounds compared to children with ASD-LI and TD controls. Parent responses to the Sensory Experiences Questionnaire revealed that all participating individuals with ASD were hypersensitive to sounds. Conclusions: Our results lend support to the theory that some children with ASD + LI have increased connectivity in primary sensory cortices at the expense of connectivity to association areas of the brain. This may account for faster speech sound processing despite low language scores in these children. Future studies should focus on individuals with language impairment and hyper-or hyposensitivity to sounds.

This research aims to clarify how differences in tail lamp design affect their visibility to other drivers, with a view to develop a design that will make tail lamps more conspicuous. By focusing on visibility in human face recognition abilities, we conducted a subjective evaluation experiment and visual search task using rear-shots of vehicles. The experimental results revealed that a human's impression of a rear-shot of a vehicle is structurally similar to their impression of a face, and that the tail lamp design affects reaction time. Moreover, electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements verified the validity of the results from a neuroscience perspective. These findings may be used for developing tail lamp designs that are more striking so as to be more noticeable to fellow drivers.

An event-related potentials study on the processing of aspectual violation in Russian iterative sentences	RUSSIAN LINGUISTICS			English	Article								The treatment of verbal aspect in Russian grammar and its interaction with lexical semantics are controversial matters. We address these issues from a psycholinguistic perspective. We conducted an EEG study with 14 native Russian speakers processing 160 sentences in the unrestrictedly iterative meaning; the sentences were either correct or contained semantic, morpho-syntactic, or aspectual violations (e.g., Kazdyj vecer otec *zasnulpfv na divane. `Every evening the father *fell asleep on the sofa'). Processing the aspectual violation resulted in a P600, which is typical for processing morpho-syntactic violations and usually is interpreted as an index of difficulties in syntactic (re-)analysis, while an N400, which is typical for processing lexico-semantic violations, could not be observed. Our results show that Russian speakers must make more effort to analyze aspectually incorrect sentences compared with aspectually correct sentences. Processing aspectual violations in Russian clearly resembles processing of morpho-syntactic violations. This is in line with the interpretation of aspect as a typical grammatical category.

J	Sun, Y; Bo, SY; Lv, JJ				Sun Yan; Bo Siyu; Lv Jiaojiao			Brain network analysis of cognitive reappraisal and expressive inhibition strategies: Evidence from EEG and ERP	ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						emotion regulation; cognitive reappraisal; expressive suppression; functional connection; graph theory	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; EMOTION REGULATION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; RESOLVE CONFLICT; INTRINSIC EEG; SUPPRESSION; EFFICIENCY; TASK	The ability to regulate emotions is related to psychological, social, and physical health. The two major emotion regulation strategies are cognitive reappraisal (CR) and expressive suppression (ES). Research suggests that CR produces affective, cognitive, and social consequences that are more beneficial to the individual, whereas ES has been consistently linked to more detrimental consequences. Although an increasing number of studies have begun to focus on the neural mechanisms of different types of emotion regulation, there has not yet been systematic research on the spontaneous brain activity associated with CR and ES. Resting activity has been shown to predict performance outcomes, highlight the functional relevance of the brain's intrinsic fluctuations in response outputs. However, to date, there have been no studies to explore the relationship between the cognitive process of emotion regulation and the brain's resting EEG activity. The current study explored the neural mechanisms of spontaneous brain activity during two emotion regulation strategies. Electroencephalography (EEG) enables direct measurement of neuronal activity, allowing characterization of the intrinsic neural cognitive network. Thirty-six college students (17 males and 19 females, aged 17 similar to 28 years old) participated in this study. For the first part of the study, EEG data was collected from participants with closed eyes; EEG collection occurred for a duration of 6 minutes. Neurological studies of resting state EEG have identified the predominant role of theta waves in determining cognitive control effort and behavioral performance. In the current study, source localization and graph theory analysis revealed that node efficiency was significantly correlated with the two major emotion regulation strategies, and there were functional connections between brain regions in the theta band. Then, in order to improve the reliability of the resting result obtained above, a within subjects experiment was carried out. This experiment required subjects to watch emotional pictures under four emotion regulation conditions (watching neutral, watching negative, reappraisal negative, suppressing negative). The Late-positive potential (LPP) amplitude was obtained when viewing the emotional pictures under the four conditions. LPP is an effective physiological indicator of the emotion regulation effect. It allowed us to explore the emotion regulation effect under different emotion regulation strategies, and the intrinsic functional connections and node efficiency of the brain. The results showed that the habitual use of CR was significantly correlated with several brain regions. Specifically, the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and parietal cortex. Moreover, the brain regions significantly correlated with the LPP amplitude under CR were the parietal cortex, prefrontal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and occipital cortex. The brain regions that were significantly correlated with habitual use of ES included the prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, insula, and parahippocampal gyrus. Finally, the brain regions that were significantly associated with LPP amplitude under ES included the prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, temporal cortex, and occipital cortex. Thus, these findings reveal that many brain regions are involved in these two mood regulation strategies, including the prefrontal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, parietal cortex, and occipital cortex. In addition, the brain regions related to the different emotion regulation strategies differed slightly; specifically, CR was significantly associated with the anterior cingulate cortex while ES was related to temporal lobe and insula activation. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that use of CR for emotion regulation is associated with activation of multiple brain regions including the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, parietal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus and occipital cortex. On the other hand, the use of ES for emotional regulation was associated with activation of various brain regions including the prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, occipital cortex, temporal cortex and insula. Node efficiency or functional connectivity of these brain regions appears to be a suitable indicator for assessing the effects of the ES and CR emotion regulation strategies.

In aging, world knowledge continues to increase, but semantic processing declines. An intriguing question is whether increased world knowledge aids world knowledge comprehension, even in the face of declining semantic processing. The present study collected EEG data from 43 older and 43 younger adults as they read correct sentences, sentences with a semantic violation, and sentences with a world knowledge violation. Compared to younger adults, older adults had a significantly greater reduction in amplitude and delayed peak/onset latency of N400 for both semantic and world knowledge integration. A significant Group by Condition by Region interaction revealed that, although the N400 amplitude under the semantic violation condition was comparable to that under the world knowledge violation condition in younger adults, the N400 amplitude in the posterior brain region was significantly smaller under the world knowledge violation condition than under the semantic violation condition in older adults. The N400 difference between world knowledge and semantic violation conditions was negatively correlated only with vocabulary scores. In conclusion, age-related increases in world knowledge do not help older adults to comprehend world knowledge more effectively.

Yet, it is unknown how probability of rhythm violations affects the overall rhythm predictability. Another unresolved question is whether predictive processes are independent of attention processes. In this study, EEG was recorded while subjects listened to rhythmic sequences. Predictability was manipulated by changing the stimulus-onset-asynchrony (SOA deviants) for given tones in the rhythm. When SOA deviants were inserted rarely, predictability remained high, whereas predictability was lower with more frequent SOA deviants. Dichotic tone-presentation allowed for independent manipulation of attention, as specific tones of the rhythm were presented to separate ears. Attention was manipulated by instructing subjects to attend to tones in one ear only, while keeping the rhythmic structure of tones constant. The analyses of event-related potentials revealed an attenuated N1 for tones when rhythm predictability was high, while the N1 was enhanced by attention to tones. Bayesian statistics revealed no interaction between predictability and attention. A right-lateralization of attention effects, but not predictability effects, suggested potentially different cortical processes. This is the first study to show that probability of rhythm violation influences rhythm predictability, independent of attention.

However, such systems typically do not detect the biomarkers present in sweat, and thus do not take advantage of the biological information in the sweat. Likewise, such systems do not detect the volatile organic components (VOC's) created under stressful conditions. This work presents a review into the current status of human emotional stress biomarkers and proposes the major potential biomarkers for future wearable sensors in affective systems. Emotional stress has been classified as a major contributor in several social problems, related to crime, health, the economy, and indeed quality of life. While blood cortisol tests, electroencephalography and physiological parameter methods are the gold standards for measuring stress; however, they are typically invasive or inconvenient and not suitable for wearable real-time stress monitoring. Alternatively, cortisol in biofluids and VOCs emitted from the skin appear to be practical and useful markers for sensors to detect emotional stress events. This work has identified antistress hormones and cortisol metabolites as the primary stress biomarkers that can be used in future sensors for wearable affective systems.

While many visual and conceptual features have been linked to this ability, significant correlations exist between feature spaces, impeding our ability to determine their relative contributions to scene categorization. Here, we used a whitening transformation to decorrelate a variety of visual and conceptual features and assess the time course of their unique contributions to scene categorization. Participants (both sexes) viewed 2250 full colorscene images drawn from 30 different scene categories while having their brain activity measured through 256-channel EEG. We examined the variance explained at each electrode and time point of visual event related potential (vERP) data from nine different whitened encoding models. These ranged from low-level features obtained from filter outputs to high level conceptual features requiring human annotation. The amount of category information in the vERPs was assessed through multivariate decoding methods. Behavioral similarity measures were obtained in separate crowdsourced experiments. We found that all nine models together contributed 78% of the variance of human scene similarity assessments and were within the noise ceiling of the vERP data. Low-level models explained earlier vERP variability (88 ms after image onset), whereas high-level models explained later variance (169 ms). Critically, only high-level models shared vERP variability with behavior. Together, these results suggest that scene categorization is primarily a high-level process, but reliant on previously extracted low-level features.

Luckily, the brain plasticity could be modulated to counteract the decline. The repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a relatively non-invasive neuro-modulatory technique, could directly modulate neural excitability in the targeted cortical areas. Here, we are interested in whether the application of rTMS could enhance the source memory performance in healthy older adults. In addition, event-related potentials (ERPs) were employed to explore the specific retrieval process that rTMS could affect. Subjects were randomly assigned to either the rTMS group or the sham group. The rTMS group received 10 sessions (20 min per session) of 10 Hz rTMS applying on the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (i.e., F4 site), and the sham group received 10 sessions of sham stimulation. Both groups performed source memory tests before and after the intervention while the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded during the retrieval process. Behavioral results showed that the source memory performance was significantly improved after rTMS compared with the sham stimulation; ERPs results showed that during the retrieval phase, the left parietal old/new effect, which reflected the process of recollection common to both young and old adults, increased in the rTMS group compared with the sham stimulation group, whereas the late reversed old/new effect specific to the source retrieval of older adults showed similar attenuation after intervention in both groups. The present results suggested that rTMS could be an effective intervention to improve source memory performance in healthy older adults and that it selectively facilitated the youth-like recollection process during retrieval. This study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR) with the identifier chictr-ire-15006371.

The human visual system incorporates several solutions to this challenge, 1 of which is a reflexive covert attention system that is rapidly responsive to both the physical salience and the task-relevance of new information. This article presents a model that simulates behavioral and neural correlates of reflexive attention as the product of brief neural attractor states that are formed across the visual hierarchy when attention is engaged. Such attractors emerge from an attentional gradient distributed over a population of topographically organized neurons and serve to focus processing at 1 or more locations in the visual field, while inhibiting the processing of lower priority information. The model moves toward a resolution of key debates about the nature of reflexive attention, such as whether it is parallel or serial, and whether suppression effects are distributed in a spatial surround, or selectively at the location of distractors. The model also develops a framework for understanding the neural mechanisms of visual attention as a spatiotopic decision process within a hierarchy and links them to observable correlates such as accuracy, reaction time (RT), and the N2pc and P-D components of the electroencephalogram (EEG). This last contribution is the most crucial for repairing the disconnect that exists between our understanding of behavioral and neural correlates of attention.

J	Schindler, S; Straube, T				Schindler, Sebastian; Straube, Thomas			Selective visual attention to emotional pictures: Interactions of task-relevance and emotion are restricted to the late positive potential	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Bayes factors; EEG; ERPs IAPS; emotional scenes; emotion-attention interaction; top-down attention	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TOP-DOWN; PERCEPTION; CATEGORIZATION; MODULATIONS; STATISTICS; NETWORKS; SIGNAL	The temporal dynamics of top-down voluntary and bottom-up driven emotional attention are a matter of debate. Both emotion and task-relevance have been shown to affect the early posterior negativity (EPN) and the late positive potential (LPP) during the processing of emotional pictures, whereas there are mixed findings related to interactions of emotion and task-relevance. In this preregistered study, we used Bayesian models to test this interplay between emotion and task-relevance. Participants (N = 104) were presented negative, neutral, and positive International Affective Picture System (IAPS) pictures, and block-wise were asked to respond either to negative, neutral, or positive pictures, rendering one stimulus category task-relevant and the remaining stimuli task-irrelevant. Bayesian models showed evidence for the absence of interactions between task-relevance and emotion. Furthermore, models showed parallel emotion and task effects for the EPN and late stages of the LPP. Additional interactive effects were found during an early LPP interval (400 to 600 ms), with increased LPP amplitudes when emotion was rendered task-relevant. Taken together, the results revealed distinct but parallel temporal onsets of task-relevance and emotion effects, followed by task and emotion interactions in the early LPP. Thus, based on this high-powered study employing Bayesian analysis, evidence is provided that interactions between task-relevance and emotion do not emerge before the LPP time window. These results further inform theories proposing early parallel and late interactive processes of the emotional salience of stimuli and top-down attention.

Personalized Connectome Mapping to Guide Targeted Therapy and Promote Recovery of Consciousness in the Intensive Care Unit	NEUROCRITICAL CARE			English	Article						Coma; Consciousness; Brain injury; Connectome; Clinical trial; Biomarker	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; AREA INDUCES REANIMATION; ASCENDING AROUSAL SYSTEM; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; METHYLPHENIDATE HYDROCHLORIDE; INTRAVENOUS METHYLPHENIDATE; STEM INJURY; DOPAMINE; STATE	There are currently no therapies proven to promote early recovery of consciousness in patients with severe brain injuries in the intensive care unit (ICU). For patients whose families face time-sensitive, life-or-death decisions, treatments that promote recovery of consciousness are needed to reduce the likelihood of premature withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy, facilitate autonomous self-expression, and increase access to rehabilitative care. Here, we present the Connectome-based Clinical Trial Platform (CCTP), a new paradigm for developing and testing targeted therapies that promote early recovery of consciousness in the ICU. We report the protocol for STIMPACT (Stimulant Therapy Targeted to Individualized Connectivity Maps to Promote ReACTIvation of Consciousness), a CCTP-based trial in which intravenous methylphenidate will be used for targeted stimulation of dopaminergic circuits within the subcortical ascending arousal network (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03814356). The scientific premise of the CCTP and the STIMPACT trial is that personalized brain network mapping in the ICU can identify patients whose connectomes are amenable to neuromodulation. Phase 1 of the STIMPACT trial is an open-label, safety and dose-finding study in 22 patients with disorders of consciousness caused by acute severe traumatic brain injury. Patients in Phase 1 will receive escalating daily doses (0.5-2.0 mg/kg) of intravenous methylphenidate over a 4-day period and will undergo resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography to evaluate the drug's pharmacodynamic properties. The primary outcome measure for Phase 1 relates to safety: the number of drug-related adverse events at each dose. Secondary outcome measures pertain to pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics: (1) time to maximal serum concentration; (2) serum half-life; (3) effect of the highest tolerated dose on resting-state functional MRI biomarkers of connectivity; and (4) effect of each dose on EEG biomarkers of cerebral cortical function. Predetermined safety and pharmacodynamic criteria must be fulfilled in Phase 1 to proceed to Phase 2A. Pharmacokinetic data from Phase 1 will also inform the study design of Phase 2A, where we will test the hypothesis that personalized connectome maps predict therapeutic responses to intravenous methylphenidate. Likewise, findings from Phase 2A will inform the design of Phase 2B, where we plan to enroll patients based on their personalized connectome maps. By selecting patients for clinical trials based on a principled, mechanistic assessment of their neuroanatomic potential for a therapeutic response, the CCTP paradigm and the STIMPACT trial have the potential to transform the therapeutic landscape in the ICU and improve outcomes for patients with severe brain injuries.

All male subjects were presented five English vowel [a], [e], [i], [o], and [u] stimuli. Brain dynamics were decoded using multivariate Gaussian hidden Markov model (MGHMM), which trained on spatiotemporal patterns of broadband multivariate event-related potential amplitudes to identify distinct broadband EEG microstates (MS), microstate source imaging, and microstate functional connectivity (mu FC). Obtained results showed fiuctuated cortical generators and mu FC in eight microstates throughout the perception. Microstate source imaging revealed involvements of bilateral (left-side dominance) posterior superior temporal cortex (TC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and supramarginal regions in perception. Precentral cortex where primary motor cortex located was also significantly activated. These regions were early appeared at 96-151 ms (left-side dominance) and at 186-246 ms (left hemisphere only) after the stimuli onset. Results from fiFC revealed significant increases in delta (2.5-4.5 Hz), theta (4.5-8.5 Hz), alpha (12.5-14.5 Hz), beta (22.5-24.5 Hz), low gamma (30.5-32.5, 38.5-40.5 Hz) but decreases in high gamma (42.5-46.5 Hz) bands in perception. Increased FC were observed mainly at; (1) microstate segments 34-95 ms (MS2) and 96-151 ms (MS3) in early stages, (2) microstate intervals 186-246 ms (MS5) and 297-449 ms (MS6) in subsequent stages of perception. We found that stronger statistical FC differences in perception at TCs, with respect to left IFG (Broca' area), left TC, and precentral areas. Furthermore, by conducting a comparative protocol measuring FC distinction degree, we showed performance improvements of 8.01% (p-value D 0.0162), 14.41% (pvalue D 0.006) when compared MGHMM to well established Lehmann-based modified K-means, Atomize and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering and 8.791% (p-value D 0.0097) over the combination of Kmeans and sliding window methods, respectively. This study indicates the usefulness of EEG microstates to investigate broadband brain dynamics in speech perception. The current findings based on male subjects would be generalized more by future studies with a larger appropriate sample size including female subjects.

Here, we aimed at contributing to this debate by coregistering eye movements and EEG while participants viewed photographs of indoor scenes that contained a semantically consistent or inconsistent target object. Linear deconvolution modeling was used to analyze the ERPs evoked by scene onset as well as the fixation-related potentials (FRPs) elicited by the fixation on the target object (t) and by the preceding fixation (t - 1). Object-scene consistency did not influence the probability of immediate target fixation or the ERP evoked by scene onset, which suggests that object-scene semantics was not accessed immediately. However, during the subsequent scene exploration, inconsistent objects were prioritized over consistent objects in extrafoveal vision (i.e., looked at earlier) and were more effortful to process in foveal vision (i.e., looked at longer). In FRPs, we demonstrate a fixation-related N300/N400 effect, whereby inconsistent objects elicit a larger frontocentral negativity than consistent objects. In line with the behavioral findings, this effect was already seen in FRPs aligned to the pretarget fixation t - 1 and persisted throughout fixation t, indicating that the extraction of object semantics can already begin in extrafoveal vision. Taken together, the results emphasize the usefulness of combined EEG/eye movement recordings for understanding the mechanisms of object-scene integration during natural viewing.

The objective of the present study was to determine whether alertness, orientation and executive control can modulate cortical activation during step initiation. The attention network test (ANT) was used to control the influence of different attentional components on kinetic characteristics of step initiation and the associated cortical activity. Thirty healthy adults performed ANT combined with step initiation. The step execution time (SET) and anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) were recorded. Movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) and event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs) after response emission were analysed according to the presence or absence of cueing or conflict resolution. Step reaction time and thus SET were significantly shorter with cueing, whereas APA duration and SET were longer during conflict resolution. Moreover, alertness was related to a higher rate of anticipated responses, and conflicting situations were associated with a greater amount of multiple APAs. Attentional load did not affect MRCPs but ERSPs: trials with a cue showed earlier posterior alpha and beta desynchronisations before APA onset. Furthermore, we found earlier, more pronounced and longer alpha- and beta-band desynchronisations over the sensorimotor cortex for trials with incongruent flankers. Our results showed that attention has an impact on step initiation. A specific pattern of response-locked ERSPs seems to mirror behavioural effects of attentional load on step initiation. This new paradigm combining ANT and step initiation is, therefore, promising to investigate the interaction between attention and gait initiation in pathological populations.

NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article						Stress; Fear conditioning; Predictive learning; Blocking; Attention	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; OUTCOME ADDITIVITY; BASIC ASSUMPTIONS; MEMORY; FEAR; GLUCOCORTICOIDS; RETRIEVAL; RESPONSES	Learning is blocked when a stimulus is followed by an outcome that is identical to what was expected and thus contains no new information. This classic 'blocking' effect exemplifies that learning is driven by the predictive value of stimuli, which in turn should guide the allocation of attentional resources. Stress is known to be a powerful modulator of learning and memory. However, whether stress may affect attentional processing during predictive learning is largely unknown. Here, we combined electroencephalography and eye-tracking with an experimental stress manipulation and a fear conditioning paradigm designed to probe the blocking effect, to determine if and how stress impacts efficient attentional processing during predictive learning. Participants' explicit ratings indicated, irrespective of stress, a blocking effect. The control group further showed preferential attentional processing of predictive vs. unpredictive stimuli, reflected in differential fixation durations and a differential N2pc. Stress abolished this differentiation and led even to sustained attention, indicated by higher late positive potentials, to stimuli with low predictive value. Moreover, stress resulted in an overall increase in the P3b during the blocking phase, suggesting increased attentional processing, presumably due to impaired access to previously learned associations. Together, our results suggest that while control participants paid particular attention to predictive stimuli and reduced attention to unpredictive stimuli, in line with the classic blocking effect, stress before learning reduced this preferential processing. Thus, the present findings highlight the role of attention allocation for predictive fear learning and suggest that stress may impair efficient information processing against the background of prior experiences.

The HCS provides daily help to motor-disabled people when a caregiver is not present. The aim of the study is two-fold: (1) to develop a BCI-based home care system to help end-users control their household appliances, and (2) to assess whether the architecture of the HCS is easy for motor-disabled people to use. A motion-strip is used to evoke event-related potentials (ERPs) in the brain of the user, and the system immediately processes these potentials to decode the user's intentions. The system, then, translates these intentions into application commands and sends them via Bluetooth to the user's smartphone to make an emergency call or to execute the corresponding app to emit an infrared (IR) signal to control a household appliance. Fifteen healthy and seven motor-disabled subjects (including the one with ALS) participated in the experiment. The average online accuracy was 81.8% and 78.1%, respectively. Using component N2P3 to discriminate targets from nontargets can increase the efficiency of the system. Results showed that the system allows end-users to use smartphone apps as long as they are using their brain waves. More important, only one electrode O1 is required to measure EEG signals, giving the system good practical usability. The HCS can, thus, improve the autonomy and self-reliance of its end-users.

Psychophysiological mechanisms of performance monitoring remain largely understudied in the context of uncertainty that arises at the stage of stimulus identification and decision making, as well as in the context of inhibition/correction of the motor response. In the current study, we investigate relations between behavioral performance measures and several ERP components: N2, ERN/CRN and Pe. Participants performed a condensation task and made their responses by moving mouse cursor. Response registration using mouse tracking allowed us to obtain two independent behavioral measures: mouse movement initiation time and movement duration. Amplitude of N2 and CRN was dependent on movement initiation time: N2 was increased and CRN was decreased for 'late' correct responses compared with 'early' correct ones; this finding is compatible with the explanation that 'late' responses involve higher pre-response conflict and higher uncertainty compared with 'early' ones. Movement duration time was a novel independent behavioral parameter, that cannot be measured using traditional keystrokes. This behavioral measure was related to the early Pe: its amplitude was more positive for 'long' responses compared with 'short' ones. This finding may be explained by mechanisms of an ongoing response inhibition. We suggest that this effect is linked to response stopping, which may be related to outcome awareness.

COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Mood; Motivation; Erp; Reward	FRONTAL CORTICAL ACTIVATION; FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; ACTION-BASED MODEL; NEURAL MECHANISMS; TRAIT ANGER; THETA; PREDICTION; ERPS; PROBABILITY; EXPECTATION	In a previous study (Paul & Pourtois, 2017), we found that positive mood substantially influenced the neural processing of reward, mostly by altering expectations and creating an optimistic bias. Under positive mood, the Reward Positivity (RewP) component and fronto-medial theta activity (FM theta) in response to monetary feedback were both changed compared with neutral mood. Nevertheless, whether positive valence per se or motivational intensity drove these neurophysiological effects remained unclear. To address this question, we combined a mindset manipulation with an imagery procedure to create and maintain three different affective states using a between-subjects design: a neutral mood, and positive mood with either high or low motivational intensity. After mood induction, 161 participants performed a simple gambling task while 64-channel EEG was recorded. FM theta activity results showed that irrespective of motivational intensity, positive compared with neutral mood altered reward expectancy. By comparison, RewP was not affected by positive mood nor motivational intensity. These results suggest that positive mood, rather than motivational intensity, is likely driving the change in reward expectation during gambling, which could reflect the presence of an optimistic bias. Moreover, at the methodological level, they confirm that the RewP ERP component and FM theta activity can capture dissociable effects during reward processing.

However, to date, no study explored the neural underpinnings of infants' ability to bind emotion- to action-related information. To assess this issue, we measured EEG activity while 6-month-old infants observed the same action performed by an actress displaying three different emotional expressions (happiness, anger and neutral). Results have shown that actions embedded in an emotional context (happiness and anger) elicited larger early negativity at parieto-occipital sites compared to a neutral context. This finding suggests that already at 6 months of age, infants use information coming from facial expressions to detect the saliency and relevance of others' actions.

Exploring the temporal dynamics of speech production with EEG and group ICA	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							HIGH-PASS FILTERS; CORTICAL DYNAMICS; SPOKEN LANGUAGE; WORD PRODUCTION; INCORRECT CONCLUSIONS; TIME-COURSE; BRAIN; ARTIFACTS; NETWORKS; ERP	Speech production is a complex skill whose neural implementation relies on a large number of different regions in the brain. How neural activity in these different regions varies as a function of time during the production of speech remains poorly understood. Previous MEG studies on this topic have concluded that activity proceeds from posterior to anterior regions of the brain in a sequential manner. Here we tested this claim using the EEG technique. Specifically, participants performed a picture naming task while their naming latencies and scalp potentials were recorded. We performed group temporal Independent Component Analysis (group tICA) to obtain temporally independent component timecourses and their corresponding topographic maps. We identified fifteen components whose estimated neural sources were located in various areas of the brain. The trial-by-trial component timecourses were predictive of the naming latency, implying their involvement in the task. Crucially, we computed the degree of concurrent activity of each component timecourse to test whether activity was sequential or parallel. Our results revealed that these fifteen distinct neural sources exhibit largely concurrent activity during speech production. These results suggest that speech production relies on neural activity that takes place in parallel networks of distributed neural sources.

Changes in working memory influence the transition from reactive to proactive cognitive control during childhood	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						cognitive control; event-related potential P3b; executive function; working memory	EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; DUAL MECHANISMS; CHILDREN; SCHIZOPHRENIA; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS; TOOLBOX; BRAIN; MODEL	Cognitive control develops rapidly over the first decade of life, with one of the dominant changes being a transition from reliance on 'as-needed' control (reactive control) to a more planful, sustained form of control (proactive control). Although the emergence of proactive control is important for mature behavior, we know little about how this transition takes place, the neural correlates of this transition, and whether development of executive functions influences the ability to adopt a proactive control strategy. This study addresses these questions, focusing on the transition from reactive to proactive control in a cross-sectional sample of 79 children-forty-one 5-year-olds and thirty-eight 9-year-olds. Children completed an adapted version of the AX-Continuous Performance Task while electroencephalography was recorded and a standardized executive function battery was administered. Results revealed 5-year-olds predominantly employed reactive strategies, whereas 9-year-olds used proactive strategies. Use of proactive control was predicted by working memory ability, above and beyond other executive functions. Moreover, when enacting proactive control, greater increases in neural activity underlying working memory updating were observed; links between working memory ability and proactive control strategy use were mediated by such neural activity. These results provide convergent evidence that the transition from reactive to proactive control may be dependent on age-related changes in neurocognitive indices of working memory and that working memory may influence adopting a proactive control strategy.

Patients admitted to epilepsy monitoring units (EMUs) for diagnostic and presurgical evaluation have an increased risk of seizure-related injury, particularly in the many cases in which medication is withdrawn. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of adverse events (AEs) in this setting and to analyse associated clinical factors and costs. Methods. We evaluated consecutive patients admitted to an EMU at a tertiary care hospital over a 10-year period based on a descriptive, longitudinal study. We analysed the occurrence of AEs (traumatic injury, psychiatric complications, status epilepticus, cardiorespiratory disturbances, and death), investigated potential risk factors using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis, and compared admission costs between patients with and without AEs. Results. In total, 411 EMU admissions were studied corresponding to 352 patients (55% women; mean [SD] age: 41.7 [12.1] years). Twenty-five patients (6%) experienced an AE. The most common event was traumatic injury (n=9), followed by status epilepticus (n=8), psychiatric complications (n=7), and cardiorespiratory disturbances (n=1). On comparing patients with and without AEs, we observed that the former were more likely to experience generalized seizures (OR: 7.81; 95% CI: 3.51-12.23; p<0.001) or have more seizures overall during admission (OR: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.42-6.8; p=0.002). Patients with AEs also had longer EMU stays (6.91 [2.64] vs 5.08 [1.1]; p=0.004), longer hospital stays (8.45 [3.6] vs 5.18 [1.2]; p<0.001), and higher costs ((sic) 7277.71 [(sic) 2743.9] vs (sic) 5175.7 [(sic) 1182.5]; p<0.001). Conclusion. Patients with generalized seizures and more seizures during admission were at greater risk of AEs, which were associated with higher admission costs.

Whilst recent theoretical developments suggest that this is achieved by an interplay between bottom-up and top-down attentional mechanisms, their underlying neural dynamics are still poorly understood. Furthermore, it is still matter of discussion as to whether these attentional mechanisms are truly self-specific or instead driven by face familiarity. To address these questions, we used EEG to record the brain activity of twenty-five healthy participants whilst identifying their own face, a friend's face and a stranger's face. Time-frequency analysis revealed a greater sustained power decrease in the alpha and beta frequency bands for the self-face, which emerged at late latencies and was maintained even when the face was no longer present. Critically, source analysis showed that this activity was generated in key brain regions for self-face recognition, such as the fusiform gyrus. As in the Myth of Narcissus, our results indicate that one's own face might have the potential to hijack attention. We suggest that this effect is specific to the self and driven by a top-down attentional control mechanism, which might facilitate further processing of personally relevant events.

Participants saw an image of a product (the target in a visual metaphorical relationship), and then made a same-different judgment in response to a second image (the source in a visual metaphorical relationship) which was (in)congruous to the first image in terms of shape and/or function. We collected behavioral (button-press reaction time and accuracy), and neural (N270, delta and theta band activity) measures. The time-frequency analysis showed faster processing of incongruous visual information. Moreover, shape and conceptual incongruity were associated with increased N270 amplitude as well as delta (1-3 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) band power. Noticeably, compared with conceptual incongruity, shape incongruity evoked a larger N270 amplitude and stronger delta and theta band oscillation. In addition, the average topographical analysis revealed a frontal and central distribution of the power activity. The analysis of attitudes towards the advertising metaphor pictures also proved the supportive role played by incongruity. In conclusion, incongruity facilitates target-source matching in pictorial metaphors of Chinese advertising. The findings obtained from the study are important to metaphor designs of advertising pictures.

One of the common BCI systems is the visual P300 speller. Previous studies have shown that faces can induce strong event-related potentials (ERPs) to achieve high classification accuracy and the block-shaped condition can obtain better performance by increasing the size of the highlighted surface. However, the effects of both blended factors have not yet been studied. Therefore, we proposed a red block-shaped face paradigm (RBFP) combining both block-shape and face. We compared the proposed paradigm with the traditional red face paradigm (RFP) to validate its feasibility and effectiveness. Results indicated that RBFP had better classification accuracy (95.27% vs. 91.116/0) and raw bit rate (R BR) (25.84 bit/min vs. 23.43 bit/min) than RFP, and could elicit particularly increased ERPs. Moreover, RBFP obtained a high degree of preference in the subjective assessment. In conclusion, the proposed paradigm combined the advantages of both types of stimuli to obtain a significant improvement in BCI performance, which was meaningful for future BCI studies.

This study disentangled and directly compared the respective influences of external rewards and positive stimuli on childhood cognitive control. We expected external rewards to promote proactive cognitive control and positive stimuli to impair proactive control, especially in younger age. EEG data were recorded while children (5-6 years old and 9-10 years old) and adults completed a cued task-switching paradigm in three conditions: positive-stimulus, external-reward and control conditions. Provision of reward resulted in more accurate but slower responses, and more pronounced cue-locked posterior positivity, potentially suggesting general proactive mobilisation of attention (i.e., readiness). Despite no effects on behaviour, the presentation of positive stimuli was unexpectedly associated with a greater cue-locked extended slow-wave when task cues were presented ahead of targets (i.e. proactive-control possible) in younger children, suggesting greater proactive cue preparation. In contrast to our hypothesis, both external rewards and positive stimuli seem to promote different types of proactive approaches in children.

This study assesses the neurophysiological differences between children with ADHD and matched healthy controls during a face emotional recognition task. The study also explores how brain connectivity is affected by ADHD. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded from 64 scalp electrodes. Event-related phase coherence (ERPCOH) method was applied to pre-processed signals, and functional connectivity between any pair of electrodes was computed in different frequency bands. A logistic regression (LR) classifier with elastic net regularization (ENR) was trained to classify ADHD and HC participants using the functional connectivity of frequency bands as a potential biomarker. Subsequently, the brain network is constructed using graph-theoretic techniques, and graph indices such as clustering coefficient (C) and shortest path length (L) were calculated. Significant intra-hemispheric and the inter-hemispheric discrepancy between ADHD and healthy control (HC) groups in the beta band was observed. The graph features indicate that the clustering coefficient is significantly higher in the ADHD group than that in the HC group. At the same time, the shortest path length is significantly lower in the beta band. ADHD's brain networks have a problem in transferring information among various neural regions, which can cause a deficiency in the processing of facial emotions. The beta band seems better to reflect the differences between ADHD and HC. The observed functional connectivity and graph differences could also be helpful in ADHD investigations.

Recent findings show that inhibitory control processes are crucial for sequential cognitive flexi- bility. These processes are indicated by the 'backward inhibition (BI) effect' which emerges when a mental representation that has recently been suppressed in favour of another task has to be re -activated. Alterations in the catecholaminergic neural transmission including the norepinephrine (NE) system have been shown to modulate inhibitory processes. However, a possible role of the NE system in sequential cognitive flexibility is elusive. The present study examines the relevance of the NE system for sequential cognitive flexibility by integrating pupil diameter data and electrophysiological (EEG) data applying signal decomposition techniques and source localization. We show that the BI effects modulated amplitudes in the P1/N1 time window, as well as in the N2 time window. Correlating this data with the pupil diameter data only revealed substantial correlations in the P1/N1 time window. Moreover, it is shown that regions in the right inferior frontal gyrus are activated during modulations in the P1 time window, in which correlations with the pupil diameter data were also evident. The results are interpreted that sequential cognitive flexibility modulates early inhibitory gating processes (P1) which are related to the suppression of task -irrelevant information in inferior frontal regions. These processes are likely modu- lated by the NE system. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Importantly, reactions to faces depend not only on their features but also on their processing fluency, with disfluent faces suffering social devaluation. The current research used electrophysiological (EEG) and behavioral measures to explore at what processing stage and under what conditions emotional ambiguity is detected in the brain and how it influences trustworthiness judgments. Participants viewed male and female faces ranging from pure anger, through mixed expressions, to pure happiness. They categorized each face along the experimental dimension (happy vs. angry) or a control dimension (gender). In the emotion-categorization condition, mixed (ambiguous) expressions were classified relatively slower, and their trustworthiness was rated relatively lower. EEG analyses revealed that early brain responses are independent of the categorization condition, with pure faces evoking larger P1/N1 responses than mixed expressions. Some late (728- 880 ms) brain responses from central-parietal sites also were independent of the categorization condition and presumably reflect familiarity of the emotion categories, with pure expressions evoking larger central-parietal LPP amplitude than mixed expressions. Interestingly, other late responses were sensitive to both expressive features and categorization task, with ambiguous faces evoking a larger LPP amplitude in frontal-medial sites around 560-660 ms but only in the emotion categorization task. Critically, these late responses from the frontal-medial cluster correlated with the reduction in trustworthiness judgments. Overall, the results suggest that ambiguity detection involves late, top-down processes and that it influences important social impressions.

Mothers may be particularly focused on cue processing early postpartum, contributing to intense preoccupation with their infant's well-being. Prior reproductive experience, or parity, may also impact the intensity of infant-cue processing and has been found to influence P300 neural responses to infant faces during pregnancy and at 2 months postpartum. However, we do not know whether this parity effect persists. Thus, we examined the P300 to infant faces in 59 mothers at 2 and 7 months postpartum. Our main finding was that primiparous, as compared to multiparous, women showed a significantly higher P300 to infant faces across the postpartum period. Findings further emphasize the importance of studying parity and its impact on the neural processing of infant faces.

J	Hoppe, K; Wascher, E; Kuper, K				Hoppe, Katharina; Wascher, Edmund; Kuper, Kristina			Feature Overlap and Relevance Determine Sequential Modulations in the Simon Task	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Simon effect; sequential modulations; ERP; conflict adaptation; feature integration	S-R COMPATIBILITY; RESPONSE ACTIVATION; CONFLICT ADAPTATION; STIMULUS; COMPONENT; INFORMATION; INTEGRATION; INDICATOR; MODEL; ERP	Subjects usually respond faster and more accurate in trials in which the response location corresponds to a task-irrelevant stimulus location compared to when not. Previous research has shown, that this so-called Simon effect is reduced after non-corresponding compared to after corresponding trials. As of now it is yet unclear what exact mechanisms drive such sequential modulations. One theory assumes a conflict adaptation mechanism that decreases the influence of incongruent information after non-corresponding trials via increased cognitive control. However, other authors claim that feature integration processes may be the underlying mechanism as the amount of feature overlap differs between different correspondence sequences. Unfortunately, this also means that in the standard Simon task the repetition of task features and correspondence sequences are not independent. In order to address this issue, we mapped four stimuli to two responses in the present EEG study. This way, we created a task, which allows for sequences in which the stimulus identity may change without alternating the required response. These sequences may either comprise a change of the stimulus position or not and the contribution of feature integration as well as conflict adaptation processes could thus be observed independently. Our results indicate that the repetition of task features affects performance to a stronger degree than the correspondence sequence and feature integration processes do. Yet, an impact of both could still be observed. The strongest effect of feature repetitions on task performance was observed for task-relevant features, especially for the imperative stimulus identity itself. The EEG results support these findings. The amplitudes of the fronto-central N2 and the parietal P3 decreased with increasing feature overlap from one trial to the next. The posterior lateralization, reflected by the posterior contralateral negativity (PCN), however, appears to reflect mainly changes in the stimulus location and stimulus-response (S-R) correspondence rather than feature repetitions per se.

A dimensional investigation of error-related negativity (ERN) and self-reported psychiatric symptoms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Error monitoring; Error-related negativity; Transdiagnostic psychiatry	OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; COGNITIVE CONTROL; VALIDATION; CHILDREN; CORRECT; IDENTIFICATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA	Alterations in error processing are implicated in a range of DSM-defined psychiatric disorders. For instance, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and generalised anxiety disorder show enhanced electrophysiological responses to errors-i.e. error-related negativity (ERN)-while others like schizophrenia have an attenuated ERN. However, as diagnostic categories in psychiatry are heterogeneous and also highly intercorrelated, the precise mapping of ERN enhancements/impairments is unclear. To address this, we recorded electroencephalograms (EEG) from 196 participants who performed the Flanker task and collected scores on 9 questionnaires assessing psychiatric symptoms to test if a dimensional framework could reveal specific transdiagnostic clinical manifestations of error processing dysfunctions. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found non-significant associations between ERN amplitude and symptom severity of OCD, trait anxiety, depression, social anxiety, impulsivity, eating disorders, alcohol addiction, schizotypy and apathy. A transdiagnostic approach did nothing to improve signal; there were non-significant associations between all three transdiagnostic dimensions (anxious-depression, compulsive behaviour and intrusive thought, and social withdrawal) and ERN magnitude. In these same individuals, we replicated a previously published transdiagnostic association between goal-directed learning and compulsive behaviour and intrusive thought. Possible explanations discussed are (i) that associations between the ERN and psychopathology might be smaller than previously assumed, (ii) that these associations might depend on a greater level of symptom severity than other transdiagnostic cognitive biomarkers, or (iii) that task parameters, such as the ratio of compatible to incompatible trials, might be crucial for ensuring the sensitivity of the ERN to clinical phenomena.

Unseen food images capture the attention of hungry viewers: Evidence from event-related potentials	APPETITE			English	Article							ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; CRAVINGS QUESTIONNAIRES; BIAS; AWARENESS; VALIDATION; PERCEPTION; APPETITE; STIMULI; IMPACT; INDEX	Motivationally relevant visual targets appear to capture visuospatial attention. This capture is evident behaviorally as faster and more accurate responses, and neurally as an enhanced-amplitude of the N2pc - an index of spatial attention allocation, which is observed even when observers are unaware of the target. In the case of reinforcers such as food or substances of dependence, it is likely that the motivational state of craving accompanying deprivation potentiates this capture. The automaticity of such attentional capture by reward-associated stimuli, as well as its possible interaction with craving, is as yet not completely understood, though it is likely a major explanatory factor in motivated behaviors. For the present experiment, participants completed two EEG recording sessions: one just after eating lunch (sated/non-craving), and the other following a minimum 12-h period of fasting (hungry/craving). For both sessions, participants identified food- and clothing-related targets embedded in an object-substitution masking paradigm, which yielded trials of full target visibility, as well as trials for which targets were present but undetected. Although masking equally disrupted visual awareness of both classes of targets as measured behaviorally, a three-way hunger by visibility by target interaction was observed in the neural data, with unseen food targets eliciting an enhanced N2pc. Interestingly, this subliminal attentional capture by food-related items was observed only during the "hungry" session. No such capture was evident under conditions of full visibility. These findings indicate that attentional capture by food-related images, and reflected in enhancements of the N2pc, is spurred by hunger, and that this effect can be viewed as automatic, or independent of explicit awareness of food-relevant target content.

We recorded brainwaves (electroencephalograms [EEGs]) as people read word-by-word and then correlated the predictability in context of indefinite articles that preceded nouns ( kite vs. an airplane) with the average event-related brain potentials (ERPs) they elicited [K. A. DeLong, T. P. Urbach, M. Kutas, Nat. Neurosci. 8, 1117-1121 (2005)]. Amid a broader controversy about the role of word-form prediction in comprehension, those findings were recently challenged by a failed putative direct replication attempt [M. S. Nieuwland et al., eLife 7, e33468 (2018); nine labs, one experiment, and 2.6e4 observations]. To better understand the empirical justification for positing an association between prenominal article predictability and scalp potentials, we conducted a wide-ranging exploratory data analysis (EDA), pooling our original data with extant data from two followup studies (one lab, three experiments, and 1.2e4 observations). We modeled the time course of article predictability in the single-trial data by fitting linear mixed-effects regression (LMER) models at each time point and scalp location spanning a 3-s interval before, during, and after the article. Model comparisons based on Akaike information criteria (AIC) and slope-regression ERPs [rERPs; N. J. Smith, M. Kutas, Psychophysiology 52, 157-168 (2015)] provide substantial empirical support for a small positive association between article predictability and scalp potentials approximately 300 to 500 ms after article onset, predominantly over bilateral posterior scalp. We think this effect may reasonably be attributed to prediction of upcoming word forms.

An exploration and a discussion	HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						RNN; CNN; LDA; ASD; ERP	BCI-COMPETITION-III; ATTENTION; AUTISM; PERFORMANCE; P300	Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one of the most common developmental conditions with one in 160 children worldwide being diagnosed. Both Virtual Reality (VR) and Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) are believed to be beneficial to enhance communication for people with ASD. However, BCI solutions for ASD are not yet commercially available. This is partly due to the current challenge with long and fatiguing calibration sessions with conventional gel based BCI. BCI using active electrodes hold the potentials to resolve part of this issue but might increase the challenges to classification of tasks due to reduced signal quality. The dataset considered in this paper, available from the IFMBE Scientific Challenge (IFMBE SC) of 15 participants with ASD, contained data captured using electroencephalogram (EEG) headsets, from g.Nautilus system, with active electrodes in a VR environment. Known approaches, such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) have demonstrated potential solutions to enhancing current algorithms. Nevertheless, in this paper, a novel Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) solution with several pre-processing methods was introduced. Our results show that our novel RNN solution achieved 92.59% accuracy, an improvement with 0.61 percentage point from the previously best reported algorithm during the IFMBE SC. Furthermore, with a standard 80%-20% initial separation strategy, our solution also generated a compatible accuracy at 89.92%.

Therefore, ErrPs must be decoded. The aim of this study was to evaluate ErrP decoding using combinations of different feature types and classifiers in BCI paradigms involving motor execution (ME) and imagination (MI). Fifteen healthy subjects performed 510 (ME) and 390 (MI) trials of right/left wrist extensions and foot dorsiflexions. Sham BCI feedback was delivered with an accuracy of 80% (ME) and 70% (MI). Continuous EEG was recorded and divided into ErrP and NonErrP epochs. Temporal, spectral, and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) marginals and template matching features were extracted, and all combinations of feature types were classified using linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, and random forest classifiers. ErrPs were elicited for both ME and MI paradigms, and the average classification accuracies were significantly higher than the chance level. The highest average classification accuracy was obtained using temporal features and a combination of temporal + DWT features classified with random forest; 89 +/- 9% and 83 +/- 9% for ME and MI, respectively. These results generally indicate that temporal features should be used when detecting ErrPs, but there is great inter-subject variability, which means that user-specific features should be derived to maximize the performance.

These improvements are often assumed to arise from selective attention processes, but longer-term plasticity as a result of training may also play a role. Here, listeners were trained to detect either an 861-Hz or 1058-Hz tone (counterbalanced across participants) presented in noise at SNRs varying from -10 to -24 dB. On the following day, they were tasked with detecting 861-Hz and 1058-Hz tones at an SNR of -21 dB. In between blocks of this active task, EEG was recorded during passive presentation of trained and untrained frequency tones in quiet. Detection accuracy and confidence ratings were higher for trials at listeners' trained, than untrained-frequency (i.e., learning occurred). During passive exposure to sounds, the P2 component of the auditory evoked potential (similar to 150 - 200 ms post tone onset) was larger in amplitude for the trained compared to the untrained frequency. An analysis of global field power similarly yielded a stronger response for trained tones in the P2 time window. These effects were obtained during passive exposure, suggesting that training induced improvements in detection are not solely related to changes in selective attention. Rather, there may be an important role for changes in the long-term neural representations of sounds.

The present first-line anti-migraine medications can cause overwhelming side-effects, of which one includes the onset of cardiovascular disease. As one of the marketed Tibetan drugs, Ru-yi-Zhen-bao Pills (RYZBP) have been clinically used to treat cardiovascular disorders and as anti-migraine medication. However, there is currently no research exploring the anti-migraine actions of RYZBP. Aim of the study: The current research was designed to assess the anti-migraine roles of RYZBP and explore the underlying mechanisms in a nitroglycerin (NTG)-induced migraine rat model trial. Materials and methods: 120 rats were randomly divided into the following six groups of 20 rats each: normal control group, model control group, positive control group, and RYZBP high/medium/low-dose groups (Ru-yiZhen-bao Pills; TH 1.00 g/kg, TM 0.50 g/kg and TL 0.25 g/kg). All rats were administered intragastrically for 7 consecutive days, which were subcutaneously injected with the NTG (10 mg/kg) after the last gavage (except in the normal control group). 3min after NTG treatment, 30 rats (5 rats from each group) were anesthetized and devoted to electroencephalogram(EEG) testing, which was used to evaluate the analgesic effect of RYZBP. One hour after NTG treatment, the rest of the 90 rats (15 rats from each group) were anesthetized and midbrain tissue sample was dissected. The dissection was then washed with physiological saline and collected. The histopathological changes in the periaqueductal gray(PAG) of 5 tissue samples were determined by aematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, as well as an estimation of substance P (SP) and neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) expression through immunohistochemically staining(IHC). Another 5 midbrain preparations were carried out to evaluate calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), proenkephalin (PENK), SP, and cholecystokinin (CCK) expressions by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The rest of the 5 brainstem tissues were then used to measure CCK, CGRP, and opioid peptide receptor (DORR) levels by western blotting(WB). Results: In the EEG test, RYZBP (TM 0.50 g / kg) treatment transformed the EEG pain-wave of the NTG-induced migraine model rats in different time period. In the mechanism assay, compared with the model control group, RYZBP pretreatment reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, fibrosis and vacuolation of neuronal cells of PAG tissue seen by HE staining. IHC experiments further showed that RYZBPTM up-regulated SP expression levels and enhanced NK1R levels in the NTG-induced migraine rats (P < 0.05). Therapeutic administration of RYZBP also increased PENK mRNA expression and DORR protein level. Both RT-qPCR and western blotting trials indicated that RYZBP treatment significantly decreased CCK and CGRP expression levels (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05) in the NTG-induced migraine rats. Conclusions: RYZBP has the potential to be an effective anti-migraine treatment through suppressing the EEG pain-wave, increasing the levels of SP, PENK, DORR and reducing expression of CCK and CGRP. Mediating the PAG anti-nociceptive channel and inhibiting central sensitization were the two potential mechanisms, which offers further evidence for clinical therapy.

Outpatients with Major Depression Disorder (MDD, n=44) and healthy controls (HCs, n=28) were administered the Beck Depression Inventory-I (BDI-I), the Three-Dimensional Psychological Pain Scale (TDPPS), and the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS), and then patients were allocated to two groups: suicide attempts (MDD-SA, n=12) and suicidal ideation (MDD-SI, n=32). All participants were required to complete the measurements and performed the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task with recording of electroencephalography synchronously. The MDD-SA group scored higher in the BDI-I, total TDPPS, pain avoidance subscale, and BSS-W scores than the MDD-SI and healthy control groups. Pain avoidance subscale scores had the highest correlations with SA than other inventory scores. The P3 elicited by negative feedback under punitive condition was significantly larger than those of reward and neutral conditions in the MDD-SA group, whereas no significant differences were found between the MDD-SI and HC groups. The P3 elicited by punitive and reward cues was negatively correlated to the total TDPPS and pain avoidance scores, and the P3 elicited by positive feedback in reward and punitive conditions was negatively correlated to the total TDPPS and painful feeing scores. Pain avoidance is a strong behavioral index in distinguishing suicide attempters from suicide ideators. The P3 patterns elicited by punitive cue and feedback may represent psychological pain processing which contribute to suicide act.

Knowing the maturational trajectory of auditory cortex responses to human voice in typically developing young children is crucial for identifying voice processing abnormalities in children at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders and language impairment. An early prominent positive component in the cerebral auditory response in newborns has been reported in previous electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies. However, it is not clear whether this prominent component in infants less than 1 year of age corresponds to the auditory P1m component that has been reported in young children over 2 years of age. Methods To test the hypothesis that the early prominent positive component in infants aged 0 years is an immature manifestation of P1m that we previously reported in children over 2 years of age, we performed a longitudinal MEG study that focused on this early component and examined the maturational changes over three years starting from age 0. Five infants participated in this 3-year longitudinal study. Results This research revealed that the early prominent component in infants aged 3 month corresponded to the auditory P1m component in young children over 2 years old, which we had previously reported to be related to language development and/or autism spectrum disorders. Conclusion Our data revealed the development of the auditory-evoked field in the left and right hemispheres from 0- to 3-year-old children. These results contribute to the elucidation of the development of brain functions in infants.

Auditory categorical processing for speech is modulated by inherent musical listening skills	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						auditory event-related potentials; categorical perception; electro-encephalography; individual differences; Profile of Music Perception Skills	NEURAL ORGANIZATION; BRAIN-STEM; PERCEPTION; EXPERIENCE; CATEGORIZATION; CORTEX; NOISE	During successful auditory perception, the human brain classifies diverse acoustic information into meaningful groupings, a process known as categorical perception (CP). Intense auditory experiences (e.g., musical training and language expertise) shape categorical representations necessary for speech identification and novel sound-to-meaning learning, but little is known concerning the role of innate auditory function in CP. Here, we tested whether listeners vary in their intrinsic abilities to categorize complex sounds and individual differences in the underlying auditory brain mechanisms. To this end, we recorded EEGs in individuals without formal music training but who differed in their inherent auditory perceptual abilities (i.e., musicality) as they rapidly categorized sounds along a speech vowel continuum. Behaviorally, individuals with naturally more adept listening skills ("musical sleepers") showed enhanced speech categorization in the form of faster identification. At the neural level, inverse modeling parsed EEG data into different sources to evaluate the contribution of region-specific activity [i.e., auditory cortex (AC)] to categorical neural coding. We found stronger categorical processing in musical sleepers around the timeframe of P2 (180 ms) in the right AC compared to those with poorer musical listening abilities. Our data show that listeners with naturally more adept auditory skills map sound to meaning more efficiently than their peers, which may aid novel sound learning related to language and music acquisition.

Yet, little is known about how reduced PVS activation emerges across development or what implications it has for prevention. We review genetic, temperament, parenting, and naturalistic and laboratory stress research on neural measures of PVS and outline developmentally-informed models of trajectories of PVS activation. PVS function is partly heritable and appears to reflect individual differences in early-emerging temperament traits. Although lab-induced stressors blunt PVS activation, effects of parenting and naturalistic stress on PVS are mixed and depend on the type of stressor, developmental timing, and interactions amongst risk factors. We propose that there may be multiple, dynamic developmental trajectories to reduced PVS activation in which combinations of genes, temperament, and exposure to severe, prolonged, or uncontrollable stress may exert direct and interactive effects on PVS function. Critically, these risk factors may alter PVS developmental trajectories and/or PVS sensitivity to proximal stressors. Distinct factors may converge such that PVS activation proceeds along a typical, accelerated, chronically low, or stress-reactive trajectory. Finally, we present directions for future research with translational implications.

Behaviorally, children acquire adult-like sensitivity to natural image statistics during middle childhood (Ellemberg et al., 2012), but infants exhibit sensitivity to deviations of natural image structure (Balas & Woods, 2014). We used event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine sensitivity to natural image statistics during childhood at distinct processing stages (the P1 and N1 components). We presented children (5-10 years old) and adults with natural images varying in positive/negative contrast, and natural/synthetic texture appearance to compare electrophysiological responses to images that did or did not violate natural statistics. We hypothesized that children would acquire sensitivity to these deviations late in middle childhood. Instead, we observed significant responses to unnatural contrast and texture statistics at the N1 in all age groups. At the P1, however, only young children exhibited sensitivity to contrast polarity. The latter effect suggests greater sensitivity earlier in development to some violations of natural image statistics. We discuss these results in terms of changing patterns of invariant texture processing during middle childhood and ongoing refinement of the representations supporting natural image perception.

However, in pathological anxiety, this attentional mechanism seems to be dysfunctional, which leads to an exaggeration of threat processing and significant functional impairment. This attentional threat bias (ATB) has been proposed as a key mechanism in the etiology and maintenance of anxiety disorders. Recently, evidence has accumulated that the behavioral assessment of ATB by means of reaction times is compromised by conceptual and methodological problems. In this review paper we argue that a brain-based assessment of ATB, which includes different mechanistic aspects of biased attention, may provide neuro-mechanistic knowledge regarding the etiology and maintenance of anxiety, and potentially start identifying different targets for effective treatment. We summarize examples for such an approach, highlighting the strengths of electrophysiological measurements, which include the sensitivity to time dynamics, specificity to specific neurocomputational mechanisms, and the continuous/dimensional nature of the resulting variables. These desirable properties are a prerequisite for developing trans-diagnostic biomarkers of attentional bias, and hence may inform individually tailored treatment approaches.

Neural Correlate of Acceptance: Relating Individual Differences in Dispositional Acceptance to Error Processing	MINDFULNESS			English	Article						Acceptance; Mindfulness; Nonreactivity; ERN; Performance monitoring	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NEGATIVITY ERN; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; EMOTION REGULATION; MINDFULNESS; MEDITATION; ATTENTION; ANXIETY; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; QUESTIONNAIRE	Objectives Many of the observed benefits following mindfulness training are associated with changes to acceptance, characterized by having less reactivity to, and judgment of, one's experiences. Acceptance may be particularly relevant to the processing of errors, as errors often enlist difficult cognitive and affective reactions. Error processing can be measured by error-related negativity (ERN), a negative deflection that directly reflects the brain's signal of error processing. The present study examined whether error processing may be a neural correlate of acceptance at the dispositional level in non-clinical populations, outside the context of meditation training. Methods Thirty-seven participants, with a mean age of 22 years (SD = 5.79), 48.6% female, completed a Go/No-Go (GNG) task while their performance was monitored with an electroencephalogram (EEG) to measure the ERN and the co-occurring behaviors of response inhibition. Acceptance was measured by the nonreactivity and nonjudging subscales of the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). Results Nonreactivity correlated with a less negative ERN (r = 0.43, p = 0.01, 95% CI = [0.11, 0.67]), and higher acceptance correlated with faster reaction time (r = - 0.48, p = 0.003, 95% CI = [- 0.70, - 0.18]), without any trade-offs in accuracy. Conclusions Findings suggest that individuals higher in acceptance may process errors and competing responses with less neural activity while still displaying similar behavioral responses. Given the limited objective measures for assessing acceptance and the benefits associated with acceptance, the presence of these neural and behavioral correlates of acceptance may inform the clinical research of mindfulness interventions.

Peter; Perrault, Ella			Familiarity-related filler items enhance the RT CIT, but not the P300 CIT: Episodic vs. Semantic memory protocols	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						P300; Reaction time; CIT; Information-detection; Familiarity-related fillers; EEG; ERP	ERP	The reaction time-based concealed information test (RT CIT) typically uses three types of stimuli: 1) probe (i.e., crime-related item), 2) irrelevant (i.e., crime-unrelated item) and 3) target (i.e., an irrelevant item assigned a unique response so as to ensure attention to the test). Luk ' acs, et al., (2017) introduced familiarity-related filler items to the RT CIT, enhancing the efficacy of the test for both single and multiple probe (per block) protocols. Our study aims to A) replicate the effects of familiarity-related filler items on the RT CIT, B) use P300 to investigate the mechanisms of the fillers-related enhancement effect on the RT CIT, C) investigate whether these fillers can enhance the efficacy of the typical P300-based CIT, and D) explore the effects of fillers on the semantic and episodic versions of the P300 and RT CITs. We replicated a clear fillers-related enhancement of the RT CIT (N = 38 for Fillers, N = 37 for No Fillers). Semantic and Episodic experiments were enhanced equally-well by filler items. No effect of fillers was observed on P300 amplitude for CIT stimuli, however, an interaction involving P300 latency suggests that fillers facilitated the processing of Semantic information over Episodic information. Our study independently replicates a valuable improvement of the traditional RT CIT, investigates the potential mechanisms of this enhancement effect, and demonstrates important differences between the P300 and RT CITs.

We investigated processing of Norwegian propositional attitude sentences with plausible or implausible complement clauses ('Magnus {knows/believes/dreams/doubts/imagines} that mosquitos live off {blood/vodka}'). Using ERPs, we tested the hypothesis that the amplitude of the N400 component is sensitive to the plausibility of the attitude sentence as a whole, as opposed to that of the complement clause. If the hypothesis is correct, the N400 should be larger for implausible clauses (vodka > blood) under know and believe, it should be canceled (vodka similar to blood) under dream, and it should be reversed (vodka < blood) under doubt and imagine. These predictions were not borne out. We found N400 effects for all attitude sentences, tracking the plausibility of complement clauses (vodka > blood), except for imagine ('innbille' in Norwegian has a counterfactual sense), where the effect was suppressed, but not reversed. Moreover, we observed modulations of late ERP components for implausible clauses (vodka > blood) under doubt and imagine, i.e., when the plausibility of the attitude sentence requires an implausible complement clause. We propose that (a) the N400, in general, reflects processing of semantic relations in phrasal and clausal contexts, and it is not necessarily sensitive to sentence plausibility, and (b) later components index integration of information from embedded clauses into a sentence model.

CLoSES: A platform for closed-loop intracranial stimulation in humans	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Closed-loop; Direct electrical stimulation; Neuromodulation; intracranial EEG	BRAIN-STIMULATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; SYSTEM; NEUROSTIMULATION; TETRAPLEGIA	Targeted interrogation of brain networks through invasive brain stimulation has become an increasingly important research tool as well as therapeutic modally. The majority of work with this emerging capability has been focused on open-loop approaches. Closed-loop techniques, however, could improve neuromodulatory therapies and research investigations by optimizing stimulation approaches using neurally informed, personalized targets. Implementing closed-loop systems is challenging particularly with regard to applying consistent strategies considering inter-individual variability. In particular, during intracranial epilepsy monitoring, where much of this research is currently progressing, electrodes are implanted exclusively for clinical reasons. Thus, detection and stimulation sites must be participant- and task-specific. The system must run in parallel with clinical systems, integrate seamlessly with existing setups, and ensure safety features are in place. In other words, a robust, yet flexible platform is required to perform different tests with a single participant and to comply with clinical requirements. In order to investigate closed-loop stimulation for research and therapeutic use, we developed a Closed-Loop System for Electrical Stimulation (CLoSES) that computes neural features which are then used in a decision algorithm to trigger stimulation in near real-time. To summarize CLoSES, intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) signals are acquired, band-pass filtered, and local and network features are continuously computed. If target features are detected (e.g. above a preset threshold for a certain duration), stimulation is triggered. Not only could the system trigger stimulation while detecting real-time neural features, but we incorporated a pipeline wherein we used an encoder/decoder model to estimate a hidden cognitive state from the neural features. CLoSES provides a flexible platform to implement a variety of closed-loop experimental paradigms in humans. CLoSES has been successfully used with twelve patients implanted with depth electrodes in the epilepsy monitoring unit. During cognitive tasks (N=5), stimulation in closed loop modified a cognitive hidden state on a trial by trial basis. Sleep spindle oscillations (N=6) and sharp transient epileptic activity (N=9) were detected in near real-time, and stimulation was applied during the event or at specified delays (N=3). In addition, we measured the capabilities of the CLoSES system. Total latency was related to the characteristics of the event being detected, with tens of milliseconds for epileptic activity and hundreds of milliseconds for spindle detection. Stepwise latency, the actual duration of each continuous step, was within the specified fixed-step duration and increased linearly with the number of channels and features. We anticipate that probing neural dynamics and interaction between brain states and stimulation responses with CLoSES will lead to novel insights into the mechanism of normal and pathological brain activity, the discovery and evaluation of potential electrographic biomarkers of neurological and psychiatric disorders, and the development and testing of patient-specific stimulation targets and control signals before implanting a therapeutic device.

However, existing evidence is limited to one study with a small sample size (n = 24). Our aim was to extend previous work by investigating the relationship between the CDA and MCI risk in a large sample of older adults (n = 76). We used a regression approach to determine whether (and when) CDA amplitude predicted MCI risk, as indexed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). CDA amplitude from similar to 300-500 and similar to 800-900 ms predicted MoCA performance. However, significant effects were only observed for specific electrodes (P5/P6 and CP3/CP4, but not PO7/PO8) and the nature of the relationship between the CDA and MoCA scores differed across time and according to set size. Bayesian regression analysis indicated partial evidence in favour of the null hypothesis (BF10 values = 4-1.18). Contrary to previous results, our findings suggest that the CDA may not a robust marker of MCI risk. More broadly, our results highlight the difficulty in identifying at-risk individuals, particularly as MCI is a heterogeneous, unstable condition. Future research should prioritise longitudinal approaches in order to track the progression of the CDA and its association with cognitive decline in later life.

Empirical and theoretical accounts of this phenomenon suggest that the body ownership illusion relies not on a single process, but rather on the alignment of the biological and the alternative bodies across multiple aspects. However, the portrayal of these aspects and the demarcation of their neurophysiological correlates has yet to be established. Our study examines electroencephalographic (EEG) markers of two extensively studied systems in the context of virtual body ownership illusion: the mirror-neuron system (MNS) and the error-monitoring system (EMS). We designed an experimental manipulation of brief involuntary and unexpected virtual hand bounces, which triggers both systems, and examined how the response of EEG markers of these systems to this manipulation is modulated by three aspects of body ownership: agency, visuotactile synchronicity, and semantic congruence between the participant's hands and its virtual representation. We found evidence for enhanced MNS-related power suppression at the Mu band in the synchronous and semantic congruence conditions. On the other hand, the EMS-related Pe/P300 wave was reduced by semantic congruence. This Pe/P300 effect was stronger among participants who exhibited higher acceptance of the spatial illusion and an increased tendency for affective empathy. Mu power and Pe/P300 were not correlated, suggesting a dissociation between the distinct aspects of body ownership they probe. The findings suggest that synchronicity and semantic congruence induce sensorimotor sensitivity to the alternative body, whereas the latter parameter also buffers minor erroneous virtual motions. These neurophysiological markers may be added to the arsenal of body ownership probes and incorporated into VR rehabilitation protocols.

EEG-based neurofeedback training is a possible strategy to improve the social abilities in Autism-Spectrum Disorder (ASD) subjects. This paper presents a BCI P300 ERPs based protocol optimization used for the enhancement of joint-attention skills in ASD subjects, using a robust logistic regression with Automatic Relevance Determination based on full Variational Bayesian inference (VB-ARD). The performance of the proposed approach was investigated utilizing the IFMBE 2019 Scientific Challenge Competition dataset, which consisted of 15 ASD subjects who underwent a total of 7 BCI sessions spread over 4 months. The results showed that the proposed VB-ARD approach eliminates irrelevant channels and features effectively, producing a robust sparse model with 81.5 +/- 12.0% accuracy in relatively short modeling computational time 19.3 +/- 1.4 s, and it outperforms the standard regularized logistic regression in terms of accuracy and speed needed to produce the BCI model. This paper demonstrated the effectiveness of the probabilistic approach using Bayesian inference for the production of a robust BCI model. Considering the good classification accuracy over sessions and fast modeling time the proposed method could be a useful tool used for the BCI based protocol for the improvement of joint-attention ability in ASD subjects.

J	Retter, TL; Jiang, F; Webster, MA; Rossion, B				Retter, Talia L.; Jiang, Fang; Webster, Michael A.; Rossion, Bruno			All-or-none face categorization in the human brain	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY; PERCEPTUAL AWARENESS; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; SINGLE-TRIAL; RECOGNITION; CORTEX; FMRI; ACTIVATION; THRESHOLD	Visual categorization is integral for our interaction with the natural environment. In this process, similar selective responses are produced to a class of variable visual inputs. Whether categorization is supported by partial (graded) or absolute (all-or-none) neural responses in high-level human brain regions is largely unknown. We address this issue with a novel frequency-sweep paradigm probing the evolution of face categorization responses between the minimal and optimal stimulus presentation times. In a first experiment, natural images of variable non-face objects were progressively swept from 120 to 3 Hz (8.33-333 ms duration) in rapid serial visual presentation sequences. Widely variable face exemplars appeared every 1 s, enabling an implicit frequency-tagged face-categorization electroencephalographic (EEG) response at 1 Hz. Face-categorization activity emerged with stimulus durations as brief as 17 ms (17-83 ms across individual participants) but was significant with 33 ms durations at the group level. The face categorization response amplitude increased until 83 ms stimulus duration (12 Hz), implying graded categorization responses. In a second EEG experiment, faces appeared non-periodically throughout such sequences at fixed presentation rates, while participants explicitly categorized faces. A strong correlation between response amplitude and behavioral accuracy across frequency rates suggested that dilution from missed categorizations, rather than a decreased response to each face stimulus, accounted for the graded categorization responses as found in Experiment 1. This was supported by (1) the absence of neural responses to faces that participants failed to categorize explicitly in Experiment 2 and (2) equivalent amplitudes and spatio-temporal signatures of neural responses to behaviorally categorized faces across presentation rates. Overall, these observations provide original evidence that high-level visual categorization of faces, starting at about 100 ms following stimulus onset in the human brain, is variable across observers tested under tight temporal constraints, but occurs in an all-or-none fashion.

J	Wessel, JR				Wessel, Jan R.			beta-Bursts Reveal the Trial-to-Trial Dynamics of Movement Initiation and Cancellation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						beta-bursts; EEG; motor inhibition; movement; response inhibition; stop-signal task	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; PROACTIVE INHIBITORY CONTROL; INFERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; MOTOR CORTEX; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; STOPPING ACTION; SCALP EEG	The neurophysiological basis of motor control is of substantial interest to basic researchers and clinicians alike. Motor processes are accompanied by prominent field potential changes in the beta-frequency band (15-29 Hz): in trial-averages, movement initiation is accompanied by beta-band desynchronization over sensorimotor areas, whereas movement cancellation is accompanied by beta -power increases over , (pre)frontal areas. However, averaging misrepresents the true nature of the beta-signal. Unaveraged beta-band activity is characterized by short-lasting, burst-like events, rather than by steady modulations. Therefore, averaging-based quantifications may miss important brain-behavior relationships. To investigate how beta-bursts relate to movement in male and female humans (N = 234), we investigated scalp-recorded beta-band activity during the stop-signal task, which operationalizes both movement initiation and cancellation. Both processes were indexed by systematic spatiotemporal changes in beta-burst rates. Before movement initiation, beta-bursting was prominent at bilateral sensorimotor sites. These burst-rates predicted reaction time (a relationship that was absent in trial-average data), suggesting that sensorimotor beta-bursting signifies an inhibited motor system, which has to be overcome to initiate movements. Indeed, during movement initiation, sensorimotor burst-rates steadily decreased, lateralizing just before movement execution. In contrast, successful movement cancellation was signified by increased phasic beta-bursting over fronto-central sites. Such beta-bursts were followed by short latency increases of bilateral sensorimotor beta-burst rates, suggesting that motor inhibition can be rapidly re-instantiated by frontal areas when movements have to be rapidly cancelled. Together, these findings suggest that beta-bursting is a fundamental signature of the motor system, used by both sensorimotor and frontal areas involved in the trial-by-trial control of behavior.

We investigated the effects of rhythm-based temporal expectation on auditory responses measured with EEG recorded from the frontocentral sites implicated in auditory processing. By manipulating temporal expectation and the interonset interval (IOI) of tones, we examined how neural responses adapted to auditory rhythm and reacted to stimuli that violated the rhythm. Participants passively listened to the tones while watching a silent nature video. In Experiment 1 (n= 22), in the long-IOI block, tones were frequently presented (80%) with 1.7-sec IOI and infrequently presented (20%) with 1.2-sec IOI, generating unexpectedly early tones that violated temporal expectation. Conversely, in the short-IOI block, tones were frequently presented with 1.2-sec IOI and infrequently presented with 1.7-sec IOI, generating late tones. We analyzed the tone-evoked N1-P2 amplitude of ERPs and intertrial phase clustering in the theta-alpha band. The results provided evidence of strong delay-dependent adaptation effects (short-term, sensitive to IOI), weak cumulative adaptation effects (long-term, driven by tone repetition over time), and robust temporal-expectation violation effects over and above the adaptation effects. Experiment 2 (n= 22) repeated Experiment 1 with shorter IOIs of 1.2 and 0.7 sec. Overall, we found evidence of strong delay-dependent adaptation effects, weak cumulative adaptation effects (which may most efficiently accumulate at the tone presentation rate of similar to 1 Hz), and robust temporal-expectation violation effects that substantially boost auditory responses to the extent of overriding the delay-dependent adaptation effects likely through mechanisms involved in exogenous attention.

BASIS Team	Neural and behavioural indices of face processing in siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD): A longitudinal study from infancy to mid-childhood	CORTEX			English	Article						Autism spectrum disorder (ASD); Infant siblings; Face processing; EEG; Development	RESEARCH CONSORTIUM; SOCIAL ATTENTION; EMOTIONAL FACES; ATYPICAL FACE; RISK; N170; SPECIALIZATION; INDIVIDUALS; RECOGNITION; PERCEPTION	Impaired face processing is proposed to play a key role in the early development of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and to be an endophenotypic trait which indexes genetic risk for the disorder. However, no published work has examined the development of face processing abilities from infancy into the school-age years and how they relate to ASD symptoms in individuals with or at high-risk for ASD. In this novel study we investigated neural and behavioural measures of face processing at age 7 months and again in mid-childhood (age 7 years) as well as social-communication and sensory symptoms in siblings at high (n = 42) and low (n = 35) familial risk for ASD. In mid-childhood, high-risk siblings showed atypical P1 and N170 event-related potential correlates of face processing and, for high-risk boys only, poorer face and object recognition ability compared to low-risk siblings. These neural and behavioural atypicalities were associated with each other and with higher social-communication and sensory symptoms in mid-childhood. Additionally, more atypical neural correlates of object (but not face) processing in infancy were associated with less right-lateralised (more atypical) N170 amplitudes and greater social-communication problems in mid-childhood. The implications for models of face processing in ASD are discussed. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we asked how the perception of facial identity is influenced by the set of preceding faces that observers are exposed to. We morphed the faces of Adam and Bob to generate a continuum of face images, and asked subjects to judge the identity of those face images to be Adam or Bob after they were exposed to a face image within the continuum. We found that after adaptation to Bob, the subjects were apt to identify a subsequently presented ambiguous face to be Adam, and vice versa, i.e., the face identity aftereffect (FIAE). We simultaneously recorded EEG during the task and analyzed the event-related potentials in response to the test faces, and found that adapting to a face identity (e.g., Bob) suppressed the amplitude, and prolonged the latency, of the late positive potential (LPP) in response to subsequent faces of the same identity (e.g., Bob). Further analyses of the LPP in response to each test face within the continuum revealed a proportional changing trend, i.e., the strongest LPP suppression happened when the adaptor and the test face were the most similar, while the similarity declined, the LPP gradually recovered from suppression. The modulations of LPP amplitude and latency by the identity similarity between the adaptor and test face strongly indicate that the proportionally suppressed and prolonged LPP activity acts as a neurophysiological correlate of FIAE.

When there is a delay between action and outcome, this response must be remembered if you are to learn from the experience. Previous studies have shown that the Stimulus-Preceding Negativity (SPN) recorded during the delay interval is larger under conditions that foster a sense of agency. In an EEG experiment (N = 27), we confirmed that the SPN is larger when participants have a choice between two responses in a gambling task as compared to when there is only a single button and the computer determines the monetary outcome. This SPN agency effect was largest over right prefrontal cortex and it did not vary significantly between trial blocks in which only gains or only losses were possible. Participants in a second experiment (N = 26) performed the same task while activity in anterior insular cortex, a known SPN generator, was measured via functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI). An essentially identical pattern of results was obtained: Activity was greater on choice than no-choice trials, especially for the right hemisphere, and no effect of contextual valence was observed. Although parallel observations such as these cannot warrant causal inference, our findings are consistent with the assumption that anterior insular cortex contributes to the effect of agency on the SPN.

J	Jovicevic, J				Jovicevic, Jasna			Composing the Actual: Brainwave Sonification as Materialized Intensity of Virtual Relations	AM JOURNAL OF ART AND MEDIA STUDIES			English	Article						sonified brain waves; virtual-actual dimension; open-social; affective interaction; music experiment		My recently performed experimental music performance I Sit and Worry About Her comprises a transdisciplinary research project that explores the function of large-scale cortical networks and application of EEG, monitoring the brainwaves in music making and perceiving. The project aims at understanding the activity of the brain and its electric impulses as an affect or intensity of virtual relations. There are several assemblages that relate rhizomatically in different dimensions inside an event; from minor gestures in the brain's electric impulse continuum, its self-enjoyment and experience of sound frequencies, to the affective modality that creates authentic collective identity during the performance, thus questioning the unity of movement between subject and object. The project involves playing pre-recorded music content back to the performance space in real time, triggered by a threshold of a certain brainwave frequency; thus, it functions as a sonification of the brain's electricity - a kind of materialization of a virtual property. Pre-recorded music is perceived in the performing space before the subject becomes a knower of the actualized potential, before she perceives her thought. Does that make me a composer of the perceiver's actual dimension?

Association between depression and hostile attribution bias in hostile and non-hostile individuals: An ERP study	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						Depression; Aggression; Hostile attribution bias; Eeg; Erp; N400	NEGATIVE URGENCY; INFORMATION; AGGRESSION; ADULTS; IRRITABILITY; VALIDATION; COMPONENT	Background: Hostility and aggression have been found to be highly prevalent among depressed patients and are associated with higher comorbidity and illness severity levels. Although negative interpretation biases are a fundamental element of cognitive models of depression, few studies have examined the specific biases in information processing, mainly the hostile attribution bias, found in hostile individuals who present depressive symptoms. Method: Using pre-collected data from a sample of 72 (male=41,6%, female=58,3%) undergraduate and community-based hostile (n = 26) and non-hostile (n = 46) adult participants, the authors aimed to examine the association between depression and the hostile attribution bias by determining whether depression level scores were uniquely related to electrophysiological measures of the hostile attribution bias. Results: The hostile group showed higher measured levels of depression and reactive aggression compared to the non-hostile group. Also, depression scores were significant predictors of the N400 effect in the non-hostile task condition, while reactive aggression was not, whereas in the hostile condition, the overall model was significant, with depression and reactive aggression levels both showing strong trends towards significance. Limitations: A small sample size limited the scope of our conclusions. Also, sample selection prevented us from examining specific group differences regarding the hostile attribution bias in depressed and non-depressed groups. Conclusion: Clinical and research implications include the necessity to apply cognitive restructuring techniques to counter biased interpretation processes in settings where depression and aggression intersect, and the need to consider alternatives to self-evaluative methodologies.

Whether TMR acts locally or globally on cortical sleep oscillations remains unknown. Here, we exploit the unique functional neuroanatomy of olfaction with its ipsilateral stimulus processing to perform local TMR in one brain hemisphere. Participants learned associations between words and locations in left or right visual fields with contextual odor throughout. We found lateralized event-related potentials during task training that indicate unihemispheric memory processes. During post-learning naps, odors were presented to one nostril in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Memory for specific words processed in the cued hemisphere (ipsilateral to stimulated nostril) was improved after local TMR during sleep. Unilateral odor cues locally modulated slow-wave (SW) power such that regional SW power increase was lower in the cued hemisphere relative to the uncued hemisphere and negatively correlated with select memories for cued words. Moreover, local TMR improved phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between slow oscillations and sleep spindles specifically in the cued hemisphere. The effects on memory performance and cortical sleep oscillations were not observed when unilateral olfactory stimulation during sleep followed learning without contextual odor. Thus, TMR in human sleep transcends global action by selectively promoting specific memories associated with local sleep oscillations.

J	Muckschel, M; Roessner, V; Beste, C				Mueckschel, Moritz; Roessner, Veit; Beste, Christian			Task experience eliminates catecholaminergic effects on inhibitory control - A randomized, double-blind cross-over neurophysiological study	EUROPEAN NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Catecholamines; Response inhibition; EEG; Methylphenidate; Study designs	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; ITERATION DECOMPOSITION RIDE; FRONTAL THETA ACTIVITY; NOREPINEPHRINE SYSTEM; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; LOCUS-COERULEUS; ERP COMPONENTS; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; COGNITIVE CONTROL	Catecholaminergic neural transmission plays an important role during the inhibition of prepotent responses. Methylphenidate (MPH) is an important drug that modulates the catecholaminergic system. However, theoretical considerations suggest that the effects of drugs (e.g. MPH) on cognitive control may depend on prior learning effects. Here we investigate this in a conflict-modulated Go/Nogo task and evaluate neurophysiological processes associated with this dynamic using EEG signal decomposition methods and source localization analysis. The behavioral data show that prior learning experiences eliminate effects of MPH on response inhibition processes. On a neurophysiological level, we show that MPH modulates specific processes in medial frontal brain regions. Although MPH seems to consistently modulate neurophysiological processes associated with response inhibition, this is no longer sufficient to modulate behavioral performance once learning or task familiarization processes have taken place. An important consequence of this study finding is that it may be important to adjust MPH dosage depending on learning effects in a specific setting to constantly increase cognitive control functions in that setting. This has important implications for clinical practice, since MPH is the first-line pharmacological therapy in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Cross-over study designs with constant doses of MPH can mask effects on cognitive functions. The impact of learning needs careful consideration in cross-over study designs examining catecholaminergic drug effects. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All rights reserved.

Participants first listened to two-part auditory sequences (Listen condition). Each part featured a single pitch presented at a fixed rate; the integer ratio formed between the two rates varied in rhythmic complexity from low (1:1) to moderate (1:2) to high (3:2). One of the two parts occurred at a constant rate across conditions. Then, participants heard the same rhythms as they synchronized their tapping at a fixed rate (Synchronize condition). Finally, they tapped at the same fixed rate (Motor condition). Auditory feedback from their taps was present in all conditions. Behavioral effects of rhythmic complexity were evidenced in all tasks; detection of missing beats (Listen) worsened in the most complex (3:2) rhythm condition, and tap durations (Synchronize) were most variable and least synchronous with stimulus onsets in the 3:2 condition. EEG power spectral density was lowest at the fixed rate during the 3:2 rhythm and greatest during the 1:1 rhythm (Listen and Synchronize). ERP amplitudes corresponding to an N1 time window were smallest for the 3:2 rhythm and greatest for the 1:1 rhythm (Listen). Finally, synchronization accuracy (Synchronize) decreased as amplitudes in the N1 time window became more positive during the high rhythmic complexity condition (3:2). Thus, measures of neural entrainment corresponded to synchronization accuracy, and rhythmic complexity modulated the behavioral and neural measures similarly.

Cortical Microcircuit Mechanisms of Mismatch Negativity and Its Underlying Subcomponents	FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS			English	Review						adaptation; deviance detection; interneuron; NMDA; somatostatin; parvalbumin; cortex; schizophrenia	STIMULUS-SPECIFIC ADAPTATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SENSORY NERVE-ENDINGS; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; AUDITORY-CORTEX; DEVIANCE DETECTION; SYNAPTIC MECHANISMS; INTERNEURONS CONTROL; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; INHIBITORY NEURONS	In the neocortex, neuronal processing of sensory events is significantly influenced by context. For instance, responses in sensory cortices are suppressed to repetitive or redundant stimuli, a phenomenon termed "stimulus-specific adaptation" (SSA). However, in a context in which that same stimulus is novel, or deviates from expectations, neuronal responses are augmented. This augmentation is termed "deviance detection" (DD). This contextual modulation of neural responses is fundamental for how the brain efficiently processes the sensory world to guide immediate and future behaviors. Notably, context modulation is deficient in some neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ), as quantified by reduced "mismatch negativity" (MMN), an electroencephalography waveform reflecting a combination of SSA and DD in sensory cortex. Although the role of NMDA-receptor function and other neuromodulatory systems on MMN is established, the precise microcircuit mechanisms of MMN and its underlying components, SSA and DD, remain unknown. When coupled with animal models, the development of powerful precision neurotechnologies over the past decade carries significant promise for making new progress into understanding the neurobiology of MMN with previously unreachable spatial resolution. Currently, rodent models represent the best tool for mechanistic study due to the vast genetic tools available. While quantifying human-like MMN waveforms in rodents is not straightforward, the "oddball" paradigms used to study it in humans and its underlying subcomponents (SSA/DD) are highly translatable across species. Here we summarize efforts published so far, with a focus on cortically measured SSA and DD in animals to maintain relevance to the classically measured MMN, which has cortical origins. While mechanistic studies that measure and contrast both components are sparse, we synthesize a potential set of microcircuit mechanisms from the existing rodent, primate, and human literature. While MMN and its subcomponents likely reflect several mechanisms across multiple brain regions, understanding fundamental microcircuit mechanisms is an important step to understand MMN as a whole. We hypothesize that SSA reflects adaptations occurring at synapses along the sensory-thalamocortical pathways, while DD depends on both SSA inherited from afferent inputs and resulting disinhibition of non-adapted neurons arising from the distinct physiology and wiring properties of local interneuronal subpopulations and NMDA-receptor function.

NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Auditory; Attention; Memory; Implicit; EEG	IMPLICIT MEMORY; RECOGNITION MEMORY; RECOLLECTION; DISSOCIATION; CONTEXT; ERP; SEGMENTATION; SPECIFICITY; POTENTIALS; RETRIEVAL	The current study addressed the relation between awareness, attention, and memory, by examining whether merely presenting a tone and audio-clip, without deliberately associating one with other, was sufficient to bias attention to a given side. Participants were exposed to 80 different audio-clips (half included a lateralized pure tone) and told to classify audio-clips as natural (e.g., waterfall) or manmade (e.g., airplane engine). A surprise memory test followed, in which participants pressed a button to a lateralized faint tone (target) embedded in each audio-clip. They also indicated if the clip was (i) old/new; (ii) recollected/familiar; and (iii) if the tone was on left/right/not present when they heard the clip at exposure. The results demonstrate good explicit memory for the clip, but not for tone location. Response times were faster for old than for new clips but did not vary according to the target-context associations. Neuro-electric activity revealed an old-new effect at midline-frontal sites and a difference between old clips that were previously associated with the target tone and those that were not. These results are consistent with the attention-dependent learning hypothesis and suggest that associations were formed incidentally at a neural level (silent memory trace or engram), but these associations did not guide attention at a level that influenced behaviour either explicitly or implicitly.

To address this gap, we rely on a neural approach by indexing attention using the P50 ERP component. The P50 measures sensory gating, which is the brain's ability to filter out or inhibit responses to repeated stimuli. We analyze the relationships between neural responses to P50 and performance on two tasks designed to measure creative potential: a convergent task and a divergent task. While we did not find evidence of a relationship between attention and the originality component of divergent thinking, our results show that leaky attention was positively associated with the fluency component of divergent thinking but negatively associated with performance on the convergent thinking task. This result highlights that the relationship between attention and performance on creative tasks may depend on the type of task.

We used a somato-sensory Go/Nogo task and combined ERP recordings with pupil diameter recordings as an index of NE system activity. The Go/Nogo task was designed to achieve processing of tactile stimuli predominantly over primary somatosensory (SI) and secondary somatosensory (SII) areas. The data show that response inhibition was better when stimuli were processed via SII, compared to SI areas. This was reflected by variations in the Nogo-N2/P3 associated with anterior cingulate structures. Correlations with the pupil diameter data, indicting modulations of the NE system during inhibitory control processes, were only evident when SI sensory areas were involved. These dissociable modulatory effects were associated with activations in the superior frontal gyrus. Actions of the NE system during response inhibition are modulated by properties of lower level processing.

Methods: People with chronic low back pain, recurrent low back pain, and no low back pain were compared on the extent to which they attended to somatosensory stimuli on the back during a movement task. To measure hypervigilance, somatosensory event-related potentials (SEPs) to task-irrelevant tactile stimuli on the back were measured when preparing movements in either a threatening or a neutral condition, indicated by a cue signaling possible pain on the back during movement or not. Results: Results showed stronger attending to stimuli on the back in the threat condition than in the neutral condition, as reflected by increased amplitude of the N96 SEP. However, this effect did not differ between groups. Similarly, for all 3 groups the amplitude of the P172 was larger for the threatening condition, suggesting a more general state of arousal resulting in increased somatosensory responsiveness. No significant associations were found between somatosensory attending to the back and theorized antecedents such as pain catastrophizing, pain-related fear, and pain vigilance. Discussion: The current study confirmed that individuals preparing a movement attended more toward somatosensory stimuli at the lower back when anticipating back pain during the movement, as measured by the N96 SEP. However, no differences were found between participants with chronic low back pain or recurrent low back pain, or the pain-free controls.

Neural dynamics of speech and non-speech motor planning	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Speech; Non-speech; Speech motor planning; Speech production; Evoked potentials	LEXICAL ACCESS; SYLLABLE FREQUENCY; CORTEX; TASK; APRAXIA; LATERALIZATION; DYSARTHRIA; TUTORIAL; PROGRAM; LOCUS	As the speech apparatus is also involved in producing non-speech movements, understanding whether speech and non-speech planning are controlled by the same brain mechanisms is central to the comprehension of motor speech planning. A crucial issue is whether a specialized motor planning/control system is dedicated to speech or if the motor planning/control system is shared across oromotor behaviors. We investigated the EEG/ERP spatio-temporal dynamics of the motor planning processes preceding articulation by comparing the production of non-speech gestures matched to monosyllabic words and non-words. To isolate motor from pre-motor planning, we used a delayed production task combined with an articulatory suppression task. Results suggest that the planning processes preceding articulation for non-speech, words and non-words recruit the same neural networks but with different involvement for non-speech and speech. The results support the idea of shared motor planning/control systems for speech and non-speech but with different dynamics for each oromotor behavior.

The response to symmetry in extrastriate areas and its time course are modulated by selective attention	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						Symmetry; Reflection symmetry; Extrastriate areas; ERP; SPN		Neurophysiological studies have shown a strong activation in visual areas in response to symmetry. Electrophysiological (EEG) studies, in particular, have confirmed that amplitude at posterior electrodes is more negative for symmetrical compared to asymmetrical patterns. This response is present even when observers perform tasks that do not require processing of symmetry. In this sense the activation is automatic. In this study we test this automaticity more directly by presenting stimuli that contain both symmetry and asymmetry, as overlapping patterns of dots of different colour (black and white). Observers were asked to respond to symmetry in only one of the two colours. If feature-based attention has no role the response should depend on properties of the image. If attention fully filters only the relevant colour the response should depend on properties of the relevant colour only. Neither of these models fully explained the data. We conclude that selective attention does modulate the neural response to symmetry, however we also found a significant contribution from the irrelevant pattern.

The study was conducted in 2018 in Ningbo University in Zhejiang Province (China) on 235 students aged 20-21. The results showed that in the experimental group, when perceiving music, symmetrical hemisphere interaction parameters dominate (p <= 0.05), in both groups, right-hand parameters dominate in speech perception. The third group showed a difference in the depth of decrease in the amplitude of the alpha rhythm with respect to the resting state (p <= 0.03) in the low-frequency range when listening to a fragment of Slavic folklore. The interaction of the cerebral hemispheres determines a high result in the processing of music. The latter manifested itself when listening to Slavic music: the width of the alpha-1 range is wider when listening in comparison with the state of rest.

While Cystinosis' impact on brain function is relatively mild compared to its effects on other organs, the increased lifespan of this population and thus potential for productive societal contributions have led to increased interest on the effects on brain function. Nevertheless, and despite some evidence of structural brain differences, the neural impact of the mutation is still not well characterized. Here, using a passive duration oddball paradigm (with different stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs), representing different levels of demand on memory) and high-density electrophysiology, we tested basic auditory processing in a group of 22 children and adolescents diagnosed with Cystinosis (age range: 6-17 years old) and in neurotypical age-matched controls (N = 24). We examined whether the N1 and mismatch negativity (MMN) significantly differed between the groups and if those neural measures correlated with verbal and non-verbal IQ. Individuals diagnosed with Cystinosis presented similar N1 responses to their age-matched peers, indicating typical basic auditory processing in this population. However, whereas both groups showed similar MMN responses for the shortest (450 ms) SOA, suggesting intact change detection and sensory memory, individuals diagnosed with Cystinosis presented clearly reduced responses for the longer (900 ms and 1800 ms) SOAs. This could indicate reduced duration auditory sensory memory traces, and thus sensory memory impairment, in children and adolescents diagnosed with Cystinosis. Future work addressing other aspects of sensory and working memory is needed to understand the underlying bases of the differences described here, and their implication for higher order processing.

Many BCI approaches designed for communication rely on attention to visual stimuli, commonly applying an oddball paradigm, and require both eye movements and adequate visual acuity. These abilities may, however, be absent in patients who depend on BCI communication. We have therefore developed a response-based communication BCI, which is independent of gaze shifts but utilizes covert shifts of attention to the left or right visual field. We recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) from 29 channels and coregistered the vertical and horizontal electrooculogram. Data-driven decoding of small attention-based differences between the hemispheres, also known as N2pc, was performed using 14 posterior channels, which are expected to reflect correlates of visual spatial attention. Eighteen healthy participants responded to 120 statements by covertly directing attention to one of two colored symbols (green and red crosses for "yes" and "no," respectively), presented in the user's left and right visual field, respectively, while maintaining central gaze fixation. On average across participants, 88.5% (std: 7.8%) of responses were correctly decoded online. In order to investigate the potential influence of stimulus features on accuracy, we presented the symbols with different visual angles, by altering symbol size and eccentricity. The offline analysis revealed that stimulus features have a minimal impact on the controllability of the BCI. Hence, we show with our novel approach that spatial attention to a colored symbol is a robust method with which to control a BCI, which has the potential to support severely paralyzed people with impaired eye movements and low visual acuity in communicating with their environment.

The development of covert attention occurs during the first year of life. According to Colombo's model of attention (2001), within the first years there is a significant change in infants' visuo-spatial orienting mechanisms, from a predominantly overt form to a covert orienting starting from 4 to 5 months of life. The use of non-invasive brain imaging techniques can shed light on the origin of such mechanisms. In particular, EEG and ERP studies can directly investigate the neural correlates of covert attention in young infants. The present study investigated the neural correlates of covert attention employing a visuo-spatial cueing paradigm in 3-month-old infants. Infants were presented with a central point-light walker (PLD) followed by a single peripheral target. The target appeared randomly at a position either congruent or incongruent with the walking direction of the cue. We examined infants' target-locked P1 component and the saccade latencies toward the peripheral target. Results showed that the P1 component was larger in response to congruent than to incongruent targets and saccade latencies were faster for congruent rather than incongruent trials. Moreover, the facilitation in processing sensory information (priming effects) presented at the cued spatial location occurs even before the onset of the oculomotor response, suggesting that covert attention is present before 4 months of age. Overall, this study highlights how ERPs method could help researchers at investigating the neural basis of attentional mechanisms in infants.

The deficit in auditory sensory or echoic memory may be the cause of the perception of tinnitus. This study considered the mismatch negativity (MMN) to investigate the potential difference between and within groups of persons with normal hearing (NH) and tinnitus. Using an auditory multi-feature paradigm to elicit the MMN, this study considered the MMN peak amplitude at two central frequencies for two MMN subcomponents. These central frequencies were 1 and 5 kHz, which the latter was closer to the perceived tinnitus frequency in the group with tinnitus. The deviants were higher frequency, lower frequency, higher intensity, lower intensity, duration, location (left), location (right), and gap. The pure tone audiometry (PTA) test and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) test showed no meaningful difference between the two groups. For the frontal subcomponent, the mean amplitudes of the MMN peak for the two groups illustrated less negative meaningful MMN peak amplitudes in the group of persons with tinnitus. For the supratemporal component at 5 kHz central frequency, amplitudes were lower for the group of persons with tinnitus, whereas for the central frequency of 1 kHz, most deviants exhibited meaningful differences. Additionally, within-group comparisons indicated that mean amplitudes for both groups were more negative at the central frequency of 1 kHz for the frontal MMN subcomponent. In comparison, the supratemporal component illustrated a lower peak amplitude at 5 kHz central frequency in the group of persons with tinnitus and no difference in the NH group, which is a unique observation of this study. Results of the between-groups are in accordance with previous studies and within-group comparisons consider the probability of decreasing the change detection capability of the brain. The results of this study indicate that increasing the frequency of the stimuli close to the tinnitus perceived frequencies decreases the prediction error, including the prediction error of the silence. Such a decrease may cause the prediction error of the spontaneous neural activity in the auditory pathway to exceed the silence prediction error, and as a result, increases the probability of occurrence of tinnitus in higher frequencies according to the predictive coding model.

Effects of 12-week avocado consumption on cognitive function among adults with overweight and obesity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Carotenoids; Event-related potential; N2; P3; Attention; Xanthophyll; Obesity	LUTEIN SUPPLEMENTATION; ASSOCIATION; ZEAXANTHIN; METAANALYSIS; ABSORPTION; TRIAL	Objectives: Excess adiposity increases risk for cognitive impairment. Consumption of avocado, a highly bioavailable source of the xanthophyll lutein, has been shown to improve retinal lutein accumulation and cognitive function. Thus, we evaluated the influence of avocado consumption on cognitive function and lutein status among adults with overweight and obesity using a randomized-controlled trial with matching design for pertinent study outcomes. Methods: A cohort of 84 adults (25-45 years, 31 males) were randomized to a treatment group (N = 47) that received a 12-week daily meal with fresh Hass avocado or a control group (N = 37) that received an isocaloric meal (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02740439). Serum lutein and macular pigment optical density (MPOD) were used to assess xanthophyll status. Attention and inhibition were assessed using the Flanker, Oddball and Nogo tasks with accompanying electroencephalographic (EEG) recording. Results: Participants in the treatment group exhibited improvements in serum lutein and accuracy in the Flanker task. However, there were no relationships between performance and changes in lutein status, nor neuroelectric variables. No significant changes in MPOD were observed. Conclusion: Daily avocado intake over 12 weeks, after controlling for covariates, improved attentional inhibition and increased serum lutein concentrations among adults with overweight and obesity. However, the cognitive benefits were independent of changes in lutein concentrations. Additional work is necessary to determine non-carotenoid, or carotenoid interactive, mechanisms by which avocados may influence cognitive function.

Improving the performance of P300 BCI system using different methods	NETWORK MODELING AND ANALYSIS IN HEALTH INFORMATICS AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Brain Computer Interface (BCI); P300 signal; Machine learning algorithms (MLA); Linear discriminant analysis (LDA); Support vector machine (SVM); Linear regression (LREG); Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA)	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; SINGLE TRIAL EEG; MENTAL PROSTHESIS; FEATURES	A brain-computer interface (BCI) can be used for people with severe physical disabilities such as ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. BCI can allow these individuals to communicate again by creating a new communication channel directly from the brain to an output device. BCI technology can allow paralyzed people to share their intent with others, and thereby demonstrate that direct communication from the brain to the external world is possible, and that it might serve useful functions. In this paper, we propose a system to exploit the P300 signal in the brain, a positive deflection in event-related potentials. The P300 signal can be incorporated into a spelling device. BCI systems include machine learning algorithms (MLA). Their performance depends on the feature extraction and classification techniques employed. This work discusses the performance of different machine learning algorithms. First, a preprocessing step is introduced to the subjects to extract the important features before applying the machine learning algorithms. The presented algorithms are linear discriminant analysis (LDA I and LDA II), support vector machine (SVM I, SVM II, SVM III, and SVM IV), linear regression (LREG), and Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA). It is found that BLDA and SVMIV classifiers yield the highest performance for both subjects considered in our study.

To investigate the amount of listening effort required in reverberating and noisy backgrounds, a semantic mismatch was examined. Subjects and Methods: Electroencephalography was performed in 18 voluntary healthy participants using a 64-channel system to obtain N400 latencies. They were asked to listen to sounds and see letters in 2 reverberatedx2 noisy paradigms (i.e., Q-0 ms, Q-2000 ms, 3 dB-0 ms, and 3 dB-2000 ms). With auditory-visual pairings, the participants were required to answer whether the auditory primes and letter targets did or did not match. Results: Q-0 ms revealed the shortest N400 latency, whereas the latency was significantly increased at 3 dB-2000 ms. Further, Q-2000 ms showed approximately a 47 ms delayed latency compared to 3 dB-0 ms. Interestingly, the presence of reverberation significantly increased N400 latencies. Under the distracting conditions, both noise and reverberation involved stronger frontal activation. Conclusions: The current distracting listening conditions could interrupt the semantic mismatch processing in the brain. The presence of reverberation, specifically a 2000 ms delay, necessitates additional mental effort, as evidenced in the delayed N400 latency and the involvement of the frontal sources in this study.

Network-level mechanisms underlying effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on visuomotor learning	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						tDCS; Connectivity; ERP; fMRI; Motor; Vision; SRTT; Neuromodulation	HIPPOCAMPAL BRAIN NETWORK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; PRIMARY MOTOR; PREMOTOR CORTEX; FINE MOTOR; SYNCHRONIZATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; OSCILLATIONS; COHERENCE; DYNAMICS	Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation approach in which low level currents are administered over the scalp to influence underlying brain function. Prevailing theories of tDCS focus on modulation of excitation-inhibition balance at the local stimulation location. However, network level effects are reported as well, and appear to depend upon differential underlying mechanisms. Here, we evaluated potential network-level effects of tDCS during the Serial Reaction Time Task (SRTT) using convergent EEG- and fMRI-based connectivity approaches. Motor learning manifested as a significant (p<.0001) shift from slow to fast responses and corresponded to a significant increase in beta-coherence (p<.0001) and fMRI connectivity (p<.01) particularly within the visual-motor pathway. Differential patterns of tDCS effect were observed within different parametric task versions, consistent with network models. Overall, these findings demonstrate objective physiological effects of tDCS at the network level that result in effective behavioral modulation when tDCS parameters are matched to network-level requirements of the underlying task.

Attentional Control and Executive Function	COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Attention; connectivity; EEG; ERP; fMRI; reward; working memory		The processes of attentional control and executive function are critical for navigating and operating efficiently in everyday life, and deficits in these core processes have serious consequences. Despite a long history of research into these topics, much is still unknown about the brain mechanisms supporting these processes. This special issue of Cognitive Neuroscience: Current Debates, Research & Reports presents nine new empirical papers investigating the dynamic neural mechanisms of attentional selection, working memory, and executive control. The papers in this special issue utilize electrophysiological and neuroimaging methods, along with advanced analysis techniques, to identify the neural substrates and dynamic mechanisms underlying the orienting and shifting of attention, as well as the representation and maintenance of information in working memory. These articles inform theories of attentional selection by providing a deeper understanding of social influences on the allocation of attention as well as illuminating the role of selection history in biasing neural activity and behavior. Finally, the research presented here has broader impacts on the field of cognitive neuroscience, as results from studies investigating the coupling between bands of oscillatory neural activity provide exciting new insights into the coordination between widespread brain networks.

By using three-dimensional cooperative filtering and differential calculation, the different and complex background clutter is suppressed. To obtain the optimal parameters for the background suppression algorithm, an adaptive parameter optimization method is proposed. The adaptive parameter optimization problem is transformed into a multiobjective optimization problem in which the signal-to-clutter ratio gain and background suppression factor, which effectively reflect the background suppression performance, are chosen as the optimization objectives, and the parameters of the proposed background suppression algorithm are considered as the variables. To effectively solve the established multiobjective optimization problem, a particle swarm parameter optimization-based method is utilized. Experimental results indicate that the proposed adaptive background suppression method using these optimal parameters has good performance for IR images in real complex scenes, as well as performance superior to that of other baseline methods.

During speech perception, formal and temporal predictions may be made for phonotactic probability and syllable stress patterns, respectively, contributing to the efficient processing of speech input. The current experiment employed a passive EEG oddball paradigm to probe the neurophysiological processes underlying temporal and formal predictions simultaneously. The component of interest, the mismatch negativity (MMN), is considered a marker for experience-dependent change detection, where its timing and amplitude are indicative of the perceptual system's sensitivity to presented stimuli. We hypothesized that more predictable stimuli (i.e. high phonotactic probability and first syllable stress) would facilitate change detection, indexed by shorter peak latencies or greater peak amplitudes of the MMN. This hypothesis was confirmed for phonotactic probability: high phonotactic probability deviants elicited an earlier MMN than low phonotactic probability deviants. We do not observe a significant modulation of the MMN to variations in syllable stress. Our findings confirm that speech perception is shaped by formal and temporal predictability. This paradigm may be useful to investigate the contribution of implicit processing of statistical regularities during (a)typical language development.

Here, we examine the effects of verbal instructions ('beware of this person') on the perception of unknown persons. Focusing on visual attention, face identity and facial expression information is examined during instructed threat-of-shock or safety. However, shocks never occurred. Participants quickly acquired instructed threat associations, and electrocortical processing differentiated threat- from safe-identities as well as emotional and neutral facial expressions. Importantly, face encoding varied as a joint function of identity and facial expression, as revealed by pronounced N170 amplitudes to smiling threat-identities. Moreover, instructions readily reversed previously learned affective associations leading to attention allocation and memory updating as reflected by N170, EPN and P3 amplitudes toward new threat-identities displaying angry expressions. These findings demonstrate that person perception flexibly re-adjusts according to minimal information.

Brain-Computer Interface System Based on P300 Processing with Convolutional Neural Network, Novel Speller, and Low Number of Electrodes	COGNITIVE COMPUTATION			English	Article						P300 wave; Event-related potential; Brain-computer interface; EEG signal processing; Convolutional neural networks	BCI; PEOPLE; ICA	The P300 wave has been successfully employed to develop brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for speller applications. However, methods to analyze the P300 require computers with high processing capability because they are computationally complex and require many electrodes. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel BCI speller system based on the P300 wave that employs a few electrodes and a processing method aimed to design ubiquitous and embedded applications. The experiments were developed with a dataset generated by our BCI data acquisition system. The BCI speller developed requires five electrodes for data acquisition, and the visual interface is an improved Donchin speller. Our BCI includes a novel processing method composed of the following modules: preprocessing, signal averaging, low computational cost convolutional neural network, and character prediction. The network has two feature extraction sections, a fully connected layer and a SoftMax layer. According to the results, the proposed BCI speller has an accuracy of 96% using just five electrodes, and it is similar to the best BCI for P300 analysis described in the literature. The processing time makes the system practical for online applications since the processing method has a low computational burden and the acquisition system has the lowest number of electrodes for P300 analysis reported in the literature. Considering the low computational burden, the low number of electrodes required, and the accuracy achieved, we conclude that our proposed BCI speller may be considered as one of the best spellers based on P300.

Impairments in Probabilistic Prediction and Bayesian Learning Can Explain Reduced Neural Semantic Priming in Schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN			English	Article						language; N400; precision; statistical learning	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LEXICAL DECISION TASK; SPREADING ACTIVATION; WORD PRONUNCIATION; TELL US; N400; THOUGHT; LANGUAGE; FACILITATION; RECOGNITION	It has been proposed that abnormalities in probabilistic prediction and dynamic belief updating explain the multiple features of schizophrenia. Here, we used electroen-cephalography (EEG) to ask whether these abnormalities can account for the well-established reduction in semantic priming observed in schizophrenia under nonautomatic conditions. We isolated predictive contributions to the neural semantic priming effect by manipulating the prime's predictive validity and minimizing retroactive semantic matching mechanisms. We additionally examined the link between prediction and learning using a Bayesian model that probed dynamic belief updating as participants adapted to the increase in predictive validity. We found that patients were less likely than healthy controls to use the prime to predictively facilitate semantic processing on the target, resulting in a reduced N400 effect. Moreover, the trial-by-trial output of our Bayesian computational model explained between-group differences in trial-by-trial N400 amplitudes as participants transitioned from conditions of lower to higher predictive validity. These findings suggest that, compared with healthy controls, people with schizophrenia are less able to mobilize predictive mechanisms to facilitate processing at the earliest stages of accessing the meanings of incoming words. This deficit may be linked to a failure to adapt to changes in the broader environment. This reciprocal relationship between impairments in probabilistic prediction and Bayesian learning/adaptation may drive a vicious cycle that maintains cognitive disturbances in schizophrenia.

To deal with the limited capacity, attention allows us to enhance relevant information and suppress irrelevant information. Particularly, the suppression of salient irrelevant stimuli has shown to be important as it prevents attention to be captured and thus attentional resources to be wasted. This study aimed at directly connecting failures to suppress distraction with a neural marker of suppression, the distractor positivity (Pd). We measured participants' EEG signal while they performed a visual search task in which they had to report a digit inside a shape target while ignoring distractors, one of which could be a salient color singleton. Reports of target digits served as a behavioral index of enhancement, and reports of color distractor digits served as a behavioral index of failed suppression, each measured against reports of neutral distractor digits serving as a baseline. Participants reported the target identity more often than any distractor identity. The singleton identity was reported least often, suggesting suppression of the singleton below baseline. Suppression of salient stimuli was absent in the beginning and then increased throughout the experiment. When the singleton identity was reported, the Pd was observed in a later time window, suggesting that behavioral errors were preceded by failed suppression. Our results provide evidence for the signal suppression hypothesis that states salient items have to be actively suppressed to avoid attentional capture. Our results also provide direct evidence that the Pd is reflecting such active suppression.

Effects of MEG-based neurofeedback for hand rehabilitation after tetraplegia: preliminary findings in cortical modulations and grip strength	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						spinal cord injury; magnetoencephalography; grasp; neurofeedback; sensorimotor; motor cortex; neurorehabilitation	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; FUNCTIONAL ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; MOTOR SYSTEM FUNCTION; CHRONIC STROKE; RECOVERY; EEG; IMAGERY; PLASTICITY; RHYTHMS	Objective. Neurofeedback (NF) trains people to volitionally modulate their cortical activity to affect a behavioral outcome. We evaluated the feasibility of using NF to improve hand function after chronic cervical-level spinal cord injury (SCI) using biologically-relevant visual feedback of motor-related brain activity and an intuitive control scheme. Approach. The NF system acquired magnetoencephalography (MEG) data in real-time to provide feedback of event-related desynchronization (ERD) measured over the sensorimotor cortex during attempted hand grasping. During brain control, stronger ERD resulting from attempted grasping drove the virtual hand towards a more closed grasp, while less ERD drove the hand more open. Main results. Eight individuals with partial or complete hand impairment due to chronic SCI controlled the NF to perform a grasping task that increased in difficulty as the participants achieved success. During their first NF session, participants achieved an average success rate of 63.7 +/- 6.4% (chance level of 13.9%). After as few as one intervention session, four of the seven individuals evaluated for ERD changes had significantly strengthened ERD and three of the four participants with measurable grip strength prior to NF had increased grip strength. Interestingly, both individuals who participated in a longer-term study (i.e. >8 NF sessions) had improved grip strength and significantly strengthened ERD. Significance. This study demonstrates that MEG-based NF training can change brain activity in individuals with hand impairment due to SCI and has the potential to induce acute changes in grip strength. Future studies will evaluate whether neuroplasticity induced with long term NF can improve hand function for those with moderate impairment.

Differential effects of mind-wandering and visual distraction on age-related changes in neuro-electric brain activity and variability	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Mind-wandering; Task-unrelated thoughts; Visual distraction; Aging; EEG	MONTREAL COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT; OLDER-ADULTS; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; SIGNAL VARIABILITY; EXECUTIVE CONTROL; BOLD SIGNAL; TASK; MEMORY; YOUNG; THOUGHTS	Optimal performance in many tasks requires minimizing the impact of both visual distractors in the environment and distracting internal thoughts (i.e., mind-wandering). Prior research has indicated that older adults are disproportionately affected by the presence of visual distractors compared to young adults, but are not excessively affected by distracting thoughts. Yet an explanation for these dissociable effects remains elusive. In the current study, we assessed age-related differences in event-related potentials and neural variability associated with internal distraction and visual distractors in a go/no-go task. Compared to young adults, older adults showed an increased visual distraction cost in mean reaction time (RT) and RT variability but a reduction in internal distraction frequency and a reduced internal distraction cost on go accuracy and RT variability. Visual distraction and internal distraction were associated with opposite patterns of behavioral and neural effects. Behaviorally, across age groups, internal distraction was associated with more no-go errors whereas visual distraction was associated with reduced no-go errors. Across groups, internal distraction was associated with decreased P3 amplitude, whereas visual distraction was associated with increased P3 amplitude. In addition, internal distraction was associated with an increase in neural variability (more so in young versus older adults), while visual distraction was associated with a reduction in variability in young adults only. We suggest that the opposing effects of the two distractor types on behavioral and neural measures occur because visual distraction is associated with increased attentional resources devoted to the task to overcome visual interference whereas internal distraction is associated with decreased attentional resources devoted to the task. Moreover, older adults exhibited reduced flexibility of neural variability as a function of both distractor types, which may correspond to a diminished ability to up-regulate attention in the face of visual distraction and a diminished shift in attention away from the task during internal distraction.

However, there is a large variability among patients with first episode psychosis (FEP). Also, most studies report a single electrode site and on comparing case-control group differences. Few have taken advantage of the full wealth of multi-channel EEG signals to examine observable patterns. None, to our knowledge, have used machine learning (ML) approaches to investigate neurophysiological derived subgroups with distinct cognitive and functional outcome characteristics. In this study, we applied ML to empirically stratify individuals into homogeneous subgroups based on multi-channel MMN data. We then characterized the functional, cognitive, and clinical profiles of these neurobiologically derived subgroups. We also explored the underlying low frequency range responses (delta, theta, alpha) during MMN. Methods Clinical, neurocognitive, functioning data of 33 healthy controls and 20 FEP patients were collected. 90% of the patients had 6-month follow-up data. Neurocognition, social cognition, and functioning measures were assessed using the NCCB Cognitive Battery, the Awareness of Social Inference Test, UCSD Performance-Based Skills Assessment, and Multnomah Community Ability Scale. Symptom severity was collected using the PANSS. MMN amplitude and single-trial derived low frequency activity across 24 frontocentral channels were used as main variables in the ML k-means clustering analyses. Results We found a consistent pattern of two distinctive subgroups. We labeled them as "better functioning" and "poorer functioning" clusters, respectively. Each subgroup can be mapped onto either better or poorer clinical, cognitive, and functioning profiles. Also, we identified two subgroups of patients: one showed improved MMN and one showed worsening of MMN over time. Patients with improved MMN had better follow-up clinical, cognitive, and functioning profile than those with worsening MMN. Among the low frequency bands, delta frequency appeared to be the most relevant to the observed MMN responses in all individuals. However, higher delta responses were not necessarily associated with a better functioning profile, suggesting that delta frequency alone may not be useful in clinical characterization. Conclusions The ML approach could be a robust tool to explore heterogeneity and facilitate the identification of neurobiological homogeneous subgroups in FEP.

Previous studies consistently showed that a lack of meaning in work would reduce one's autonomous motivation in the current job, which is the motivation to engage in self-determined activities driven by one's own interests or personal beliefs. However, researchers overlooked the fact that in work settings, it is not uncommon that people work on multiple tasks in a row. As a result, the cross-task effect of work meaningfulness remains understudied. Based on the meaning maintenance model (MMM) and the suggested fluid compensation strategy, we predicted that the disappearance of the meaning of work may induce a compensatory response and thus enhance one's autonomous motivation in an irrelevant ensuing activity. To test this hypothesis, we invited participants to work on an encyclopedic knowledge quiz in Session 1 and a StopWatch (SW) task in Session 2. A between-subject design was adopted. While participants in the control group successfully completed their tasks in Session 1, those in the experimental group encountered unexpected program quits by the end of the quiz, and their previous efforts suddenly became futile and meaningless. Electroencephalography was recorded during the experiment to measure reward positivity (RewP). In Session 2, a more pronounced RewP in the win-lose difference wave was observed in the experimental group in contrast to the control group, suggesting that the disappearance of the meaning of work enhanced one's autonomous motivation in an irrelevant activity that follows. Therefore, results of this study provided preliminary electrophysiological evidence for one's pursuit of meaning and the compensation effect induced by the disappearance of the meaning of work.

J	Oralhan, Z				Oralhan, Zeki			3D Input Convolutional Neural Networks for P300 Signal Detection	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Brain computer interface; deep Learning; human machine systems; P300 detection	BRAIN; CLASSIFICATION; SPELLER	P300 signal is an endogenous event related potential component. It is mostly elicited from the frontal to parietal brain lobes. Electroencephalography is used for acquiring P300 signal from scalp. P300 signal is used for brain-computer interface systems. P300 based brain-computer interface systems are preferable since they have high overall performance. The most significant overall performance indicator is information transfer rate for P300 based brain-computer interface systems. P300 signal detection accuracy and P300 detection time are using for information transfer rate calculation. Hence, P300 signal classification accuracy is important for getting higher information transfer rate. In this study, it is aimed to investigate P300 detection model for higher classification accuracy. Thus, it is proposed 3-dimensional input convolutional neural network model for P300 detection. Moreover, the proposed model was applied with region based P300 speller which constituted audio and visual stimuli. In experiments, the participants were asked to spell desired words in two sessions which were offline and online session. Linear support vector machine, stepwise linear discriminant analysis, 2-dimensional input convolutional neural network, and the proposed method were compared in both online and offline sessions. It is reached highest average classification accuracy rate with the proposed method in both sessions. According to the online session result, average classification accuracy was 94.22% in 3-dimensional input convolutional neural network model. Furthermore, average information transfer rate was 5.53 bit/min in 3-dimensional input convolutional neural network model. We have also applied methods on BCI competition III-dataset II for 2 participants "A" and "B" for evaluating performance of algorithms. The proposed method had higher classification accuracy rate than linear support vector machine, stepwise linear discriminant analysis, 2-dimensional input convolutional neural network, and multi-classifier convolutional neural network which was used in other study on same dataset.

Furthermore, evidence from category learning has shown that dissociable memory systems are engaged, depending on the structure of a task. This can even hold true for tasks that are very similar to each other, which complicates the process of classifying brain activity as relating to changes that are associated with learning or reflecting the engagement of a memory system suited for the task. The primary goals of these studies were to characterize the mechanisms that are associated with category learning and understand the extent to which different memory systems are recruited within a single task. Two studies providing spatial and temporal distinctions between learning-related changes in the brain and category-dependent memory systems are presented. The results from these experiments support the notion that exemplar memorization, rule-based, and perceptual similarity-based categorization are flexibly recruited in order to optimize performance during a single task. We conclude that these three methods, along with the memory systems they rely on, aid in the development of expertise, but their engagement might depend on the level of familiarity with a category.

Studies on social cognition and gossip have also revealed the activation of similar areas from the reward network. In this study we wanted to assess the electrophysiological correlates of the anticipation and processing of novel information (as an intrinsic cognitive reward) depending on the degree of elicited curiosity and the content of the information. 24 healthy volunteers participated in this EEG experiment. The task consisted of 150 questions and answers divided into three different conditions: trivia-like questions, personal-gossip information about celebrities and personal-neutral information about the same celebrities. Our main results from the ERPs and time-frequency analysis pinpointed main differences for gossip in comparison with personal-neutral and trivia-like conditions. Specifically, we found an increase in beta oscillatory activity in the outcome phase and a decrease of the same frequency band in the expectation phase. Larger amplitudes in P300 component were also found for gossip condition. Finally, gossip answers were the most remembered in a one-week memory test. The arousing value and saliency of gossip information, its rewarding effect evidenced by the increase of beta oscillatory power and the recruitment of areas from the brain reward network in previous fMRI studies, as well as its potential social value have been argued in order to explain its differential processing, encoding and recall.

We also computed sensory-level activity using EEG data and investigated theta and alpha neural oscillations, phase-locking values (PLV), and brain networks. Based on the scores from the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) and Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS), an ADHD-trait group (n= 40) and a normal control group (n= 41) were selected. Participants were required to respond to whether the presented stimulus was at the same location as that presented two trials earlier. The ADHD-trait group showed significantly slower response times than the control group in the spatial 2-back task. In terms of spectrum, the ADHD-trait group showed significantly reduced theta power than the control group. In contrast, the ADHD-trait group exhibited an increased alpha power compared to the control group with the 250-1000 ms interval after stimulus onset. In terms of the PLV, the ADHD-trait group showed significantly weaker theta phase synchrony and fewer connection numbers in frontal-occipital areas than the control group. In terms of the theta brain network, the ADHD-trait group showed a significantly lower clustering coefficient and longer characteristic path length than the control group for the theta band. The present results indicate that college students with ADHD traits have deficits in spatial working memory and that these abnormal activities in neural oscillation, functional connectivity, and the network may contribute to spatial working memory deficits.

Both seem to be modulated by catecholamines, especially dopamine. On the basis of cognitive theoretical and neurobiological considerations, we investigated the effects of dopamine D1 and D2 signaling with the help of unweighted polygenic scores in n = 207 healthy young human subjects. We used a task that combines subliminal primes with conscious flankers to induce conflicts. Dopamine D1 scores were formed based on DRD1 rs4532, CALY rs2298122 and TH rs10770141 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), while dopamine D2 scores were formed based on DRD2 rs6277 and NPY2R rs2234759 SNPs. We used EEG recordings and source localization analyses to identify differentially modulated neurophysiological sub-processes and functional neuroanatomical structures. Increased dopamine D1 signaling was associated with decreases in consciously induced conflicts. This decrease was due to enhanced stimulus-response mapping in the premotor cortex (BA6), as reflected by an increased P3 amplitude in incongruent trials. Attentional processes remained unaffected by dopamine D1 signaling. The effect of dopamine D2 signaling on conscious conflicts did not reach significance. Subliminally induced conflicts were neither modulated by dopamine D1, nor by dopamine D2 signaling. Our findings suggest that dopamine D1 signaling benefits consciously induced conflicts, presumably by improving the suppression of distracting information via gain control-initiated increases in top-down control processes associated with pre-motor regions. Dopamine D2 signaling does not seem to mediate behavioral differences. Probably, this is because the D2 state facilitates switching between (conflicting) top-down-selected mental representations, but not necessarily between top-down processes and bottom-up distractor information.

However, the idea that conflict resolution facilitates positive stimuli processing has not reached a consistent conclusion. We suggested that conflict resolution was integrated with positive emotions. The present study used ERPs, took the flanker task as primes, set different durations (i.e., 600 ms and 1200 ms) between the resolution of conflicts and the presentation of targets, and chose affective words as targets to investigate the affective effect of cognitive conflict during the resolution stage. Participants' task was to react to the flanker task and then evaluate the valence of the target words. The findings of experiment1 (600 ms) and experiment2 (1200 ms) were consistent. Behavioral results showed that the conflict effect was significant, and the positive signal effect of conflict resolution was found. In ERPs results, the enhanced N2 amplitudes for incongruent primes showed a significant conflict effect. The enhanced conflict SP amplitudes for incongruent primes reflected conflict resolution. As expected, the enhanced N400 amplitudes for positive targets after incongruent primes indicated that conflict resolution facilitated positive stimuli processing. Time-frequency analyses showed that incongruent primes elicited larger theta (4-8 Hz) power than congruent primes over the frontal areas. More importantly, we found that theta (4-8 Hz) power for positive targets after incongruent primes was lower than those after congruent primes over the central areas. These findings suggested that conflict resolution facilitated positive stimulus processing, and this positive effect was a carry-over effect, which indicated that conflict resolution was integrated with positive emotions.

The present EEG study examined how much action video gamers differ from non-gamers in the usage of visual exploration and attention driven perceptual analyses during a categorization learning task. Seventeen healthy right-handed non-gamers and 16 healthy right-handed action video gamers performed a visual categorization task with 14 ring stimuli, which were divided into two categories. All stimuli had the same structure but differed with respect to their color combinations and were forming two categories including a prototype, five typical stimuli and one exception. The exception shared most similarities with the prototype of the opposite group. Prototypes and typical stimuli were correctly categorized at an early stage of the experiment, whereas the successful categorization of exceptions occurred later. The behavioral data yield evidence that action video gamers perform correct categorizations of exceptions earlier than non-gamers. Additionally, groups differed with respect to differential expressions of the attention related P150 ERP component (early perceptual analysis) and the N170 ERP component, which reflected differential processing demands for the stimulus material. In comparison to non-gamers, the analyses of the eye movements yield for action video gamers different, more central fixations possibly indicating covert peripheral processing. For both groups fixations as well as saccades decrease and in the case of exceptions, one of the two segments that are decisive for correct categorization shows higher fixation rates at the end of the experiment. These findings indicate for both groups a learning process regarding the stimulus material. Regarding the group differences, we interpret the results to indicate that action video gamers show a different stimulus exploration, use an enhanced early perceptual analysis of the stimulus material and therefore may detect changes in objects faster and learned the belonging of the stimuli to their categories in an earlier trial phase.

Prediction of social behavior in autism spectrum disorders: Explicit versus implicit social cognition	AUTISM			English	Article						autism spectrum disorder; electroencephalography; event-related potential; partial least squares regression; social cognition; social perception	HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; ASPERGER-SYNDROME; CHILDREN; SKILLS; MIND; INTERVENTION; ADOLESCENTS; YOUTH; RECOGNITION; IMPAIRMENTS	Deficient social communication and interaction behaviors are a hallmark feature of individuals with autism spectrum disorder. These social communication and interaction deficits potentially stem from problems with explicit social cognition (i.e. processes that are controlled and largely conscious) as well as with implicit social cognition (i.e. processes that are fast, spontaneous, and primarily unconscious). This study aimed to investigate the relative contributions of implicit and explicit social cognition factors as predictors of multi-informant measures of social communication and interaction behaviors in a sample of 34 youth with clinical diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder. Behavioral, cognitive, and electrophysiological indices of implicit and explicit social cognition were entered into partial least squares regression models designed to identify latent factors that optimally predict parent-report, observer-coded, and clinician-rated social communication, and interaction outcomes. Results indicated that while both implicit and explicit social cognition factors optimally predicted outcomes, implicit social cognition factors were relatively more predictive. Findings have important implications for the conceptualization and measurement of social functioning as well as the development of targeted social interventions in autism spectrum disorder populations. Lay abstract Difficulties with social communication and interaction are a hallmark feature of autism spectrum disorder. These difficulties may be the result of problems with explicit social cognition (effortful and largely conscious processes) such as learning and recalling social norms or rules. Alternatively, social deficits may stem from problems with implicit social cognition (rapid and largely unconscious processes) such as the efficient integration of social information. The goal of this study was to determine how problems in explicit and implicit social cognition relate to social behavior in 34 youth with autism spectrum disorder. We measured aspects of implicit and explicit social cognition abilities in the laboratory using behavioral, cognitive, and brain (electrophysiological) measures. We then used those measures to predict "real-world" social behavior as reported by parents, clinicians, and independent observers. Results showed that overall better aspects of implicit and explicit social cognition predicted more competent social behavior. In addition, the ability to fluidly integrate social information (implicit social cognition) was more frequently related to competent social behavior that merely knowing what to do in social situations (explicit social cognition). These findings may help with the development of interventions focusing on improving social deficits.

Acute stress influences our attention to threat. However, we do not know whether acute stress can enhance facilitating attention engagement or impair attention disengagement toward threat. Therefore, the present study investigated whether attention engagement to threat is enhanced or attention disengagement to threat is weakened when people are stressed. Thirty-six healthy male adults were randomly assigned to a stress group (n = 18) and a control group (n = 18). The stress group underwent socially evaluated cold pressor test (SECPT), whereas the control group underwent a warm water control protocol. The dot-probe task was used to measure the attention bias toward threat. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were used in conjunction with reaction time measures to investigate the time course of attention to threat in the dot-probe task. The N2-posteior-contralateral (N2pc) component measured the initial shift of visual attention to the threatening stimulus, whereas the sustained posterior contralateral negativity (SPCN) component measured the maintenance of visual attention to the threatening stimulus. Reaction time, accuracy rate, and the electroencephalography data of the participants were recorded during the dot-probe task. The state anxiety questionnaire and saliva were acquired at five time points, such as 85 and 70 minutes before the SECPT, immediately before and after the dot-probe task, and 70 minutes after the SECPT. The SECPT successfully induced stress response. Participants in the stress group showed stronger state anxiety and Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis response indicated by increased salivary cortisol concentration after the SECPT than the control group. In addition, no significant differences were found before the SECPT. At the behavioral level, the attention disengagement in the stress group was slower than in the control group. Regarding ERPs, we found a greater amplitude of SPCN (300 similar to 600 ms after cue) in the stress group than in the control group. However, no significant effect was found on the amplitude of N2pc between stress group and control group.

Numerous cellular studies in animals and brain slices have demonstrated that long-term potentiation (LTP) enhances synaptic transmission, which can be evoked by high-frequency intermittent stimulation. In humans, plasticity processes underlying perceptual learning can be reliably induced by repetitive, LTP-like sensory stimulation. These protocols lead to improvement of perceptual abilities parallel to widespread remodeling of cortical processing. However, whether maintained rhythmic cortical activation induced by the LTP-like stimulation is also present during human perceptual learning experiments, remains elusive. To address this question, we here applied a 20 Hz intermittent stimulation protocol for 40 min to the index-, middle- and ring-fingers of the right hand, while continuously recording EEG over the hand representation in primary somatosensory cortex in young adult participants. We find that each train of stimulation initiates a transient series of sensory-evoked potentials which accumulate after about 500 ms into a 20 Hz steady-state response persisting over the entire period of the 2-s-train. During the inter-train interval, no consistent evoked activity can be detected. This response behavior is maintained over the whole 40 min of stimulation without any indication of habituation. However, the early stimulation evoked potentials (SEPs) and the event-related desynchronization (ERD) during the steady-state response change over the 40 min of stimulation. In a second experiment, we demonstrate in a separate cohort of participants that the here-applied pneumatic type of stimulation results in improvement of tactile acuity as typically observed for electrically applied 20 Hz intermittent stimulation. Our data demonstrate that repetitive stimulation using a 20 Hz protocol drives rhythmic activation in the hand representation of somatosensory cortex, which is sustained during the entire stimulation period. At the same time, cortical excitability increases as indicated by altered ERD and SEP amplitudes. Our results, together with previous data underlining the dependence of repetitive sensory stimulation effects on NMDA-receptor activation, support the view that repetitive sensory stimulation elicits LTP-like processes in the cortex, thereby facilitating perceptual learning processes.

Over the past 10 years, this distinction has proven its diagnostic value as well as its important prognostic value on consciousness recovery. However, clinicians are currently limited by three factors: (i) the current behavioural repertoire of minimally conscious state items is limited and restricted to a few cognitive domains in the goldstandard revised version of the Coma Recovery Scale; (ii) a proportion of similar to 15-20% clinically VS/UWS patients are actually in a richer state than VS/UWS as evidenced by functional brain imaging; and (iii) the neurophysiological and cognitive interpretation of each minimally conscious state item is still unclear and debated. In the current study we demonstrate that habituation of the auditory startle reflex (hASR) tested at bedside constitutes a novel, simple and powerful behavioural sign that can accurately distinguish minimally conscious state from VS/UWS. In addition to enlarging the minimally conscious state items repertoire, and therefore decreasing the low sensitivity of current behavioural measures, we also provide an original and rigorous description of the neurophysiological basis of hASR through a combination of functional (high density EEG and F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging) and structural (diffusion tensor imaging MRI) measures. We show that preservation of hASR is associated with the functional and structural integrity of a brain-scale fronto-parietal network, including prefrontal regions related to control of action and inhibition, and meso-parietal areas associated with minimally conscious and conscious states. Lastly, we show that hASR predicts 6-month improvement of consciousness. Taken together, our results show that hASR is a cortically-mediated behaviour, and suggest that it could be a new clinical item to clearly and accurately identify non-communicating patients who are in the minimally conscious state.

The present study pursues this approach by examining the neurophysiological changes associated with disengagement of attention in young adults performing an inhibition of return (IOR) paradigm while EEG was recorded. Participants were drawn from a diverse community and varied widely in their bilingual experience. There were three main findings. First, dividing the sample into dichotomous groups based on language proficiency did not lead to reliable group differences on the task. Second, using instead continuous measures of bilingualism across the sample indicated that greater bilingual experience and proficiency were associated with the magnitude of the IOR effect, with more bilingual individuals showing larger and earlier IOR effects. Finally, a network of processes that are temporally and spatially distinct were found to work together to produce facilitation, disengagement of attention, and inhibition of return. These findings contribute to debates regarding the electrophysiological correlates of the IOR effect and provide additional evidence for how bilingualism affects domain general cognition.

In the present study, images featuring reptiles and firearms were employed as target and flanking stimuli in a modified version of the affective Flanker task. Forty-two participants (21 male) completed the modified Flanker task as EEG was recorded. Congruency effects in reaction times were more consistently observed for arrays with firearm targets than for arrays with reptile targets. Arrays with neutral targets (i.e., water pistols, turtles) evoked more negative mean N2 (250-400 ms) amplitudes than those with attack targets (i.e., attacking snakes, aimed handguns), while arrays with aimed handgun targets elicited more positive mean activity for the late positive component (LPC; 450-650 ms) compared to arrays with water pistol or reptile targets. Congruency effects were also found in N2 activity for arrays with firearm targets and reptile Flankers. In addition, LPC amplitude for incongruent arrays with attack targets and neutral Flankers was reduced compared to congruent attack arrays. These findings suggest that biological relevance influences interference processing (the N2) and intersects with attack intent during the later stages of picture processing (the LPC).

However, not only does it require hundreds of milliseconds of processing, but our eyes also typically fixate the object for hundreds of milliseconds. Conse-quently, information reaching our eyes at different moments is processed in the brain together. Moreover, in-formation received at different moments during fixation is likely to be processed differently, notably because different features might be selectively attended at different moments. Here, we introduce a novel reverse cor-relation paradigm that allows us to uncover with millisecond precision the processing time course of specific information received on the retina at specific moments. Using faces as stimuli, we observed that processing at several electrodes and latencies was different depending on the moment at which information was received. Some of these variations were caused by a disruption occurring 160-200 ms after the face onset, suggesting a role of the N170 ERP component in gating information processing; others hinted at temporal compression and integration mechanisms. Importantly, the observed differences were not explained by simple adaptation or repetition priming, they were modulated by the task, and they were correlated with differences in behavior. These results suggest that top-down routines of information sampling are applied to the continuous visual input, even within a single eye fixation.

J	Li, J; Sun, Y; Yang, ZL; Zhong, YP				Li Jin; Sun Yu; Yang Zilu; Zhong Yiping			Social value orientation modulates the processing of social rewards for self: Evidence from ERPs study	ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						social value orientation (SVO); outcome evaluation; advice-giving; social rewards for self; event-related potential (ERP)	OUTCOME EVALUATION; DECISION-MAKING; VENTRAL STRIATUM; FEEDBACK; RESPONSES; ADVICE; CORTEX; P300; FRN; MONETARY	Social value orientation (SVO) is a relatively stable personality trait that reflects how the individual evaluate interdependent outcomes for oneself and the other in human social environments. Previous studies showed that people could be classified into proselfs and prosocials by assessing the Triple-Dominance Measure. Emerging studies have demonstrated that SVO is a personality trait that is closely associated with the processing of rewards allocation. Outcome evaluation is closely associated with the reward processing. Past research always focused on the modulation of SVO on the outcomes evaluation involving the monetary rewards. However, relatively little is known about how the SVO modulates the processing of outcome evaluation involving the social rewards for self. In the present study, we adopted the Event-related potentials (ERPs) technology to examine the temporal processing of the influence of SVO on the processing of the social reward for self. In particular, we focused on two types of social reward in this study, i.e., the "social acceptance" and "reflected glory". Advice-giving is a typical or common way for individuals to gain the social acceptance and reflected glory. Evaluating outcomes of advice involves with these two kinds of social rewards. Specifically, if individuals' advice is accepted, they may feel that they have garnered the "social acceptance". Further, if the advice provided leads to another's personal success, individuals may further feel a sense of reward through "reflected glory". The proselfs (n = 26) and prosocials (n = 25) were asked to complete the advice-giving guessing card task, in which task participants acted as an advisor who selected one of two advice options to give another person. Subsequently, all participants were informed that the other accepted (vs. rejected) their advice and the other's final outcome (gain vs. loss), while recording their electroencephalogram (EEG) at the feedback from the other processing stage (advice was accepted or rejected by the other) and outcomes for the other (gain or loss) processing stage. We focused on the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and P3 in outcome evaluation. The results of ERPs showed that at the feedback from the other processing stage, compared with the proselfs, the prosocials are more sensitive to the feedback from the other. In particular, at the early stage (FRN), there was no difference between having the advice accepting and rejecting for proselfs, however, this FRN effect was observed in the prosocials participants. At the later stage (P3), we also found there was a difference between having the advice accepting and rejecting for prosocials but not for the proselfs. On the other hand, at the final outcome for the other processing stage, at the early stage, there was a main effect of SVO, indicating that for prosocials, the FRN peak-to-peak value is more negative than the proselfs. There was a significant interaction among the SVO, Feedback from the other and Outcome for the other in the FRN. For the prosocials, there was a difference between the other's gain and loss in FRN following their own selections (i.e., advice) were rejected, whereas this difference did not emerge for the proselfs. In addition, we also observed that there was a significant interaction among the SVO, Feedback from the other and Outcome for the other in the P3. In particular, following the participant's advice was rejected, for the prosocials, compared with the other's loss outcome, the other's gain outcome elicited a larger P3. However, for the proselfs, the P3 showed a different pattern, showing that following the participant's advice was rejected, compared with the other's gain outcome, the other's loss outcome elicited a larger P3. Our findings indicates that the influences of SVO on the processing of self-rewards occurs at the early stage (mirrored in FRN) and the late stage (mirrored in P3). At the feedback from the other processing stage, at the early and the later stages, compared with prosoicals, the proselfs are relatively insensitive to the other's feedback about the advice (rejecting or accepting). At the final outcome for the other processing stage, at the earlier stage, prosocials are sensitive to the others' wins or losses in both the "accepted" and "rejected" conditions, whereas proselfs are not interested in the others' outcomes in the "self are rejected" context. Furthermore, at the late stage of outcome evaluation, prosocials attaches the significance on the other's interest and proselfs attached the importance on the self-interest. Taken together, SVO has a modulation effect on the processing of social rewards.

Memory failure predicted by attention lapsing and media multitasking	NATURE			English	Article							INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; WORKING-MEMORY; RETRIEVAL; OSCILLATIONS; COGNITION; AROUSAL; MIND; ERP	With the explosion of digital media and technologies, scholars, educators and the public have become increasingly vocal about the role that an 'attention economy' has in our lives(1). The rise of the current digital culture coincides with longstanding scientific questions about why humans sometimes remember and sometimes forget, and why some individuals remember better than others(2-6). Here we examine whether spontaneous attention lapses-in the moment(7-12), across individuals(13-15) and as a function of everyday media multitasking(16-19)-negatively correlate with remembering. Electroencephalography and pupillometry measures of attention(20,21) were recorded as eighty young adults (mean age, 21.7 years) performed a goal-directed episodic encoding and retrieval task(22). Trait-level sustained attention was further quantified using task-based(23) and questionnaire measures(24,25). Using trial-to-trial retrieval data, we show that tonic lapses in attention in the moment before remembering, assayed by posterior alpha power and pupil diameter, were correlated with reductions in neural signals of goal coding and memory, along with behavioural forgetting. Independent measures of trait-level attention lapsing mediated the relationship between neural assays of lapsing and memory performance, and between media multitasking and memory. Attention lapses partially account for why we remember or forget in the moment, and why some individuals remember better than others. Heavier media multitasking is associated with a propensity to have attention lapses and forget. Lapses in attention before remembering partially account for why we remember or forget in the moment, why some individuals remember better than others, and why heavier media multitasking is related to worse memory.

We used a modified Sternberg task with pure tones as memory items, with 3 memory set size conditions (2, 4, or 6 tones), and a control condition in which no task-relevant tone was presented (tones replaced by white-noise segments). Participants reported the presence or absence of a probe tone in the memory set. EEG signals were recorded using a BioSemi ActiveTwo system, with 64 active electrodes following the 10-10 system and average-mastoids reference. A P3 component, at electrode POz, was elicited by the probe when items were to be held in memory, no P3 was observed in control trials. With an increase in memory load, P3 amplitude decreased, accuracy was lower, and response time (RT) longer. There was a clear recency effect, in the electrophysiological and behavioral results reflected in a larger P3, shorter RT, and higher accuracy, when the probe matched the last tone of a sequence than when it matched any of the other presented tones, regardless of memory load. P3 amplitude and behavioral results were similar across all the other serial positions and loads. The results suggest that acoustic memory for pure tones is mediated by two subsystems: one encoding the last item with high probability, and another for all other serial positions. ICA of the ERPs isolated parieto-occipital ICA components with larger activations for probes that matched the last serial position than for earlier ones, and an anterior component that had little activation for the last serial positions and large activations for all earlier ones, corroborating the two-systems theory.

Engineeringcreativity: Prior experience modulates electrophysiological responses to novel metaphors	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						ERPs; Creativity; N400; Metaphor; Figurative language; Prior Knowledge	DOMAIN-RELATED INFORMATION; CONCEPTUAL INTEGRATION; ERP; COMPREHENSION; KNOWLEDGE; N400; COMPONENT; LANGUAGE; ACCESS; EXPERTISE	Novel metaphorical language use exemplifies human creativity through production and comprehension of meaningful linguistic expressions that may have never been heard before. Available electrophysiological research demonstrates, however, that novel metaphor comprehension is cognitively costly, as it requires integrating information from distantly related concepts. Herein, we investigate if such cognitive cost may be reduced as a factor of prior domain knowledge. To this end, we asked engineering and nonengineering students to read for comprehension literal, novel metaphorical, and anomalous sentences related to engineering or general knowledge, while undergoing EEG recording. Upon reading each sentence, participants were asked to judge whether or not the sentence was original in meaning (noveltyjudgment) and whether or not it made sense (sensicalityjudgment). When collapsed across groups, our findings demonstrate a gradual N400 modulation with N400 being maximal in response to anomalous, followed by metaphorical, and literal sentences. Between-group comparisons revealed a mirror effect on the N400 to novel metaphorical sentences, with attenuated N400 in engineers and enhanced N400 in non-engineers. Critically, planned comparisons demonstrated reduced N400 amplitudes to engineering novel metaphors in engineers relative to non-engineers, pointing to an effect of prior knowledge on metaphor processing. This reduction, however, was observed in the absence of a sentence type x knowledge x group interaction. Altogether, our study provides novel evidence suggesting that prior domain knowledge may have a direct impact on creative language comprehension.

Monitoring processes are often studied through the analysis of error processing. Previous developmental studies generally focused on post-error slowing and error-related EEG activities. Instead, the present study aims at collecting indicators of error monitoring processes occurring within trials that is, before the erroneous response is produced. Electromyographic (EMG) activity and force produced during responding were registered in 6 to 14-year-olds performing a choice-response task. As already reported in adults, force produced was weaker, EMG bursts were smaller, and motor times (interval between EMG onsets and responses) were longer during errors compared to correct responses. In contrast, the rising part of EMG burst, reflecting the initial motor command, was the same for both response outcomes. This suggests that error inhibition was applied online after the response was triggered but before the actual key was pressed. This error correction was already present in children as young as 6 years old. The effects of reduced EMG and force amplitudes remained stable across childhood. However, the prolonged motor times in young children suggests that they need more time to implement motor inhibition than their older peers.

Tracking Your Mind's Eye during Recollection: Decoding the Long-Term Recall of Short Audiovisual Clips	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							RECOGNITION MEMORY; EPISODIC MEMORY; AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORIES; REMEMBER/KNOW JUDGMENTS; EVIDENCE ACCUMULATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FAMILIARITY; RETRIEVAL; ERP; REPRESENTATIONS	Unlike familiarity, recollection involves the ability to reconstruct mentally previous events that results in a strong sense of reliving. According to the reinstatement hypothesis, this specific feature emerges from the reactivation of cortical patterns involved during information exposure. Over time, the retrieval of specific details becomes more difficult, and memories become increasingly supported by familiarity judgments. The multiple trace theory (MTT) explains the gradual loss of episodic details by a transformation in the memory representation, a view that is not shared by the standard consolidation model. In this study, we tested the MTT in light of the reinstatement hypothesis. The temporal dynamics of mental imagery from long-term memory were investigated and tracked over the passage of time. Participant EEG activity was recorded during the recall of short audiovisual clips that had been watched 3 weeks, 1 day, or a few hours beforehand. The recall of the audiovisual clips was assessed using a Remember/Know/New procedure, and snapshots of clips were used as recall cues. The decoding matrices obtained from the multivariate pattern analyses revealed sustained patterns that occurred at long latencies (>500 msec poststimulus onset) that faded away over the retention intervals and that emerged from the same neural processes. Overall, our data provide further evidence toward the MTT and give new insights into the exploration of our "mind's eye."

Typically, single tasks are used in relatively small studies to compare cases and controls in one indication, but they are rarely included in larger multisite trials. This is due to limited systematic standardization as well as the challenges of deployment in international studies and stringent adherence to the high regulatory requirements for data integrity. The Reward Task Optimization Consortium (RTOC) was formed to facilitate operational implementation of reward processing tasks, making them suitable for use in future large-scale, international, multisite drug development studies across multiple indications. The RTOC clinical study aims to conduct initial optimization of a set of tasks in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) or schizophrenia (SZ). Methods: We will conduct a multicenter study across four EU countries. Participants (MDD = 37, SZ = 37, with <= 80 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers) will attend a study visit comprising screening, self-report and clinically rated assessments of anhedonia and symptom severity, and three reward processing tasks; specifically, the Grip Strength Effort task, the Doors task, and the Reinforcement Learning Working Memory task. The Grip Strength Effort and Doors tasks include simultaneous electroencephalography/event-related potential recordings. Outcomes will be compared using a two-way group design of MDD and SZ with matched controls, respectively. Further analyses will include anhedonia assessment scores as covariates. Planned analyses will assess whether our findings replicate previously published data, and multisite deployment will be evaluated through assessments of quality and conduct. A subset of participants will complete a second visit, to assess test-retest reliability of the task battery. Discussion: This study will evaluate the operational deployment of three reward processing tasks to the regulatory standards required for use in drug development trials. We will explore the potential of these tasks to differentiate patients from controls and to provide a quantitative marker of anhedonia and/or impaired motivation, establishing their usefulness as endpoints in multisite clinical trials. This study should demonstrate where multifaceted reward deficits are similar or divergent across patient populations.

The error-related negativity as a neuromarker of risk or resilience in young children	BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						anxiety; cognitive control; emotion regulation; error&#8208; related negativity; executive functioning	BRAIN ACTIVITY; EMOTION REGULATION; ANXIETY DISORDERS; EFFORTFUL CONTROL; ELECTROCORTICAL RESPONSES; EXECUTIVE ATTENTION; ERP COMPONENTS; BEHAVIOR; ASSOCIATIONS; TEMPERAMENT	Introduction The error-related negativity (ERN) is a neural response that reflects error monitoring. Contradictorily, an enlarged (more negative) ERN has been cited as both a risk factor and a protective factor, which hinders its utility as a predictive indicator. The aim of the current study was to examine the associations between ERN measured in early childhood with the development of cognitive control (CC), emotion regulation, and internalizing/externalizing symptoms over 1-2 years. Methods When children were ages 5-7, EEG was collected during a Go/No-Go task. A subset of the original participants (n = 30) were selected based on their baseline ERN in an extreme-case design: half with high-amplitude ERN, matched by age and sex with another group with low-amplitude ERN. Results At follow-up, children in the High-Amplitude group showed better executive function, less self-reported anxiety and depression, less affect dysregulation, more parent-rated CC, less lability/negativity, and fewer parent-reported externalizing problems. Many results held even when accounting for baseline levels. Further, emotion dysregulation mediated the relationship between the ERN and both anxiety and externalizing problems, while CC mediated the ERN's relationship with externalizing problems only. Conclusions These results can inform identification and intervention efforts for children at risk for psychopathology.

Multisensory Audiovisual Processing in Children With a Sensory Processing Disorder (I): Behavioral and Electrophysiological Indices Under Speeded Response Conditions	FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						autism spectrum disorders; EEG; multisensory integration; ASD; event-related potential; sensory integration; cross-modal	OBJECT RECOGNITION; INTEGRATION; HUMANS; FREQUENCY; CHILDHOOD	Background Maladaptive reactivity to sensory inputs is commonly observed in neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., autism, ADHD). Little is known, however, about the underlying neural mechanisms. For some children, atypical sensory reactivity is the primary complaint, despite absence of another identifiable neurodevelopmental diagnosis. Studying Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) may well provide a window into the neuropathology of these symptoms. It has been proposed that a deficit in sensory integration underlies the SPD phenotype, but objective quantification of sensory integration is lacking. Here we used neural and behavioral measures of multisensory integration (MSI), which would be affected by impaired sensory integration and for which there are well accepted objective measures, to test whether failure to integrate across the senses is associated with atypical sensory reactivity in SPD. An autism group served to determine if observed differences were unique to SPD. Methods We tested whether children aged 6-16 years with SPD (N = 14) integrate multisensory inputs differently from age-matched typically developing controls (TD: N = 54), or from children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD: N = 44). Participants performed a simple reaction-time task to the occurrence of auditory, visual, and audiovisual stimuli presented in random order, while high-density recordings of electrical brain activity were made. Results Children with SPD showed large reductions in the extent to which they benefited from multisensory inputs compared to TDs. The ASD group showed similarly reduced response speeding to multisensory relative to unisensory inputs. Neural evidence for MSI was seen across all three groups, with the multisensory response differing from the sum of the unisensory responses. Post hoc tests suggested the possibility of enhanced MSI in SPD in timeframes consistent with cortical sensory registration (similar to 60 ms), followed by reduced MSI during a timeframe consistent with object formation (similar to 130 ms). The ASD group also showed reduced MSI in the later timeframe. Conclusion Children with SPD showed reduction in their ability to benefit from redundant audio-visual inputs, similar to children with ASD. Neurophysiological recordings, on the other hand, showed that major indices of MSI were largely intact, although post hoc testing pointed to periods of potential differential processing. While these exploratory electrophysiological observations point to potential sensory-perceptual differences in multisensory processing in SPD, it remains equally plausible at this stage that later attentional processing differences may yet prove responsible for the multisensory behavioral deficits uncovered here.

Processing Code-Switches in the Presence of Others: An ERP Study	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						code-switching; early frontal positivity; LPC; social factors; bilingual language processing; pro-active control; language control	BILINGUAL WORD RECOGNITION; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; LEXICAL ACCESS; LANGUAGE; SENTENCE; IDENTIFICATION; COMPREHENSION; MECHANISMS; FREQUENCY; COMPONENT	Code-switching is highly socially constrained. For instance, code-switching is only felicitous when those present are fluent in both languages. This means that bilinguals need to dynamically adjust their language control and expectation of code-switching to the current social situation or context. The aim of the present EEG study was to investigate how and when language control in the comprehension of code-switches is affected by the assumed language knowledge of others in the context. Spanish-English bilinguals read sentences with and without code-switches together with another Spanish-English bilingual or with an English monolingual. Switches elicited an early fronto-central positivity. This effect was smaller overall when a bilingual was present at the start of the study. In addition, the late positive complex found for switches was smaller when a bilingual was present rather than a monolingual, but only for those participants who were sensitive to the other's language knowledge in their off-line judgments. These findings suggest that the bilinguals in our study expected and activated both languages when initially paired with a bilingual and that they more easily accommodated code-switches, in the presence of a bilingual than in the presence of a monolingual. Our findings support the view that language control can be modulated by the perceived language knowledge of others present, and are compatible with a dynamic control model of bilingual language comprehension.

Four different comic strips (strips containing humorous scenes that required ToM, non-ToM humorous strips, non-humorous semantically coherent strips and non-humorous semantically incoherent strips) were presented to participants, while their EEG response was recorded. Results showed that both of the humorous comic strips and the semantically incongruent strip elicited an N400 effect, suggesting similar cognitive mechanisms underlying the processing of incongruent and humorous comic strips. The results also showed that the humorous ToM strips elicited a frontal late positive (LP) response, possibly reflecting the active deployment of ToM abilities such as perspective-taking and empathy that allow for the resolution and interpretation of apparently incongruent situations. In addition, the LP response was positively correlated with ratings of perceived amusement as well as individual empathy scores, suggesting that the increased LP response to ToM humorous strips reflects the combined activation of neural mechanisms involved in the experience of amusement and ToM abilities. Overall, humor comprehension appears to demand distinct cognitive steps such as the detection of incongruent semantic components, the construction of semantic coherence, and the appreciation of humoristic elements such as maladaptive emotional reactions. Our results show that the deployment of these distinct cognitive steps is at least partially dependent on individual empathic abilities.

Beat-based and Memory-based Temporal Expectations in Rhythm: Similar Perceptual Effects, Different Underlying Mechanisms	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; METRICAL ACCENTS; TASK-RELEVANCE; BRAIN EVIDENCE; ATTENTION; PREDICTION; RESPONSES; ERP; PREDICTABILITY; ENTRAINMENT	Predicting the timing of incoming information allows the brain to optimize information processing in dynamic environments. Behaviorally, temporal expectations have been shown to facilitate processing of events at expected time points, such as sounds that coincide with the beat in musical rhythm. Yet, temporal expectations can develop based on different forms of structure in the environment, not just the regularity afforded by a musical beat. Little is still known about how different types of temporal expectations are neurally implemented and affect performance. Here, we orthogonally manipulated the periodicity and predictability of rhythmic sequences to examine the mechanisms underlying beat-based and memory-based temporal expectations, respectively. Behaviorally and using EEG, we looked at the effects of beat-based and memory-based expectations on auditory processing when rhythms were task-relevant or task-irrelevant. At expected time points, both beat-based and memory-based expectations facilitated target detection and led to attenuation of P1 and N1 responses, even when expectations were task-irrelevant (unattended). For beat-based expectations, we additionally found reduced target detection and enhanced N1 responses for events at unexpected time points (e.g., off-beat), regardless of the presence of memory-based expectations or task relevance. This latter finding supports the notion that periodicity selectively induces rhythmic fluctuations in neural excitability and furthermore indicates that, although beat-based and memory-based expectations may similarly affect auditory processing of expected events, their underlying neural mechanisms may be different.

However, individuals with autism (ASD) are commonly challenged in multispeaker settings and often do not respond to salient speech, including one's own name (OON). It is unknown whether neural responses during this Cocktail Party scenario differ in those with ASD and whether such differences are associated with expressive language or auditory filtering abilities. We measured neural responses to hearing OON in quiet and multispeaker settings using electroencephalography in 20 minimally or low verbal ASD (ASD-MLV), 27 verbally fluent ASD (ASD-V), and 27 neurotypical (TD) participants, ages 13-22. First, we determined whether TD's neural responses to OON relative to other names could be quantified with early frontal mismatch responses (MMRs) and late, slow shift parietal and frontal responses (LPPs/FNs). Second, we compared the strength of MMRs and LPPs/FNs across the three groups. Third, we tested whether participants with poorer auditory filtering abilities exhibited particularly weak neural responses to OON heard in a multispeaker setting. Our primary finding was that TDs and ASD-Vs, but not ASD-MLVs, had significant MMRs to OON in a multispeaker setting, and strength of LPPs positively correlated with auditory filtering abilities in those with ASD. These findings reveal electrophysiological correlates of auditory filtering disruption within a clinical population that has severe language and communication impairments and offer a novel neuroimaging approach to studying the Cocktail Party effect in neurotypical and clinical populations. Lay Summary We found that minimally and low verbal adolescents and young adults with autism exhibit decreased neural responses to one's own name when heard in a multispeaker setting. In addition, decreased strength of neural responses in those with autism correlated with decreased auditory filtering abilities. We propose that these neural deficits may reflect the ineffective processing of salient speech in noisy settings and contribute to language and communication deficits observed in autism.

Leveling the Field for a Fairer Race between Going and Stopping: Neural Evidence for the Race Model of Motor Inhibition from a New Version of the Stop Signal Task	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							CHOICE REACTION-TIME; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; BRAIN; IMPULSIVITY; ATTENTION; STIMULATION; DRINKING; BEHAVIOR; NOVELTY	The stop signal task (SST) is the gold standard experimental model of inhibitory control. However, neither SST condition-contrast (stop vs. go, successful vs. failed stop) purely operationalizes inhibition. Because stop trials include a second, infrequent signal, the stop versus go contrast confounds inhibition with attentional and stimulus processing demands. While this confound is controlled for in the successful versus failed stop contrast, the go process is systematically faster on failed stop trials, contaminating the contrast with a different noninhibitory confound. Here, we present an SST variant to address both confounds and evaluate putative neural indices of inhibition with these influences removed. In our variant, stop signals occurred on every trial, equating the noninhibitory demands of the stop versus go contrast. To entice participants to respond despite the impending stop signals, responses produced before stop signals were rewarded. This also reversed the go process bias that typically affects the successful versus failed stop contrast. We recorded scalp electroencephalography in this new version of the task (as well as a standard version of the SST with infrequent stop signal) and found that, even under these conditions, the properties of the frontocentral stop signal P3 ERP remained consistent with the race model. Specifically, in both tasks, the amplitude of the P3 was increased on stop versus go trials. Moreover, the onset of this P3 occurred earlier for successful compared with failed stop trials in both tasks, consistent with the proposal of the race model that an earlier start of the inhibition process will increase stopping success. Therefore, the frontocentral stop signal P3 represents a neural process whose properties are in line with the predictions of the race model of motor inhibition, even when the SST's confounds are controlled.

J	Zimmermann, J; Ross, B; Moscovitch, M; Alain, C				Zimmermann, Jacqueline; Ross, Bernhard; Moscovitch, Morris; Alain, Claude			Neural dynamics supporting auditory long-term memory effects on target detection	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Attention; Memory; Memory-guided attention; EEG; Auditory; Contextual cueing	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; HEARING SUBJECTS; BAND ACTIVITY; IMPLICIT; SLEEP; FAMILIARITY; PERCEPTION	Auditory long-term memory has been shown to facilitate signal detection. However, the nature and timing of the cognitive processes supporting such benefits remain equivocal. We measured neuroelectric brain activity while young adults were presented with a contextual memory cue designed to assist with the detection of a faint pure tone target embedded in an audio clip of an everyday environmental scene (e.g., the soundtrack of a restaurant). During an initial familiarization task, participants heard such audio clips, half of which included a target sound (memory cue trials) at a specific time and location (left or right ear), as well as audio clips without a target (neutral trials). Following a 1-h or 24-h retention interval, the same audio clips were presented, but now all included a target. Participants were asked to press a button as soon as they heard the pure tone target. Overall, participants were faster and more accurate during memory than neutral cue trials. The auditory contextual memory effects on performance coincided with three temporally and spatially distinct neural modulations, which encompassed changes in the amplitude of event-related potential as well as changes in theta, alpha, beta and gamma power. Brain electrical source analyses revealed greater source activity in memory than neutral cue trials in the right superior temporal gyrus and left parietal cortex. Conversely, neutral trials were associated with greater source activity than memory cue trials in the left posterior medial temporal lobe. Target detection was associated with increased negativity (N2), and a late positive (P3b) wave at frontal and parietal sites, respectively. The effect of auditory contextual memory on brain activity preceding target onset showed little lateralization. Together, these results are consistent with contextual memory facilitating retrieval of target-context associations and deployment and management of auditory attentional resources to when the target occurred. The results also suggest that the auditory cortices, parietal cortex, and medial temporal lobe may be parts of a neural network enabling memory-guided attention during auditory scene analysis.

MULTIPLE CLASSIFICATION TECHNIQUES TOWARD A ROBUST AND RELIABLE P300 BCI SYSTEM	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING-APPLICATIONS BASIS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Brain-Computer Interface (BCI); P300 Signal; Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA); Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA); Support Vector Machine (SVM); Linear Regression (LREG); Bayesian Linear Discriminant Analysis (BLDA); Twin Support Vector Machine (TSVM)	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; SINGLE TRIAL EEG; MENTAL PROSTHESIS; WHEELCHAIR; ENSEMBLE; SVMS	A brain-computer interface (BCI) can be used for people with severe physical disabilities such as ALS or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. BCI can allow these individuals to communicate again by creating a new communication channel directly from the brain to an output device. BCI technology can allow paralyzed people to share their intent with others, and thereby demonstrate that direct communication from the brain to the external world is possible and that it might serve useful functions. BCI systems include machine learning algorithms (MLAs). Their performance depends on the feature extraction and classification techniques employed. In this paper, we propose a system to exploit the P300 signal in the brain, a positive detection in event-related potentials. The P300 signal can be incorporated into a spelling device. There are two benefits behind this kind of research. First of all, this work presents the research status and the advantages of communication via a BCI system, especially the P300 BCI system for disordered people, and the related literature review is presented. Secondly, the paper discusses the performance of different machine learning algorithms. Two-different datasets are presented: the first dataset 2004 and the second dataset 2019. A preprocessing step is introduced to the subjects in both datasets first to extract the important features before applying the proposed machine learning methods: linear discriminant analysis (LDA I and LDA II), support vector machine (SVM I, SVM II, SVM III, and SVM IV), linear regression (LREG), Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA), and twin support vector machine (TSVM). By comparing the performance of the different machine learning systems, in the first dataset it is found that BLDA and SVMIV classifiers yield the highest performance for both subjects "A" and "B". BLDA yields 98% and 66% for 15th and 5th sequences, respectively, whereas SVMIV yields 98% and 54.4% for 15th and 5th sequences, respectively. While in the second dataset, it is obvious that BLDA classifier yields the highest performance for both subjects "1" and "2", it achieves 90.115%. The paper summarizes the P300 BCI system for the two introduced datasets. It discusses the proposed system, compares the classification methods performances, and considers some aspects for the future work to be handled. The results show high accuracy and less computational time which makes the system more applicable for online applications.

Methods: 15 ADHD patients between 10 and 16 years underwent three tDCS sessions in which conventional, HD and sham tDCS of the right IFG were applied. In all sessions a 2-back working memory task was solved and EEG was recorded. Baseline data were assessed from 15 age matched healthy controls. Results: In ADHD patients, increased positive values of P300 and N200 mean amplitudes were found after conventional and HD-tDCS. Thus, both components were more in resemblance to ERPs in healthy controls. Behavioral performance was not generally influenced by tDCS but effects of HD-tDCS depended on individual hyperactive/impulsive symptom load. The rate of responders for HD-tDCS was equivalent to the responder rate for conventional tDCS. Conclusions: ERP data indicate that HD-tDCS is equally suitable as conventional tDCS for the recruitment of the right IFG in the context of working memory processing. Significance: HD-tDCS of the right IFG is a promising approach for neuromodulation in ADHD but further research is necessary to develop adaptations that produce reliable behavioral benefits.

Although some functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have documented the relationship between reactive and intentional inhibitions, they could not provide pertinent temporal dynamics information due to fMRI's low temporal resolution. Therefore, in the current study, we explored this issue by extracting the time-domain dynamics and oscillatory-power dynamics from electroencephalographic (EEG) data while participants performed a modified Go/NoGo/Choose task, in which free choices trials were integrated with conventional go/nogo trials. Participants were asked to decide for themselves to either inhibit or execute an action for free choices trials, and to respond properly according to go/nogo signal for conventional go/nogo trials. Two important results were obtained. First, for the reactive condition, nogo trials elicited greater N2 and P3 amplitudes and induced more pronounced delta, theta, and beta band oscillations than go trials, while for the intentional condition, nogo trials only elicited greater P3 amplitudes and triggered pronounced beta band oscillations compared to go trials. Second, while the P3/delta, theta, and beta oscillations were larger for reactive nogo trials than for intentional go/nogo trials, the P3/delta and theta oscillations were larger for intentional go/nogo trials than for reactive go trials. Together, these results suggest that there are both similarities and differences in oscillatory dynamics between reactive and intentional inhibitions. This study is the first to investigate the relationship between reactive and intentional inhibitions at the time-frequency domain, and the current results expand our understanding about different inhibitions.

Variations in these neurotransmitter levels may modulate/predict executive functioning. Matching this, strong impairments of response inhibition are one of the most consistently reported cognitive/behavioral effects of acute alcohol intoxication. However, it has never been investigated whether baseline differences in these neurotransmitters allow to predict how much alcohol intoxication impairs response inhibition, and whether this is reflected in neurophysiological measures of cognitive control. We used MR spectroscopy to assess baseline (i.e., sober) GABA and glutamate levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and striatum in n = 30 healthy young males, who were subsequently tested once sober and once intoxicated (1.01 permille). Inhibition was assessed with the sustained attention to response task (SART). This paradigm also allows to examine the effect of different degrees of response automatization, which is a known modulator for response inhibition, but does not seem to be substantially impaired during acute intoxication. As a neurophysiological correlate of response inhibition and control, we quantified EEG-derived theta band power and located its source using beamforming analyses. We found that alcohol-induced response inhibition deficits only occurred in the case of response automatization. This was reflected by decreased theta band activity in the left supplementary motor area (SMA), which may reflect modulations in the encoding of a surprise signal in response to inhibition cues. However, we did not find that differences in baseline (i.e., sober) GABA or glutamate levels significantly modulated differences in the size of alcohol-induced inhibition deficits.

We used the Dynamic Temporal Prediction (DTP), in which local and global predictions of an imperative stimulus were manipulated by using different stimulus-onset asynchronies (SOAs), presented with several distribution probabilities. At a behavioural level, the results show a performance adjustment (reaction time decrease) depending on the implicit use of global prediction. At a neurophysiological level, three separate computational steps underlying motor control were investigated. First, the expectancy implementation was associated with global probability-dependent contingent negative variation (CNV) modulation supported by the recruitment of a frontoparietal network involving the anterior cingulate, the left intraparietal sulcus, the occipital, and the premotor areas. Second, the response implementation was modulated by the global prediction fostering stimulus processing (P3 increase) at the motor response level, as suggested by both oscillatory (beta desynchronization), as well as source analysis (frontal cortical network). Third, the expectancy violation lead to a negativity increase (omission-detection potential) time locked to the global rule violation and additionally, to delta and theta power increase interpreted as inhibitory control and rule violation detection, respectively. The expectancy violation further engaged a left lateralized network including the temporal parietal junction (TPJ) and the motor cortex, suggesting involvement of attentional reorienting and a motor adjustment. Finally, these findings provide new insights on the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying proactive motor control, suggesting an overlapping between implicit and explicit processes.	[Duma, G.

A Phase I, Randomized, Single-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Single Ascending Dose Study of the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Subcutaneous and Oral TRV250, a G Protein-Selective Delta Receptor Agonist, in Healthy Subjects	CNS DRUGS			English	Article							OPIOID RECEPTORS; MIGRAINE	Background The delta opioid receptor (DOR) has been identified as a therapeutic target for migraine, with DOR agonists exhibiting low abuse potential compared with conventional mu-opioid agonists. TRV250 is a novel small molecule agonist of the DOR that is preferentially selective for G-protein signaling, with relatively little activation of the beta-arrestin2 post-receptor signaling pathway. This selectivity provides reduced susceptibility to proconvulsant activity seen with non-selective DOR agonists. TRV250 significantly reduced nitroglycerin-evoked hyperalgesia in rodents, indicating a potential utility in acute migraine without the risk of seizure activity or abuse potential. Objective This trial evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of ascending dose levels of TRV250 administered subcutaneously (SC) and the relative bioavailability of TRV250 administered orally compared with SC administration. Methods This was a two-part, single ascending dose study. Part A included four cohorts of healthy adults (N = 38). Each cohort was dosed on three occasions (placebo and two different dose levels of TRV250, allocated in randomized order and administered by SC route). In Part B, a single cohort of nine subjects received an oral dose of either TRV250 (n = 7) or placebo (n = 2) in a fed or fasted state. Serial blood samples were obtained for pharmacokinetic determination across a 24-h post-dose period. Safety assessments included clinical laboratory measures, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and electroencephalogram (EEG) pre- and post-dosing. Results TRV250 was well tolerated. There were no serious adverse events (SAEs), and all AEs were mild in severity. Injection-site reactions and headache were the most common AEs. One subject was withdrawn from the study due to a TRV250-related AE of postural orthostatic tachycardia. There were no clinically relevant changes in physical examination, hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, suicidal ideation, or vital signs, with the exception of orthostatic changes in some subjects. No subject experienced abnormalities in EEGs or experienced a change from baseline in heart-rate-corrected QT interval (QTcF) > 60 ms, or an absolute QTcF interval > 480 ms at any post-dosing observation. Peak and total plasma exposure to TRV250 increased in a dose-proportional manner following 0.1-30 mg SC doses, with the mean half-life ranging from 2.39 to 3.76 h. Oral bioavailability of TRV250 ranged from 14% (fasting) to 19% (fed) relative to SC dosing, while administration with food increased the AUC but decreased the rate of absorption as reflected by a modest delay in median time to maximum concentration and a slight reduction in maximum concentration. Conclusion The findings from the first-in-human study support further evaluation of TRV250, a G-protein selective DOR agonist, in the treatment of acute migraine.

J	Wang, LJ; Suo, T; Zhao, GX				Wang Lijun; Suo Tao; Zhao Guoxiang			The influence of unaware errors on post-error adjustment: Evidence from ectrophysiological analysis	ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						error awareness; post-error adjustment; alpha; proactive control; reactive control	COGNITIVE CONTROL; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; AWARENESS; THETA	Following errors, participants usually recruit more cognitive resources to change error-related behaviors; this phenomenon is termed post-error adjustment. Generally, behavioral adjustments in post-error trials behave as slower subsequent responses and improved accuracy. It is worth noting that we cannot successfully perceive every error we commit in daily life. Several studies found that post-error slowing occurred only after aware errors, suggesting that only aware errors contribute to the phenomenon of post-error adjustment. Moreover, these studies emphasized the role of top-down control in the processing of error awareness. However, a few studies came to the opposite conclusion, finding that post-error adjustment could be modulated by unaware errors in an implicit manner. These studies emphasized the role of bottom-up control in the processing of error awareness. Notably, previous studies have demonstrated that post-error adjustment involves both proactive and reactive cognitive control. Proactive control refers to a goal-driven manner that is actively maintained with sustained attention before the occurrence of cognitively demanding events. Reactive control refers to a bottom-up manner, in which the attentional control is mobilized when the goal-related event is reactivated. Thus, whether different control strategies are adopted by aware and unaware errors remains unclear. To investigate the above issue, we recruited 36 participants to execute an error awareness task based on the go/no-go task. However, data from five participants were removed due to poor EEG records or poor behavioral performance. In the go/no-go error awareness task, participants were instructed to withhold their responses in certain circumstances. The first was when a word was presented on two consecutive trials, and the second was when the font color of the word and its meaning were inconsistent. Additionally, the usage of an error signal button might lead to a response bias toward signaling or not signaling an error. If participants tended to signal errors, they might signal their correct responses as errors, increasing the false alarm rates. If participants did not tend to signal errors, aware errors might be classed as unaware errors. In this case, the measurement of unaware errors might be contaminated by potential conscious error trials. Thus, participants were instructed to respond to indicate their perceived response accuracy in both error and correct cases during the rating screen in the current experiment. Since previous studies have found that neural oscillations reveal the processing of proactive and reactive control. the time-frequency analysis is conducted in this experiment. It has been suggested that the alpha band (8-14 Hz) reflects the trial-by-trial behavioral adjustment. Thus, alpha power is chosen as the neural indicator. As a result, the post-error reaction time indicated two dissociated behavior patterns with speeding up following aware errors and slowing down following unaware errors. However, accuracy in trials following aware and unaware errors was significantly higher than for trials following correct go. At the neural level, alpha (-500 to 500 ms) power was stronger for aware errors than for unaware errors. Moreover, the alpha was activated before the subjective report of error awareness for aware errors, but the alpha was activated after the subjective report of error awareness for unaware errors. Current behavioral results showed that aware and unaware errors both successfully optimized post-error performance, but the two error types adopted different methods to adjust post-error behaviors. The time-frequency analysis revealed that aware errors led to sustained attention control after responses, but unaware errors led to temporary attention control induced by the subjective report of error awareness. Therefore. these findings might suggest that the adjustments following aware errors were based on a strategy such as proactive control, whereas the adjustments following unaware errors were based on a strategy such as reactive control.

Cell transplantation as a novel therapeutic strategy for autism spectrum disorders: a clinical study	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF STEM CELLS			English	Article						Autologous; bone marrow mononuclear cells; autism spectrum disorders; PET CT scan; cell transplantation	STEM-CELLS; FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY; OXIDATIVE STRESS; BRAIN; CHILDREN; PLASTICITY; PREVENT; INJURY; SCALE; SAFE	Background: Autism spectrum disorders [ASD] is a lifelong disability mainly affecting the development, communication, social interaction and behavior of an individual. Cell transplantation is emerging as a potential therapeutic strategy for ASD. Our previously published proof of concept study showed beneficial effects of cell transplantation in ASD. This study shows effect of cell transplantation in a larger sample size of ASD patients. Methods: 254 patients diagnosed with ASD on DSM V criteria were enrolled in this open label non-randomized study. The intervention included intrathecal transplantation of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells and neurorehabilitation. On mean follow up of 7.50 months, percentage analysis was performed on all symptomatic changes. Changes in outcome measures, Indian Scale for Assessment of Autism [ISAA] and Childhood Autism Rating Scale [CARS], were analyzed statistically using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Comparative analysis of Positron Emission Tomography [PET CT] scan brain, performed before and 6 months after intervention, was done in 86 patients to monitor the outcome at cellular level. Change in the standardized uptake values was statistically evaluated using T-Test [P <= 0.05]. Results: Improvements were observed in eye contact, attention and concentration, hyperactivity, sitting tolerance, social interaction, stereotypical behavior, aggressiveness, communication, speech, command following and self-stimulatory behavior. Statistically significant improvement was observed in scores of ISAA and CARS after intervention. A significantly better outcome of the intervention was found in patients at younger age and with shorter duration of disease [<5 years from time of diagnosis]. 86 patients who underwent a repeat PET CT scan showed improved brain metabolism after intervention in areas which correlated to the symptomatic changes. No major procedure related adverse events were recorded. However, 5 patients, with history of seizure and abnormal EEG, had an episode of seizure which was managed using medications. Outcome of intervention in these patients was not affected by seizures as improvements were observed in them. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells in combination with neurorehabilitation are a safe and effective treatment modality for ASD. It improves the quality of life of patients and helps them to integrate in mainstream lifestyle.

Earlier results had indicated that the direction of gaze is a strong social cue that speeds response times; so we wondered whether, as a task-irrelevant stimulus, it could compensate for age-related impairment of inhibitory processes in the elderly. Our results assessed the Simon effect by: reaction time, error rate, the P3 component and the lateralized readiness potential (LRP). We found that the Simon effect was larger in the older group confirming an increased sensitivity to interference and also suggesting a decreased inhibitory control in older adults. LRP results showed that aging and stimulus-response incongruency delayed the selection of the responses-indexed by longer s-LRP latency data-, and also decreased the efficiency of motor inhibition in the Simon task-the s-LRP amplitude of both wrong- and correct-side activation was larger in older adults, and the latency difference of these two components was longer in this age-group. Also a larger N2pc amplitude in the congruent, compared to incongruent gaze condition, showed an increased visuospatial attention when the gaze-cueing drew attention to the target stimulus. This gaze-cueing could not be ignored and hence it modified task processing in the older age group, which was evident in the incongruent Simon condition where the congruent gaze increased older adults' reaction time and their error rate; but there was no difference observed in the congruent Simon condition. Since the anticipated facilitation of reaction times did not occur, we suggest that general slowing and decreased inhibitory functions in the elderly caused the social cue not to be a supporting stimulus but rather to be a further burden on their cognitive processing.

Overlapping connectivity patterns during semantic processing of abstract and concrete words revealed with multivariate Granger Causality analysis	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							NEURAL REPRESENTATION; BRAIN NETWORK; LANGUAGE; INFORMATION; COMPREHENSION; MEG; ERP; FMRI; ACQUISITION; ACTIVATION	, unlike concrete, nouns refer to notions beyond our perception. Even though there is no consensus among linguists as to what exactly constitutes a concrete or abstract word, neuroscientists found clear evidence of a "concreteness" effect. This can, for instance, be seen in patients with language impairments due to brain injury or developmental disorder who are capable of perceiving one category better than another. Even though the results are inconclusive, neuroimaging studies on healthy subjects also provide a spatial and temporal account of differences in the processing of abstract versus concrete words. A description of the neural pathways during abstract word reading, the manner in which the connectivity patterns develop over the different stages of lexical and semantic processing compared to that of concrete word processing are still debated. We conducted a high-density EEG study on 24 healthy young volunteers using an implicit categorization task. From this, we obtained high spatio-temporal resolution data and, by means of source reconstruction, reduced the effect of signal mixing observed on scalp level. A multivariate, time-varying and directional method of analyzing connectivity based on the concept of Granger Causality (Partial Directed Coherence) revealed a dynamic network that transfers information from the right superior occipital lobe along the ventral and dorsal streams towards the anterior temporal and orbitofrontal lobes of both hemispheres. Some regions along these pathways appear to be primarily involved in either receiving or sending information. A clear difference in information transfer of abstract and concrete words was observed during the time window of semantic processing, specifically for information transferred towards the left anterior temporal lobe. Further exploratory analysis confirmed a generally stronger connectivity pattern for processing concrete words. We believe our study could guide future research towards a more refined theory of abstract word processing in the brain.

J	Zhang, QF; Wang, XJ				Zhang Qingfang; Wang Xuejiao			Primary phonological planning units in Chinese spoken word production: Evidence from an ERP study with implicit priming paradigm	ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						spoken word production; phonological encoding; proximate unit principle; syllable; phoneme	SPEECH PRODUCTION; LANGUAGE PRODUCTION; TIME COURSE; SYLLABLES; ORTHOGRAPHY; SEGMENTS	Languages may differ in terms of the proximate units of phonological encoding in spoken word production. It is widely accepted that phonemes are the primary units used in Indo-European languages. However, it is controversial what the functional units (syllables or phonemes) are in Chinese spoken word production. In the framework of proximate unit principle hypothesis for Mandarin Chinese spoken word production, phonological content is activated in a syllable while its syllabic frame is retrieved. Both syllabic content and frame are linked sequentially and tone is also specified at this point. Crucially, syllables are retrieved at an early stage of word form encoding, and then the phonemes of the syllable are retrieved in parallel and linked to their position in the syllable frame. The present study investigated the temporal courses of syllables and phonemes in word production using an implicit priming paradigm, and electrophysiological signals were measured concurrently. Specifically, participants were young native Chinese speakers with low level of English ability for excluding the influence of the second language. In an implicit priming paradigm, four sets of word pairs served as experimental stimuli. Each set consisted of four pairs, and the first word of a pair was the cue word, while the second was the response word. In the homogeneous conditions, four response words in a set with common phonological properties. For instance, the four response words in a set were (/wei1ji1/, crisis), (/wei2qiang2/, bounding wall), (/wei3ba/, tail), and (/wei4xing1/, satellite), which shared the first syllable but not tone. The heterogeneous conditions used the same word pairs, but assigned them to sets in which they didn't share any properties. Two homogeneous conditions (syllable shared and initial phoneme shared) were used in the study. Participants were asked to memorize the sets of four pairs of associate words, after which they were presented with the cue words, and were required to produce the response words. Behavioral results didn't show any syllable or phoneme effects. EEG results revealed that syllable overlap condition elicited significant effects in the time window of 100 similar to 400 ms, and the effect firstly showed up in the left and right anterior regions, following in the middle anterior region, and finally in the left and right anterior regions, right and middle posterior regions. While the phoneme effects only appeared between 500 similar to 600 ms after the cue words were presented, and were distributed in the right anterior and posterior regions. Both the syllabically and phonemically homogeneous conditions were characterized by more positive ERP waveforms when compared to the heterogeneous conditions. We suggest that syllable overlap effect arises at an early stage of phonological encoding, whereas the phoneme overlap effect possibly arises at a late stage of phonological encoding, or phonetic encoding in Chinese spoken word production. Our findings provide support for the assumption of the proximate unit principle.

J	Zhang, ZH; Han, M; Zhang, F; Li, WJ				Zhang Zhenghua; Han Mei; Zhang Fang; Li Weijun			Musical training improves rhythm integrative processing of classical Chinese poem	ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						musical training; rhythm; poem; integrative processing	TIME-COURSE; BRAIN-STEM; CONGENITAL AMUSIA; FOREIGN-LANGUAGE; AUDITORY-CORTEX; SPEECH; ERP; MUSICIANS; POTENTIALS; PLASTICITY	Long-term rigorous musical training changes the brain structure and function, which impacts speech processing. Many studies have demonstrated that subcortical and cortical neural plasticity interact to give musicians linguistic advantages, allowing them to construct more elaborate perceptions of speech signals than non-musicians. There is ample empirical support for integrative processing at the end of a sentence. Studies have found that participants completed integrative processing of syntactic or semantic information at the end of a sentence containing an earlier syntactic or semantic violation. As speech rhythms play an important role in establishing the lexical, syntactic, and semantic representation of sentences, is it necessary for listeners to integrate rhythm at the end of sentence containing an earlier rhythm violation? Further, it remains unknown whether and (if yes) how musical training contributes to this process. The present ERP study used the rhyming judgment task to explore these questions using Chinese poems. We used 160 unfamiliar, seven-character quatrains as experimental materials, with the last syllable (that is, targets) in the second line of the quatrain either appropriate or deviating from the appropriate syllable in tone, vowel, or both. Fifty undergraduates participated in this experiment. A total of 25 were musicians (9 males, mean age 20.56) with more than 10 years of formal music training who started at 7 years old or younger. The other 25 were non-musicians (9 males, mean age 20.84) who had never received any formal music training. Both were told to listen carefully and complete a "yes" or "no" judgment task on the appropriateness of the metrical feet. The EEG was recorded using 64 electrodes placed according to the international extended 10-20 system. The continuous EEG data were segmented into epochs of -200 to 1000 ms relative to the onset of the last syllable of each quatrain. The ERPs were analyzed and compared between conditions at time windows of 100 similar to 300 ms and 300 similar to 750 ms after the onset of the last syllable. The behavioral results indicated that average accuracy rate in rhyming judgment task for musicians (83.24%, SE = 6.64%) was not significantly different from nonmusicians (82.64%, SE = 9.15%), t(48) = 0.27, p = 0.791. However, musicians responded faster when the tone was inappropriate compared to the appropriate condition, F(1, 48) = 16.88, p < 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.26. ERP results indicated that during 100-300 ms the interaction between Subject, Vowel and Tone was significant in the midline, F(1, 48) = 7.59, p = 0.008, eta(2)(p) = 0.14, and lateral areas, F(1, 48) = 7.54, p = 0.008, eta(2)(p) = 0.14. Simple effect analysis indicated that for musicians, the inappropriate vowel elicited larger positivities than the appropriate vowel when the tone was appropriate [midline: F(1, 48) = 9.84, p = 0.003, eta(2)(p) = 0.17; lateral: F(1, 48) = 15.41, p < 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.24]; the inappropriate tone elicited larger positivities than the appropriate tone when the vowel was appropriate[ midline: F(1, 48) = 3.80, p = 0.057, eta(2)(p) = 0.07; lateral: F(1, 48) = 7.27, p = 0.010, eta(2)(p) = 0.13]. Besides, the inappropriate tone elicited smaller positivities than the appropriate tone when the vowel was inappropriate[ midline: F(1, 48) = 10.68, p = 0.002, eta(2)(p) = 0.18; lateral: F(1, 48) = 7.37, p = 0.009, eta(2)(p) = 0.13]. However, for nonmusicians, no significant difference was found in this time window (ps > 0.1). During 300-750 ms, we found that the interaction between Subject, Vowel and Tone was significant in the midline, F(1, 48) = 6.66, p = 0.013, eta(2)(p) = 0.12, and lateral areas, F(1, 48) = 5.60, p = 0.022, eta(2)(p) = 0.10. Simple effect analysis indicated that for musicians, the inappropriate vowel elicited larger negativities than the appropriate vowel when the tone was inappropriate [midline: F(1, 48) = 5.14, p = 0.028, eta(2)(p) = 0.10; lateral: F(1, 48) = 2.92, p = 0.094, eta(2)(p) = 0.06], and the inappropriate tone elicited larger negativities than the appropriate tone when the vowel was inappropriate[midline: F(1, 48) = 12.94, p = 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.21; lateral: F(1, 48) = 9.65, p = 0.003, eta(2)(p) = 0.17]. However, for nonmusicians, the inappropriate vowel elicited larger negativities than the appropriate vowel when the tone was appropriate [midline: F(1, 48) = 15.07, p < 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.24; lateral: F( 1, 48) = 12.04, p = 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.20], while the inappropriate tone elicited larger negativities than the appropriate tone when the vowel was appropriate[midline: F(1, 48) = 10.88, p = 0.002, eta(2)(p) = 0.19; lateral: F(1, 48) = 8.27, p = 0.006, eta(2)(p) = 0.15]. In summary, the current study found that both musicians and non-musicians completed rhythm integrative processing at the end of sentence containing an earlier rhythm violation that was reflected by a late negative effect (during 300 similar to 750 ms). More importantly, through years of musical training, the musicians were more sensitive and faster at the integrative processing of rhythm information as reflected by an early positive component during 100 similar to 300 ms. In line with the behavioral data, the musicians developed increased sensitivity to tone variations during both early and late time windows. Taken together, both musicians and non-musicians completed the integrative processing of rhythm information at the end of quatrains, whereas the musicians were more sensitive and faster.

In dynamic auditory scenes, changes in talker settings require rapid shifts of attention, which is especially relevant when the position of a target talker switches from one location to another. Here, we explored electrophysiological correlates of shifts in spatial auditory attention, using a free-field speech perception task, in which sequences of short words (a company name, followed by a numeric value, e.g., "Bosch-6") were presented in the participants' left and right horizontal plane. Younger and older participants responded to the value of a pre-defined target company, while ignoring three simultaneously presented pairs of concurrent company names and values from different locations. All four stimulus pairs were spoken by different talkers, alternating from trial-to-trial. The location of the target company was within either the left or right hemisphere for a variable number of consecutive trials (between 3 and 42 trials) and then changed, switching from the left to the right hemispace or vice versa. Thus, when a switch occurred, the participants had to search for the new position of the target company among the concurrent streams of auditory information and re-focus their attention on the relevant location. As correlates of lateralized spatial auditory attention, the anterior contralateral N2 subcomponent (N2ac) and the posterior alpha power lateralization were analyzed in trials immediately before and after switches of the target location. Both measures were increased after switches, while only the increase in N2ac was related to better speech perception performance (i.e., a reduced post-switch decline in accuracy). While both age groups showed a similar pattern of switch-related attentional modulations, N2ac and alpha lateralization to the task-relevant stimulus (the target company's value) was overall greater in the younger, than older, group. The results suggest that N2ac and alpha lateralization reflect different attentional processes in multi-talker speech perception, the first being primarily associated with auditory search and the focusing of attention, and the second with the in-depth attentional processing of taskrelevant information. Especially the second process appears to be prone to age-related cognitive decline. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, JJ; Lu, YT; Zhang, QR; Zhang, JQ				Zhang Jijia; Lu Yutong; Zhang Qirui; Zhang Jinqiao			The effects of foreign language anxiety, nervousness and cognitive load on foreign language lying: Evidence from Chinese-English bilinguals	ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						foreign language; native language; lie; cognitive load; foreign language anxiety; nervousness	DETECTING DECEPTION; LIE DETECTION; ATTENTION; DISTANCE; MECHANISMS; SPEAKING; EMOTION; NETWORK; GENDER; BRAIN	Lying is a common social behavior. When people lie, they are affected by many factors, such as cognitive load and nervousness. Therefore, people act differently when they are lying. Similar to lying, there are also differences in cognitive load and emotions when people speak their native language or a foreign language. When people are speaking a foreign language, the cognitive load and foreign language anxiety are greater than speaking their native language, especially for those with lower proficiency. Therefore, these factors might influence or interact with lying in speaking native or foreign languages. Former studies which observed skin conductance and pupil size have found that comparing to lying in their native language, there are more lying features when people lie in a foreign language. The current study aims to explore the differences in neural mechanism between Chinese-English bilinguals lying in Chinese and English, and focuses on the effects of two specific factors: cognitive load and emotion. The study of 34 Chinese-English bilinguals adopted the misstatement paradigm. During the experiment, participants were required to describe the pictures in Chinese and English on the screen according to the "truth" or "lie" instructions. The accuracy and EEG data were collected for analysis. Two ERP components were found in the study: P200 and CNV (Contingent Negative Variation). P200 is a positive potential that appears at around 200 ms after the stimulus is presented, and is often considered related with emotional arousal. In this study, P200 was used as an indicator for early anxiety. Larger P200 indicates greater anxiety. CNV occurs around 1000 similar to 1500 ms after the emergence stimulation. Larger CNV reflects heavier cognitive load and can be an indicator of lying. By observing P200 and CNV, the results are as follow: (1) Comparing with speaking Chinese, there was a lager P200 when Chinese-English bilinguals speak English, which indicated that speaking a foreign language aroused anxiety; (2) The P200s were not significantly different when lying and telling truth in English. However, the P200s were significantly different when lying and telling truth in Chinese, which indicated that comparing with speaking the native language, the tension induced by lying is not as great as speaking a foreign language; (3) Chinese-English bilinguals showed greater CNV when lying than telling truth, which suggested that lying contained heavier cognitive load than telling truth; (4) There was a larger CNV when Chinese-English bilinguals lied in English than in Chinese, which indicated that lying in a foreign language brought heavier cognitive load; (5) The results of correlation analysis showed that English proficiency was an important variable that affected those differences when lying in both native and foreign languages. The current study suggested that both cognitive load and emotion affected lying behavior in either the native or foreign language. Lying brings heavier cognitive load than telling truth, and lying in a foreign language brings heavier cognitive load than in the native language. Moreover, people are more anxious when speaking a foreign language than their native language, no matter when they are lying or telling truth. Foreign language anxiety takes so much cognitive load that the tension caused by lying is not significant when people lie in foreign language. Further research is suggested focusing more on the contribution and interactions of the factors which have effects on the process.

J	Yang, WQ; Xiao, R; Liang, DD				Yang Wanqing; Xiao Rong; Liang Dandan			Lexical tone perception mechanism in 2- to 4-year-old Mandarin-speaking children in the pre-attention stage	ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						Mandarin-speaking children; lexical tone perception; the categories of lexical tones; size of deviant	MISMATCH RESPONSES; LANGUAGE; MATURATION; NEGATIVITY; INFANTS; RESOLUTION	Lexical tones are a key component of tonal language. The accurate perception of different Mandarin lexical tones is essential for Mandarin-speaking children to process spoken Chinese. Previous studies based on the speech perception model of nontonal language proposed perceptual narrowing theory, while later studies indicated that the perception of lexical tones might be more complicated. Event-related potentials (ERPs) are an effective tool that can investigate Mandarin-speaking children's implicit perception of lexical tones. Some studies targeting children's speech perception have demonstrated that mismatch responses (MMRs, including MMN and p-MMR) indicate the development of phonetic representation. Moreover, these studies have provided empirical evidence in this field. However, ages between 2 and 4 years old needs to be explored empirically. The current study used MMN and p-MMR as the neural correlates of lexical tone perception of Mandarin in the pre-attention stage and investigated the development of lexical tone processing mechanisms in 2- to 4-year-old children. In addition, we paid attention to the influence of category information and the size of the deviance at the acoustic level. Sixteen 2- to 4-year-old Mandarin-speaking children (7 boys and 9 girls; mean age: 3.4 years old; range: 2.6 - 3.10 years old) were recruited in this study. The study used the oddball paradigm and designed two experiments: Experiment 1 investigated the mismatch responses in across-category lexical tone perception in the participants. The stimuli consisted of three syllables: /yi1/ (T1), /yi2/ (T2), and /yi3/(T3). T3 was assigned as the standard; T1 was assigned as the large deviant; T2 was the small deviant. This experiment investigated how the deviance size affects children's perception of different lexical tones in the across-category condition. Experiment 2 investigated the mismatch responses of the participants to the perception of tones in the same category and were designated yi3a (T3a) and yi3b (T3b) within the category. These tones have the same phonological information but differ from the standard T3 stimulus in the acoustic information (based on the frequency and contour). The distances between T3a & T3 and T3b & T3 were modulated in Praat to control the distances of T1 & T3 and T2 & T3, respectively. This experiment detected the influence of the degree of similarity on the acoustic information on lexical tone perception without changing the category information. The results of the EEG data showed that (1) only the across-category large-deviance pair (T1/T3) elicited an obvious MMN response, indicating that 2- to 4-year-old Mandarin-speaking children can distinguish tones with obvious category boundaries in the pre- attention stage; (2) the across-category small-deviance pair (T2/T3) and the two kinds of within-category deviations (T3a/T3; T3b/T3) achieved the same data performance: no significant MMN or p-MMR was elicited. However, the internal mechanisms of these two conditions are different. The former may indicate that 2- to 4-year-old Mandarin-speaking children are in the period of transition from p-MMR to MMN. The latter may reflect that children have established a lexical tone category, and due to their immature perception ability, it is impossible for them to distinguish the differences among within-category lexical tones. In summary, the current study has filled the age gap in the relevant lexical tone perception neural mechanism research and has revealed what is crucial to children's lexical tone neural mechanism of perception development. Moreover, this research has identified the size difference between isometric across-category stimulation with within-category stimulation, which innovatively provides a reference for future research. The conclusion indicates that 2- to 4-year-old Mandarin-speaking children are in the period of lexical tone category formation. In the pre-attention stage, the obvious category boundary of lexical tones can be distinguished accurately. For the inconspicuous category boundaries of lexical tones, the neural mechanism is transforming from p-MMR to MMN. The magnitude of the deviance does not affect lexical tone perception within the same category.
