Predicting Dementia With Prefrontal Electroencephalography and Event-Related Potential	FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						dementia; Alzheimer&#8217; s disease; electroencephalography; electrophysiology; event-related potential; Mini-Mental Status Examination		Objective: To examine whether prefrontal electroencephalography (EEG) can be used for screening dementia. Methods: We estimated the global cognitive decline using the results of Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), measurements of brain activity from resting-state EEG, responses elicited by auditory stimulation [sensory event-related potential (ERP)], and selective attention tasks (selective-attention ERP) from 122 elderly participants (dementia, 35; control, 87). We investigated that the association between MMSE and each EEG/ERP variable by using Pearson's correlation coefficient and performing univariate linear regression analysis. Kernel density estimation was used to examine the distribution of each EEG/ERP variable in the dementia and non-dementia groups. Both Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses with the estimated odds ratios were conducted to assess the associations between the EEG/ERP variables and dementia prevalence. To develop the predictive models, five-fold cross-validation was applied to multiple classification algorithms. Results: Most prefrontal EEG/ERP variables, previously known to be associated with cognitive decline, show correlations with the MMSE score (strongest correlation has |r| = 0.68). Although variables such as the frontal asymmetry of the resting-state EEG are not well correlated with the MMSE score, they indicate risk factors for dementia. The selective-attention ERP and resting-state EEG variables outperform the MMSE scores in dementia prediction (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.891, 0.824, and 0.803, respectively). In addition, combining EEG/ERP variables and MMSE scores improves the model predictive performance, whereas adding demographic risk factors do not improve the prediction accuracy. Conclusion: Prefrontal EEG markers outperform MMSE scores in predicting dementia, and additional prediction accuracy is expected when combining them with MMSE scores. Significance: Prefrontal EEG is effective for screening dementia when used independently or in combination with MMSE.

A comparative experimental study of visual brain event-related potentials to a working memory task: virtual reality head-mounted display versus a desktop computer screen	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Virtual reality; Electroencephalography (EEG); Event-related potentials (ERPs); n-back; Cognitive workload	SPATIAL ATTENTION; N-BACK; P300; EEG; ERP; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY; BRIGHTNESS; PERCEPTION; SIZE	Virtual reality head mounted display (VR HMD) systems are increasingly utilised in combination with electroencephalography (EEG) in the experimental study of cognitive tasks. The aim of our investigation was to determine the similarities/differences between VR HMD and the computer screen (CS) in response to an n-back working memory task by comparing visual electrophysiological event-related potential (ERP) waveforms (N1/P1/P3 components). The same protocol was undertaken for VR HMD and CS with participants wearing the same EEG headcap. ERP waveforms obtained with the VR HMD environment followed a similar time course to those acquired in CS. The P3 mean and peak amplitudes obtained in VR HMD were not significantly different to those obtained in CS. In contrast, the N1 component was significantly higher in mean and peak amplitudes for the VR HMD environment compared to CS at the frontal electrodes. Significantly higher P1 mean and peak amplitudes were found at the occipital region compared to the temporal for VR HMD. Our results show that successful acquisition of ERP components to a working memory task is achievable by combining VR HMD with EEG. In addition, the higher amplitude N1/P1 components seen in VR HMD indicates the potential utility of this VR modality in the investigation of early ERPs. In conclusion, the combination of VR HMD with EEG/ERP would be a useful approach to advance the study of cognitive function in experimental brain research.

EEG and event-related potentials (ERPs) are widely used in studies investigating psychopathology and neural substrates of psychiatric diseases in children and adolescents. The present study aimed to review recent ERP studies in child and adolescent psychiatry. ERPs are non-invasive methods for studying synaptic functions in the brain. ERP might be a candidate biomarker in child-adolescent psychiatry, considering its ability to reflect cognitive and behavioral functions in humans. For the EEG study of psychiatric diseases in children and adolescents, several ERP components have been used, such as mismatch negativity, P300, error-related negativity (ERN), and reward positivity (RewP). Regarding executive functions and inhibition in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), P300 latency, and ERN were significantly different in patients with ADHD compared to those in the healthy population. ERN showed meaningful changes in patients with anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Patients with depression showed significantly attenuated RewP compared to the healthy population, which was related to the symptoms of anhedonia.

Reliability of an automated gaze-controlled paradigm for capturing neural responses during visual and face processing in toddlerhood	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOBIOLOGY			English	Article						child; electroencephalography; evoked potentials; eye-tracking technology; human development; methods; preschool	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER; SOCIAL COGNITION; CHILDREN; RECOGNITION; ERP; SPECIALIZATION; REPETITION; ASD; PERFORMANCE	Electroencephalography (EEG) has substantial potential value for examining individual differences during early development. Current challenges in developmental EEG research include high dropout rates and low trial numbers, which may in part be due to passive stimulus presentation. Comparability is challenged by idiosyncratic processing pipelines. We present a novel toolbox ("Braintools") that uses gaze-contingent stimulus presentation and an automated processing pipeline suitable for measuring visual processing through low-density EEG recordings in the field. We tested the feasibility of this toolbox in 61 2.5- to 4-year olds, and computed test-retest reliability (1- to 2-week interval) of event-related potentials (ERP) associated with visual (P1) and face processing (N290, P400). Feasibility was good, with 52 toddlers providing some EEG data at the first session. Reliability values for ERP features were moderate when derived from 20 trials; this would allow inclusion of 79% of the 61 toddlers for the P1 and 82% for the N290 and P400. P1 amplitude/latency were more reliable across sessions than for the N290 and P400. Amplitudes were generally more reliable than latencies. Automated and standardized solutions to collection and analysis of event-related EEG data would allow efficient application in large-scale global health studies, opening significant potential for examining individual differences in development.

In this paper we apply time-frequency analysis to the ERPs to investigate the sub-cognitive processes of the Stroop test. EEG data from 50 healthy participants are collected while performing the Stroop test. The test comprised of congruent and incongruent trials. Response time, response accuracy, and peak amplitudes and latencies are compared between congruent and incongruent trials. It is found that participants took significantly longer time to respond to incongruent trials than the congruent trials. It is also observed that the peak amplitudes in multiple ERPs are significantly higher in the congruent trials than incongruent trials. The time-frequency results revealed that brain oscillations in both congruent and incongruent trials increased in the higher beta range (18-30 Hz). We conclude that brain responses to stimulus are strongly correlated with higher beta band (18-30 Hz).

EEG patterns are generated through electrical activity over the human scalp, but the collected data from these sensors are quite complex due to noise and artifacts. Given the complex nature of human brain signals, emotion recognition and regulation are still challenging problems. By emphasizing and aiming to improve the human living, how could be possible to prevent emotional or behavioral disorder in children in their early age? Therefore, it is essential to investigate the children's emotions. In this study, we present a mechanism to regulate children's emotions. Over 40 subjects' EEG data were collected and performed a late-positive-potential (LPP) analysis in EEGLAB. By investigating late positive potential during emotion regulatory analysis, we find a significant difference in modulation and amplitude between control/special subjects that may help in early detection of mood disruption problems.

However, users with ALS may experience significant variations in BCI performance and event related potential (ERP) characteristics. This study investigated latency jitter and its correlates in ALS. Methods: Electroencephalographic (EEG) responses were recorded from six people with ALS and nine neurotypical controls. ERP amplitudes and latencies were extracted. Classifier-based latency estimation was used to calculate latency jitter. ERP components and latency jitter were compared between groups using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Correlations between latency jitter and each of the clinical measures, ERP features, and performance measures were investigated using Spearman and repeated measures correlations. Results: Latency jitter was significantly increased in participants with ALS and significantly negatively correlated with BCI performance in both ALS and control participants. ERP amplitudes were significantly attenuated in ALS, and significant correlations between ERP features and latency jitter were observed. There was no significant correlation between latency jitter and clinical measures. Conclusions: Latency jitter is increased in ALS and correlates with both BCI performance and ERP features. Significance: These results highlight the associations of latency jitter with BCI performance and ERP characteristics and could inform future BCI designs for people with ALS.

Recently, electroencephalography (EEG) has emerged as a tool to investigate the neurophysiological connection of ADHD and the brain. In this study, we investigated the differentiation of attention process of healthy subjects with or without ADHD symptoms under visual continuous performance test (VCPT). In our experiments, artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm achieved 98.4% classification accuracy with 0.98 sensitivity when P2 event related potential (ERP) was used. Additionally, our experimental results showed that fronto-central channels were the most contributing. Overall, we conclude that the attention process of adults with or without ADHD symptoms become a key feature to separate individuals especially in fronto-central regions under VCPT condition. In addition, using P2 ERP component under VCPT task can be a highly accurate approach to investigate EEG signal differentiation on ADHD-symptomatic adults.

Cognitive fatigue - a neural state that is associated with an increased incidence of errorful performance - is responsible for accidents on a daily basis which at times can cost human lives. To gain better insight into the neural signature of cognitive fatigue in the present study we used mEEG to examine the relationship between perceived cognitive fatigue and human-event related brain potentials (ERPs) and electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations in a sample of 1,000 people. As a secondary goal, we wanted to further demonstrate the capability of mEEG to accurately measure ERP and EEG data. To accomplish these goals, participants performed a standard visual oddball task on an Apple iPad while EEG data were recorded from a Muse EEG headband. Counter to traditional EEG studies, experimental setup and data collection was completed in less than seven minutes on average. An analysis of our EEG data revealed robust N200 and P300 ERP components and neural oscillations in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands. In line with previous findings we observed correlations between ERP components and EEG power and perceived cognitive fatigue. Further, we demonstrate here that a linear combination of ERP and EEG features is a significantly better predictor of perceived cognitive fatigue than any ERP or EEG feature on its own. In sum, our results provide validation of mEEG as a viable tool for research and provide further insight into the impact of cognitive fatigue on the human brain.

In this letter, we propose a novel Multi-Attention Convolutional Recurrent mOdel (MACRO) for EEG-based event-related potential (ERP) detection in the subject-independent scenario. Specifically, the convolutional recurrent network is designed to capture the spatial-temporal features, while the multi-attention mechanism is integrated to focus on the most discriminative channels and temporal periods of EEG signals. Comprehensive experiments conducted on a benchmark dataset for RSVP-based BCIs show that our method achieves the best performance compared with the five state-of-the-art baseline methods. This result indicates that our method is able to extract the underlying subject-invariant EEG features and generalize to unseen subjects. Finally, the ablation studies verify the effectiveness of the designed multi-attention mechanism in MACRO for EEG-based ERP detection.

Methods EEG and ERP were performed in high-risk infants at four weeks old, and GMs quality was evaluated once at 4 weeks and once at 12 weeks. The Gesell score was used to assess neurodevelopment outcome at one year old. A comparative analysis of the effects of EEG, GMs, EEG + ERP, and EEG + ERP + GMs was used to predict high-risk neonatal neurodevelopmental outcome. Results Of 71 high-risk infants at the age of one year, 3 (4.23%) had cerebral palsy, 14 (19.72%) had psychomotor retardation, and 54 (76.05%) were normal. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of EEG + ERP + GMs method were 90.00%, 95.08%, 75.00%, and 98.31%, respectively, and these indexes were the highest among the four methods (EEG, GMs, EEG + ERP, and EEG + ERP + GMs). The kappa statistic for the reliability of predicting neurodevelopmental outcome of high risk newborns by the EEG + ERP + GMs method was substantial at 0.785, while the other three methods obtained relatively low Kappa values (0.599, 0.586, and 0.712, respectively). Conclusions The combination of EEG, ERP, and GMs quality assessment can greatly improve the prediction of neurodevelopmental outcome of high-risk newborns.

We produced low- and high-MWLs using a mental arithmetic task and measured the ERP response of 14 participants. ERP trials were divided into three conditions based on the effect of HEPs on ERPs: ERPHEP, containing the heartbeat in a period of 280-700ms in ERP epochs after the target; ERPA-HEP, not including the heartbeat within the same period; and ERPT, all trials including ERPA-HEP and ERPHEP. We then compared MWL classification performance using the amplitude and latency of the P600 ERP among the three conditions. The ERPA-HEP condition achieved an accuracy of 100% using a radial basis function-support vector machine (with 10-fold cross-validation), showing an increase of 14.3 and 28.6% in accuracy compared to ERPT (85.7%) and ERPHEP (71.4%), respectively. The results suggest that evoked potentials caused by heartbeat overlapped or interfered with the ERPs and weakened the ERP response to stimuli. This study reveals the effect of the evoked potentials induced by heartbeats on the performance of the MWL classification based on ERPs.</p>	[Park, Sangin; Ha, Jihyeon; Kim, Laehyun] Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Ctr Bion, Seoul, South Korea; [Ha, Jihyeon] Hanyang Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Laehyun] Hanyang Univ, Dept HY KIST Bioconvergence, Seoul, South Korea		Kim, L (corresponding author), Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Ctr Bion, Seoul, South Korea.; Kim, L (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Dept HY KIST Bioconvergence, Seoul, South Korea.	laehyunk@kist.re.kr			Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) - Korean Government (MSIT) [2017-0-00432]	Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) - Korean Government (MSIT)	This work was partly supported by the Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korean Government (MSIT) (No. 2017-0-00432), for the development of a non-invasive integrated BCI SW platform to control home appliances and external devices by users thoughts via AR/VR interface.		60	0	0	2	5	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND	1664-042X			FRONT PHYSIOL	Front.

Reward Responsiveness in Suicide Attempters: An Electroencephalography/Event-Related Potential Study	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY-COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE AND NEUROIMAGING			English	Article							RISK-FACTORS; NEUROSCIENCE; BEHAVIORS; INTERVIEW; ANHEDONIA; THOUGHTS; CHILDREN	BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to objectively examine the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) subconstructs of reward anticipation and initial response to reward in adult suicide attempters, compared with nonattempters, using electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) within the context of the RDoC- recommended experimental paradigms for these subconstructs. METHODS: Participants had either a history of at least 1 suicide attempt (n = 30) or no history of attempting suicide (n = 30). They completed diagnostic interviews, self-report questionnaires, and 2 computer-based tasks-the monetary incentive delay task and the doors task-during which continuous EEG was recorded. Temporospatial principal component analysis was used to isolate each of the ERP components of interest from other temporally or spatially overlapping components. Exploratory time-frequency analyses were also conducted to supplement the ERP analyses. RESULTS: Suicide attempters, compared with nonattempters, exhibited specific deficits in reward anticipation (i.e., blunted cue-P3 ERP during the monetary incentive delay task) and in initial response to reward (i.e., reduced feedback-related delta power in the gain condition of the doors task). These results were at least partially independent of current symptoms or diagnoses of depression and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: These findings constitute an important step in obtaining a more fine-grained understanding of the specific reward-related abnormalities that might contribute to suicide risk.

Understanding the causes and consequences of variability in infant ERP editing practices	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOBIOLOGY			English	Article						artifact rejection; data editing; ERP methodology; infant EEG; infant event-related potential	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RELIABILITY; ATTENTION; ARTIFACTS	The current study examined the effects of variability on infant event-related potential (ERP) data editing methods. A widespread approach for analyzing infant ERPs is through a trial-by-trial editing process. Researchers identify electroencephalogram (EEG) channels containing artifacts and reject trials that are judged to contain excessive noise. This process can be performed manually by experienced researchers, partially automated by specialized software, or completely automated using an artifact-detection algorithm. Here, we compared the editing process from four different editors-three human experts and an automated algorithm-on the final ERP from an existing infant EEG dataset. Findings reveal that agreement between editors was low, for both the numbers of included trials and of interpolated channels. Critically, variability resulted in differences in the final ERP morphology and in the statistical results of the target ERP that each editor obtained. We also analyzed sources of disagreement by estimating the EEG characteristics that each human editor considered for accepting an ERP trial. In sum, our study reveals significant variability in ERP data editing pipelines, which has important consequences for the final ERP results. These findings represent an important step toward developing best practices for ERP editing methods in infancy research.

J	Zang, BY; Lin, YF; Liu, ZW; Gao, XR				Zang, Boyu; Lin, Yanfei; Liu, Zhiwen; Gao, Xiaorong			A deep learning method for single-trial EEG classification in RSVP task based on spatiotemporal features of ERPs	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; event-related potential; RSVP; convolutional neural network; deep learning	NEURAL-NETWORKS	Objective. Single-trial electroencephalography (EEG) classification is of great importance in the rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), as one of the mainstream deep learning methods, have been proven to be effective in extracting RSVP EEG features. However, most existing CNN models for EEG classification do not consider the phase-locked characteristic of event-related potential (ERP) components very well in the architecture design. Here, we propose a novel CNN model to make better use of the phase-locked characteristic to extract spatiotemporal features for single-trial RSVP EEG classification. Based on the phase-locked characteristic, the spatial distributions of the main ERP component in different periods can be learned separately. Approach. In this work, we propose a novel CNN model to achieve superior performance on single-trial RSVP EEG classification. We introduce the combination of the standard convolutional layer, the permute layer and the depthwise convolutional layer to separately operate the spatial convolution in different periods, which more fully utilizes the phase-locked characteristic of ERPs for classification. We compare our model with several traditional and deep-learning methods in the classification performance. Moreover, we use spatial topography and saliency map to visually analyze the ERP features extracted by our model. Main results. The results show that our model obtains better classification performance than those of reference methods. The spatial topographies of each subject exhibit the typical ERP spatial distribution in different time periods. And the saliency map of each subject illustrates the discriminant electrodes and the meaningful temporal features. Significance. Our model is designed with better consideration of the phase-locked ERP characteristic and reaches excellent performance on single-trial RSVP EEG classification.

J	Ozkara, BY; Bagozzi, R				Ozkara, Behcet Yalin; Bagozzi, Richard			The use of event related potentials brain methods in the study of Conscious and unconscious consumer decision making processes	JOURNAL OF RETAILING AND CONSUMER SERVICES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Symposium on National Brands and Private Labels in Retailing (NB and PL)	JUN 24-26, 2014	Univ Oberta Catalunya, Barcelona, SPAIN	Ramon Areces Fdn, Univ Oberta Catalunya	Univ Oberta Catalunya	Consumer purchase behavior; Event-related potentials; Electroencephalography; Conscious and unconscious; Mental processes	PREDECISIONAL DISTORTION; ONLINE; PRODUCT; INFORMATION; ATTENTION; PURCHASE; AROUSAL; MEMORY; IMPACT; EEG	The question of whether consumer purchasing decisions are conscious choices or unconscious has long been studied in marketing. The ability to measure mental changes with high temporal resolution makes the EEG-based event-related potentials (ERP) method very useful in studying the distinction between consciousness and unconsciousness. Although experiences with brands significantly affect the awareness or unconsciousness of decisions to purchase, ERP studies have ignored experiences of consumers in relation to brand purchases. For this purpose, EEG recordings of participants were taken in the order they saw brand names: experienced brands, review-based brands, and unknown brands. Participants chose one of the three options for the brands they saw on the screen: buying, not buying, and no idea. 35 people participated in the study. The results indicate that early ERPs, which are unconscious mental reactions, related to purchase decisions for previously unknown brands. Late ERPs associated with conscious mental reactions are related to purchasing review-based brands or experienced brands. We conclude that purchasing decisions about unknown brands occur as a result of automatic, unconscious mental processes, whereas purchasing decisions about previously experienced brands and based on consumer reviews result from conscious mental processes. Our study is the first that demonstrates the relationship between ERP's and purchasing decisions, with an experimental design focused on consumer experience and consciousness.

In order to understand the neurophysiological activity during risky behavior and its relationship with other dimensions of impulsivity, we have acquired event-related-potential (ERP) data and self-reported impulsivity scores from 17 non-clinical volunteers. They underwent high-resolution electroencephalography (HR-EEG) combined with an adapted version of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), and completed the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-10) and the Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance, Sensation Seeking, Impulsive Behavior Scale (UPPS). The ERP components were sensitive to valence (FRN, P300) and risk/reward magnitude (SPN, RewP). Our main finding evidenced a positive correlation between the amplitude of the P300 component following positive feedback and both the global UPPS score and the (lack of) perseverance UPPS subscale, significant for several adjacent electrodes. This finding might suggest an adaptive form of impulsive behavior, which could be associated to the reduction on the difference of the P300 amplitude following negative and positive feedback. However, further investigation with both larger clinical and non-clinical samples is required.

Characterizing multi-word speech production using event-related potentials	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						error&#8208; related negativity; event&#8208; related potentials; Laplacian transformation; multi&#8208; word production; tongue twisters		Event-related potentials (ERPs) derived from electroencephalography (EEG) have proven useful for understanding linguistic processes during language perception and production. Words are commonly produced in sequences, yet most ERP studies have used single-word experimental designs. Single-word designs reduce potential ERP overlap in word sequence production. However, word sequence production engages brain mechanisms in different ways than single word production. In particular, speech monitoring and planning mechanisms are more engaged than for single words since several words must be produced in a short period of time. This study evaluates the feasibility of recording ERP components in the context of word sequence production, and whether separate components could be isolated for each word. Scalp EEG data were acquired, while participants recited word sequences from memory at a regular pace, using a tongue-twister paradigm. The results revealed fronto-central error-related negativity, previously associated with speech monitoring, which could be distinguished for each word. Its peak amplitude was sensitive to Cycle and Phonological Similarity. However, an effect of sequential production was also observable on baseline measures, indicating baseline shifts throughout the word sequence due to concurrent sustained medial-frontal EEG activity. We also report a late left anterior negativity (LLAN), associated with verbal response planning and execution, onsetting around 100 ms before the first word in each cycle and sustained throughout the rest of the cycle. This work underlines the importance of considering the contribution of transient and sustained EEG activity on ERPs, and provides evidence that ERPs can be used to study sequential word production.

Alpha coherence is an electroencephalography (EEG) rhythm that regulates functional connectivity between different brain regions. However, the relationships between resting-state alpha coherence and N2/P3 components associated with response inhibition and cognitive processes have not been investigated in addictive disorders. The present study investigated the relationships between alpha coherence during the resting state and N2/P3 components of event-related potentials during the Go/Nogo task in healthy controls (HCs) and patients with Internet gaming disorder (IGD). A total of 64 young adults (HC: n = 31; IGD: n = 33) participated in this study. Alpha coherence values at left fronto-central and bilateral centro-temporal electrode sites were significantly correlated with P3 latency in HCs, whereas inverse correlations were observed in patients with IGD. Furthermore, significant differences were observed in the correlation values between the groups. Our results suggest that patients with IGD lack dynamic interactions of functional connectivity between the fronto-centro-temporal regions during the resting state and the event-related potential (ERP) index during cognitive tasks. The findings of this study may have important implications for understanding the neurophysiological mechanisms linking resting-state EEG and task-related ERPs underlying IGD.

However, the episodic retrieval pattern detected by functional MRI (fMRI) appears preserved in aMCI subjects. To address this discrepancy, simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG)-fMRI recording was employed to determine whether temporal dynamics of brain episodic retrieval activity were disturbed in patients with aMCI. Twenty-six aMCI and 29 healthy control (HC) subjects completed a word-list memory retrieval task during simultaneous EEG-fMRI. The retrieval success activation pattern was detected with fMRI analysis, and the familiarity- and recollection-related components of episodic retrieval activity were identified using event-related potential (ERP) analysis. The fMRI-constrained ERP analysis explored the temporal dynamics of brain activity in the retrieval success pattern, and the ERP-informed fMRI analysis detected fMRI correlates of the ERP components related to familiarity and recollection processes. The two groups exhibited similar retrieval success patterns in the bilateral posteromedial parietal cortex, the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and the left lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC). The fMRI-constrained ERP analysis showed that the aMCI group did not exhibit old/ new effects in the IPL and LPFC that were observed in the HC group. In addition, the aMCI group showed disturbed fMRI correlate of ERP recollection component that was associated with inferior EM performance. Therefore, in this study, we identified disturbed temporal dynamics in episodic retrieval activity with a preserved spatial activity pattern in aMCI. Taken together, the simultaneous EEG-fMRI technique demonstrated the potential to identify individuals with a high risk of cognitive deterioration.

Three ERP components (P100, N170, N250) and spectral power in the mu range were extracted, corresponding to cognitive stages of face processing: low-level vision processing, structural encoding, higher-order processing, and action understanding. Youth and adults exhibited similar yet distinct patterns of hierarchical temporal dynamics such that earlier cognitive stages predicted later stages, directly and indirectly. However, latent factors indicated unique profiles related to behavioral performance for adults and youth and age as a continuous factor. The application of path analysis to electrophysiological data can yield novel insights into the cortical dynamics of social information processing.

ERP is important in cognitive neuroscience and has been applied to brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, because ERP signals collected on the scalp are weak, mixed with spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, and their temporal and spatial features are complex, accurate ERP detection is challenging. Compared to traditional neural networks, the capsule network (CapsNet) replaces scalar-output neurons with vector-output capsules, allowing the various input information to be well preserved in the capsules. In this study, we expect to utilize CapsNet to extract the discriminative spatial-temporal features of ERP and encode them in capsules to reduce the loss of valuable information, thereby improving the ERP detection performance for BCI. Therefore, we propose ERP-CapsNet to perform ERP detection in a BCI speller application. The experimental results on BCI Competition datasets and the Akimpech dataset show that ERP-CapsNet achieves better classification performances than do the state-of-the-art techniques. We also use a decoder to investigate the attributes of ERPs encoded in capsules. The results show that ERP-CapsNet relies on the P300 and P100 components to detect ERP. Therefore, ERP-CapsNet not only acts as an outstanding method for ERP detection, but also provides useful insights into the ERP detection mechanism.

ERP CORE: An open resource for human event-related potential research	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Event-related potentials; EEG; Data quality; Open science; Reproducibility	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; FLANKER TASK; EEG; SCHIZOPHRENIA; COMPONENT; SPEED	Event-related potentials (ERPs) are noninvasive measures of human brain activity that index a range of sensory, cognitive, affective, and motor processes. Despite their broad application across basic and clinical research, there is little standardization of ERP paradigms and analysis protocols across studies. To address this, we created ERP CORE (Compendium of Open Resources and Experiments), a set of optimized paradigms, experiment control scripts, data processing pipelines, and sample data (N = 40 neurotypical young adults) for seven widely used ERP components: N170, mismatch negativity (MMN), N2pc, N400, P3, lateralized readiness potential (LRP), and error-related negativity (ERN). This resource makes it possible for researchers to 1) employ standardized ERP paradigms in their research, 2) apply carefully designed analysis pipelines and use a priori selected parameters for data processing, 3) rigorously assess the quality of their data, and 4) test new analytic techniques with standardized data from a wide range of paradigms.

However, objective criteria as Electroencephalography (EEG) features would be helpful in detecting depressive states at early stages to prevent the worsening of the symptoms. Scientific community has widely investigated the effectiveness of EEG-based measures to discriminate between depressed and healthy subjects, with the aim to better understand the mechanisms behind the disorder and find biomarkers useful for diagnosis. This work offers a comprehensive review of the extant literature concerning the EEG-based biomarkers for MDD and its subtypes, and identify possible future directions for this line of research. Scopus, PubMed and Web of Science databases were researched following PRISMA's guidelines. The initial papers' screening was based on titles and abstracts; then full texts of the identified articles were examined, and a synthesis of findings was developed using tables and thematic analysis. After screening 1871 articles, 76 studies were identified as relevant and included in the systematic review. Reviewed markers include EEG frequency bands power, EEG asymmetry, ERP components, non-linear and functional connectivity measures. Results were discussed in relations to the different EEG measures assessed in the studies. Findings confirmed the effectiveness of those measures in discriminating between healthy and depressed subjects. However, the review highlights that the causal link between EEG measures and depressive subtypes needs to be further investigated and points out that some methodological issues need to be solved to enhance future research in this field.

At the same time, along with such a growing interest in studying bilingual populations, psycholinguistics as a discipline has been rapidly developing owing to the more and more widespread use of physiological research methods. Particularly, electroencephalography (EEG) has received much scholarly attention, as it can elucidate the exact time course of language processing. The present contribution explores current trends in EEG research on bilingual language processing and discusses how event-related potential (ERP) studies and their findings have been extended from the monolingual to the bilingual context. To this end, the paper discusses selected ERP experiments into language co-activation across different modalities, bilingual executive control, electrophysiological correlates of new meaning construction, neural changes accompanying foreign language learning, and the automaticity of emotional responding in bilingual speakers.

J	Borra, D; Magosso, E				Borra, Davide; Magosso, Elisa			Deep learning-based EEG analysis: investigating P3 ERP components	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Electroencephalography; P3a; P3b; Convolutional neural networks; Decision ex-planation	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EVOKED-RESPONSES; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ATTENTION	The neural processing of incoming stimuli can be analysed from the electroencephalogram (EEG) through event-related potentials (ERPs). The P3 component is largely investigated as it represents an important psychophysiological marker of psychiatric disorders. This is composed by several subcomponents, such as P3a and P3b, reflecting distinct but interrelated sensory and cognitive processes of incoming stimuli. Due to the low EEG signal-to-noise-ratio, ERPs emerge only after an averaging procedure across trials and subjects. Thus, this canonical ERP analysis lacks in the ability to highlight EEG neural signatures at the level of single-subject and single-trial. In this study, a deep learning-based workflow is investigated to enhance EEG neural signatures related to P3 subcomponents already at single-subject and at single-trial level. This was based on the combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) with an explanation technique (ET). The CNN was trained using two different strategies to produce saliency representations enhancing signatures shared across subjects or more specific for each subject and trial. Cross-subject saliency representations matched the signatures already emerging from ERPs, i.e., P3a and P3b-related activity within 350-400 ms (frontal sites) and 400-650 ms (parietal sites) post stimulus, validating the CNN+ET respect to canonical ERP analysis. Single-subject and single-trial saliency representations enhanced P3 signatures already at the single-trial scale, while EEG-derived representations at single-subject and single-trial level provided no or only mildly evident signatures. Empowering the analysis of P3 modulations at single-subject and at single-trial level, CNN+ET could be useful to provide insights about neural processes linking sensory stimulation, cognition and behaviour.

Event Related Potential Signal Capture Can Be Enhanced through Dynamic SNR-Weighted Channel Pooling	SENSORS			English	Article						EEG; ERP; neural signal processing; signal augmentation; signal to noise ratio; channel pooling	BRAIN POTENTIALS; CONSCIOUSNESS; DISORDERS; STATE; NOISE; N400	Background: Electroencephalography (EEG)-derived event-related potentials (ERPs) provide information about a variety of brain functions, but often suffer from low inherent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To overcome the low SNR, techniques that pool data from multiple sensors have been applied. However, such pooling implicitly assumes that the SNR among sensors is equal, which is not necessarily valid. This study presents a novel approach for signal pooling that accounts for differential SNR among sensors. Methods: The new technique involves pooling together signals from multiple EEG channels weighted by their respective SNRs relative to the overall SNR of all channels. We compared ERP responses derived using this new technique with those derived using both individual channels as well as traditional averaged-based channel pooling. The outcomes were evaluated in both simulated data and real data from healthy adult volunteers (n = 37). Responses corresponding to a range of ERP components indexing auditory sensation (N100), attention (P300) and language processing (N400) were evaluated. Results: Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to traditional pooling technique, the new SNR-weighted channel pooling technique improved ERP response effect size in cases of unequal noise among channels (p's < 0.001). Similarly, results from real-world experimental data showed that the new technique resulted in significantly greater ERP effect sizes compared to either traditional pooling or individual channel approach for all three ERP components (p's < 0.001). Furthermore, the new channel pooling approach also resulted in larger ERP signal amplitudes as well as greater differences among experimental conditions (p's < 0.001). Conclusion: These results suggest that the new technique improves the capture of ERP responses relative to traditional techniques. As such, SNR-weighted channel pooling can further enable widespread applications of ERP techniques, especially those that require rapid assessments in noisy out-of-laboratory environments.

A Systematic Review of Electrophysiological Findings in Binge-Purge Eating Disorders: A Window Into Brain Dynamics	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review						EEG; binge eating; neurophysiology; bulimia nervosa; electroneurophysiology; ERP; frequency analysis	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ANOREXIA-NERVOSA; ATTENTIONAL BIAS; BULIMIA-NERVOSA; FOOD; STIMULI; OVERWEIGHT; WEIGHT; TIME; CUES	Binge-purge eating disorders (BP-ED), such as bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder, may share some neurobiological features. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive measurement modality that may aid in research and diagnosis of BP-ED. We conducted a systematic review of the literature on EEG findings in BP-ED, seeking to summarize and analyze the current evidence, as well as identify shortcomings and gaps to inform new perspectives for future studies. Following PRISMA Statement recommendations, the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched using terms related to "electroencephalography" and "binge-purge" eating disorders. Of 555 articles retrieved, 15 met predefined inclusion criteria and were included for full-text analysis. Eleven studies investigated EEG by means of event-related potentials (ERP) in BP-ED individuals: 7 using eating disorder-related stimuli (i.e., food, body image) and 4 using non-eating disorder-related stimuli (i.e., facial expressions or auditory clicks). These studies found significant differences in the N200, P200, P300, and LPP components in BP-ED participants compared to controls, indicating that this population exhibits impairments in selective attention, attentional allocation/processing, and allocation of motivational or emotion-based attention. Five studies investigated EEG using frequency analysis; reporting significant differences in beta activity in fronto-temporal and occipito-temporo-parietal areas in BP-ED individuals compared to controls, revealing a dysfunctional brain network. However, the small number of studies, the heterogeneity of samples, study paradigms, stimulus types, and the lack of an adequate assessment of neuropsychological parameters are some limitations of the current literature. Although some EEG data are promising and consistent with neuroimaging and neuropsychological findings in individuals with BP-ED, future studies need to overcome current methodological shortcomings.

Development and Evaluation of a Smartphone-Based Electroencephalography (EEG) System	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Integrated circuits; Electrodes; Wireless fidelity; Microcontrollers; Legged locomotion; Standards; Alpha waves; Bland-Altman; EEG; ERP; P300; smartphone	ELECTRODE IMPEDANCE; MOBILE EEG; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; AGREEMENT; WALKING; BLAND; POWER; STANDARDS; SIGNALS	The aim of the study was to design, develop and evaluate a general-purpose EEG platform which integrates with a smartphone. The target specification was a system with 19 EEG channels and data stored onto the smartphone via a Wi-Fi connection. The hardware was developed using three ADS1299 integrated circuits, and the game engine, Unity, was used to develop the smartphone app. An evaluation of the system was conducted using recordings of alpha waves during periods of eye closure in participants (Bland-Altman statistical comparison with a clinical grade EEG system). The smartphone was also used to deliver time-locked auditory stimuli using an oddball paradigm to evaluate the ability of the developed system to acquire event related potentials (ERP) during sitting and walking. No significant differences were found for the alpha wave peak amplitude, frequency and area under the curve for the intra-system (two consecutive periods of alpha waves) or inter-system (developed smartphone-based EEG system versus FDA-approved system) comparisons. ERP results showed the peak amplitude of the auditory P300 component to deviant tones was significantly higher when compared to standard tones for sitting and walking activities. It is envisaged that our general-purpose EEG system will encourage other researchers to design and build their own specific versions rather than being limited by the fixed features of commercial products.

J	Maciejewska, K; Froelich, W				Maciejewska, Karina; Froelich, Wojciech			Hierarchical Classification of Event-Related Potentials for the Recognition of Gender Differences in the Attention Task	ENTROPY			English	Article						gender identification; event related potentials; ERP signal classification; data mining	P300; TOPOGRAPHY; SEX; AGE; P3B	Research on the functioning of human cognition has been a crucial problem studied for years. Electroencephalography (EEG) classification methods may serve as a precious tool for understanding the temporal dynamics of human brain activity, and the purpose of such an approach is to increase the statistical power of the differences between conditions that are too weak to be detected using standard EEG methods. Following that line of research, in this paper, we focus on recognizing gender differences in the functioning of the human brain in the attention task. For that purpose, we gathered, analyzed, and finally classified event-related potentials (ERPs). We propose a hierarchical approach, in which the electrophysiological signal preprocessing is combined with the classification method, enriched with a segmentation step, which creates a full line of electrophysiological signal classification during an attention task. This approach allowed us to detect differences between men and women in the P3 waveform, an ERP component related to attention, which were not observed using standard ERP analysis. The results provide evidence for the high effectiveness of the proposed method, which outperformed a traditional statistical analysis approach. This is a step towards understanding neuronal differences between men's and women's brains during cognition, aiming to reduce the misdiagnosis and adverse side effects in underrepresented women groups in health and biomedical research.

We focus on the so-called P300-BCI, a stable and accurate BCI paradigm relying on the recognition of a positive event-related potential (ERP) occurring in the EEG about 300 ms poststimulation. We implemented a basic version of such a BCI displayed on an ordinary and affordable smartphone-based head-mounted VR device, that is, a mobile and passive VR system (with no electronic components beyond the smartphone). The mobile phone performed the stimuli presentation, EEG synchronization (tagging), and feedback display. We compared the ERPs and the accuracy of the BCI on the VR device with a traditional BCI running on a personal computer (PC). We also evaluated the impact of subjective factors on the accuracy. The study was within-subjects, with 21 participants and one session in each modality. No significant difference in BCI accuracy was found between the PC and VR systems, although the P200 ERP was significantly wider and larger in the VR system as compared with the PC system.

Memory specificity is linked to repetition effects in event-related potentials across the lifespan	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Episodic memory; Memory specificity; Repetition suppression; Lifespan development; Event-related potentials (ERP); Electroencephalography (EEG)	MNEMONIC SIMILARITY TASK; AGE-RELATED DEFICITS; FALSE-MEMORY; RECOGNITION MEMORY; EPISODIC MEMORY; YOUNG-CHILDREN; TERM-MEMORY; ERP; BRAIN; EEG	The specificity with which past experiences can be remembered varies across the lifespan, possibly due to differences in how precisely information is encoded. Memory formation can be investigated through repetition effects, the common finding that neural activity is altered when stimuli are repeated. However, whether differences in this indirect measure of memory formation relate to lifespan differences in memory specificity has not yet been established. In the present study, we examined repetition effects in event-related potentials and their relation to recognition. During incidental encoding, children (aged 7?9 years), young adults (18?30 years), and older adults (65?76 years) viewed repeated object images from different categories. During subsequent recognition, we distinguished memory for the specific items versus the general categories. We identified repetition suppression in all age groups, and repetition enhancement for adults. Furthermore, individual item recognition performance comprising lure discrimination was positively associated with the magnitude of the neural repetition effects, which did not differ between groups, indicating common neural mechanisms of memory formation. Our findings demonstrate that neural repetition effects reflect the formation of highly specific memory representations and highlight their significance as a neural indicator of individual differences in episodic memory encoding across the lifespan.

Research has shown that the behavioral aspects of living species are significantly affected by type of illumination, level of intensity and Correlated Colour Temperature (CCT). Continuous Electroencephalograph (EEG) is electrical activity of brain and it is a complex signal, detected with the help of several electrodes on scalp. EEG data consists of low frequency signals and main five different rhythmus - delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. Stimulus brain activity is the Event Related Potential (ERP). EEG and ERP arc the main tools to study the role of brain in different activities. Present study examines the effect of intensity of light and CCT of a LED source on the subject with the help of EEGLAB a software tool available for MATLAB toolbox. The signal processing is carried out for time-frequency analysis and independent component analysis (ICA). Experiments are conducted on five different subjects in age group from 25 to 50 years. EEG measurements are carried out in dark scene, and in an enlightened scene with the help of NeXus-10 physiological monitoring system. It is observed that event related potential rises and shows a peculiar pattern when light intensity and CCT change. Subjective response shows that cool white light and neutral white light are more comfortable. Alertness is more in warm white light.	[Yawale, P.

BCI paradigms based on visual stimulation are prevalent and highly efficient but fail once vision or gaze control are impaired. We present a single-case study of a potential end-user who operated a potentially vision independent, vibrotactile BCI. The participant in the locked-in state (LIS) trained with the BCI on a weekly basis for several months in his own home. The tactile BCI offered four movement commands which had to be selected either according to an on-screen instruction, or to navigate a virtual wheelchair through an apartment. Average accuracies of up to 67.7 % were achieved. A P300 event-related potential (ERP) was consistently observed in every session, but no training effects could be demonstrated. Finally, analysis revealed a relatively high subjective workload of the paradigm.

Here, we aimed to review the studies that have investigated this phenomenon by means of neurophysiological techniques. Methods The MEDLINE, accessed by Pubmed and EMBASE electronic databases, was searched using the medical subject headings: "Rubber hand illusion" AND "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)" OR "Evoked potentials (EP)" OR "Event related potentials (ERP)" OR "Electroencephalography (EEG)". Results Transcranial magnetic stimulation studies revealed a significant excitability drop in primary motor cortex hand circuits accompanying the disembodiment of the real hand during the RHI experience and that the perceived ownership over the rubber hand is associated with normal parietal-motor communication. Moreover, TMS provided causal evidence that the extrastriate body area is involved in the RHI and subsequently in body representation, while neuromodulation of ventral premotor area and the inferior parietal lobe did not result in an enhancement of embodiment. EP and ERP studies suggest that pre-existing body representations may affect larger stages of tactile processing and support predictive coding models of the functional architecture of multisensory integration in bodily perceptual experience. High-frequency oscillations on EEG play a role in the integrative processing of stimuli across modalities, and EEG activity in gamma band activity in the parietal area reflects the visuotactile integration process. EEG studies also revealed that RHI is associated with the neural circuits underlying motor control and that premotor areas play a crucial role in mediating illusory body ownership. Conclusion Neurophysiological studies shed new light on our understanding of the different aspects that contribute to the formation of a coherent self-awareness in humans.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is the most common method used in brain imaging to study neurological disorders. Diagnosis of neurological disorders such as ALS, Parkinson's, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is important in biomedical studies. In recent years, deep learning (DL) models have been started to be applied in the literature for the diagnosis of these diseases. In this study, event-related potentials (ERPs) were obtained from EEG signals obtained as a result of visual stimuli from ALS patients and healthy controls. As a new method, variational mode decomposition (VMD) is applied to the produced ERP signals and the signals are decomposed into subbands. In addition, empirical mode decomposition (EMD), one of the popular decomposition methods in the literature, was also analyzed, and ERP signals were divided into subbands and compared with the VMD method. Subband signals were classified in two stages with the one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) model, which is one of the DL techniques proposed in the study. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-Score measurements were obtained using 5-and 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate classifier performance. In the first stage of classification, only VMD and EMD subband signals were used and 92.95% classification accuracy was obtained by the VMD method. In the second stage, VMD, EMD subband signals, and original ERP signals were all classified together with the VMD+ERP model achieving the maximum classification accuracy rate of 90.42%. It is thought that the results of the study will contribute to the diagnosis of similar neurological disorders such as ALS, attention studies based on visual stimuli, and the development of brain-computer interface (BCI) systems using the method applied to the proposed ERP signals.

Neurophysiological Markers of Internet Gaming Disorder: A Literature Review of Electroencephalography Studies	CUREUS			English	Review						electroencephalography (eeg); internet gaming disorder (igd); biomarkers; event-related potential (erp); treatment; gaming disorder(gd)		Pathological online gaming is a relatively newer psychiatric disorder. It is the second behavioral addiction (after internet gambling disorder) included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM), 5th edition as "Internet Gaming Disorder" (IGD). Recent research is showing high morbidity associated with IGD, thus encouraging researchers to find valid and reliable biomarkers of IGD. So that, early diagnosis and proper treatment could limit the high disability level accompanying excessive online gaming. As electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive and relatively easily available diagnostic technique, we aimed at collecting EEG studies that investigated EEG changes associated with IGD, with a specific focus on finding diagnostic and predictive neurophysiological biomarkers of IGD. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for EEG studies of IGD. We eliminated those EEG studies that were not focused on finding biomarkers. Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) is followed in the writing of this review article. Our results showed that increased slow-wave resting-state activity and reduced P300 and N100 can serve as useful IGD diagnostic markers of IGD. Moreover, increased resting-state theta activity can be a predictive biomarker of IGD. Lastly, increased late low potentials (LLPs) can be specific trait markers of cue-induced cravings in IGD.

Studies attempting to find physiological correlates of sense presence using electroencephalography (EEG) have reported mixed results. In the present study, we used brain event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by auditory stimuli to identify an objective physiological index of sense of presence during VR, attempting to replicate the findings of previous studies and explain the heterogeneity of results reported in the literature. Participants in our experiment were asked to experience an immersive virtual environment using a modern head-mounted display while passively hearing task-irrelevant frequent standard and infrequent deviant tones as in a classic auditory oddball paradigm. Subsequently, they were asked to complete a battery of questionnaires aimed to estimate their sense of presence during the VR. EEG and questionnaire data from three-seventh participants were analyzed. ERP components evoked by the auditory stimuli were then analyzed. Late ERP components (after 450 ms from stimulus onset) registered over central brain areas were associated with the sense of presence as measured with questionnaires, while earlier components were not associated with presence. The use of different questionnaires and the content of the VR environment may both be a plausible explanation for heterogeneous results as reported in previous studies. The present study showed that late ERP components recorded over the central brain may represent good electrophysiological correlates of the subjective sense of presence.

DelIrium VULnerability in GEriatrics (DIVULGE) study: a protocol for a prospective observational study of electroencephalogram associations with incident postoperative delirium	BMJ NEUROLOGY OPEN			English	Article						event-related potentials; cognitive electrophysiology; EEG; geriatrics; neurophysiology	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; HIGH-RISK; NETWORK; BRAIN; EEG; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; HYPOTHESIS	Introduction Delirium is a neurocognitive disorder common in older adults in acute care settings. Those who develop delirium are at an increased risk of dementia, cognitive decline and death. Electroencephalography (EEG) during delirium in older adults is characterised by slowing and reduced functional connectivity, but markers of vulnerability are poorly described. We aim to identify EEG spectral power and event-related potential (ERP) markers of incident delirium in older adults to understand neural mechanisms of delirium vulnerability. Characterising delirium vulnerability will provide substantial theoretical advances and outcomes have the potential to be translated into delirium risk assessment tools. Methods and analysis We will record EEG in 90 participants over 65 years of age prior to elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We will record 4-minutes of resting state (eyes open and eyes closed) and a 5-minute frequency auditory oddball paradigm. Outcome measures will include frequency band power, 1/f offset and slope, and ERP amplitude measures. Participants will undergo cognitive and EEG testing before their elective procedures and daily postoperative delirium assessments. Group allocation will be done retrospectively by linking preoperative EEG data according to postoperative delirium status (presence, severity, duration and subtype). Ethics and dissemination This study is approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Royal Adelaide Hospital, Central Adelaide Local Health Network and the University of South Australia Human Ethics Committee. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal articles and presentations at national and international conferences.	[Boord, Monique S.; Coussens, Scott W.; Keage, Hannah A.

In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using such a system in a visual perception scenario. We investigate the complexity perception of color natural and synthetic fractal texture images, by studying the correlations between four types of data: image complexity that is expressed by computed color entropy and color fractal dimension, human subjective evaluation by scoring, and the measured brain EEG responses via Event-Related Potentials. We report on the considerable correlation experimentally observed between the recorded EEG signals and image complexity while considering three complexity levels, as well on the use of an EEG wireless system with few channels for practical applications, with the corresponding electrodes placement in accordance with the type of neural activity recorded.

By combining high spatial and temporal resolution, intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) might contribute to filling this gap. Four drug-resistant epileptic patients with intracranial electrodes in the insula were instructed to watch and rate pictures with sexual content and neutral pictures. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were computed separately for both types of stimuli. Ninety-three percent of the anterior insula (AI) and 85% of the posterior insula (PI) contacts showed differences between ERPs. Al-positive deflections tended to have an earlier onset than PI-positive deflections. The results suggest that the AI generates a P300-like response and contributes to the early phase of the late positive potential, both components found enhanced while viewing emotional stimuli in the ERP literature. The present findings are interpreted as congruent with the role of the Al in maintaining attention to salient stimuli.

It's all about time: precision and accuracy of Emotiv event-marking for ERP research	PEERJ			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Emotiv; EPOC; Flex; Jitter; Timing; Accuracy; Trigger		Background: The use of consumer-grade electroencephalography (EEG) systems for research purposes has become more prevalent. In event-related potential (ERP) research, it is critical that these systems have precise and accurate timing. The aim of the current study was to investigate the timing reliability of event-marking solutions used with Emotiv commercial EEG systems. Method: We conducted three experiments. In Experiment 1 we established a jitter threshold (i.e. the point at which jitter made an event-marking method unreliable). To do this, we introduced statistical noise to the temporal position of event-marks of a pre-existing ERP dataset (recorded with a research-grade system, Neuroscan SynAmps(2) at 1,000 Hz using parallel-port event-marking) and calculated the level at which the waveform peaks differed statistically from the original waveform. In Experiment 2 we established a method to identify 'true' events (i.e. when an event should appear in the EEG data). We did this by inserting 1,000 events into Neuroscan data using a custom-built event-marking system, the 'Airmarker', which marks events by triggering voltage spikes in two EEG channels. We used the lag between Airmarker events and events generated by Neuroscan as a reference for comparisons in Experiment 3. In Experiment 3 we measured the precision and accuracy of three types of Emotiv event-marking by generating 1,000 events, 1 s apart. We measured precision as the variability (standard deviation in ms) of Emotiv events and accuracy as the mean difference between Emotiv events and true events. The three triggering methods we tested were: (1) Parallel-port-generated TTL triggers; (2) Arduino-generated TTL triggers; and (3) Serial-port triggers. In Methods 1 and 2 we used an auxiliary device, Emotiv Extender, to incorporate triggers into the EEG data. We tested these event-marking methods across three configurations of Emotiv EEG systems: (1) Emotiv EPOC+ sampling at 128 Hz; (2) Emotiv EPOC+ sampling at 256 Hz; and (3) Emotiv EPOC Flex sampling at 128 Hz. Results: In Experiment 1 we found that the smaller P1 and Ni peaks were attenuated at lower levels of jitter relative to the larger P2 peak (21 ms, 16 ms, and 45 ms for P1, Ni, and P2, respectively). In Experiment 2, we found an average lag of 30.96 ms for Airmarker events relative to Neuroscan events. In Experiment 3, we found some lag in all configurations. However, all configurations exhibited precision of less than a single sample, with serial-port-marking the most precise when paired with EPOC+ sampling at 256 Hz. Conclusion: All Emotiv event-marking methods and configurations that we tested were precise enough for ERP research as the precision of each method would provide ERP waveforms statistically equivalent to a research-standard system. Though all systems exhibited some level of inaccuracy, researchers could easily account for these during data processing.

There is a strong history and a growing body of EEG research investigating positive affect (PA). In the current article, we focus on EEG components which are increasingly informing the science of PA. We review EEG frequency evidence from alpha-band (recorded over lateral prefrontal leads) and beta-band (over the motor and pre-motor cortex) as measures of approach motivation in PA. We also review evidence of the event-related potential called the Reward Positivity, and the frequency components underlying it in the context of reward processing and learning. These EEG measures have been highly informative of PA, however, they are but a few of the potential EEG measures informing the study of PA.

Using the P300 component of event-related potential (ERP) [electroencephalography (EEG)], we have developed a concealed information test (CIT), which provides an easy and effective way to identify whether an individual carries some concealed information. The P300 component is elicited when an individual is provoked with stimuli related to his/her memories. Taking advantage of this P300 feature, several images of certain familiar and nonfamiliar faces are shown to the subjects during the experiment. Throughout the image presentation, EEG data of the subject are recorded. Signal preprocessing, processing, and classification algorithms are then implemented on the recorded EEG data. This article aims to classify the recorded EEG data for CIT. For extracting the spatial features from the recorded EEG data (of range 0.5-30 Hz), a common spatial pattern has been used. A fuzzy integrator system is developed using classifier performance measures as the antecedents. A novel defuzzification function called generalized mean of maxima (GMoM) has also been proposed to achieve a classification score or value. The experimental results demonstrate the outperformance of fuzzy-based CIT with significant classification accuracy.

Precise Temporal P300 Detection in Brain Computer Interface EEG Signals Using a Long-Short Term Memory	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS AND MACHINE LEARNING - ICANN 2021, PT IV	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	30th International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (ICANN)	SEP 14-17, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK			Recurrent neural networks; Inter- and intra-subject variability; Detection of P300 at sample level; Event-related potential; P300 latency variability; Oddball paradigm; Bayesian LDA	SELECTION METHODS; LATENCY; CLASSIFICATION	Event-Related Potentials (ERP) detection is a latent problem in the clinical, neuroscience, and engineering fields. It is an open challenge that contributes to achieving more accurate and adaptable Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). The state-of-the-art typically uses simple classifiers based on Discriminant Analysis due to their little computational demand. Some more recent approaches have started using Deep Learning techniques, but these do not provide any temporal information and rarely focus on detecting the P300 at sample level in electroencephalography (EEG) signals, which would improve the Information Transfer Rate in BCIs. In other research areas, recurrent neural networks have shown high performance in those tasks that require online responses. We propose a new methodology, based on Long-Short Term Memory networks, in a sample level forecast to predict the P300 signal continuously. We get a slight improvement concerning the standard procedure, typically Bayesian Linear Discriminant Analysis, and we also show that the model predicts the occurrence of the P300 ERP at sample level in EEG signals. This brings us the possibility of evaluating the inherent variation between subjects. Our approach contributes to more agile and adaptable BCIs development, going further in the real-life usage of BCIs.

Most of these algorithms are classified based on the ERP characteristics. To observe the characteristics of ERPs, an averaging method using electroencephalography (EEG) signals cut out by time-locking to the event for each condition is required. To date, several classification methods using only single-trial EEG signals have been studied. In some cases, the machine learning models were used for the classifications; however, the relationship between the constructed model and the characteristics of ERPs remains unclear. In this study, the LightGBM model was constructed for each individual to classify a single-trial waveform and visualize the relationship between these features and the characteristics of ERPs. The features used in the model were the average values and standard deviation of the EEG amplitude with a time width of 10 ms. The best area under the curve (AUC) score was 0.92, but, in some cases, the AUC scores were low. Large individual differences in AUC scores were observed. In each case, on checking the importance of the features, high importance was shown at the 10-ms time width section, where a large difference was observed in ERP waveforms between the target and the nontarget. Since the model constructed in this study was found to reflect the characteristics of ERP, as the next step, we would like to try to improve the discrimination performance by using stimuli that the participants can concentrate on with interest.

Emerging biomarkers for child & family intervention studies: A review of EEG studies of parenting	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review						EEG; ERP; Parenting; Self-regulation; Child and family intervention emotion	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; BRAIN ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; MATERNAL SENSITIVITY; EMOTION REGULATION; ALPHA-ASYMMETRY; INFANT DISTRESS; YOUNG-CHILDREN; RESPONSES	Most interventions for childhood mental health problems require significant parental involvement, and treatment programs are increasingly incorporating components aimed at enhancing parents' own self-regulation in the context of potentially stressful parent-child interactions. This paper discusses the promise of EEG in examining the rapidly unfolding perceptual, cognitive, emotional, and regulatory processes that occur in parenting, in hopes of ultimately informing child and family interventions. First, we review two separate bodies of work that have used EEG with parents: one examining event-related potential (ERP) measures, and the other examining frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA). We discuss benefits of each within the study of parenting, and also suggest other EEG metrics (such as event-related time-frequency analyses) that can be leveraged to fill current gaps in our knowledge. Finally, we discuss the potential for these findings to inform clinical work with children and families, such as identifying biomarkers that could aid in assessment, treatment recommendations, and monitoring response to interventions.

Biomarker support for ADHD diagnosis based on Event Related Potentials and scores from an attention test	PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH			English	Article						ADHD; Event related potentials; Biomarkers; Children; Win EEG; Electrophysiology; Diagnostic index	DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; CHILDREN; EEG; ADOLESCENTS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; RELIABILITY; ARTIFACTS; VALIDITY; DEFICIT	ADHD is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder associated with dysfunctions in several brain systems. Objective markers of brain dysfunction for clinical assessment are lacking. Many studies applying electroencephalography (EEG) and neuropsychological tests find significant differences between ADHD and controls, but the effect sizes (ES) are often too small for diagnostic purposes. This study aimed to compute a diagnostic index for ADHD by combining behavioral test scores from a cued visual go/no-go task and Event Related Potentials (ERPs). Sixty-one children (age 9-12 years) diagnosed with ADHD and 69 age- and gender-matched typically developing children (TDC) underwent EEG-recording while tested on a go/no-go task. Based on comparisons of ERP group-means and task-performance, variables that differed significantly between the groups with at least moderate ES were converted to a five points percentile scale and multiplied by the ES of the variable. The sum-scores of the variables constituted the diagnostic index. The index discriminated significantly between patients and TDC with a large ES. This index was applied to an independent sample (20 ADHD, 21 TDC), distinguishing the groups with an even larger ES. The diagnostic index described has the potential to support assessment. Further research establishing diagnostic indexes for differential diagnoses is needed.	[Hager, L.

Method: We present a new metric to evaluate trial-by-trial covariations of successive ERP components. Our main assumption is that if two successive ERP components are generated by phase-resetting of a unitary oscillation, they should be time-locked to each other and their single-trial latencies should covary. In contrast, if the components are generated by independent additive components, single-trial latency covariations should not be observed. To quantify the covariance between the single-trial latencies, we define a metric based on latencycorrected averages, which we applied to both simulated and real ERPs. Results: For the simulated data, there was a clear distinction in latency covariation between the ERPs generated with unitary phase-resetting versus additive models. For real visual and auditory ERPs, we observed a lack of latency covariation of successive components. Comparison with existing methods: The new metric is complementary to other approaches to study the mechanisms underlying ERP generation, and does not suffer from potential caveats due to filtering artifacts. Moreover, the method proved to be more sensitive than another estimation of single-trial latency covariations using the crosscorrelation function. Conclusion: The observed lack of latency covariation shows the presence of parallel, independent processing within each cortical sensory pathway.

J	Duru, DG; Alobaidi, M				Goksel Duru, Dilek; Alobaidi, May			Classification of brain electrophysiological changes in response to colour stimuli	PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Colour stimuli; Classification; Machine learning; Event-related potentials		In this study, the classification of ongoing brain activity occurring as a response to colour stimuli was managed and reported. Until now, the classification of the seen colour from brain electrical signals has not been investigated or reported in the related literature. In this study, we aimed to classify EEG brain responses corresponding to blue, green, and red coloured shapes. In addition to the current literature, we focused on ongoing EEG responses instead of using ERP metrics, with visual stimulus-related ERP metrics also compared throughout the study. The feature extraction process was carried out using the Fourier transform to obtain the conventional band power values of the EEG for each stimulus type. Delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma-band power values of each one-second period constituted the feature set. In addition to scalp measurements, a second feature set was obtained based on the inverse solution of the EEG waves. Furthermore, we applied one-way ANOVA for the feature selection prior to classification procedures. Four classifiers were implemented using the reduced feature set and the raw one as well. The differences between scalp responses were localized mainly around the temporal and temporoparietal regions. Our ERP-component findings support the fact that additional brain regions among the visual cortex participate in the colour categorization process of the brain. RGB colours were identified using 1 s EEG data. Ensemble-KNN and KNN achieved the highest accuracy values (93%) when used either with scalp spectral features or source space features.

J	Tsai, CC; Liang, WK				Tsai, Chong-Chih; Liang, Wei-Kuang			Event-related components are structurally represented by intrinsic event-related potentials	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; FACE PERCEPTION; WORKING-MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS	The detection of event-related potentials (ERPs) through electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis is a well-established method for understanding brain functions during a cognitive process. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and stationarity of the data, ERPs are often filtered to a wideband frequency range, such as 0.05-30 Hz. Alternatively, a natural-filtering procedure can be performed through empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which yields intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) for each trial of the EEG data, followed by averaging over trials to generate the event-related modes. However, although the EMD-based filtering procedure has advantages such as a high SNR, suitable waveform shape, and high statistical power, one fundamental drawback of the procedure is that it requires the selection of an IMF (or a partial sum of a range of IMFs) to determine an ERP component effectively. Therefore, in this study, we propose an intrinsic ERP (iERP) method to overcome the drawbacks and retain the advantages of event-related mode analysis for investigating ERP components. The iERP method can reveal multiple ERP components at their characteristic time scales and suitably cluster statistical effects among modes by using a tailored definition of each mode's neighbors. We validated the iERP method by using realistic EEG data sets acquired from a face perception task and visual working memory task. By using these two data sets, we demonstrated how to apply the iERP method to a cognitive task and incorporate existing cluster-based tests into iERP analysis. Moreover, iERP analysis revealed the statistical effects between (or among) experimental conditions more effectively than the conventional ERP method did.

As a result, many methods are being reconsidered, and researchers' degrees of freedom in these methods are being discussed as a potential source of inconsistencies across studies. New Method: With the aim of addressing these subjectivity issues, we have been working on a tutorial-like EEG (pre-)processing pipeline to achieve an automated method based on the semi-automated analysis proposed by Delorme and Makeig. Results: Two scripts are presented and explained step-by-step to perform basic, informed ERP and frequency-domain analyses, including data export to statistical programs and visual representations of the data. The open-source software EEGlab in MATLAB is used as the data handling platform, but scripts based on code provided by Mike Cohen (2014) are also included. Comparison with existing methods: This accompanying tutorial-like article explains and shows how the processing of our automated pipeline affects the data and addresses, especially beginners in EEG-analysis, as other (pre)-processing chains are mostly targeting rather informed users in specialized areas or only parts of a complete procedure. In this context, we compared our pipeline with a selection of existing approaches. Conclusion: The need for standardization and replication is evident, yet it is equally important to control the plausibility of the suggested solution by data exploration. Here, we provide the community with a tool to enhance the understanding and capability of EEG-analysis. We aim to contribute to comprehensive and reliable analyses for neuro-scientific research.

Permutation tests are also particularly useful to overcome the multiple comparisons problem as they are used to test the effect of factors or variables on signals while controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER). This article introduces the permuco package which implements several permutation methods. They can all be used jointly with multiple comparisons procedures like the cluster-mass tests or threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE). The permuco package is designed, first, for univariate permutation tests with nuisance variables, like regression and ANOVA; and secondly, for comparing signals as required, for example, for the analysis of event-related potential (ERP) of experiments using electroencephalography (EEG). This article describes the permutation methods and the multiple comparisons procedures implemented. A tutorial for each of theses cases is provided.

To see, not to see or to see poorly: Perceptual quality and guess rate as a function of electroencephalography (EEG) brain activity in an orientation perception task	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; orientation perception; standard mixture model; time-frequency analysis; variable precision model; visual perception	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY; ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; ERP; THETA; RESPONSES; COMPONENT; TOOLBOX	Detection of visual stimuli fluctuates over time, and these fluctuations have been shown to correlate with time domain evoked activity and frequency-domain periodic activity. However, it is unclear if these fluctuations are related to a change in guess rate, perceptual quality or both. Here we determined whether the quality of perception randomly varies across trials or is fixed so that the variability is the same. Then we estimated how perceptual quality and guess rate on an orientation perception task relate to electroencephalography (EEG) activity. Response errors were fitted to variable precision models and the standard mixture model to determine whether perceptual quality is from a varying or fixed distribution. Overall, the best fit was the standard mixture model that assumes that response variability can be defined by a fixed distribution. The power and phase of 2-7 Hz post-target activities were found to vary along with task performance in that more accurate trials had greater power, and the preferred phase differed significantly between accurate and guess trials. Guess rate and sigma were significantly lower on trials with high 2- to 3-Hz power than low, and the difference started around 250-ms post-target. These effects coincide with changes in the P3 event-related potential (ERP): There was a more positive deflection in the accurate trials versus guesses. These results suggest that the spread of errors (perceptual quality) can be characterised by a fixed range of values. Where the errors fall within that range is modulated by the post-target power in the lower-frequency bands and their analogous ERPs.

The data were collected from 32-channel scalp-EEG, 14-channel ear-EEG, 4-channel electrooculography, and 9-channel inertial measurement units placed at the forehead, left ankle, and right ankle. The recording conditions were as follows: standing, slow walking, fast walking, and slight running at speeds of 0, 0.8, 1.6, and 2.0 m/s, respectively. For each speed, two different BCI paradigms, event-related potential and steady-state visual evoked potential, were recorded. To evaluate the signal quality, scalp- and ear-EEG data were qualitatively and quantitatively validated during each speed. We believe that the dataset will facilitate BCIs in diverse mobile environments to analyze brain activities and evaluate the performance quantitatively for expanding the use of practical BCIs.

This review summarizes the types of EEG and ERP measures that could be used in the HEALthy Brain and Cognitive Development (HBCD) study, and the promises and challenges in doing so. First, we provide brief overview of the use of EEG/ERP for studying the developing brain and discuss exemplar findings, using resting or baseline EEG measures as well as the ERP mismatch negativity (MMN) as exemplars. We then discuss the promises of EEG/ERP such as feasibility, while balancing challenges such as ensuring good signal quality in diverse children with different hair types. We then describe an ongoing multi-site EEG data harmonization from our groups. We discuss the process of alignment and provide preliminary usability data for both resting state EEG data and auditory ERP MMN in diverse samples including over 300 infants and toddlers. Finally, we provide recommendations and considerations for the HBCD study and other studies of neurodevelopment.

The underlying neuroplastic mechanisms remain unclear. Electrocorticography (ECOG), electroencephalography (EEG), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) may help elucidate the brain mechanisms underlying CR, as CR is thought to be related to efficient utilization of remaining brain resources. The purpose of this systematic review is to collect, evaluate, and synthesize the findings on neural correlates of CR estimates using ECOG, EEG, and MEG. Method: We examined articles that were published from the first standardized definition of CR. Eleven EEG and five MEG cross-sectional studies met the inclusion criteria: They concerned original research, analyzed (M)EEG in humans, used a validated CR estimate, and related (M)EEG to CR. Quality assessment was conducted using an adapted form of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. No ECOG study met the inclusion criteria. Results: A total of 1383 participants from heterogeneous patient, young and older healthy groups were divided into three categories by (M)EEG methodology: Eight (M)EEG studies employed event-related fields or potentials, six studies analyzed brain oscillations at rest (of which one also analyzed a cognitive task), and three studies analyzed brain connectivity. Various CR estimates were employed and all studies compared different (M)EEG measures and CR estimates. Several associations between (M)EEG measures and CR estimates were observed. Conclusion: Our findings support that (M)EEG measures are related to CR estimates, particularly in healthy individuals. However, the character of this relationship is dependent on the population and task studied, warranting further studies.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used technique to address research questions about brain functioning, from controlled laboratorial conditions to naturalistic environments. However, EEG data are affected by biological (e.g. ocular, myogenic) and non-biological (e.g. movement-related) artifacts, which-depending on their extent-may limit the interpretability of the study results. Blind source separation (BSS) approaches have demonstrated to be particularly promising for the attenuation of artifacts in high-density EEG (hdEEG) data. Previous EEG artifact removal studies suggested that it may not be optimal to use the same BSS method for different kinds of artifacts. Approach. In this study, we developed a novel multi-step BSS approach to optimize the attenuation of ocular, movement-related and myogenic artifacts from hdEEG data. For validation purposes, we used hdEEG data collected in a group of healthy participants in standing, slow-walking and fast-walking conditions. During part of the experiment, a series of tone bursts were used to evoke auditory responses. We quantified event-related potentials (ERPs) using hdEEG signals collected during an auditory stimulation, as well as the event-related desynchronization (ERD) by contrasting hdEEG signals collected in walking and standing conditions, without auditory stimulation. We compared the results obtained in terms of auditory ERP and motor-related ERD using the proposed multi-step BSS approach, with respect to two classically used single-step BSS approaches. Main results. The use of our approach yielded the lowest residual noise in the hdEEG data, and permitted to retrieve stronger and more reliable modulations of neural activity than alternative solutions. Overall, our study confirmed that the performance of BSS-based artifact removal can be improved by using specific BSS methods and parameters for different kinds of artifacts. Significance. Our technological solution supports a wider use of hdEEG-based source imaging in movement and rehabilitation studies, and contributes to the further development of mobile brain/body imaging applications.

J	Zerna, J; Strobel, A; Scheffel, C				Zerna, Josephine; Strobel, Alexander; Scheffel, Christoph			EEG microstate analysis of emotion regulation reveals no sequential processing of valence and emotional arousal	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE; COGNITIVE REAPPRAISAL; ATTENTION; MODULATION; UNPLEASANT; DYNAMICS; ERP; THREAT; CONSEQUENCES	In electroencephalography (EEG), microstates are distributions of activity across the scalp that persist for several tens of milliseconds before changing into a different pattern. Microstate analysis is a way of utilizing EEG as both temporal and spatial imaging tool, but has rarely been applied to task-based data. This study aimed to conceptually replicate microstate findings of valence and emotional arousal processing and investigate the effects of emotion regulation on microstates, using data of an EEG paradigm with 107 healthy adults who actively viewed emotional pictures, cognitively detached from them, or suppressed facial reactions. Within the first 600 ms after stimulus onset only the comparison of viewing positive and negative pictures yielded significant results, caused by different electrodes depending on the microstate. Since the microstates associated with more and less emotionally arousing pictures did not differ, sequential processing could not be replicated. When extending the analysis to 2000 ms after stimulus onset, differences were exclusive to the comparison of viewing and detaching from negative pictures. Intriguingly, we observed the novel phenomenon of a microstate difference that could not be attributed to single electrodes. This suggests that microstate analysis can detect differences beyond those detected by event-related potential analysis.

J	Conrad, C; Newman, A				Conrad, Colin; Newman, Aaron			Measuring Mind Wandering During Online Lectures Assessed With EEG	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography; mind wandering; e-learning; online lecture; asynchronous lecture; remote learning	SOFTWARE	Mind wandering can inhibit learning in multimedia classrooms, such as when watching online lectures. One explanation for this effect is that periods of mind wandering cause learners' attention to be redirected from the learning material toward task-unrelated thoughts. The present study explored the relationship between mind wandering and online education using electroencephalography (EEG). Participants were asked to attend to a 75 minute educational video lecture, while task-irrelevant auditory tones played at random intervals. The tones were of two distinct pitches, with one occurring frequently (80%) and the other infrequently (20%). Participants were prompted at pseudo-random intervals during the lecture to report their degree of experienced mind wandering. EEG spectral power and event-related potentials (ERP) were compared between states of high and low degrees of self-reported mind wandering. Participants also performed pre/post quizzes based on the lecture material. Results revealed significantly higher delta, theta and alpha band activity during mind wandering, as well as a decreased P2 ERP amplitude. Further, learning scores (improvement on quizzes pre to post) were lower among participants who reported higher degrees of mind wandering throughout the video. The results are consistent with a view that mind wandering during e-learning is characterized by a shift in attention away from the external world and toward internal thoughts, which may be a cause of reduced learning.

However, the electroencephalography (EEG) signals are distorted by movement artifacts and electromyography signals when users are moving, which make hard to recognize human intention. In addition, as hardware issues are also challenging, ear-EEG has been developed for practical brain-computer interface and has been widely used. In this paper, we proposed ensemble-based convolutional neural networks in ambulatory environment and analyzed the visual event-related potential responses in scalp- and ear-EEG in terms of statistical analysis and brain-computer interface performance. The brain-computer interface performance deteriorated as 3-14% when walking fast at 1.6 m/s. The proposed methods showed 0.728 in average of the area under the curve. The proposed method shows robust to the ambulatory environment and imbalanced data as well.

Python, a prominent computer language, has emerged as a language of choice for many research and engineering purposes. In this article, BciPy, an open-source, Python-based software for conducting BCI research is presented. It was developed with a focus on restoring communication using Event-Related Potential (ERP) spelling interfaces; however, it may be used for other non-spelling and non-ERP BCI paradigms.

Practical real-time MEG-based neural interfacing with optically pumped magnetometers	BMC BIOLOGY			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); Optically pumped magnetometers (OPM); Event-related potential (ERP); Event-related field (ERF); Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP); Magnetoencephalography (MEG); Electroencephalography (EEG)	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; MAGNETOCARDIOGRAPHY MEASUREMENTS; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; BCI; EEG; GAMES; SSVEP; SPEED	Background Brain-computer interfaces decode intentions directly from the human brain with the aim to restore lost functionality, control external devices or augment daily experiences. To combine optimal performance with wide applicability, high-quality brain signals should be captured non-invasively. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a potent candidate but currently requires costly and confining recording hardware. The recently developed optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) promise to overcome this limitation, but are currently untested in the context of neural interfacing. Results In this work, we show that OPM-MEG allows robust single-trial analysis which we exploited in a real-time 'mind-spelling' application yielding an average accuracy of 97.7%. Conclusions This shows that OPM-MEG can be used to exploit neuro-magnetic brain responses in a practical and flexible manner, and opens up new avenues for a wide range of new neural interface applications in the future.

Results would also offer a proof-of-concept for the device to be used as a concealed brain-computer interface (BCI). Design: The device is composed of a custom-fitted earpiece and an ergonomic behind-the-ear piece with embedded electrodes made of a soft and flexible combination of silicone rubber and carbon fibers. The location of the conductive silicone electrodes inside the ear canal and the optimal geometry of the behind-the-ear piece were obtained through morphological and geometrical analysis of the human ear canal and the region around-the-ear. An entirely conductive generic earpiece was also developed to assess the potential of a universal, more affordable solution. Results: Early latency results illustrate the conductive silicone electrodes' capability to record quality EEG signals, comparable to those obtained with traditional gold-plated electrodes. Additionally, late latency results demonstrate EARtrodes' capacity to reliably detect decision-making processes from the ear. Conclusions: EEG results validate the performance of EARtrodes as a circum-aural and intra-aural EEG recording system adapted for a wide range of applications in audiology, neuroscience, clinical research, and as an unobtrusive BCI.

New method: We establish stability properties of the TDA descriptor persistence landscape (PL) in event related potential (ERP) across multi-trial EEG signals, state algorithms for computing PL, and propose an exact inference framework on persistence and PLs. Results: We apply the topological signal processing and inference framework to compare ERPs between individuals with post-stroke aphasia and healthy controls under a speech altered auditory feedback (AAF) paradigm. Results show significant PL difference in the ERP response of aphasic individuals and healthy controls over the parietal-occipital and occipital regions with respect to speech onset, and no significant PL difference in any regions with respect to the two pitch-shift stimuli. Comparison with existing methods: In comparison, spatial patterns of difference between aphasic individuals and healthy controls by persistence, local variance, and spectral powers are much more diffuse than the PL patterns. In simulation results, the exact test on persistence and PLs has more robust performance than the baseline tests on local variance and spectral powers. Conclusions: Persistence features provide a more robust EEG marker than local variance, and spectral powers. It could be a potentially powerful tool for comparing electrophysiological correlates in neurological disorders.

Event detection in single trial EEG during attention and memory related task	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						brain computer interface; BCI; P300-event related potential; attention; adaptive filter; ensemble averaging; moving averager; latency; SNR; short-time Fourier transform; STFT; time-domain; frequency-domain	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; BCI; COMPONENT	P300 is an endogenous event related potential (ERP) elicited by a rare or significant visual stimulus and is widely preferred in brain computer interface (BCI) to assess the cognition level of the subject. Many researchers contribute to P300 estimation as this signal is of very low strength in background electroencephalogram (EEG) activity. This paper proposes a novel signal processing algorithm to detect the P300 event in a single trial EEG acquired from midline electrode sites in oddball paradigm to evaluate attention and memory related tasks of subjects. The algorithm incorporates wavelet combined adaptive noise canceller followed by ensemble and moving averager. Time domain analysis shows the localisation of ERP around 300 ms for target stimuli attended by the subjects. The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) analysis shows strong theta activity associated to memory related task. Thus, the proposed algorithm is efficient in detecting the P300 with higher correlation coefficient of 0.82 (average) compared to other existing methods.

EPOC outside the shield: comparing the performance of a consumer-grade EEG device in shielded and unshielded environments	BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS & ENGINEERING EXPRESS			English	Article						N170; ERPs; face perception; emotiv; gaming EEG validation		Low-cost, portable electroencephalography (EEG) devices have become commercially available in the last 10 years. One such system, Emotiv's EPOC, has been modified to allow event-related potential (ERP) research. Although the EPOC has been shown to provide data comparable to research-grade equipment and has been used in real-world settings, how EPOC performs without the electrical shielding, commonly used in research-grade laboratories, is yet to be systematically tested. In the current article we address this gap by conducting a simple EEG experiment in shielded and unshielded contexts. Participants (n = 13, mean age = 23.2 years, SD = 7.9) monitored the presentation of human versus wristwatch faces, responding whether the images were inverted or not. This method elicited the face-sensitive N170 ERP. In both shielded and unshielded contexts, the N170 amplitude was larger when participants viewed human faces and peaked later when a human face was inverted. More importantly, Bayesian analysis showed no difference in the N170 measured in the shielded and unshielded contexts. Further, the signal recorded in both contexts was highly correlated. The EPOC appears to reliably record EEG signals without a purpose-built electrically-shielded room.

Increased Neural Efficiency in Visual Word Recognition: Evidence from Alterations in Event-Related Potentials and Multiscale Entropy	ENTROPY			English	Article						visual word recognition; lexical decision task (LDT); brain signal complexity; multiscale entropy; event-related potential (ERP)		Visual word recognition is a relatively effortless process, but recent research suggests the system involved is malleable, with evidence of increases in behavioural efficiency after prolonged lexical decision task (LDT) performance. However, the extent of neural changes has yet to be characterized in this context. The neural changes that occur could be related to a shift from initially effortful performance that is supported by control-related processing, to efficient task performance that is supported by domain-specific processing. To investigate this, we replicated the British Lexicon Project, and had participants complete 16 h of LDT over several days. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) at three intervals to track neural change during LDT performance and assessed event-related potentials and brain signal complexity. We found that response times decreased during LDT performance, and there was evidence of neural change through N170, P200, N400, and late positive component (LPC) amplitudes across the EEG sessions, which suggested a shift from control-related to domain-specific processing. We also found widespread complexity decreases alongside localized increases, suggesting that processing became more efficient with specific increases in processing flexibility. Together, these findings suggest that neural processing becomes more efficient and optimized to support prolonged LDT performance.

The aim of this study was to explore the potential of interval-based features as possible ERP biomarkers for early detection of AD patients. Methods: The current results are based on 7-channel ERP recordings of 95 healthy controls (HCs) and 75 subjects with mild AD acquired during a three-stimulus auditory oddball task. To evaluate interval-based features as diagnostic biomarkers in AD, two classifiers were applied to the selected features to distinguish AD and healthy control ERPs: RBFNN (radial basis function neural network) and MLP (multilayer perceptron). Results: Using extracted features and a radial basis function neural network, a high overall diagnostic accuracy of 98.3% was achieved. Discussion: Our findings demonstrate the great promise for scalp ERP and interval-based features as non-invasive, objective, and low-cost biomarkers for early AD detection.

However, the psychometric properties of reward- and error-related brain activity have been primarily investigated in adolescents and adults. It is critical to also establish the reliability of ERPs in younger children, particularly if they are used as individual difference measures of risk during key developmental periods. The present study examined the reliability of the reward positivity (RewP) and error-related negativity (ERN) among 80 children (M-age = 6.9 years old; 50% female). Participants completed the doors, flanker, and go/no-go tasks twice, separated by approximately 8 months, while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Results indicated that the RewP demonstrated strong internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The ERN also demonstrated strong internal consistency, but test-retest reliability was only significant for the ERN measured during the flanker task and not the go/no-go task. These results are largely consistent with reported psychometric properties of reward- and error related ERPs in adolescents and adults, suggesting that the ERN and RewP may be appropriate biomarkers of individual differences in populations ranging from early childhood to adulthood.

Local spatial analysis: an easy-to-use adaptive spatial EEG filter	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG components; electroencephalography (EEG); event-related potentials (ERPs); referencing; spatial filtering	IPSILATERAL MOTOR CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BRAIN ASYMMETRY; VISUAL-CORTEX; DEPRESSION; ATTENTION; ARTIFACTS; RESPONSES	Spatial EEG filters are widely used to isolate event-related potential (ERP) components. The most commonly used spatial filters (e.g., the average reference and the surface Laplacian) are ?stationary.? Stationary filters are conceptually simple, easy to use, and fast to compute, but all assume that the EEG signal does not change across sensors and time. Given that ERPs are intrinsically nonstationary, applying stationary filters can lead to misinterpretations of the measured neural activity. In contrast, ?adapt-ive? spatial filters (e.g., independent component analysis, ICA; and principal component analysis, PCA) infer their weights directly from the spatial properties of the data. They are, thus, not affected by the shortcomings of stationary filters. The issue with adaptive filters is that understanding how they work and how to interpret their output require advanced statistical and physiological knowledge. Here, we describe a novel, easy-to-use, and conceptually simple adaptive filter (local spatial analysis, LSA) for highlighting local components masked by large widespread activity. This approach exploits the statistical information stored in the trial-by-trial variability of stimulus-evoked neural activity to estimate the spatial filter parameters adaptively at each time point. Using both simulated data and real ERPs elicited by stimuli of four different sensory modalities (audition, vision, touch, and pain), we show that this method outperforms widely used stationary filters and allows to identify novel ERP components masked by large widespread activity. Implementation of the LSA filter in MATLAB is freely available to download. NEW & NOTEWORTHY EEG spatial filtering is important for exploring brain function. Two classes of filters are commonly used: stationary and adaptive. Stationary filters are simple to use but wrongly assume that stimulus-evoked EEG responses (ERPs) are stationary. Adaptive filters do not make this assumption but require solid statistical and physiological knowledge. Bridging this gap, we present local spatial analysis (LSA), an adaptive, yet computationally simple, spatial filter based on linear regression that separates local and widespread brain activity (https://www.iannettilab.net/lsa.html or https://github.com/rorybufacchi/LSA-filter).

Genetic underpinnings of schizophrenia-related electroencephalographical intermediate phenotypes: A systematic review and meta-analysis	PROGRESS IN NEURO-PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						Schizophrenia; Electrophysiology; ERP; SNP; Intermediate phenotypes; Electroencephalography (EEG)	CATECHOL-O-METHYLTRANSFERASE; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; RESTING EEG; QUANTITATIVE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL ENDOPHENOTYPES; VAL158MET POLYMORPHISM; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; ANTIPSYCHOTIC-NAIVE; RECEPTOR GENE	Although substantial research into genetics of psychotic disorders has been conducted, a large proportion of their genetic architecture has remained unresolved. Electroencephalographical intermediate phenotypes (EIP) have the potential to constitute a valuable tool when studying genetic risk loci for schizophrenia, in particular P3b amplitude, P50 suppression, mismatch negativity (MMN) and resting state power spectra of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Here, we systematically reviewed studies investigating the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with these EIPs and meta-analysed them when appropriate. We retrieved 45 studies (N = 34,971 study participants). Four SNPs investigated in more than one study were genome-wide significant for an association with schizophrenia and three were genome-wide suggestive, based on a lookup in the influential 2014 GWAS (Ripke et al., 2014). However, in our meta-analyses, rs1625579 failed to reach a statistically significant association with p3b amplitude decrease and rs4680 risk allele carrier status was not associated with p3b amplitude decrease or with impaired p50 suppression. In conclusion, evidence for SNP associations with EIPs remains limited to individual studies. Careful selection of EIPs and SNPs, combined with consistent reporting of effect sizes, directions of effect and p-values would aid future meta-analyses.

Subjects were passively viewing 128 static and dynamic facial expressions of female and male actors and their respective avatars in neutral or fearful conditions. Event-related potentials (ERPs), as well as alpha and theta event-related synchronization and desynchronization (ERD/ERS), were derived from the EEG that was recorded during the task. All ERP features, except for the very early N100, differed in their response to avatar and actor faces. Whereas the N170 showed differences only for the neutral avatar condition, later potentials (N300 and LPP) differed in both emotional conditions (neutral and fear) and the presented agents (actor and avatar). In addition, we found that the avatar faces elicited significantly stronger reactions than the actor face for theta and alpha oscillations. Especially theta EEG frequencies responded specifically to visual emotional stimulation and were revealed to be sensitive to the emotional content of the face, whereas alpha frequency was modulated by all the stimulus types. We can conclude that the computerized avatar faces affect both, ERP components and ERD/ERS and evoke neural effects that are different from the ones elicited by real faces. This was true, although the avatars were replicas of the human faces and contained similar characteristics in their expression.

Methods: 54 healthy and 57 ADHD adults participated in the study. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded when combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the right prefrontal cortex and also recorded during the Stop Signal task. Results: TMS evoked potentials (TEPs) and the event related potential (ERP) components in the Stop Signal task were found to be significantly reduced in ADHD relative to the matched healthy controls. Stop signal reaction time (SSRT) and stopping accuracy was found to correlate with the ERP signal, and ADHD severity correlated with the TEP signal. Cortical activity (early TEP and Stop Signal ERP) diagnostic model yielded accuracy of 72%. Conclusion: TEPs and ERPs reveal that right PFC excitability was associated with ADHD severity, and with behavioral impulsivity & ndash; as a hallmark of ADHD pathology. This electrophysiological biomarker supports the potential of objective diagnosis for ADHD. Significance: Such tools would allow better assessment of treatment efficacy and prognosis, may advance understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and better the publics attitudes and stigma towards ADHD.

Aging reduces EEG markers of recognition despite intact performance: Implications for forensic memory detection	CORTEX			English	Article						Episodic memory; Aging; Forensic memory detection; ERP; EEG oscillations	CONCEALED INFORMATION TEST; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; THETA OSCILLATIONS; RETRIEVAL; ERP; P300; DYNAMICS; ALPHA; RECOLLECTION	ERP-based forensic memory detection is based on the logic that guilty suspects will hold incriminating knowledge about crimes they have committed, and therefore should show parietal ERP positivities related to recognition when presented with reminders of their crimes. We predicted that such forensic memory detection might however be inaccurate in older adults, because of changes to recognition-related brain activity that occurs with aging. We measured both ERPs and EEG oscillations associated with episodic old/new recognition and forensic memory detection in 30 younger (age < 30) and 30 older (age > 65) adults. EEG oscillations were included as a complementary measure which is less sensitive to temporal variability and component overlap than ERPs. In line with predictions, recognition-related parietal ERP positivities were significantly reduced in the older compared to younger group in both tasks, despite highly similar behavioural performance. We also observed aging-related reductions in oscillatory markers of recognition in the forensic memory detection test, while the oscillatory effects associated with episodic recognition were similar across age groups. This pattern of results suggests that while both forensic memory detection and episodic recognition are accompanied by aging-induced reductions in parietal ERP positivities, these reductions may be caused by non-overlapping mechanisms across the two tasks. Our findings suggest that EEG-based forensic memory detection tests are less valid in older than younger populations, limiting their practical applications.& nbsp; (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Whereas most studies utilize relatively high doses, there are also reports of beneficial effects of "microdosing," or repeated use of very low doses of these drugs. The behavioral and neural effects of these low doses are not fully understood. Objectives To examine the effects of LSD (13 mu g and 26 mu g) versus placebo on resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potential (ERP) responses in healthy adults. Methods Twenty-two healthy men and women, 18 to 35 years old, participated in 3 EEG sessions in which they received placebo or LSD (13 mu g and 26 mu g) under double-blind conditions. During each session, participants completed drug effect and mood questionnaires at hourly intervals, and physiological measures were recorded. During expected peak drug effect, EEG recordings were obtained, including resting-state neural oscillations in scalp electrodes over default mode network (DMN) regions and P300, N170, and P100 ERPs evoked during a visual oddball paradigm. Results LSD dose-dependently reduced oscillatory power across delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands during both eyes closed and eyes open resting conditions. During the oddball task, LSD dose-dependently reduced ERP amplitudes for P300 and N170 components and increased P100 latency. LSD also produced dose-related increases in positive mood, elation, energy, and anxiety and increased heart rate and blood pressure. On a measure of altered states of consciousness, LSD dose-dependently increased Blissful State, but not other indices of perceptual or sensory effects typical of psychedelic drugs. The subjective effects of the drug were not correlated with the EEG measures. Conclusions Low doses of LSD produced broadband cortical desynchronization over the DMN during resting state and reduced P300 and N170 amplitudes, patterns similar to those reported with higher doses of psychedelics. Notably, these neurophysiological effects raise the possibility that very low doses of LSD may produce subtle behavioral and perhaps therapeutic effects that do not rely on the full psychedelic experience.

Individualized real-time prediction of working memory performance by classifying electroencephalography signals	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGING SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; event-related (de-)synchronization; N-back; single-trial classification; working memory	EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; RIGHT FOOT MOVEMENTS; OSCILLATORY RESPONSES; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; EEG SIGNALS; CLASSIFICATION; TASK; SELECTION; LOAD	An individualized model that predicts trial-by-trial working memory performance is instrumental for personalized interventions. Here, we propose a single-trial electroencephalography (EEG) classification process predicting individuals' responses, that is, target correct versus target non-correct during a working memory task, N-back. We used event-related (de-)synchronization (ERD and ERS) prior to an anticipatory cue as features. The proposed comprehensive process addresses single-trial EEG classification challenges such as temporal overlap between training and testing datasets, feature selection's stability, and significance of the classification accuracy which have been often overlooked. Our model identified for the first time a few (ranged between 4 and 10) brain regions and oscillations where ERD and ERS predicted an individual's performance. Mean (SD) prediction accuracy across 50 participants (mean age [SD] = 28.56 [7.55]) was 69.51% (8.41). Accuracy was significantly above chance in 34 participants. This machine learning-based approach provides a proof of principle for individualizing EEG targets for potential interventions.

Accurate classification of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) based on ERP data could help improve our understanding of these alterations and propel novel diagnostic or screening measures. However, it has been particularly challenging due to the lack of generalization for noisy raw data with small sample sizes. We aim to improve classification performance for MDD using noisy ERP datasets using machine learning (ML) techniques. Results: We have developed two optimizations in our ML-based analysis of ERP datasets: effective feature extraction in the preprocessing of high-dimensional noisy data and enhanced classification through ensemble ML models. Together with a carefully designed validation strategy, our techniques provide a highly accurate method for MDD classification even for ERP data that are limited in sample size, inherently noisy and high-dimensional in nature. Our experimental results demonstrate that our ML optimizations achieve great accuracy and nearly perfect sensitivity simultaneously, particularly in classifying data samples unseen during the training process, compared to prior studies that perform regression-based classifications.

However, current interpolation methods are all based on purely mathematical interpolation theory, ignoring the neurophysiological basis of the EEG signals, and their performance needs to be further improved, especially when there are many scattered or adjacent bad channels. Therefore, a new interpolation method, named the reference electrode standardization interpolation technique (RESIT), was developed for interpolating scalp EEG channels. Resting-state and event-related EEG datasets were used to investigate the performance of the RESIT. The main results showed that (1) assuming 10% bad channels, RESIT can reconstruct the bad channels well; (2) as the percentage of bad channels increased (from 2% to 85%), the absolute and relative errors between the true and RESIT-reconstructed signals generally increased, and the correlations between the true and RESIT signals decreased; (3) for a range of bad channel percentages (2% similar to 85%), the RESIT had lower absolute error (approximately 2.39% similar to 33.5% reduction), lower relative errors (approximately 1.3% similar to 35.7% reduction) and higher correlations (approximately 2% similar to 690% increase) than traditional interpolation methods, including neighbor interpolation (NI) and spherical spline interpolation (SSI). In addition, the RESIT was integrated into the EEG preprocessing pipeline on the WeBrain cloud platform (). These results suggest that the RESIT is a promising interpolation method for both separate and simultaneous EEG preprocessing that benefits further EEG analysis, including event-related potential (ERP) analysis, EEG network analysis, and strict group-level statistics.

Peak selection and latency jitter correction in developmental event-related potentials	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOBIOLOGY			English	Article						child; event-related potentials; infant; latency	RECOGNITION MEMORY; ATTENTION AFFECTS; FACE; ERP; GUIDELINES; CHILDREN; INFANTS; FEAR; EEG	Event-related potentials (ERPs) provide great insight into neural responses, yet developmental ERP work is plagued with inconsistent approaches to identifying and quantifying component latency. In this analytical review, we describe popular conventions for the selection of time windows for ERP analysis and assert that a data-driven strategy should be applied to the identification of component latency within individual participants' data. This may overcome weaknesses of more general approaches to peak selection; however, it does not account for trial-by-trial variability within a participant. This issue, known as ERP latency jitter, may blur the average ERP, misleading the interpretation of neural mechanisms. Recently, the ReSync MATLAB toolbox has been made available for correction of latency jitter. Although not created specifically for pediatric ERP data, this approach can be adapted for developmental researchers. We have demonstrated the use of the ReSync toolbox with individual infant and child datasets to illustrate its utility. Details about our peak detection script and the ReSync toolbox are provided. The adoption of data processing procedures that allow for accurate, study-specific component selection and reduce trial-by-trial asynchrony strengthens developmental ERP research by decreasing noise included in ERP analyses and improving the representation of the neural response.

Phonological processing in psychopathic offenders	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Event-related potential (ERP); N320; Language; Left Hemisphere Activation (LHA) hypothesis; Psychopathy; Antisocial personality disorder	DEFICIENT RESPONSE MODULATION; WORD RECOGNITION; ACTIVATION; ASYMMETRY; ATTENTION; ERP; DISORDERS; TASKS	Recent research has demonstrated that psychopathic offenders exhibit dynamic cognitive and behavioral deficits on a variety of lab tasks that differentially activate left hemisphere resources. The Left Hemisphere Activation (LHA) hypothesis is a cognitive perspective that aims to address these deficits by conceptualizing psychopathy as a disorder in which behavior and cognitive processing change dynamically as a function of the differential taxation of left hemisphere resources. This study aimed to investigate whether psychopathic traits are associated with electrophysiological anomalies under conditions that place differential demands on left hemisphere language processing systems. We examined in a sample of 43 incarcerated indivdiuals the evocation of the N320, an event-related potential (ERP) elicited by nontarget stimuli during a phonological/phonetic decision task that has been shown to elicit greater activation and cognitive processing within the left hemisphere than the right hemisphere. Findings for a subsample of 18 offenders low in psychopathic traits were generally consistent with previous findings in healthy individuals, suggesting similar electrophysiological activity during phonological processing. However, psychopathic traits impacted the amplitude of the N320. Higher levels of psychopathic traits were associated with reduced left-lateralization in phonological processing as well as enhanced ERP differentiation between pronounceable and nonpronounceable stimuli. These findings provide physiological evidence of a relationship between psychopathic traits and anomalous language processing at the phonological level of word processing.

In this pilot study, we applied magnetoencephalography (MEG) and high density (hd) electroencephalography (EEG) study to evaluate acoustic P300 features in a cohort of early MS. Sixteen MS patients (pwMS) and 19 healthy controls (HCs) matched for age and gender underwent an MEG-/(hd)-EEG-co-recording, using 306-channel Vectorview and 64 scalp electrodes. CI was assessed using Rao's Brief Repeatable Battery (BRB). Moreover, we performed psychometric tests to assess depression and fatigue. In pwMS, we observed a slight latency prolongation of P300 peak compared to HCs, while P300 amplitude and scalp distribution were similar in the two groups. pwMS did not show an amplitude reduction and different scalp distribution of Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) and Event Related Fields (ERFs) related to an acoustic oddball paradigm. We found an inverse correlation between P300 amplitude and fatigue (r Spearman = -0.4; p = 0.019). In pwMS, phenomena of cortical adaptation to early dysfunction could preserve the cognitive performance of the P300 acoustic task, while the development of fatigue could prospectively lead to amplitude decline of P300, suggesting its possible role as a biomarker.

Texture complexity evaluation is important for relying not only on the mathematical properties of the digital image, but also on human perception. Human subjective perception verbally expressed is relative in time, since it can be influenced by a variety of internal or external factors, such as: Mood, tiredness, stress, noise surroundings, and so on, while closely capturing the thought processes would be more straightforward to human reasoning and perception. With the long-term goal of designing more reliable measures of perception which relate to the internal human neural processes taking place when an image is perceived, we firstly performed an electroencephalography experiment with eight healthy participants during color textural perception of natural and fractal images followed by reasoning on their complexity degree, against single color reference images. Aiming at more practical applications for easy use, we tested this entire setting with a WiFi 6 channels electroencephalography (EEG) system. The EEG responses are investigated in the temporal, spectral and spatial domains in order to assess human texture complexity perception, in comparison with both textural types. As an objective reference, the properties of the color textural images are expressed by two common image complexity metrics: Color entropy and color fractal dimension. We observed in the temporal domain, higher Event Related Potentials (ERPs) for fractal image perception, followed by the natural and one color images perception. We report good discriminations between perceptions in the parietal area over time and differences in the temporal area regarding the frequency domain, having good classification performance.

Low-frequency neural activity at rest is correlated with the movement-related cortical potentials elicited during both real and imagined movements	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Low-frequency power; Event related potential (ERP); Readiness potential; Motor imagery	BETA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA	Ongoing low-frequency activity in the brain has been shown to indicate an inhibitory neural state; however, the effects of this low-frequency activity on event-related neural processes associated with movement preparation, including movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) or more specifically, the motor potential (MP), and event-related desynchronization (ERD) have not been assessed. Using data from 48 participants, the current study examined how ongoing mu and beta frequency activity at rest relates to the MP and mu and beta ERD during real or imagined movement of the fingers. Resting state EEG activity was collected for 1 min, prior to the real and imagined finger movement trials. 20 real and 20 imagined movement trials were collected for each hand. Resting beta activity correlated with MP amplitude during movement trials for both the right (r(47) = -0.304, p = 0.035) and left (r(47) = -0.468, p < 0.001) hands, whereas resting mu correlated with MP amplitude during motor imagery trials of both the right (r(47) = -0.289, p = 0.046) and left (r(47) = -0.330, p = 0.020) hands. Ongoing mu and beta activity was not significantly correlated with mu or beta ERD for both the movement and imagery trials. A connection between low-frequency activity and MP could inform biofeedback procedures that promote a reduction of this activity, ultimately allowing for easier identification of the intent to move.

Methods: Pre-attentive auditory mismatch-negativity (MMN) event-related potentials (ERP's), globally induced electroencephalography (EEG) spectral power following verbal command, and clinical parameters were assessed. The study included 10 patients with DOC with mixed etiology and 10 healthy controls (HC) at baseline. The clinical status of patients with DOC was reassessed after 1 year. Results: Unlike baseline clinical assessment scores, baseline MMN amplitudes of non-survivors and induced theta-power following verbal-command clearly distinguished the non-surviving patients versus surviving patients. Baseline MMN peak-amplitude latencies in survivors with DOC were significantly related to clinical outcome over a 1-year period. Conclusion: Current findings underscore the increased sensitivity of EEG-reactivity markers of awareness versus standard clinical scores in predicting 1-year clinical outcome and survival in patients with DOC. Further longitudinal research in larger DOC samples is needed to confirm the prognostic-reliability, and validity of neural reactivity parameters of awareness in patients with DOC. Current finding may have implications for clinical care and medical-legal decisions in unresponsive-awake patients, and could assist clinicians to predict their survival up to 1 year from admission.

A Fine Dry-Electrode Selection to Characterize Event-Related Potentials in the Context of BCI	ADVANCES IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, IWANN 2021, PT I	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	16th International Work-Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (IWANN)	JUN 16-18, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	Univ Granada, Univ Malaga, Polytechn Univ Catalonia		Event-related potentials; Low-cost BCI; Electrode selection; Inter- and intrasubject variability; Bayesian linear discriminant analysis; EEG signal; Oddball paradigm	BRAIN ACTIVITY; P300; EEG; VARIABILITY; INTERFACE	A brain-computer interface (BCI) detects brain activity and converts it to external commands, facilitating the interaction with external devices. One way to implement a BCI is through event-related potentials (ERP), which are positive or negative voltage deflections detected by electroencephalography (EEG) through conductive electrodes. A very promising technology of dry electrodes has been used in recent years, which is much easier and faster to install; useful also for daily life applications. But the disadvantage is that its signal-to-noise ratio is lower compared to traditional wet electrodes technology. Thus, we hypothesized that an appropriate selection of dry electrodes allows the recovery of much more information than traditional standard electrodes and therefore improves the BCI performance. This work shows the importance of electrode selection to obtain a better detection of the ERPs of the EEG signal with a minimum number of electrodes in a personalized manner. To illustrate this problem, we designed a BCI experiment based on P300-ERPs with a dry electrodes wireless EEG system and we evaluated its performance with two electrode selection methodologies designed for this purpose in 12 subjects. The experimental analysis of this work shows that our electrode selection methodology allows the P300-ERPs to be detected with greater precision than a standard electrode set choice. Besides, this minimum electrode selection methodology allows dealing with the well-known problem of inter- and intrasubject variability of the EEG signal, thus customizing the optimal selection of electrodes for each individual. This work contributes to the design of more friendly BCIs through a reduction in the number of electrodes, thus promoting more precise, comfortable, and lightweight equipment for real-life BCI applications.

J	Krause, D; Richert, B; Weigelt, M				Krause, Daniel; Richert, Benjamin; Weigelt, Matthias			Neurophysiology of embodied mental rotation: Event-related potentials in a mental rotation task with human bodies as compared to alphanumeric stimuli	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG ERP; embodied cognition; mental rotation; rotation-related negativity; visual processes	SEX-DIFFERENCES; BRAIN; TRANSFORMATIONS; ACTIVATION; ORIENTATION; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIES; HANDEDNESS; EXPERTISE; ASYMMETRY	The present study examines if the neural signature of information processing in mental rotation tasks is moderated by stimulus characteristics (e.g., body-related vs. non-body-related stimuli). In the present experiment, stimulus sets of human figures (back view; left vs. right arm abduction) and alphanumeric characters ('R'; normal vs. mirrored view) were scrutinized with event-related potentials (ERPs) in the electroencephalography (EEG). Participants had to judge parity between an upright (0 degrees orientation) and a comparison stimulus (stimulus disparity; 0 degrees, 45 degrees, 90 degrees, 135 degrees or 180 degrees). There was a main effect of stimulus disparity for the behavioural (response time and error rates), as well as for the neural data (rotation-related negativity, RRN). The interaction of stimulus disparity and stimulus type was significant for the RRN, but not for the response time. Lower RRN amplitudes for letters indicate a more pronounced use of alternative processes (e.g., memory retrieval), which seems to be reflected in higher N350 amplitudes. Moreover, the increase of the RRN amplitude and the increase in response time as a function of disparity were positively correlated. Task differences were evident for several ERP components (i.e., N150, P150 and N250), being independent of disparity, which might reflect differences in early and late object cognition prior to the mental rotation process itself. This might be associated with the task-dependent activation of embodied cognition processes in mental rotation tasks.

In this sense, analyzing the evoked or phase activity can confirm results from traditional event-related potential (ERP) studies. However, studying the induced or nonphase activity may be necessary to elucidate hidden compensatory or affected cognitive mechanisms. In this study, 30 remitting-relapsing multiple sclerosis patients and 30 healthy controls (HCs) matched in sociodemographic variables performed a visual oddball task. The main goal was to analyze phase and nonphase alpha and gamma bands by applying temporal spectral evolution (TSE) and its potential relation with cognitive impairment in these patients. The behavioural results showed slower reaction time and poorer accuracy in MS patients compared to controls. In contrast, the time-frequency analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) revealed a delay in latency and lower amplitude in MS patients in evoked and induced alpha compared to controls. With respect to the gamma band, there were no differences between the groups. In summary, MS patients showed deficits in early sensorial (evoked alpha activity) and cognitive processing (induced alpha activity in longer latencies), whereas the induced gamma band supported the hypothesis of its role in translation of attentional focus (induced activity) and did not show strong activity in this paradigm (visual oddball).

Currently, the diagnosis is solely based on clinical observation of overt symptoms, and this can delay the detection of the disease and the timely start of appropriate treatment. Several candidate clinical tools have been studied to better characterize BPD, including event-related potentials (ERP). This review aimed at summarizing the results of the available ERP studies on BPD to clarify the possible application of this technique in the early diagnosis of BPD. Methods: A bibliographic search on PubMed and PsycInfo was performed in order to identify studies comprising individuals with BPD diagnosis and a control group that evaluated the ERP elicited by auditory stimuli. Results: Ten studies that explored various ERP components associated with auditory stimuli in BPD were included. Overall, the results showed that positive ERP (P50, P100, and P300) amplitude and latencies as well as loudness dependance were altered in BPD patients compared to controls, possibly reflecting deficits involving attention, mainly at its early stage, and executive functions. Limitations: The reviewed studies used different ERP approaches and non-homogeneous BPD diagnostic criteria. Conclusions: Auditory ERP appear to be a promising tool for the assessment of BPD patients, especially for early diagnosis and evaluation of cognitive symptoms.

A driver training simulator and scenario were developed to explore the capability of the P300 for this purpose. A user study was conducted with 32 participants divided into two groups objectively determined by driving performance scores, thus enabling observations of the P300 response to be equated to varying levels of learning and memory. Participant electroencephalogram data were recorded during the procedure, which was postprocessed to filter and extract ERPs to capture neural responses to specific events in the virtual training scenario. These were combined to produce a result for each participant, which was then grand averaged to create an overall ERP for each group. Across the eight electrode sites, statistically significant differences were found between the grand average waveforms of the two groups, with high memory retention producing significantly greater peak-to-peak amplitude (U = 9.00, p = 0.045), peak latency (U = 0.00, p < 0.001), and positive area (U = 13.00, p = 0.05) of the waveform than low memory retention. The evidenced relationship between the P300 response and working memory in this context suggests that it has the potential for monitoring learning and memory in stimulus-driven virtual training systems.

J	Simon, L; Blay, M; Galvao, F; Brunelin, J				Simon, Louis; Blay, Martin; Galvao, Filipe; Brunelin, Jerome			Using EEG to Predict Clinical Response to Electroconvulsive Therapy in Patients With Major Depression: A Comprehensive Review	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						depression; biomarker; major depression; prediction; EEG; ECT	ECT; BIOMARKERS; SLEEP; WAVE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; METAANALYSIS; DISORDERS; EFFICACY; IMPACT	Introduction: An important approach to improve the therapeutic effect of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be to early characterize patients who are more likely to respond. Our objective was to explore whether baseline electroencephalography (EEG) settings before the beginning of ECT treatment can predict future clinical response to ECT in patients with depressive disorder. Methods: We conducted a systematic search in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases to identify studies using EEG in adults with depressive disorder treated by ECT. To investigate the predictive value of baseline EEG on clinical outcomes of ECT, we extracted from the retrieved studies and qualitatively described the association between the baseline EEG markers characteristics and the rates of future responders and/or remitters to ECT. Results: The primary search yielded 2,531 potentially relevant citations, and 12 articles were selected according to inclusion criteria. Most of the studies were prospective studies with small sample size. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients, ECT settings, EEG settings, and outcomes were heterogeneous. Event-related potential (ERP) paradigms were used in three studies, polysomnography was used in three studies, and the six other studies used EEG to measure cerebral connectivity and activity. Conclusions: P300 amplitude, coherence, and connectivity measures were correlated with remission in patients with depression treated by ECT. Sleep EEG recordings seemed not to be correlated with remission after ECT. Further prospective studies with large sample size are needed to determine optimal EEG parameters associated with clinical response to ECT in depressive disorder.

To make the analysis and classification of emotions possible, emotions have been represented in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space represented by arousal and valence domains or arousal, valence and dominance domains, respectively. This paper presents the classification of emotions into four classes in an arousal-valence plane using the orthogonal nature of emotions. The average Event Related Potential (ERP) attributes and differential of average ERPs acquired from the frontal region of 24 subjects have been used to classify emotions into four classes. The attributes acquired from the frontal electrodes, viz., Fp1, Fp2, F3, F4, F8 and Fz, have been used for developing a classifier. The four-class subject-independent emotion classification results in the range of 67-83% have been obtained. Using three classifiers, a mid-range accuracy of 85% has been obtained, which is considerably better than existing studies on ERPs.

Participants were given a task designed to produce a high rate of errors while their brain waves were measured using electroencephalography (EEG). In the current study, we examined the relationship of anxious and avoidant attachment to the Error Related Negativity (ERN), an event related potential (ERP) waveform that is thought to be linked to response-error monitoring and emotional-regulation monitoring, using multiple regression analysis. Thirty-three participants completed the Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised (ECR-R) measure of attachment security and then performed a simple flanker task while EEG was recorded. We found that individuals high in avoidance showed a reduced ERN during this task, despite the lack of social or emotional cues in the task. Thus individuals who are more avoidantly attached are demonstrating less self-monitoring via a perceptual correlate of error detection during a task that elicits error-commission, even in situations devoid of social content.

Methods: 59 abstinent AUD patients and 20 healthy controls performed a Go/NoGo task incorporating alcohol-related and neutral stimuli during 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) recording, yielding four event-related potentials (ERP) per participant (NoGo-Alcohol, Go-Alcohol, NoGo-Neutral, Go Neutral). Whole-scalp randomization-based statistics assessed effects of the factors group (patients/controls or relapsers/abstainers), craving level, response type (NoGo/Go) and picture type (alcohol/neutral) on topography and signal strength of the ERP components N2 and P3. Results: No differences on group level were observed between patients and controls. However, analyses incorporating individual craving indicated that the topographic difference between alcohol-related and neutral NoGo-N2 components increased with craving. Moreover, topographic differences in the alcohol-related and neutral NoGo-P3 component allowed for differentiation between relapsers and abstainers. Conclusions: In alcohol-related contexts, the response inhibition conflict reflected in the NoGo-N2 seems enhanced in patients with high craving. The inhibition-sensitive NoGo-P3 varies in relapsers but not in abstainers between neutral and alcohol-related contexts. Significance: In AUD patients, neurophysiological correlates of inhibition vary with alcohol-related contexts and craving, and might be indicative of relapse risk.

Changes in the high-dimensional ERP signal throughout the duration of an experiment (longitudinally) is the main quantity of interest in learning paradigms, where they represent the learning dynamics. Typical analysis, which can be performed in the time or the frequency domain, average the ERP waveform across all trials, leading to the loss of the potentially valuable longitudinal information in the data. Longitudinal time-frequency transformation of ERP (LTFT-ERP) is proposed to retain information from both the time and frequency domains, offering distinct but complementary information on the underlying cognitive processes evoked, while still retaining the longitudinal dynamics in the ERP waveforms. LTFT-ERP begins by time-frequency transformations of the ERP data, collected across subjects, electrodes, conditions and trials throughout the duration of the experiment, followed by a data driven multidimensional principal components analysis (PCA) approach for dimension reduction. Following projection of the data onto leading directions of variation in the time and frequency domains, longitudinal learning dynamics are modeled within a mixed effects modeling framework. Applications to a learning paradigm in autism depict distinct learning patterns throughout the experiment among children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder and their typically developing peers. LTFT-ERP time-frequency joint transformations are shown to bring an additional level of specificity to interpretations of the longitudinal learning patterns related to underlying cognitive processes, which is lacking in single domain analysis (in the time or the frequency domain only). Simulation studies show the efficacy of the proposed methodology. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ozkara, BY				Ozkara, Behcet Yalin			The neural substrate of schadenfreude: The effects of competition level changes on the processing of pain in others	NEW IDEAS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Schadenfreude; Electroencephalography; Event related potentials; Empathy for pain	STEREOTYPE CONTENT; HUMAN EMPATHY; RESPONSES; ENVY; EMOTIONS; PLEASURE; INGROUP; MODEL	Schadenfreude is defined as the joy individuals feel as a result of the pain felt by opposing group members. In order to experience schadenfreude, it is not enough for the individual who is suffering to be a member of the opposing group, but also the perceived competitiveness level of the opposing group must be high. Although this basic assumption of Schadenfreude's competitiveness is confirmed by self-report-based techniques, there is no study in the literature addressing the subject's neural bases. The aim of this study is to test the competitiveness assumptions of schadenfreude using the electroencephalography-based ERP method. For this purpose, EEG recordings were taken of 40 individuals who expressed themselves as belonging to a political party while watching the outgroup and ingroup party members in pain. Perception of competition levels of outgroup and ingroup members were manipulated during the study. The results show that pain empathy for the suffering individuals changes in relation to the competition level. Particularly related changes have been observed in late ERP components known to be related to consciousness. In this context, our study contributes to the literature as the first confirmation of the assumptions of schadenfreude competitiveness level by neuroscientific methodology.

Methods: EEG was acquired using a mobile/wireless 9-channel system in 39 persons with HIV, with well controlled immune function and 63 healthy control participants (HCs) during three ERP tasks: sustained attention, focused attention, and divided attention. Results: The HIV-group evidenced smaller late positive potential (LPP) and larger P200 amplitudes across the tasks compared to the HC group. P200 amplitude was correlated (r = 0.56) with the estimated duration of infection. Both groups showed higher P200 and LPP amplitudes in response to infrequent stimuli; this effect was not significantly different between groups. In the sustained attention task, the HIV-group showed significantly slower reaction time than controls while maintaining the same level of accuracy. In the divided attention task, the HIV-group showed a trend towards faster/less accurate responses. Conclusions: HIV seropositive participants receiving anti-retroviral treatment (ART) demonstrated significantly larger P200 amplitude during three different attention tasks. This may reflect attentional deficits characterized by over-attending to non-target/distracting stimuli. Significance: These findings demonstrate the potential benefits of EEG-ERP metrics derived from attention tasks as neurocognitive biomarkers for HIV. This approach may reveal underlying causes of attentional deficits in HIV patients. (c) 2020 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Since P300 wave is a cognitive response across multiple brain channels correlated between the measured electroencephalogram (EEG) and deviant stimulus in a specific period, it requires a suitable signal processing application for interpretation. Moreover, multiple steps of data processing under neuroscience criteria make the P300 reflection difficult to analyze by common methods. Therefore, this study proposes the processing model for brainwave applications based on P300 peak signal detection in multiple brain channels. This study applies 64 channels ERP datasets throughout bandpass filter in fast Fourier transform (FFT) with the specific ranges of signal processing while ERP averaging is applied as a feature extraction method. Furthermore, the experimental metadata is applied with the filtered P300 peak signals in channel classification via a machine learning method, the Decision Tree. The experimental results indicate the accurate mental reflection of P300 evoked potential in different brain channels with high classification accuracy relying on the contrast condition throughout the original data source averaged across the individual electrodes.

NEUROIMAGE			English	Review						Reward; Feedback; Electroencephalography; Oscillations; Source separation	MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; GANGLIA DIFFERENTIATES REWARDS; MULTI-SUBJECT DECOMPOSITION; HUMAN OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; HIGHER-ORDER STATISTICS; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; BETA OSCILLATIONS	Understanding how the brain processes reward is an important and complex endeavor, which has involved the use of a range of complementary neuroimaging tools, including electroencephalography (EEG). EEG has been praised for its high temporal resolution but, because the signal recorded at the scalp is a mixture of brain activities, it is often considered to have poor spatial resolution. Besides, EEG data analysis has most often relied on event related potentials (ERPs) which cancel out non-phase locked oscillatory activity, thus limiting the functional discriminative power of EEG attainable through spectral analyses. Because these three dimensions-temporal, spatial and spectral-have been unequally leveraged in reward studies, we argue that the full potential of EEG has not been exploited. To back up our claim, we first performed a systematic survey of EEG studies assessing reward processing. Specifically, we report on the nature of the cognitive processes investigated (i.e., reward anticipation or reward outcome processing) and the methods used to collect and process the EEG data (i.e., event-related potential, time-frequency or source analyses). A total of 359 studies involving healthy subjects and the delivery of monetary rewards were surveyed. We show that reward anticipation has been overlooked (88% of studies investigated reward outcome processing, while only 24% investigated reward anticipation), and that time-frequency and source analyses (respectively reported by 19% and 12% of the studies) have not been widely adopted by the field yet, with ERPs still being the dominant methodology (92% of the studies). We argue that this focus on feedback-related ERPs provides a biased perspective on reward processing, by ignoring reward anticipation processes as well as a large part of the information contained in the EEG signal. Finally, we illustrate with selected examples how addressing these issues could benefit the field, relying on approaches combining time-frequency analyses, blind source separation and source localization.

Participants were 63 adolescent boys who have been followed since birth as part of a prospective longitudinal study on the developmental pathways to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). At 17 years of age, they completed the stop-signal task (SST) while electroencephalography (EEG) was continuously recorded. Inhibitory control was evaluated by the stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) as well as by the amplitude of the event-related potential (ERP) component of N2 during successful inhibition. We found that higher inattention symptoms throughout childhood predicted reduced amplitude (i.e., less negative) of the N2 in adolescence. Furthermore, the N2 amplitude was longitudinally predicted by the early precursors of child familial risk for ADHD and early childhood temperament. Specifically, father's inattention symptoms (measured in the child's early infancy) and child's effortful control at 36 months of age directly predicted the N2 amplitude in adolescence, even beyond the consistency of inattention symptoms throughout development. The SSRT was predicted by ADHD symptoms throughout childhood but not by the early precursors. Our findings emphasize the relevance of early familial and temperamental risk for ADHD to the prediction of a later dysfunction in inhibitory control.

Development and recovery time of mental fatigue and its impact on motor function	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Event related potentials; Frequency; Mental fatigue; motor function	EEG ALPHA; ATTENTION; INHIBITION; POTENTIALS; REFLECTS; ERP; OSCILLATIONS; COMPONENT; TASK; N2	Mental fatigue is commonplace but there is limited understanding of the neural underpinnings of its development, the time course of its recovery, and its impact on motor function. Hence, this study used neural (electroencephalography) and motor measures to investigate the development and recovery of mental fatigue. Twenty participants performed a 60-min N-back task, with neural activity compared within the task. Additionally, pretask neural and motor measures were compared to assessments beginning at 0, 30 and 60 min post-task. Alpha power increased during the task and was greater than baseline at 30 and 60 min post-task. Motor skills were impaired at similar to 10-17 min post-task but recovered at similar to 40-47 min. Using a unique combination of neural and motor measures, our results suggest that attentiveness and, possibly, selectiveness in inhibiting irrelevant information are impaired after an acute mentally-fatiguing task. Notably, recovery time differed for neural and motor measures.

Conventional clinical interviews or questionnaires can be biased and may not accurately diagnose at the early stage. A wearable electroencephalogram (EEG)-sensing headset paired with an examination procedure can be a potential user-friendly method to explore ICD-related signatures that can detect its early signs and progression by reflecting brain activity. Methods A stereotypical Go/NoGo test that targets impulse inhibition was performed on 59 individuals, including healthy controls, patients with PD, and patients with PD diagnosed by ICDs. We conducted two Go/NoGo sessions before and after the DA-pharmacological treatment for the PD and ICD groups. A low-cost LEGO-like EEG headset was used to record concurrent EEG signals. Then, we used the event-related potential (ERP) analytical framework to explore ICD-related EEG abnormalities after DA treatment. Results After the DA treatment, only the ICD-diagnosed PD patients made more behavioral errors and tended to exhibit the deterioration for the NoGo N2 and P3 peak amplitudes at fronto-central electrodes in contrast to the HC and PD groups. Particularly, the extent of the diminished NoGo-N2 amplitude was prone to be modulated by the ICD scores at Fz with marginal statistical significance (r = - 0.34, p = 0.07). Conclusions The low-cost LEGO-like EEG headset successfully captured ERP waveforms and objectively assessed ICD in patients with PD undergoing DA treatment. This objective neuro-evidence could provide complementary information to conventional clinical scales used to diagnose ICD adverse effects.

We measured within-subject (N = 10) event-related potential (ERP) changes during out-of-body imagery (OBI)-vivid imagery of a vertical line outside of the head/body-and within-body imagery (WBI)-vivid imagery of the line within one's own head. Furthermore, we measured ERP changes and line offset Vernier acuity (hyperacuity) performance concurrent with those imagery, compared to baseline detection without imagery. Relative to OEA baseline, OBI yielded larger N200 and P300, whereas WBI yielded larger P50, P100, N400, and P800. Additionally, hyperacuity dropped significantly when concurrent with both imagery types. Partial least squares analysis combined behavioural performance, ERPs, and/or event-related EEG band power (ERBP). For both imagery types, hyperacuity reduction correlated with opposite frontal and occipital ERP amplitude and polarity changes. Furthermore, ERP modulation and ERBP synchronizations for all EEG frequencies correlated inversely with hyperacuity. Dipole Source Localization Analysis revealed unique generators in the left middle temporal gyrus (WBI) and in the right frontal middle gyrus (OBI), whereas the common generators were in the left precuneus and middle occipital cortex (cuneus). Imagery experiences, we conclude, can be identified by symmetric and asymmetric combined neurophysiological-behavioural patterns in interactions with the width of attentional focus.

Developmental studies showed improvement of proprioceptive accuracy and timing adjustments of muscular events from childhood to adulthood in bimanual tasks. However, the cortical maturational changes related to bimanual coordination is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate cortical correlates underlying motor planning and upper limb stabilization performance at left (C3) and right (C4) sensorimotor cortices using event-related potential (ERP) analyses. We recruited 46 participants divided into four groups (12 children: 8-10 years, 13 early adolescents: 11-13 years, 11 late adolescents: 14-16 years and 10 young adults: 20-35 years). Participants performed a bimanual load-lifting task, where the left postural arm supported the load and the right motor arm lifted the load. Maximal amplitude of elbow rotation (MA%) of the postural arm, reaction time (RT) and EMG activity of biceps brachii bilaterally were computed. Laplacian-transformed ERPs of the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal response-locked to motor arm biceps EMG activity onset were analyzed over C3 and C4. We found a developmental effect for behavioral and EEG data denoted by significant decrease of MA% and RT with age, earlier inhibition of the biceps brachii of the postural arm in adults and earlier EEG activation/inhibition onset at C3/C4. Amplitude of the negative wave at C4 was higher in children and early adolescents compared to the other groups. In conclusion, we found a maturational process in cortical correlates related to motor planning and upper limb stabilization performance with interhemispheric lateralization appearing during adolescence. Findings may serve documenting bimanual performance in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. (C) 2021 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We performed a statistical analysis using Spearman's correlation between the EEG traits and the emotional information. We found that EEG traits had strong correlation with arousal and valence scores; also, common EEG traits with strong correlations, belonged to the theta band of the central channels. Then, we implemented a regression algorithm with feature selection to predict arousal and valence scores using EEG traits. We achieved better result for arousal regression, than for valence regression. EEG traits selected for arousal and valence regression belonged to time domain (standard deviation, complexity, mobility, kurtosis, skewness), and frequency domain (power spectral density-PDS, and differential entropy-DE from theta, alpha, beta, gamma, and all EEG frequency spectrum). Addressing game events, we found that EEG traits related with the theta, alpha and beta band had strong correlations. In addition, distinctive event-related potentials where identified in the presence of both types of game events. Finally, we implemented a classification algorithm to discriminate between positive and negative events using EEG traits to identify emotional information. We obtained good classification performance using only two traits related with frequency domain on the theta band and on the full EEG spectrum.

However, research indicates a narrowing of this TWI and an associated change in audiovisual integration in the course of development. Methods: To further elucidate audiovisual integration processes in adulthood, we compared adult participants with Asperger?s Syndrome (AS) to healthy controls (HC) by using the sound-induced double flash illusion. For a better understanding of underlying neural mechanisms, event-related potentials were measured via electroencephalography (EEG). Results: The number of reported sound-induced flash illusions indicated audiovisual integration. A similar TWI size for both, participants with AS and HC, was found. Additionally, enhanced P2 amplitudes were detected for participants with AS compared to HC. Conclusion: Results indicate an involvement of attentional processes in audiovisual perception in participants with AS.

Using an incidental go/no-go priming paradigm, we have previously shown a facilitation effect for the execution of a walking-related action in response to far vs. near objects/locations in the extrapersonal space, and this effect has been called "macro-affordance " to reflect the role of locomotion in the coverage of extrapersonal distance. Here, we investigated the neurophysiological underpinnings of such an effect by recording scalp electroencephalography (EEG) from 30 human participants during the same paradigm. The results of a whole-brain analysis indicated a significant modulation of the event-related potentials (ERPs) both during prime and target stimulus presentation. Specifically, consistent with a mechanism of action anticipation and automatic activation of affordances, a stronger ERP was observed in response to prime images framing the environment from a far vs. near distance, and this modulation was localized in dorso-medial motor regions. In addition, an inversion of polarity for far vs. near conditions was observed during the subsequent target period in dorso-medial parietal regions associated with spatially directed foot-related actions. These findings were interpreted within the framework of embodied models of brain functioning as arising from a mechanism of motor-anticipation and subsequent prediction error which was guided by the preferential affordance relationship between the distant large-scale environment and locomotion. More in general, our findings reveal a sensory-motor mechanism for the processing of walking-related environmental affordances.

In infancy, social exchanges are thought to be critical for optimal brain development. This systematic review explores this association by drawing together infant studies that relate adult-infant behaviours - coded from their social interactions - to children's brain measures collected during a neuroimaging session in infancy, childhood, adolescence or adulthood. In total, we identified 55 studies that explored associations between infants' social interactions and neural measures. These studies show that several aspects of caregiver-infant behaviours are associated with, or predict, a variety of neural responses in infants, children and adolescents. The presence of both concurrent and long-term associations - some of which are first observed just a few months postnatally and extend into adulthood - open an important research avenue and motivate further longitudinal studies.

Modulation of the Neurophysiological Response to Fearful and Stressful Stimuli Through Repetitive Religious Chanting	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article							EMOTION; BRAIN; MINDFULNESS; DYNAMICS; IMPACT; TRIAL	In neuropsychological experiments, the late positive potential (LPP) is an event-related potential (ERP) component that reflects the level of one's emotional arousal. This study investigates whether repetitive religious chanting modulates the emotional response to fear- and stress-provoking stimuli, thus leading to a less responsive LPP. Twentyone participants with at least one year of experience in the repetitive religious chanting of "Amitabha Buddha" were recruited. A 128-channel electroencephalography (EEG) system was used to collect EEG data. The participants were instructed to view negative or neutral pictures selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) under three conditions: repetitive religious chanting, repetitive nonreligious chanting, and no chanting. The results demonstrated that viewing the negative fearand stress-provoking pictures induced larger LPPs in the participants than viewing neutral pictures under the no-chanting and nonreligious chanting conditions. However, this increased LPP largely disappeared under repetitive religious chanting conditions. The findings indicate that repetitive religious chanting may effectively alleviate the neurophysiological response to fearful or stressful situations for practitioners.

A total of 50 female participants, including 27 who were parous (33.2 +/- 3.2 years) and 23 who were nulliparous (30.8 +/- 2.3 years), were recruited. Only parous females who were <= 36 months postpartum (17.7 +/- 8.1 months) were included. To compare the cognitive performance between the two groups, we presented the 3-back task (a working memory task) and compared the accuracy rate (%) and reaction time (ms) between the groups. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were simultaneously recorded and the ERP patterns at Fz, Cz, and Pz, which are highly associated with the 3-back task, were analyzed. From the ERP patterns, we extracted N100, P300, P600, P300 peak-to-peak (P300p_p), and P600 peak-to-peak (P600p_p). There were no significant between-group differences in terms of accuracy rate, reaction time, or ERP components (N100, P300, P600, P300p_p, or P600p_p) at the three sites (Fz, Cz, and Pz). Since this study, using meaningful objective data, did not show that parity was significantly correlated with cognitive performance ability and ERP patterns, childbirth does not appear to influence cognitive decline.

In recent years, semi-supervised learning (SSL) has attracted attention for visual event-related potential (ERP)-based BCIs and motor-imagery BCIs as an effective technique that can adapt to the variations in patterns among subjects and trials. The applications of the SSL techniques are expected to improve the performance of auditory ERP-based BCIs as well. However, there is no conclusive evidence supporting the positive effect of SSL techniques on auditory ERP-based BCIs. If the positive effect could be verified, it will be helpful for the BCI community. In this study, we assessed the effects of SSL techniques on two public auditory BCI datasets-AMUSE and PASS2D-using the following machine learning algorithms: step-wise linear discriminant analysis, shrinkage linear discriminant analysis, spatial temporal discriminant analysis, and least-squares support vector machine. These backbone classifiers were firstly trained by labeled data and incrementally updated by unlabeled data in every trial of testing data based on SSL approach. Although a few data of the datasets were negatively affected, most data were apparently improved by SSL in all cases. The overall accuracy was logarithmically increased with every additional unlabeled data. This study supports the positive effect of SSL techniques and encourages future researchers to apply them to auditory ERP-based BCIs.

Romantic love affects emotional processing of love-unrelated stimuli: An EEG/ERP study using a love induction task	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Romantic love; Love Induction Task; Event-related potentials; EEG alpha band	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; ERP EVIDENCE; NEURAL BASIS; ASYMMETRY; ATTENTION; OSCILLATIONS; COVARIATION; REAPPRAISAL; PERCEPTION	The aim of the present study was to investigate (a) the neural correlates of a love induction task (LIT) including listening to love-related songs and thinking about the romantic relationship, and (b) the effects of romantic love on the emotional processing of love-unrelated stimuli during a passive viewing task. The EEG was recorded in two groups of university students: people in love (Love Group, LG, N = 22, 19 F) and people not in love (Control Group, CG, N = 20, 15 F). The LIT induced higher pleasantness and arousal in the LG than in the CG, as well as higher alpha activity in occipital-right electrodes, suggesting active mental imagery and internal focused attention. During the picture viewing task, the LG displayed larger N1 amplitudes than the CG in response to unpleasant pictures, and lower amplitudes of the late positive potential to both pleasant and unpleasant pictures at frontal sites. Overall, these results suggest an early attentional modulation of the neural responses to unpleasant, mood-incongruent cues, followed by an implicit emotional down-regulation of arousing stimuli, which might have important implications for everyday attitudes and behaviors.

The hardware is based on the integration of low-cost components, while the signal processing algorithms combine discrete wavelet transform and linear discriminant analysis. We consider different parameters: nine different wavelets and two features extraction strategies. A set of experiments performed in real scenarios allows to compare the performance in order to determine a configuration with high accuracy and short response delay.

Infant EEG data differs in many ways from adult EEG data, but there exists almost no specific system for automated classification of source components from paediatric populations. Here, we adapt one of the most popular systems for adult ICA component classification for use with infant EEG data. Our adapted classifier significantly outperformed the original adult classifier on samples of naturalistic free play EEG data recorded from 10 to 12-month-old infants, achieving agreement rates with the manual classification of over 75% across two validation studies (n = 44, n = 25). Additionally, we examined both classifiers' ability to remove stereotyped ocular artifact from a basic visual processing ERP dataset compared to manual ICA data cleaning. Here, the new classifier performed on level with expert manual cleaning and was again significantly better than the adult classifier at removing artifact whilst retaining a greater amount of genuine neural signal operationalised through comparing ERP activations in time and space. Our new system (iMARA) offers developmental EEG researchers a flexible tool for automatic identification and removal of artifactual ICA components.	[Haresign, I.

In particular, investigation of P300 brainwaves is relevant due to its ease of use in the context of BCI. Though high-accuracy models have been developed for individual subjects under laboratory controlled conditions, further work is required to improve the robustness of the models especially for more varied conditions. Here we propose an adaptive chirplet transform (ACT) algorithm coupled with an artificial neural network for robust P300 classification. Comparison of the proposed method with conventional downsampling methods for feature extraction showed an black80% and 73% accuracy respectively when a neural network model was fit to a collection of 16 subject's P300 data. Meanwhile, accuracies of up to 100% could be achieved when the model was trained and validated on subject-specific datasets with the same averaging techniques. This investigation makes it clear that the adaptive chirplet transform holds promise for addressing issues of reliability and robustness in P300 BCI and other related brain signal processing tasks.

The apparatus used photographs of road sign related driving scenes as visual stimuli, and a customised EEG, eye tracking, and keyboard synchronised system. The results embraced a wider range of reaction time variation compared to similar work in the literature. In addition, the images used in this study include more complexity which explains the difference. The current experiment setup can reconstruct the P3 component using the response-locked averaging. This is then compared with the stimulus-locked averaging and a strong correlation is shown between the two approaches. This shows that response-locked averaging can be utilised as a sufficient tool to identify driver's visual stimuli registration in the brain. This observation may reduce the requirement for eye tracking in some future studies.

By using the event-related potential (ERP) technique, we sought to: (1) study the temporal dynamics of empathic responses in patients with PD; (2) explore whether dopaminergic medication modulates empathic processing. Methods: Twenty-six patients with early-to-moderate PD (13 on- and 13 off-medication) and 14 healthy controls performed an empathy-for-pain paradigm test while we recorded their electroencephalography. The participants responded to neutral or painful pictures during an active empathic condition (pain judgment task) and a control condition that was manipulated by task demands (laterality judgment task). Results: The ERP results demonstrated an early automatic frontal response and a late controlled parietal response to pain in healthy elderly controls. The observed early and late ERP responses were detected in the on-medication patients but not in the off-medication patients. Conclusions: PD is associated with deficits in both affective and cognitive empathic responses, dopaminergic medication may have the potential to alleviate these deficits. Significance: This study helps to understand empathic deficits in patients with PD. Within-subject studies are required to reliably assess the effect of dopaminergic medication on empathic processing.

Although 25 per cent of people worldwide suffer from PSA, there is currently a lack of standardized assessment or biomarkers to detect emotion-cognition abnormalities in individuals with PSA. Material/Methods: RT and ERP were compared between 12 subjects with high (H) PSA and 12 subjects with low (L) PSA in the ECEF experiment. EEG was recorded with the 14-channel Emotiv EPOC+. Results: RT data showed a significant Flanker Effect across groups in the neutral and emotional (PSA-related) conditions, with increased Flanker effect in the HPSA group. On average, LPSA subjects were faster than the HPSA subjects in the ECEF task. HPSA subjects showed aberrant ERP responses in two ways. Firstly in the reversed N200 conflict effect with increased frontocentral amplitude in the incongruent compared to the congruent condition. Secondly, in the absence of the P200 frontocentral emotional modulation found in LPSA subjects. In the HPSA group, decreased P200 amplitude is significantly related to impaired behavioral performance in the neutral congruent condition. Conclusions: RT and ERP are useful in modern medicine because they successfully unveiled the biomarkers of abnormalities during the interaction of emotion and cognition. Impaired conflict processing in PSA-related conditions was found at the N200 and P200 windows in HPSA individuals.

Methods: We conducted a prospective study on all DOC patients evaluated during the 2009-2018 period. Behavioral examination included Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) scores and bedside high-density EEG recordings. Consciousness recovery was evaluated at 6 months by a structured phone interview. The predictive value of a GE+ was calculated both on survivors and on all patients. Results: A total of 236 patients with a documented outcome and technically valid EEG recordings could be included. Among them, 66 patients had a GE+ status (28%). Presence of GE+ predicted behaviorally overt consciousness recovery in survivors with high specificity (Sp = 84%) and high positive predictive value (PPV = 80%) but with low sensitivity (Se = 35%) and low negative predictive value (NPV = 42%). Positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of GE+ was superior to LR+ of initial clinical status and of ERP effect indexing unconscious auditory processing [local effect (LE)]. Interpretation: Our results demonstrate that the presence of a bedside ERP GE+ is highly predictive of behaviorally overt consciousness recovery in DOC patients, regardless of the delay, of behavioral status, and of the etiology of brain dysfunction. However, the absence of this effect is not a reliable predictor of negative outcome. This study provides Class III evidence that the presence of an ERP "global effect" predicts consciousness recovery in DOC patients.

As such, it is becoming increasingly important to develop methods to accurately quantify cannabis intoxication and its associated impairments on cognitive and motor function. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a non-invasive method for quantitatively assessing neurophysiological biomarkers of intoxication and impairment with a high degree of temporal resolution. Twelve healthy, young recreational cannabis users completed a series of neurocognitive tasks with concurrent EEG acquisition using the ABM STAT X24 EEG headset in a within-subject counterbalanced design. The 1-h testbed consisted of resting state tasks and tests of attention and memory. Spectral densities were computed for resting state tasks, and event-related potentials (ERPs) were obtained for the attention and memory tasks. Theta band power (3-5 Hz) was decreased during cannabis intoxication compared to placebo during resting state tasks, as were average P400 and late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes during attention and memory tasks. Cannabis intoxication was also associated with elevated frontal coherence and diminished anterior-posterior coherence in the Theta frequency band. This work highlights the utility of EEG to identify and quantify neurophysiological biomarkers from recordings obtained during a short neurocognitive testbed as a method for profiling cannabis intoxication. These biomarkers may prove efficacious in distinguishing intoxicated from non-intoxicated individuals in lab and real-world settings.

Methods: As part of a longitudinal study of early child development, we used the auditory oddball stimulus paradigm with a portable electroencephalography system to obtain ERP data from two-month-old infants (32 term, six preterm) in Sri Lanka. The mismatch negativity was calculated between 200 and 350 milliseconds after stimulus presentation. Results: We found a significant correlation between birth weight and mismatch negativity (P = 0.046), and our time-frequency analysis indicated power differences between standard and oddball tones at approximately 5 and 18 Hz. There was no significant difference between mismatch negativity in children undergoing ERP studies in a hospital setting (30) versus in the child's home (eight). Conclusions: Although our modest sample size precludes drawing definitive conclusions, these preliminary results show that it is possible to acquire ERP datasets using currently available portable technology in a hospital or home setting, even in a developing nation such as Sri Lanka. Follow-up of this cohort will include developmental assessments, which will add to the growing literature relating early electrophysiology to developmental outcome. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

REASSESSING SYNTAX- RELATED ERP COMPONENTS USING POPULAR MUSIC CHORD SEQUENCES: A MODEL-BASED APPROACH	MUSIC PERCEPTION			English	Article						EEG; ERP; music and language; cognitive neuroscience; statistical learning	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN RESPONSES; LANGUAGE; EXPECTATION; PERCEPTION; MEMORY; REPRESENTATION; NEGATIVITY; DYNAMICS; MELODIES	ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC RESPONSES TO unexpected musical events allow researchers to test listeners' internal models of syntax. One major challenge is dissociating cognitive syntactic violations-based on the abstract identity of a particular musical structure-from unexpected acoustic features. Despite careful controls in past studies, recent work by Bigand, Delbe, PoulinCarronnat, Leman, and Tillmann (2014) has argued that ERP findings attributed to cognitive surprisal cannot be unequivocally separated from sensory surprisal. Here we report a novel EEG paradigm that uses three auditory short-term memory models and one cognitive model to predict surprisal as indexed by several ERP components (ERAN, N5, P600, and P3a), directly comparing sensory and cognitive contributions. Our paradigm parameterizes a large set of stimuli rather than using categorically "high'' and "low'' surprisal conditions, addressing issues with past work in which participants may learn where to expect violations and may be biased by local context. The cognitive model (Harrison & Pearce, 2018) predicted higher P3a amplitudes, as did Leman's (2000) model, indicating both sensory and cognitive contributions to expectation violation. However, no model predicted ERAN, N5, or P600 amplitudes, raising questions about whether traditional interpretations of these ERP components generalize to broader collections of stimuli or rather are limited to less naturalistic stimuli.

It can be used in speller, image retrieval, anomaly detection, etc. RSVP paradigm uses a small number of target pictures in a high speed presented picture sequence to induce specific event-related potential (ERP) components. However, the application of RSVP based BCI is challenged by the accuracy of ERP detection. Thus, the goal of this study is to introduce other related modalities to the traditional EEG-based BCI to make robust predictions and improve the detection performance. First, we introduce the eye movement modality into the RSVP-based BCI and collect a multi-modality RSVP-based dataset simultaneously during the image retrieval task. Second, we design a simple but efficient CNN-based network with two modality fusion modules to fully utilize the multi-modality data in two stages. In the feature extraction stage, we propose a Cross-modality-Guided Feature Calibration (cm-GFC) module to enable the EEG modality feature to modify the eye movement modality feature, and the aim is to make eye movement modality features and EEG modality features are more complementary. In the feature fusion stage, we propose a Dynamic Gated Fusion (DGF) module, which applies modality-specific gates to retain the complementary information of the two modalities and reduce redundant information from the two modalities. To evaluate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on the dataset with EEG and eye movement data are from 20 subjects. The proposed method achieves a high balanced accuracy of 87.83 +/- 2.31% of classification, which outperforms a series of single modality and multi-modality approaches.

Burgeoning behavioural evidence indicates that a caregiver who provides contingently timed vocal responses to infant vocalisations provides key support for early language development. Understanding how contingently timed vocal responses relate to neurodevelopment in early infancy is lacking. This study compares event-related potentials (ERPs) to contingent and non-contingently timed vocalisations in 6- and 9-month-old infants (n = 36), and adults (n = 24). ERPs were recorded from each age group while listening to a naturalistic 21-minute recording of a mother playing and conversing with her baby. At 6-months, infants showed a significant positive ERP response to contingent vocalisations by the mother and infant. At 9-months infants showed negative ERP response to the mother?s contingent speech. Adults showed no differences in ERPs between contingent and non-contingent speech regardless of the talker. We interpret the increased positivity in response to contingent speech as suggesting that infants show an attentional response at 6months, and the increased negativity at 9-months relates to lexical-semantic processing. Further work is necessary to confirm the development of distinct ERPs shown in response to natural speech.

The present study overcame these restrictions by mobile electroencephalography (EEG) and data-driven analysis approaches during a real-world navigation task. During assisted navigation through an unfamiliar city environment, participants received either standard or landmark-based auditory navigation instructions. EEG data were recorded continuously during navigation. Saccade- and blink-events as well as gait-related EEG activity were extracted from sensor level data. Brain activity associated with the navigation task was identified by subsequent source-based cleaning of non-brain activity and unfolding of overlapping event-related potentials. When navigators received landmark-based instructions compared to those receiving standard navigation instructions, the blink-related brain potentials during navigation revealed higher amplitudes at fronto-central leads in a time window starting at 300 ms after blinks, which was accompanied by improved spatial knowledge acquisition tested in follow-up spatial tasks. Replicating improved spatial knowledge acquisition from previous experiments, the present study revealed eye movement-related brain potentials to point to the involvement of higher cognitive processes and increased processing of incoming information during periods of landmark-based instructions. The study revealed neuronal correlates underlying visuospatial information processing during assisted navigation in the real-world providing a new analysis approach for neuroscientific research in freely moving participants in uncontrollable real-world environments.

Recently, various deep learning-based methods have been proposed to improve the performance of P300 event-related potentials (ERPs) for BCI. However, during the detection of P300 ERP signals, even electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from the same person are inconsistent and may be significantly distorted, resulting in impaired classification accuracy in many deep learning methods. Here, we propose a machine learning model based on a one-dimensional convolutional capsule network (1D-CapsNet). This network topology can effectively detect P300 ERP signals in the time domain, thereby achieving a better detection performance than can the current convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods. Two classifiers based on the 1D-CapsNet model are proposed, namely, 1D-CapsNet-64 and 1D-CapsNet-8, which are used for classifying EEG data with 64 and 8 electrodes, respectively. These two classifiers are tested and compared on dataset II of the third BCI competition. The results show that the 1D-CapsNet-64 classifier obtains the best character recognition rate result (96%). The proposed method is superior to both state-of-the-art CNN-based methods and various traditional machine learning methods. The experimental results reveal the feasibility of our proposed method for detecting P300 ERP signals. The proposed method is expected to expand the concept of EEG signal recognition pattern and improve BCI design and applications.

Methods: EEG after discontinuation of sedation in all patients, and somesthesic evoked potentials and brainstem auditive evoked potentials when EEG did not show reactivity, were performed. Clinical outcome was assessed at day 7 and 14 after neurophysiological explorations. Results: 33 patients were included for analysis. We found slowed background activity in 85% of cases, unreactive activity in 42% of cases, low-voltage activity in 21% of cases and rhythmic or periodic delta waves in 61% of cases. EEG epileptic events were never recorded. Clinical outcome at day 14 was associated with unreactive background activity and tended to be associated with rhythmic or periodic delta waves and with low-voltage activity. Results of multimodal evoked potentials were in favor of a preservation of central nervous system somatosensory and auditory functions. Conclusions: Among critical COVID-19 patients with abnormal arousal at discontinuation of sedation, EEG patterns consistent with encephalopathy are found and are predictive for short term clinical outcome. Significance: The abnormal EEG with presence of periodic discharges and lack of reactivity could be related to encephalopathy linked to COVID-19.

To investigate this question, brain potential changes via electroencephalography (EEG) and skin conductance responses (SCR) were taken within this study, while participants were exposed to pre-rated pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant pictures, which they had to rate in terms of their perceived arousal. Crucially, they had to-in respective runs-do this alone and in the presence of a significant other. Contrasting respective event-related potentials (ERPs) revealed significantly more negative going potentials peaking at 708 ms post stimulus onset at mid-frontal electrode locations (around FPz and AFz), when participants were exposed to neutral pictures while in the presence of a significant other. SCR results demonstrate higher states of arousal in the presence of a significant other regardless of picture emotion category. Self-reported arousal turned out to be highest in response to neutral pictures within the significant other condition, whereas in the alone condition in response to the pleasant pictures. In light of existing literature on social aspects and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the ERP finding in the significant other condition, while rating emotionally neutral pictures, is interpreted as reflecting heightened ACC activation, which is supported by electrode locations showing significant brain activity differences as well as by source localization results. Neutral pictures are inherently ambiguous, and the current results indicate the presence of another person to change the way one processes, perceives, and acts on them. This is in support for theories proposing the ACC to be part of a larger signal-specification network that gauges relevant stimuli for adequate execution of control.

Only a few studies have investigated fraction processing using EEG methods. In the present study, 24 adult participants completed a fraction magnitude verification task while EEGs were recorded. Similar to other arithmetic verification tasks, behavioral results show increased response times to validate mismatching magnitudes compared to matching ones. ERP results show an early frontal N270 component to mismatching trials and a late parietal P300 component during matching trials. These ERP results highlight that participants treat matching fractions as targets and suggest that additional cognitive resources are needed to process mismatching targets. These results provide evidence that fractions processing shares a similar neurocognitive process as those observed during the processing of arithmetic operations and open the door to further explore fraction processing using ERP methods.

Both internal models and the predictions derived from them are based on previous experience. However, it remains unclear how previously encoded information is maintained to support this function, especially in the visual domain. In the present study, we hypothesized that sleep consolidates newly encoded spatio-temporal regularities to improve predictions afterwards. Methods: We tested this hypothesis using a novel sequence-learning paradigm that aimed to dissociate perceptual from motor learning. We recorded behavioral performance and high-density electroencephalography (EEG) in male human participants during initial training and during testing two days later, following an experimental night of sleep (n = 16, including high-density EEG recordings) or wakefulness (n = 17). Results: Our results show sleep-dependent behavioral improvements correlated with sleep-spindle activity specifically over occipital cortices. Moreover, event-related potential (ERP) responses indicate a shift of attention away from predictable to unpredictable sequences after sleep, consistent with enhanced automaticity in the processing of predictable sequences. Conclusions: These findings suggest a sleep-dependent improvement in the prediction of visual sequences, likely related to visual cortex reactivation during sleep spindles. Considering that controls in our experiments did not fully exclude oculomotor contributions, future studies will need to address the extent to which these effects depend on purely perceptual versus oculomotor sequence learning.

However, most airborne chemicals are bimodal in nature, encompassing both properties. Moreover, there is an ongoing debate regarding whether there is one dominant nostril, and this could be investigated using these multichannel EEG methods. In this study, 18 right-handed, healthy participants (13 females) were monorhinally stimulated using an olfactometer with the bimodal component acetic acid during continuous EEG recording. Participants indicated the side of stimulation, the confidence in their decision, and rated the strength of the evoked perception. EEG microstate clustering determined four distinct maps and successive backfitting procedures, and source estimations revealed a network that evolved from visual-spatial processing areas to brain areas related to basic olfactory and trigeminal sensations (e.g., thalamus, cingulate cortex, insula, parahippocampal, and pre-/post-central gyri) and resulted in activation of areas involved in multisensory integration (e.g., frontal-temporal areas). Right-nostril stimulation was associated with faster microstate transition and longer involvement of the superior temporal gyrus, which was previously linked to chemical localization and provides evidence for a potential nostril dominance. The results describe for the first time the processing cascade of bimodal odor perception using microstate analyses and demonstrate its feasibility to further investigate potential nostril dominance.

This so-called semantic congruence effect has been broadly studied in healthy young adults with a focus on neural encoding mechanisms. However, the impacts on retrieval, and possible impairments during healthy aging, which is typically associated with changes in declarative long-term memory, remain unclear. To investigate these issues, we used a previously established paradigm in healthy young and older humans with a focus on the neural activity at a final retrieval stage as measured with electroencephalography (EEG). In both age groups, semantic congruence at encoding enhanced subsequent long-term recognition memory of words. Compatible with this observation, semantic congruence led to differences in event-related potentials (ERPs) at retrieval, and this effect was not modulated by age. Specifically, congruence modulated old/new ERPs at a fronto-central (Fz) and left parietal (P3) electrode in a late (400-600 ms) time window, which has previously been associated with recognition memory processes. Importantly, ERPs to old items also correlated with the positive effect of semantic congruence on long-term memory independent of age. Together, our findings suggest that semantic congruence drives subsequent recognition memory across the lifespan through changes in neural retrieval processes.</p>	[Alejandro, Ricardo J.; Packard, Pau A.; Steiger, Tineke K.; Bunzeck, Nico] Univ Lubeck, Dept Psychol, Lubeck, Germany; [Alejandro, Ricardo J.] Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Psychol, Ghent, Belgium; [Packard, Pau A.] Univ Pompeu Fabra Roc Boronat, Ctr Brain & Cognit, Dept Informat & Commun Technol, Barcelona, Spain; [Fuentemilla, Lluis] Hosp Llobregat, Bellvitge Biomed Res Inst IDIBELL, Cognit & Brain Plast Grp, Barcelona, Spain; [Fuentemilla, Lluis] Univ Barcelona, Dept Cognit Dev & Educ Psychol, Barcelona, Spain; [Fuentemilla, Lluis] Univ Barcelona, Inst Neurosci, Barcelona, Spain; [Bunzeck, Nico] Univ Lubeck, Ctr Brain Behav & Metab CBBM, Ratzeburger Allee, Lubeck, Germany		Alejandro, RJ; Bunzeck, N (corresponding author), Univ Lubeck, Dept Psychol, Lubeck, Germany.; Alejandro, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Psychol, Ghent, Belgium.; Bunzeck, N (corresponding author), Univ Lubeck, Ctr Brain Behav & Metab CBBM, Ratzeburger Allee, Lubeck, Germany.	ricardo.alejandrobenavides@UGent.be; nico.bunzeck@uni-luebeck.de		Packard, Pau/0000-0003-4795-5704; Bunzeck, Nico/0000-0001-8834-450X	German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) [BU 2670/7-1, 2670/7-2]	German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft)(German Research Foundation (DFG))	This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant BU 2670/7-1 and 2670/7-2 to NB).		115	1	1	3	5	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND	1663-4365			FRONT AGING NEUROSCI	Front.

Different people have different latency and amplitude of the P300 event-related potential (ERP) component, which is used as the main feature for detecting the target character. In order to achieve robust results for different subjects using generic training (GT), the ensemble learning classifiers are proposed based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed models are trained using data from healthy subjects and tested on both healthy subjects and ALS patients. The results show that the fusion of LDA, kNN and SVM provides the most accurate results, achieving the accuracy of 99% for healthy subjects and about 85% for ALS patients.

After stimulating a sensory organ, a positive deflection of the EEG signal between 250 and 700 ms can be measured. This signal component of the event-related potential (ERP) is called "P300." Numerous studies have provided evidence that the P300 amplitude and latency are linked to sensory perception, engagement, and cognition. Combining the advances in technology, classification methods, and signal processing, we developed a novel image ranking system called the Unicorn Blondy Check. In this study, the application was tested on 21 subjects using three different visual oddball paradigms. Two consisted of female faces and gray-scale images, while the third test paradigm consisted of familiar and unfamiliar faces. The images were displayed for a duration of 150 ms in a randomized order. The system was trained using 50 trials and tested with 30 trials. The EEG data were acquired using the Unicorn Hybrid Black eight-channel BCI system. These synchronized recordings were analyzed, and the achieved classification accuracies were calculated. The EEG signal was averaged over all participants and for every paradigm separately. Analysis of the EEG data revealed a significant shift in the P300 latency dependent on the paradigm and decreased amplitude for a lower target to non-target ratio. The image ranking application achieved a mean accuracy of 100 and 95.5% for ranking female faces above gray-scale images with ratios of 1:11 and 5:11, respectively. In the case of four familiar faces to 24 unfamiliar faces, 86.4% was reached. The obtained results illustrate this novel system's functionality due to accuracies above chance levels for all subjects.

However, extracting EEG features which are consistent in indicating MWL across different tasks is still one of the critical challenges. This study attempts to compare the cross-task consistency in indexing MWL variations between two commonly used EEG-based MWL indicators, power spectral density (PSD) of ongoing EEG and task-irrelevant auditory ERPs (tir-aERPs). The verbal N-back and the multi-attribute task battery (MATB), both with two difficulty levels, were employed in the experiment, along with task-irrelevant auditory probes. EEG was recorded from 17 subjects when they were performing the tasks. The tir-aERPs elicited by the auditory probes and the relative PSDs of ongoing EEG between two consecutive auditory probes were extracted and statistically analyzed to reveal the effects of MWL and task type. Discriminant analysis and support vector machine were employed to examine the generalization of tir-aERP and PSD features in indexing MWL variations across different tasks. The results showed that the amplitudes of tir-aERP components, N1, early P3a, late P3a, and the reorienting negativity, significantly decreased with the increasing MWL in both N-back and MATB. Task type had no obvious influence on the amplitudes and topological layout of the MWL-sensitive tir-aERP features. The relative PSDs in theta, alpha, and low beta bands were also sensitive to MWL variations. However, the MWL-sensitive PSD features and their topological patterns were significantly affected by task type. The cross-task classification results based on tir-aERP features also significantly outperformed the PSD features. These results suggest that the tir-aERPs should be potentially more consistent MWL indicators across very different task types when compared to PSD. The current study may provide new insights to our understanding of the common and distinctive neuropsychological essences of MWL across different tasks.

Previous studies suggested that it can be regarded as impaired response inhibition and salience attribution syndrome (iRISA). The neural substrates of the two deficit functions were widely investigated in neuroimaging studies, and the impaired prefrontal cortex, limbic-orbitofrontal network, and fronto-insular-parietal network were observed. Previous Event-related potential (ERP) studies were also conducted to explore EEG indexes related to abnormal brain function. In the current meta-analysis, we aimed to explore the consistency of ERP indexes that can reflect the two aberrant processes: P300/slow potential (SP) for salience attribution and Errorrelated negativity (ERN)/Nogo-N200/Nogo-P300 for inhibitory control and conflict monitoring. Subgroup analyses for drug type and drug use conditions were also conducted. According to the 60 research studies, we found significantly enhanced drug-cue-induced P300 amplitude and attenuated Nogo-N200 amplitude in SUD individuals relative to Healthy control (HC), which supports the dual model. Moreover, the drug-cue-induced P300 displayed time-dependence recovery, suggesting a potential index for treatment evaluation. In conclusion, drugcue-induced P300 and Nogo-N200 demonstrated high consistency, and the drug-cue-induced P300 can be used to track the changes of functional recovery for SUD. The integration of the two ERP components could be regarded as a potential biomarker for SUD, which may provide a new insight for clinical treatment and investigation.

However, the neural mechanism underlying the effect of eye gaze direction on emotional mimicry is unclear. Here, we explored how eye gaze direction influenced emotional mimicry with a combination of electromyography (EMG) and electroencephalography (EEG) techniques, which may provide a more comprehensive measure. To do this, we recorded facial EMG and scalp EEG signals simultaneously while participants observed emotional faces (happy vs. angry) with direct or averted gaze. Then, we split the EEG trials into two mimicry intensity categories (high mimicry intensity, HMI vs. low mimicry intensity, LMI) according to EMG activity. The ERP difference between HMI and LMI EEG trials revealed four ERP components (P50, P150, N200 and P300), and the effect of eye gaze direction on emotional mimicry was prominent on P300 at P7 and P8. Moreover, we also observed differences in the effect of eye gaze direction on mimicry of happy faces and angry faces, which were found on P300 at P7, as well as P150 at P7 and N200 at P7 and Pz. In short, the present study isolated the neural signals of emotional mimicry with a new multimodal method, and provided empirical neural evidence that eye gaze direction affected emotional mimicry.

Eliciting and Recording Event Related Potentials (ERPs) in Behaviourally Unresponsive Populations: A Retrospective Commentary on Critical Factors	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						disorders of consciousness; electroencephalography; N400; P3b; event related potentials	MINIMALLY CONSCIOUS STATE; COMPLEX SOUND SEQUENCES; SUBJECTS OWN NAME; VEGETATIVE STATE; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; RECEPTIVE VOCABULARY; REPLY REPLICABILITY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; LEXICAL DECISION; NEURAL RESPONSES	A consistent limitation when designing event-related potential paradigms and interpreting results is a lack of consideration of the multivariate factors that affect their elicitation and detection in behaviorally unresponsive individuals. This paper provides a retrospective commentary on three factors that influence the presence and morphology of long-latency event-related potentials-the P3b and N400. We analyze event-related potentials derived from electroencephalographic (EEG) data collected from small groups of healthy youth and healthy elderly to illustrate the effect of paradigm strength and subject age; we analyze ERPs collected from an individual with severe traumatic brain injury to illustrate the effect of stimulus presentation speed. Based on these critical factors, we support that: (1) the strongest paradigms should be used to elicit event-related potentials in unresponsive populations; (2) interpretation of event-related potential results should account for participant age; and (3) speed of stimulus presentation should be slower in unresponsive individuals. The application of these practices when eliciting and recording event-related potentials in unresponsive individuals will help to minimize result interpretation ambiguity, increase confidence in conclusions, and advance the understanding of the relationship between long-latency event-related potentials and states of consciousness.

However, individual neurological differences have led to variability in the single sessions of rehabilitation training. Research on the impact of short training sessions on brain functioning patterns can help evaluate and standardize the short duration of rehabilitation training. In this paper, we use the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to explore the brain patterns' changes after a short-term rehabilitation training. Materials and Methods Using an EEG-BCI system, we analyzed the changes in short-term (about 1-h) MI training data with and without visual feedback, respectively. We first examined the EEG signal's Mu band power's attenuation caused by Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD). Then we use the EEG's Event-Related Potentials (ERP) features to construct brain networks and evaluate the training from multiple perspectives: small-scale based on single nodes, medium-scale based on hemispheres, and large-scale based on all-brain. Results Results showed no significant difference in the ERD power attenuation estimation in both groups. But the neurofeedback group's ERP brain network parameters had substantial changes and trend properties compared to the group without feedback. The neurofeedback group's Mu band power's attenuation increased but not significantly (fitting line slope = 0.2, t-test value p > 0.05) after the short-term MI training, while the non-feedback group occurred an insignificant decrease (fitting line slope = -0.4, t-test value p > 0.05). In the ERP-based brain network analysis, the neurofeedback group's network parameters were attenuated in all scales significantly (t-test value: p < 0.01); while the non-feedback group's most network parameters didn't change significantly (t-test value: p > 0.05). Conclusion The MI-BCI training's short-term effects does not show up in the ERD analysis significantly but can be detected by ERP-based network analysis significantly. Results inspire the efficient evaluation of short-term rehabilitation training and provide a useful reference for subsequent studies.

Here, we probe sustained changes in the event-related potentials (ERPs) to 1020- and 980-Hz tones following a rapid presentation of 1020-Hz tone (every 75 ms, 13.3 Hz, tetanization). Consistent with some previous studies, we revealed the increase in the P2 ERP component after tetanization. Contrary to some other studies, we did not observe the expected N1 increase after tetanization even in the identical experimental sequence. We detected a significant N1 decrease after tetanization. Expanding previous research, we showed that P2 increase and N1 decrease are not specific to the stimulus type (tetanized 1020 Hz and non-tetanized 980 Hz), suggesting the generalizability of tetanization effect to the not-stimulated auditory tones, at least to those of the neighbouring frequency. The ERPs' tetanization effects were observed for at least 30 min-the most prolonged interval examined, consistent with the duration of long-term potentiation, LTP. In addition, the tetanization effects were detectable in the blocks where the participants watched muted videos, an experimental setting that can be easily used in children and other challenging groups. Thus, auditory 13-Hz stimulation affects brain processing of tones including those of neighbouring frequencies.

To this end, semantic congruencies were manipulated in Chinese classifier-noun phrases, resulting in four conditions: (i) a strongly constraining/high-cloze, plausible (SP) condition, (ii) a weakly constraining/low-cloze, plausible (WP) condition, (iii) a strongly constraining/implausible (SI) condition, and (iv) a weakly constraining/implausible (WI) condition. The analysis of EEG data focused on two event-related potential components, i.e., the N400, which is known for its sensitivity to semantic fit of a target word to its context, and a post-N400 late positive complex (LPC), which is linked to semantic integration after prediction violations and retrospective, evaluative processes. We found similar N400/LPC effects in response to the manipulations of semantic congruency in the mono- and bilingual groups, with a gradient N400 pattern (WI/SI > WP > SP), a larger frontal LPC in response to WP compared to SP, SI, and WI, as well as larger centro-parietal LPCs in response to WP compared to SI and WI, and a larger centro-parietal LPC for SP compared to SI. These results suggest that, in terms of event-related potential (ERP) data, Chinese-Malay early bilingual speakers predict and integrate upcoming semantic information in Chinese classifier-noun phrase to the same extent as monolingual Chinese speakers. However, the global field power (GFP) data showed significant differences between SP and WP in the N400 and LPC time windows in bilinguals, whereas no such effects were observed in monolinguals. This finding was interpreted as showing that bilinguals differ from their monolingual peers in terms of global field power intensity of the brain by processing plausible classifier-noun pairs with different congruency effects.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) based emotion recognition mainly extracts traditional features from time domain and frequency domain, and the classification accuracy is often low for the complex nature of EEG signals. However, to the best of our knowledge, the fusion of event-related potential (ERP) components and traditional features is not employed in emotion recognition, and the ERP components are only identified and analyzed by the psychology professionals, which is time-consuming and laborious. Approach. In order to recognize the consciousness and unconsciousness emotions, we propose a novel consciousness emotion recognition method using ERP components and modified multi-scale sample entropy (MMSE). Firstly, ERP components such as N200, P300 and N300 are automatically identified and extracted based on shapelet technique. Secondly, variational mode decomposition and wavelet packet decomposition are utilized to process EEG signals for obtaining different levels of emotional variational mode function (VMF), namely VMF beta+gamma, and then nonlinear feature MMSE of each VMF beta+gamma are extracted. At last, ERP components and nonlinear feature MMSE are fused to generate a new feature vector, which is fed into random forest to classify the consciousness and unconsciousness emotions. Main results. Experimental results demonstrate that the average classification accuracy of our proposed method reach 94.42%, 94.88%, and 94.95% for happiness, horror and anger, respectively. Significance. Our study indicates that the fusion of ERP components and nonlinear feature MMSE is more effective for the consciousness and unconsciousness emotions recognition, which provides a new research direction and method for the study of nonlinear time series.

Behavioural and neurophysiological differences in working memory function of depressed patients and healthy controls	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						Depression; Working memory; Electroencephalography; Event-related potentials; Frontal theta	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; N-BACK; PSYCHOMOTOR RETARDATION; MAJOR DEPRESSION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; UNIPOLAR DEPRESSION; THETA OSCILLATIONS; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; SIMULTANEOUS EEG	Objective: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with deficits in working memory. Several cognitive subprocesses interact to produce working memory, including attention, encoding, maintenance and manipulation. We sought to clarify the contribution of functional deficits in these subprocesses in MDD by varying cognitive load during a working memory task. Methods: 41 depressed participants and 41 age and gender-matched healthy controls performed the n-back working memory task at three levels of difficulty (0-, 1-, and 2-back) in a pregistered study. We assessed response times, accuracy, and event-related electroencephalography (EEG), including P2 and P3 amplitudes, and frontal theta power (4-8 Hz). Results: MDD participants had prolonged response times and more positive frontal P3 amplitudes (i.e., Fz) relative to controls, mainly in the most difficult 2-back condition. Working memory accuracy, P2 amplitudes and frontal theta event-related synchronisation did not differ between groups at any level of task difficulty. Conclusions: Depression is associated with generalized psychomotor slowing of working memory processes, and may involve compensatory hyperactivity in frontal and parietal regions.

However, this theory has not been verified from the perspective of memory retrieval. This experiment aimed to explore the offline effect of emotional conflict processing on memory retrieval. We adopted a modified encoding-retrieval paradigm to explore this issue. Participants' electroencephalography (EEG) signal were also collected. A face-word Stroop task was used to create the congruency factor. In addition, an old/new judgment task was used to evaluate the recognition performance. During the retrieval phase, the response time of the incongruent condition was longer and the recognition accuracy was lower compared with congruent and neutral conditions in the behavioral data. For event-related potentials (ERP), we detected two well-established old/new effects related to memory retrieval under both neutral and emotional conditions: the frontal negativity (FN400) related to familiarity-driven recognition and the late posterior negativity (LPN) related to reconstructive processing or evaluation of retrieval outcomes. More importantly, the old/new effects were missing for incongruent condition during the early stage of FN400 (300-400 ms). Besides, for LPN (700-900 ms), the old/new effects of the incongruent condition are greater than the congruent condition. The results prove that the encoding phase's emotional congruency factor has a regulatory effect on the retrieval phase's early familiarity processing and evaluation of retrieval outcomes. Our data confirm the inhibitory effect of emotional conflict control on memory retrieval and support the emotional conflict control mechanism found in previous studies. (c) 2021 IBRO.

However, EEG data obtained from the simultaneous EEG-fMRI are strongly influenced by MRI-related artefacts, namely gradient artefacts (GA) and ballistocardiogram (BCG) artefacts. When compared to the GA correction, the BCG correction is more challenging to remove due to its inherent variabilities and dynamic changes over time. The standard BCG correction (i.e., average artefact subtraction [AAS]), require detecting cardiac pulses from simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) recording. However, ECG signals are also distorted and will become problematic for detecting reliable cardiac peaks. In this study, we focused on a beamforming spatial filtering technique to attenuate all unwanted source activities outside of the brain. Specifically, we applied the beamforming technique to attenuate the BCG artefact in EEG-fMRI, and also to recover meaningful task-based neural signals during an attentional network task (ANT) which required participants to identify visual cues and respond accurately. We analysed EEG-fMRI data in 20 healthy participants during the ANT, and compared four different BCG corrections (non-BCG corrected, AAS BCG corrected, beamforming + AAS BCG corrected, beamforming BCG corrected). We demonstrated that the beamforming approach did not only significantly reduce the BCG artefacts, but also significantly recovered the expected task-based brain activity when compared to the standard AAS correction. This data-driven beamforming technique appears promising especially for longer data acquisition of sleep and resting EEG-fMRI. Our findings extend previous work regarding the recovery of meaningful EEG signals by an optimized suppression of MRI-related artefacts.

EEG in motion: Using an oddball task to explore motor interference in active skateboarding	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cognitive&#8211; motor interference; ERP; mobile EEG; naturalistic cognition; portable research		Recent advancements in portable computer devices have opened new avenues in the study of human cognition outside research laboratories. This flexibility in methodology has led to the publication of several electroencephalography studies recording brain responses in real-world scenarios such as cycling and walking outside. In the present study, we tested the classic auditory oddball task while participants moved around an indoor running track using an electric skateboard. This novel approach allows for the study of attention in motion while virtually removing body movement. Using the skateboard auditory oddball paradigm, we found reliable and expected standard-target differences in the P3 and MMN/N2b event-related potentials. We also recorded baseline electroencephalography activity and found that, compared to this baseline, alpha power is attenuated in frontal and parietal regions during skateboarding. In order to explore the influence of motor interference in cognitive resources during skateboarding, we compared participants' preferred riding stance (baseline level of riding difficulty) versus their non-preferred stance (increased level of riding difficulty). We found that an increase in riding difficulty did not modulate the P3 and tonic alpha amplitude during skateboard motion. These results suggest that increases in motor demands might not lead to reductions in cognitive resources as shown in previous literature.	[Robles, Daniel; Kuziek, Jonathan W.

The data-processing multiverse of event-related potentials (ERPs): A roadmap for the optimization and standardization of ERP processing and reduction pipelines	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Event-related potentials (ERPs); Multiverse analysis; Multilevel models; ERP psychometric reliability; Data quality; Open science	ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; SAMPLE-SIZE CALCULATIONS; OPEN-SOURCE TOOLBOX; CONFLICT ADAPTATION; AVERAGE REFERENCE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; RELIABILITY; EEG; GENERALIZABILITY; RECOMMENDATIONS	In studies of event-related brain potentials (ERPs), numerous decisions about data processing are required to extract ERP scores from continuous data. Unfortunately, the systematic impact of these choices on the data quality and psychometric reliability of ERP scores or even ERP scores themselves is virtually unknown, which is a barrier to the standardization of ERPs. The aim of the present study was to optimize processing pipelines for the error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) by considering a multiverse of data processing choices. A multiverse analysis of a data processing pipeline examines the impact of a large set of different reasonable choices to determine the robustness of effects, such as the impact of different decisions on between-trial standard deviations (i.e., data quality) and between-condition differences (i.e., experimental effects). ERN and Pe data from 298 healthy young adults were used to determine the impact of different methodological choices on data quality and experimental effects (correct vs. error trials) at several key stages: highpass filtering, lowpass filtering, ocular artifact correction, reference, baseline adjustment, scoring sensors, and measurement procedure. This multiverse analysis yielded 3,456 ERN scores and 576 Pe scores per person. An optimized pipeline for ERN included a 15 Hz lowpass filter, ICA-based ocular artifact correction, and a region of interest (ROI) approach to scoring. For Pe, the optimized pipeline included a 0.10 Hz highpass filter, 30 Hz lowpass filter, regression-based ocular artifact correction, a-200 to 0 ms baseline adjustment window, and an ROI approach to scoring. The multiverse approach can be used to optimize pipelines for eventual standardization, which would support efforts toward establishing normative ERP databases. The proposed process of analyzing the data-processing multiverse of ERP scores paves the way for better refinement, identification, and selection of data processing parameters, ultimately improving the precision and utility of ERPs.

Discovering the brain stages of lexical decision: Behavioral effects originate from a single neural decision process	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Lexical decision; Electroencephalography; Event-related potentials; Machine learning; Multivariate pattern analysis; Hidden semi-Markov Models	VISUAL-WORD RECOGNITION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DIFFUSION-MODEL ACCOUNT; EVIDENCE ACCUMULATION; EEG-DATA; FREQUENCY; REPETITION; ERP; IDENTIFICATION; ACTIVATION	Lexical decision (LD) - judging whether a sequence of letters constitutes a word - has been widely investigated. In a typical lexical decision task (LDT), participants are asked to respond whether a sequence of letters is an actual word or a nonword. Although behavioral differences between types of words/nonwords have been robustly detected in LDT, there is an ongoing discussion about the exact cognitive processes that underlie the word identification process in this task. To obtain data-driven evidence on the underlying processes, we recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) data and applied a novel machine-learning method, hidden semi-Markov model multivariate pattern analysis (HsMM-MVPA). In the current study, participants performed an LDT in which we varied the frequency of words (high, low frequency) and "wordlikeness" of non-words (pseudowords, random non-words). The results revealed that models with six processing stages accounted best for the data in all conditions. While most stages were shared, Stage 5 differed between conditions. Together, these results indicate that the differences in word frequency and lexicality effects are driven by a single cognitive processing stage. Based on its latency and topology, we interpret this stage as a Decision process during which participants discriminate between words and nonwords using activated lexical information.

Research has shown that electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can reflect abnormal brain function of children with ASD, and screening with EEG signals has the characteristics of good real-time performance and high sensitivity. However, the existing EEG screening algorithms mostly focus on the data analysis in the resting state, and the extracted EEG features have some disadvantages such as weak representation capacity and information redundancy. In this study, we utilized the event-related potential (ERP) technique to acquire the EEG data of the subjects under positive and negative emotional stimulation and proposed an EEG Feature Selection Algorithm based on L1-norm regularization to perform screening of autism. The proposed EEG Feature Selection Algorithm includes the following steps: (1) extracting 20 EEG features from the raw data, (2) classification with support vector machine, (3) selecting appropriate EEG feature with L1-norm regularization according to the classification performance. The experimental results show that the accuracy for screening of children with ASD can reach 93.8% and 87.5% under positive and negative emotional stimulation and the proposed algorithm can effectively eliminate redundant features and improve screening accuracy.

Reward magnitude enhances early attentional processing of auditory stimuli	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Auditory oddball; Target detection; Attention; Reward; Event-related potential; Mismatch negativity	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; MECHANISMS; CAPTURE; MODULATION; DYNAMICS; SALIENCE; TARGET; CORTEX; MODEL	Reward associations are known to shape the brain's processing of visual stimuli, but relatively less is known about how reward associations impact the processing of auditory stimuli. We leveraged the high-temporal resolution of electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the influence of low- and high-magnitude stimulus-reward associations in an auditory oddball task. We associated fast, correct detection of certain auditory target stimuli with larger monetary rewards, and other auditory targets with smaller rewards. We found enhanced attentional processing of the more highly rewarded target stimuli, as evidenced by faster behavioral detection of those stimuli compared with lower-rewarded stimuli. Neurally, higher-reward associations enhanced the early sensory processing of auditory targets. Targets associated with higher-magnitude rewards had higher amplitude N1 and mismatch negativity (MMN) ERP components than targets associated with lower-magnitude rewards. Reward did not impact the latency of these early components. Higher-reward magnitude also decreased the latency and increased the amplitude of the longer-latency P3 component, suggesting that reward also can enhance the final processing stages of auditory target stimuli. These results provide insight into how the sensory and attentional neural processing of auditory stimuli is modulated by stimulus-reward associations and the magnitude of those associations, with higher-magnitude reward associations yielding enhanced auditory processing at both early and late stages compared with lower-magnitude reward associations.

Infants' neural responses to emotional faces are related to maternal anxiety	JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Maternal anxiety; emotions; faces; EEG; ERP; infants; NC; N290; P400	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; ATTENTIONAL BIAS; AT-RISK; THREAT; BRAIN; TEMPERAMENT; DEPRESSION; CHILDREN; MOTHERS	Background Postnatal maternal anxiety is common (estimates as high as 40% prevalence) and is associated with altered mother-infant interactions (e.g., reduced maternal emotional expression and engagement). Neural circuitry supporting infants' face and emotion processing develops in their first year. Thus, early exposure to maternal anxiety may impact infants' developing understanding of emotional displays. We examine whether maternal anxiety is associated with individual differences in typically developing infants' neural responses to emotional faces. Methods One hundred and forty two mother-infant dyads were assessed when infants were 5, 7, or 12 months old. Infants' electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded while passively viewing female happy, fearful, and angry faces. Three event-related potential (ERP) components, each linked to face and emotion processing, were evaluated: NC, N290, and P400. Infant ERP amplitude was related to concurrent maternal-report anxiety assessed with the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Trait form). Results Greater maternal anxiety predicted more negative NC amplitude for happy and fearful faces in left and mid-central scalp regions, beyond covarying influences of maternal depression symptoms, infant negative emotionality, and infant age. Conclusions Postnatal maternal anxiety is related to infants' neural processing of emotional expressions. Infants of mothers endorsing high trait anxiety may need additional attentional resources to process happy and fearful faces (expressions less likely experienced in mother-infant interactions). Future research should investigate mechanisms underlying this association, given possibilities include experiential, genetic, and prenatal factors.

Sensory processing and P300 event-related potential correlates of stimulant response in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A critical review	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						ADHD; Pediatric; ERP; Pharmacological treatment; Biomarker	DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; INHIBITORY CONTROL; BRAIN POTENTIALS; METHYLPHENIDATE; PERFORMANCE; ADHD; EEG; ERP; MEDICATION	Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with considerable impairment in psychiatric and functional domains. Although stimulant medication can reduce core symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, a subgroup of patients does not respond to this intervention. A precision medicine approach has been proposed, whereby biomarkers are used to identify an effective treatment approach for a given individual. This review synthesizes the existing literature on event-related potential (ERP) correlates of stimulant response in children diagnosed with ADHD, with the goal of evaluating the potential for ERP to inform precision medicine care in this population. Forty-three articles were examined and results tentatively suggest that stimulant medications normalize the amplitude of the P300 component, and this is also associated with behavioral improvement. In contrast, results generally indicate that stimulants do not significantly alter early processing components, although there are some exceptions to this finding. Implications for research, theory, and clinical work are considered and concrete recommendations for future directions are provided. While recognizing limitations of existing literature (e.g., homogenous samples, variable methodologies), we conclude that ERP methods represent a promising approach for precision medicine care of patients with ADHD.

So far, the available body of research has largely focused on advancements in analysis methods, with little attention given to the perspective of assessment. The aim of this brief report is to provide recommendations for cognitive ERPs assessment that can be applied across diagnostic categories in child and adolescent psychiatry research. First, we discuss major issues for ERPs testing using examples from common psychiatric disorders. We conclude by summing up our recommendations for methodological standards and highlighting the potential role of ERPs in the field.

The present study examined these neural correlates in 12-month-old infants and their mothers (N = 33 dyads). Dyads completed a viewing task consisting of familiar and novel face and toy stimuli while electroencephalography was recorded. Results suggest that for mothers, the N170 was larger for faces than toys, regardless of familiarity, and the LPP was largest for familiar faces. In infants, the N290 was somewhat larger for faces than toys (p < .10); the Nc did not vary by condition. Adult ERPs demonstrated fair to good reliability; reliability of infant ERPs was lower and was influenced by looking behaviors. Intergenerational associations were strongest between the LPP and Nc, particularly when electrode and time window were taken into account. Refinement of data handling and ERP scoring procedures for infant ERPs are crucial next steps for estimation of intergenerational associations and further examination of developmental changes in face and object processing.

A single-session behavioral protocol for successful event-related potential recording in children with neurodevelopmental disorders	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOBIOLOGY			English	Article						autism spectrum disorder; child; event-related potentials; fragile X syndrome	AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; FRAGILE-X-SYNDROME; YOUNG-CHILDREN; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; EMOTIONAL FACES; ERP DATA; EEG; RESPONSES; ADHD; ATTENTION	Event-related potentials (ERPs) are an ideal tool for measuring neural responses in a wide range of participants, including children diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). However, due to perceived barriers regarding participant compliance, much of this work has excluded children with low IQ and/or reduced adaptive functioning, significant anxiety symptoms, and/or sensory processing difficulties, including heterogeneous samples of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and children with fragile X syndrome (FXS). We have developed a behavioral support protocol designed to obtain high-quality ERP data from children in a single session. Using this approach, ERP data were successfully collected from participants with ASD, FXS, and typical development (TD). Higher success rates were observed for children with ASD and TD than children with FXS. Unique clinical-behavioral characteristics were associated with successful data collection across these groups. Higher chronological age, nonverbal mental age, and receptive language skills were associated with a greater number of valid trials completed in children with ASD. In contrast, higher language ability, lower autism severity, increased anxiety, and increased sensory hyperresponsivity were associated with a greater number of valid trials completed in children with FXS. This work indicates that a "one-size-fits-all" approach cannot be taken to ERP research on children with NDDs, but that a single-session paradigm is feasible and is intended to promote increased representation of children with NDDs in neuroscience research through development of ERP methods that support inclusion of diverse and representative samples.

Methods: The experiment was performed in two sections. In Section I, using event-related potential, event-related oscillation and spatial phase-synchronization, we explored neural dynamics in 24 volunteered healthy controls (HC) and 38 patients at least 6 months post-mTBI (19 with epidural hematoma, EDH; 19 with subdural hematoma, SDH) during a Go/NoGo task. In Section II, according to the neuropsychological scales, patients were divided into sub-groups to assess these electroencephalography (EEG) indicators in identifying different rehabilitation outcomes of mTBI. Results: In Section I, mean amplitudes of NoGo-P3 and P3d were decreased in mTBI patients relative to HC, and NoGo-theta power in the non-injured hemisphere was decreased in SDH patients only. In Section II, patients with chronic neuropsychological defects exhibited more serious impairments of intra-hemispheric connectivity, whereas inter-hemispheric centro-parietal and frontal connectivity were enhanced in response to lesions. Conclusions: EEG distinguished mTBI patients from healthy controls, and estimated different rehabilitation outcomes of mTBI. The centro-parietal and frontal connectivity are the main compensatory mechanism for the recovery of mTBI patients. Significance: EEG measurements and network connectivity can track recovery process and mechanism of mTBI. (c) 2021 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

EEG signatures of cognitive and social development of preschool children-a systematic review	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Background Early identification of preschool children who are at risk of faltering in their development is essential to ensuring that all children attain their full potential. Electroencephalography (EEG) has been used to measure neural correlates of cognitive and social development in children for decades. Effective portable and low-cost EEG devices increase the potential of its use to assess neurodevelopment in children at scale and particularly in low-resource settings. We conducted a systematic review aimed to synthesise EEG measures of cognitive and social development in 2-5-year old children. Our secondary aim was to identify how these measures differ across a) the course of development within this age range, b) gender and c) socioeconomic status (SES). Methods and findings A systematic literature search identified 51 studies for inclusion in this review. Data relevant to the primary and secondary aims was extracted from these studies and an assessment for risk of bias was done, which highlighted the need for harmonisation of EEG data collection and analysis methods across research groups and more detailed reporting of participant characteristics. Studies reported on the domains of executive function (n = 22 papers), selective auditory attention (n = 9), learning and memory (n = 5), processing of faces (n = 7) and emotional stimuli (n = 8). For papers investigating executive function and selective auditory attention, the most commonly reported measures were alpha power and the amplitude and latency of positive (P1, P2, P3) and negative (N1, N2) deflections of event related potential (ERPs) components. The N170 and P1 ERP components were the most commonly reported neural responses to face and emotional faces stimuli. A mid-latency negative component and positive slow wave were used to index learning and memory, and late positive potential in response to emotional non-face stimuli. While almost half the studies described changes in EEG measures across age, only eight studies disaggregated results based on gender, and six included children from low income households to assess the impact of SES on neurodevelopment. No studies were conducted in low- and middle-income countries. Conclusion This review has identified power across the EEG spectrum and ERP components to be the measures most commonly reported in studies in which preschool children engage in tasks indexing cognitive and social development. It has also highlighted the need for additional research into their changes across age and based on gender and SES.

A high body mass index not only has effects on longevity and quality of life of people who suffer from it but also has cognitive and neurological consequences. Executive function (EF)-or the neural regions that support it might act as causes of obesity. The aim of this study is to compare the differences between healthy and obese/overweight individuals and to understand how a prolonged diet of 2 months can affect EF event-related potential (ERP) components. Among the ERP metrics, N1, N2, and P3 are measured. Subjects underwent a diet program and their electroencephalogram was recorded every 4-6 weeks using a Stroop paradigm experiment. As the diet progressed, it was observed that perhaps more neural networks and executive control are engaged as the diet begins to take effect. Attention to nonfood increases and more control is exhibited when participants are presented with food images and food word stimuli. Increase in the N2 and P3 components highlight how the diet affects the brain during various stages of diet plans.

This is because, individuals who are poor, who experience monetary scarcity, can be easily triggered by budgetary issues and increased cognitive load as a result of having to constantly think about financial issues that eventually affect their ability to make effective decisions. Behavioural studies have found how increased cognitive load impedes cognitive performance and often becomes a significant factor that affects decision-making abilities. However, it is still unclear how cognitive load as a result of scarcity hinders cognitive performance, and what neural processing systems are being affected. Although there are behavioural differences between scarce mind and the non-scarce, the differences in neurobiological processes remain unexplored. Understanding specific neural correlates associated with monetary scarcity will facilitate in identifying how scarcity can impede specific neurocognitive processes. One way to measure neurobiological activity is by using electroencephalography (EEG) event-related potentials (ERPs), which is capable of capturing intrinsic neuro-temporal activities. This paper highlights the importance of investigating the neurobiological basis of how poverty affects cognitive performance. Understanding behaviors related specific neural activities will help to facilitate in developing effective intervention programs that can be targeted to improve decision-making abilities for the poor.

J	Chen, Y; Yang, ND				Chen, Ye; Yang, Naiding			Are Consumers Cognitive Misers? An Event-Related Potential Study on Decision-Making in Online Purchasing	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE PSYCHOLOGY AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						consumer cognitive miser; deliberative decision-making; event-related potential; heuristic decision-making; online purchasing decisions	LATE POSITIVE COMPLEX; BUYING DECISIONS; NEGATIVITY BIAS; BOOKS ONLINE; ERP; ATTENTION; P300; FEEDBACK; MODEL; EEG	The notion of cognitive miserliness that people can automatically perceive and sensitively react to cognitive cost in cognitive task completion has been accepted widely. No research has investigated the underlying neural processes associated with consumers' cognitive miserliness. We developed a paradigm for event-related potential (ERP) using online purchase decision-making tasks with high/low cognitive demand to explore consumers' neural responses to different levels of cognitive cost. Participants faced either deliberative (Deliberative) or heuristic decision-making (Heuristic_DM) in each trial. Four ERP components explain consumers' neural responses to cognitive cost. First, Deliberative_DM evoked larger feedback-related negativity (FRN) than Heuristic_DM. FRN can be evoked by anticipated negative outcomes. The larger FRN might mainly reflect the participants' loss perception led by anticipated high cognitive effort in Deliberative_DM. This finding might also imply that consumers encode cognitive effort as a cognitive cost with negative utility. Second, a larger P2 was evoked in Heuristic_DM than in Deliberative_DM, suggesting that more attentional resources were allocated to the stimuli leading to Heuristic_DM demanding less cognitive expenditure. Third, P3b was observed in Heuristic_DM, while slow-wave (SW) was observed in Deliberative_DM. Observed P3b, related to target stimulus classification, revealed that Heuristic_DMwith low cognitive cost might be categorized as expected target stimuli. The SW, an ERP indicator of mental calculation, demonstrated that Deliberative_DM launched an effortful mental arithmetic process. Our insights will help marketing professionals better understand consumers' responses to the cognitive cost of information processing in purchase decision-making.

Researchers have begun to focus on neurocognitive processes that may help explain how unhealthy food habits form and are maintained. The present study compared attentional bias to food stimuli in a sample of obese (n = 22) and Normal-weight (n = 18) adolescents utilizing an Attention Blink (AB) paradigm while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. We found lower accuracy and Event-Related Potential (ERP) P3 amplitudes during the presentation of food stimuli in AB trials for obese adolescents. These findings suggest an impaired ability of their brains to flexibly relocate attentional resources in the face of food stimuli. The results were corroborated by lower P3s also being associated with higher body mass index (BMI) values and poorer self-reported self-efficacy in controlling food intake. The study is among the few examining neural correlates of attentional control in obese adolescents and suggests automatic attentional bias to food is an important aspect to consider in tackling the obesity crisis.

In this study, the Ultimatum Game (UG) was utilized in concert with electroencephalograms (EEG) to investigate the temporal course of cognitive and emotional processes involved in economic decision-making between high and low leadership level college students. Behavioral results from this study found that the acceptance rates in an economic transaction, when the partner was a computer under unfair/sub unfair condition, were significantly higher than in transactions with real human partners for the low leadership group, while there was no significant difference in acceptance rates for the high leadership group. Results from Event-Related Potentials (ERP) analysis further indicated that there was a larger P3 amplitude in the low leadership group than in the high leadership group. We concluded that the difference between high and low leadership groups was at least partly due to their different emotional management abilities.

However, whether anxiety levels have a direct effect on language processing has not been so consistently explored. The present study focuses on event-related potential (ERP) patterns resulting from electroencephalographic (EEG) measurement of participants' (n = 36) brain activity while they perform a dichotic listening task. Participants' anxiety level was measured via a behavioural inhibition system scale (BIS). Later, participants listened to dichotically paired sentences, one neutral and the other threatening, and indicated at which ear they heard the threatening stimulus. Threatening sentences expressed threat semantically-only, prosodically-only, or both combined (congruent threat). ERPs showed a late positivity, interpreted as a late positive complex (LPC). Results from Bayesian hierarchical models provided strong support for an association between LPC and BIS score. This was interpreted as an effect of trait anxiety on deliberation processes. We discuss two possible interpretations. On the one hand, verbal repetitive thinking, as associated with anxious rumination and worry, can be the mechanism disrupting late phase deliberation processes. Instantiated by inner speech, verbal repetitive thinking might be the vehicle of anxiety-related reappraisal and/or rehearsal. On the other hand, increased BIS could be simply affecting an extended evaluation stage as proposed by multistep models, maybe due to over-engagement with threat or to task-related effects.

Theoretical accounts of perception suggest that stimulus-related (i.e., exogenous) and decision-related (i.e., endogenous) factors affect distributed neuronal processing at different levels of the visual hierarchy. To test these predictions, we measured brain activity of healthy participants during a motion discrimination task, using electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We independently modeled the impact of exogenous factors (task demand) and endogenous factors (perceptual decision-making) on the activity of the motion discrimination network and applied Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) to both modalities. DCM for event-related potentials (DCM-ERP) revealed that task demand impacted the reciprocal connections between the primary visual cortex (V1) and medial temporal areas (V5). With practice, higher visual areas were increasingly involved, as revealed by DCM-fMRI. Perceptual decision-making modulated higher levels (e.g., V5-to-Frontal Eye Fields, FEF), in a manner predictive of performance. Our data suggest that lower levels of the visual network support early, feature-based selection of responses, especially when learning strategies have not been implemented. In contrast, perceptual decision-making operates at higher levels of the visual hierarchy by integrating sensory information with the internal state of the subject.

From full calibration to zero training for a code-modulated visual evoked potentials for brain-computer interface	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interface (BCI); electroencephalography (EEG); code-modulated visual evoked potentials (cVEPs); reconvolution; zero training; spread spectrum communication		Objective. Typically, a brain-computer interface (BCI) is calibrated using user- and session-specific data because of the individual idiosyncrasies and the non-stationary signal properties of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Therefore, it is normal for BCIs to undergo a time-consuming passive training stage that prevents users from directly operating them. In this study, we systematically reduce the training data set in a stepwise fashion, to ultimately arrive at a calibration-free method for a code-modulated visually evoked potential (cVEP)-based BCI to fully eliminate the tedious training stage. Approach. In an extensive offline analysis, we compare our sophisticated encoding model with a traditional event-related potential (ERP) technique. We calibrate the encoding model in a standard way, with data limited to a single class while generalizing to all others and without any data. In addition, we investigate the feasibility of the zero-training cVEP BCI in an online setting. Main results. By adopting the encoding model, the training data can be reduced substantially, while maintaining both the classification performance as well as the explained variance of the ERP method. Moreover, with data from only one class or even no data at all, it still shows excellent performance. In addition, the zero-training cVEP BCI achieved high communication rates in an online spelling task, proving its feasibility for practical use. Significance. To date, this is the fastest zero-training cVEP BCI in the field, allowing high communication speeds without calibration while using only a few non-invasive water-based EEG electrodes. This allows us to skip the training stage altogether and spend all the valuable time on direct operation. This minimizes the session time and opens up new exciting directions for practical plug-and-play BCI. Fundamentally, these results validate that the adopted neural encoding model compresses data into event responses without the loss of explanatory power compared to using full ERPs as a template.

Twenty-four healthy participants took part in a novel gamified balance task where task-irrelevant auditory tones were presented in the background to generate ERPs in the participants' electroencephalogram (EEG) as a measure of cognitive workload. For the balance task, a computer-based tilt-ball game was combined with a balance board. Participants played the game by shifting their weight to tilt the balance board, which moved a virtual ball to score goals. The game was manipulated by adjusting the size of the goalposts to set three predefined levels of game difficulty (easy, medium, and hard). The participant's experience of game difficulty was evaluated based on the number of goals scored and their subjective reporting of perceived difficulty. Participants experienced a significant difference in the three levels of task difficulty based on the number of goals scored and perceived difficulty (p < 0.001). Post hoc analysis revealed the lowest performance for the hardest level. The mean amplitude of the N1 ERP component was used to measure the cognitive workload associated with the three difficulty levels. The N1 component's amplitude decreased significantly (p < 0.001), with an increase in the task difficulty. Moreover, the amplitude of the N1 component for the hard level was significantly smaller compared to medium (p = 0.0003) and easy (p < 0.001) levels. These results support the efficacy of the N1 ERP component to measure cognitive workload in dynamic and real-life scenarios such as exergames and other rehabilitation exercises.

J	Jiang, Y				Jiang, Yue			Neural correlates of pride and joy recognition in early childhood	SOCIAL BEHAVIOR AND PERSONALITY			English	Article						self-conscious emotions; emotion recognition; pride; joy; event-related potential; early childhood	SELF-CONSCIOUS EMOTIONS; NONVERBAL EXPRESSIONS; FACIAL AFFECT; ERP EVIDENCE; FACE; CHILDREN; BRAIN; SHAME; GUILT; IDENTIFICATION	I investigated neural processing during the recognition of pride and joy in early childhood using the event-related potential (ERP) technique. Electroencephalography recording was taken of 21 children aged between 4 and 6 years. They were shown photographs of familiar peers and strangers whose facial expressions displayed the emotion of either pride or joy. ERPs were recorded for the children's judgment of the expression of these two emotions when an image was presented. The results demonstrate that the neural dynamics during children's recognition of pride and joy involve three stages: The early negative component is spontaneously responsive to familiar faces, the mid-latency negative central component is responsive to expression of familiar faces, and the late positive component marks greater extended processing of an expression of pride. These findings provide new insight into the neural mechanism of pride and joy recognition in children aged 4 to 6 years.

However, in real life, aural stimuli are continuously mixed and cannot be found isolated, such as when listening to music. In this audio context, the acoustic features in music related to brightness, loudness, noise, and spectral flux, among others, change continuously; thus, significant values of these features can occur nearly simultaneously. Such situations are expected to give rise to increased brain reaction with respect to a case in which they would appear in isolation. In order to assert this, EEG signals recorded while listening to a tango piece were considered. The focus was on the amplitude and time of the negative deflation (N100) and positive deflation (P200) after the stimuli, which was defined on the basis of the selected music feature saliences, in order to perform a statistical analysis intended to test the initial hypothesis. Differences in brain reactions can be identified depending on the concurrence (or not) of such significant values of different features, proving that coterminous increments in several qualities of music influence and modulate the strength of brain responses.</p>	[Tardon, Lorenzo J.; Rodriguez-Rodriguez, Ignacio; Barbancho, Isabel] Univ Malaga, ETSI Telecomunicac, ATIC Res Grp, Malaga 29071, Spain; [Haumann, Niels T.; Brattico, Elvira] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Mus Brain, Dept Clin Med, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Haumann, Niels T.; Brattico, Elvira] Royal Acad Mus Aarhus Aalborg, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark		Tardon, LJ; Barbancho, I (corresponding author), Univ Malaga, ETSI Telecomunicac, ATIC Res Grp, Malaga 29071, Spain.	ltg@uma.es; ignacio.rodriguez@ic.uma.es; niels.haumann@clin.au.dk; elvira.brattico@clin.au.dk; ibp@uma.es	; Tardon, Lorenzo J./M-4492-2014; Barbancho, Isabel/L-7244-2014	Rodriguez-Rodriguez, Ignacio/0000-0002-0118-3406; Brattico, Elvira/0000-0003-0676-6464; Tardon, Lorenzo J./0000-0002-5441-225X; Barbancho, Isabel/0000-0001-7002-9106	Programa Operativo FEDER Andalucia [UMA18-FEDERJA-023]; Universidad de Malaga, Campus de Excelencia Internacional Andalucia Tech	Programa Operativo FEDER Andalucia; Universidad de Malaga, Campus de Excelencia Internacional Andalucia Tech	This work was funded by Programa Operativo FEDER Andalucia 2014-2020 under Project No. UMA18-FEDERJA-023 and Universidad de Malaga, Campus de Excelencia Internacional Andalucia Tech.		35	1	1	2	11	MDPI	BASEL	ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND		2076-3417		APPL SCI-BASEL	Appl.

In the current preregistered study (N = 52), we investigated event-related potentials (ERPs) toward real social evaluations in order to uncover the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of congruent and incongruent evaluative feedback. Participants interacted first, and then during an electroencephalogram (EEG) session, they received evaluations from their interaction partner that were either congruent or incongruent with their own ratings. Findings show potentiated processing of self-related incongruent negative evaluations at early time points (N1) followed by increased processing of both incongruent negative and positive evaluations at midlatency time windows (early posterior negativity) and a prioritized processing of self-related incongruent positive evaluations at late time points (feedback-related P3, late positive potential). These findings reveal that, after real social interactions, evaluative feedback about oneself that violates one's self-view modulates all processing stages with an early negativity and a late positivity bias.

Simultaneous electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) recordings offer a high spatiotemporal resolution approach to study human brain and understand the underlying mechanisms mediating cognitive and behavioral processes. However, the high susceptibility of EEG to MRI-induced artifacts hinders a broad adaptation of this approach. More specifically, EEG data collected during fMRI acquisition are contaminated with MRI gradients and ballistocardiogram artifacts, in addition to artifacts of physiological origin. There have been several attempts for reducing these artifacts with manual and time-consuming pre-processing, which may result in biasing EEG data due to variations in selecting steps order, parameters, and classification of artifactual independent components. Thus, there is a strong urge to develop a fully automatic and comprehensive pipeline for reducing all major EEG artifacts. In this work, we introduced an open-access toolbox with a fully automatic pipeline for reducing artifacts from EEG data collected simultaneously with fMRI (refer to APPEAR). Approach. The pipeline integrates average template subtraction and independent component analysis to suppress both MRI-related and physiological artifacts. To validate our results, we tested APPEAR on EEG data recorded from healthy control subjects during resting-state (n= 48) and task-based (i.e. event-related-potentials (ERPs); n= 8) paradigms. The chosen gold standard is an expert manual review of the EEG database. Main results. We compared manually and automated corrected EEG data during resting-state using frequency analysis and continuous wavelet transformation and found no significant differences between the two corrections. A comparison between ERP data recorded during a so-called stop-signal task (e.g. amplitude measures and signal-to-noise ratio) also showed no differences between the manually and fully automatic fMRI-EEG-corrected data. Significance. APPEAR offers the first comprehensive open-source toolbox that can speed up advancement of EEG analysis and enhance replication by avoiding experimenters' preferences while allowing for processing large EEG-fMRI cohorts composed of hundreds of subjects with manageable researcher time and effort.

Recently, neuroelectrophysiological studies incorporating evidence-based medicine has provided an important approach and achieved abundant results to achieve this goal. However, there are still many controversies among current evidences, and it is difficult to reach a consensus. This article comprehensively summarized the results of psychiatric studies on mental disorders which combined the method of evidence-based medicine represented by meta-analysis and the neuroelectrophysiological technique represented by electroencephalography (EEG). To systematically analyze and summarize the neurocognitive dysfunction of mental disorders and high-risk groups, event-related potential (ERP) components are divided into early and late components including different cognitive activities such as perception processing, cognitive control, emotional response, and social cognition. Evidence based on quantitative EEG analysis are also discussed. We found that schizophrenia has defects in most of cognitive processes including perception, emotion and sociality, which indexed by amplitude reduction in most of the early and late components including P50, MMN, P300 and LPP. Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has defects in cognitive control indexed by amplitude reduction in the early and late components including the ERN and Pe. Anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder have defects in early cognitive control, while autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has defects in early perceptual processing and social cognition indexed by amplitude reduction of N170 and FN. In addition, abnormal P300 reflexing the impaired cognitive processing speed and attention resource allocation were found across multiple diagnosis types, which indicate that this ERP component may reflect the general cognitive deficits of mental disorders. The neuroelectrophysiological studies on evidence-based medicine for mental disorders has discovered a series of valuable ERPs or EEG objective marker features, but these features still cannot be directly used in the diagnosis of personalized medicine, until these features have been identified as objective biomarkers with high accuracy and specificity in further research and clinical practice. Future research can use multi-center database to seek the electrophysiological objective markers for mental disorders, and the integrated research combining advanced technologies including multi-modal psychoradiology and artificial intelligence methods including machine learning can further enhance the reliability and validity of biological markers of mental disorders.

All artifacts must be removed for correct data interpretation. However, various noise reduction methods significantly influence the final shape of the EEG signal and thus its characteristic values, latency and amplitude. There are several types of filters to eliminate noise early in the processing of EEG data. However, there is no gold standard for their use. This article aims to verify and compare the influence of four various filters (FIR, IIR, FFT, NOTCH) on the latency and amplitude of the EEG signal. By presenting a comparison of selected filters, the authors intend to raise awareness among researchers as regards the effects of known filters on latency and amplitude in a selected area-the sensorimotor area.

J	Pereira, T; Oliveira, A				Pereira, Telmo; Oliveira, Armando			The usefulness of the averaging rule in consumer studies: A partial replication with an eye at neuroeconomics	EUROPEAN REVIEW OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY-REVUE EUROPEENNE DE PSYCHOLOGIE APPLIQUEE			English	Article						Integration information theory; Functional measurement; Event-related potentials; Algebraic rules; Neuromarketing	FUNCTIONAL-MEASUREMENT; CONJOINT-MEASUREMENT; DECISION-MAKING	Introduction. - Information Integration Theory models how different pieces of information are combined by people into unified judgments. Its contribution to decision-making and to consumer studies distinctly relies on a set of empirically established algebraic models for reflecting the cognitive structure of judgments and decisions (cognitive algebra). Among these, the averaging model has particular properties, allowing for operationally distinguishing between the elusive notions of psychological value and importance. Objectives. - The main goal of the paper is to support the applicability and robustness of the averaging model in consumer studies, by partially replicating a published study that documented averaging. Additionally, it tentatively explores potential contributions of the averaging model to neuroeconomics, by simultaneously recording ratings and electroencephalographic (EEG) responses. Methods. - Twenty-five participants rated on a satisfaction scale (format 0-20) a set of experimental conditions arising from the full factorial combination of three levels of sneakers' branded models and three levels of purchase prices, expanded with conditions in which brands were presented in isolation (sub design). Simultaneous electrophysiological monitoring was performed with an EEG mask (international system 10-20, referenced to the mastoid apophyses). Segmentation and processing of evoked response potentials were done in Matlab. Both ratings and magnitudes of event-related potentials (ERP) components were analyzed through inspection of the factorial plots with the support of repeated-measures ANOVAs. Results. - The rating responses revealed an averaging model, with equal weighting in a cluster of subjects and differential weighting in another, but more overall importance of the branded model variable in both cases. The only tentative suggestions of relevant neural correlates involved the LPP and P300 components of the ERP and a reduced number of EEG channels (P4, P3, Fz and T3). Conclusions. - The averaging model is robustly applicable and useful in consumer studies, both for measurement (value and importance) and consumer segmentation (cognitively based clusterization) purposes. While calling attention to the later components of the ERP at specific topographies, the paucity of EEG results suggests that ERP peak amplitude may not be a useful measure for the purpose. Apart from that, a functional measurement approach to neuroeconomics seems feasible in principle and an explorable path in the future. (c) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

It is significantly crucial in neural communication, braincomputer interface, and other practical tasks. EEG signal is exceptionally susceptible to artifacts, which are external noise signals originated from non-cerebral regions. The interference of artifacts in EEG signals can potentially affect the original recorded EEG signal quality and pattern. Therefore, artifact removal from EEG signal is critically important before applying it to a specific task for accurate outcomes. Researchers have proposed numerous techniques to remove various artifacts present in the contaminated EEG signal. However, neither optimum method nor criterion stands standard for endorsement of clinically recorded EEG signals. Therefore, the research related to artifact elimination from EEG signal is challenging and perplexing task. This paper attempts to give an extensive outline of the advancement in methodologies to eliminate one of the most common artifacts, i.e., ocular artifact. It is anticipated that the study will enlighten the researchers on all the existing ocular artifact elimination techniques with a validated simulation model on the recorded EEG signal. In future advancements, Standard norms in artifact elimination techniques are expected to diminish the neurologist's load by substantiating the clinical diagnosis after gaining correct information from artifact-free EEG signals.

However, this evidence is mostly limited to cross-sectional data. The current study utilized neurofeedback (NFB) as a neuromodulatory tool to examine the ERP correlates of attentional and inhibitory processes in adult ADHD using a single-session, within-subject design. Methods: We recorded high-density EEG in 25 adult ADHD patients and 22 neurotypical controls during a Go/NoGo task, before and after a 30-minute NFB session designed to down-regulate the alpha (8-12 Hz) rhythm. Results: At baseline, ADHD patients demonstrated impaired Go/NoGo performance compared to controls, while Go-P3 amplitude inversely correlated with ADHD-associated symptomatology in childhood. Post NFB, task performance improved in both groups, significantly enhancing stimulus detectability (d-prime) and reducing reaction time variability, while increasing N1 and P3 ERP component amplitudes. Specifically for ADHD patients, the pre-to-post enhancement in Go-P3 amplitude correlated with measures of improved executive function, i.e., enhanced d-prime, reduced omission errors and reduced reaction time variability. Conclusions: A single-session of alpha down-regulation NFB was able to reverse the abnormal neurocognitive signatures of adult ADHD during a Go/NoGo task. Significance: The study demonstrates for the first time the beneficial neurobehavioral effect of a single NFB session in adult ADHD, and reinforces the notion that ERPs could serve as useful diagnostic/prognostic markers of executive dysfunction.

Nevertheless, very little is known about the neural mechanisms involved in this process. Our study sought to identify the neurophysiological correlates of purchase decision-making in situations where the optimal purchase time is not known. EEG was recorded in 24 healthy subjects while they were performing a new experimental paradigm that simulates real economic decisions. At the time of price presentation, we found an increase in the P3 Event-Related Potential and induced theta and alpha oscillatory activity when participants chose to buy compared to when they decided to wait for a better price. These results reflect the engagement of attention and executive function in purchase decision-making and might help in the understanding of brain mechanisms underlying economic decisions in uncertain scenarios.

Paired-pulse TMS and scalp EEG reveal systematic relationship between inhibitory GABA(a) signaling in M1 and fronto-central cortical activity during action stopping	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						GABA; motor inhibition; paired-pulse TMS; P3 event-related potential; stop-signal task		By stopping actions even after their initiation, humans can flexibly adapt ongoing behavior to changing circumstances. The neural processes underlying the inhibition of movement during action stopping are still controversial. In the 90s, a fron-to-central event-related potential (ERP) was discovered in the human EEG response to stop signals in the classic stop-signal task, alongside a proposal that this "stop-signal P3" reflects an inhibitory process. Indeed, both amplitude and onset of the stop-signal P3 relate to overt behavior and movement-related EEG activity in ways predicted by the dominant models of action-stopping. However, neither EEG nor behavior allow direct inferences about the presence or absence of neurophysiological inhibition of the motor cortex, making it impossible to definitively relate the stop-signal P3 to inhibition. Here, we therefore present a multimethod investigation of the relationship between the stop-signal P3 and GABAergic signaling in primary motor cortex, as indexed by paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In detail, we measured short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), a marker of inhibitory GABA(a) activity in M1, in a group of 41 human participants who also performed the stop-signal task while undergoing EEG recordings. In line with the P3-inhibition hypothesis, we found that subjects with stronger inhibitory GABA activity in M1 also showed both faster onsets and larger amplitudes of the stop-signal P3. This provides direct evidence linking the properties of this ERP to a true physiological index of motor system inhibition. We discuss these findings in the context of recent theoretical developments and empirical findings regarding the neural implementation of motor inhibition. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The neural mechanisms underlying rapid action stopping in humans are subject to intense debate, in part because recordings of neural signals purportedly reflecting inhibitory motor control are hard to directly relate to the true, physiological inhibition of motor cortex. For the first time, the current study combines EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) methods to demonstrate a direct correspondence between fronto-central control-related EEG activity following signals to cancel an action and the physiological inhibition of primary motor cortex.

Neurophysiological patterns associated with blunted emotional face processing and withdrawal tendencies in young children exposed to intimate partner violence	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOBIOLOGY			English	Article						affective oddball; child maltreatment; frontal asymmetry; intimate partner violence; LPP	FRONTAL EEG ASYMMETRY; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; EXPERIENCED MALTREATMENT; NEURAL REACTIVITY; 1ST YEAR; CHILDHOOD; THREAT; YOUTH; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY	Studies linking child maltreatment to abnormal neurophysiological responses to emotional stimuli and mental health impairment have not specifically explored these patterns in young children exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV). The present study examined two neurophysiological indicators, resting-state electroencephalography and an emotion event-related potential (ERP) in 21 IPV exposed and 30 nonexposed children ages 4-6 years recruited from the community and domestic violence shelters. Frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) was assessed while at rest. FAA is often associated with avoidant/withdrawn behavior and increased risk of IPV-related mental health conditions (e.g., depression). Additionally, the late positive potential (LPP) ERP component, reflecting motivated attention, was acquired in the context of an age-appropriate affective oddball paradigm with low probability animal pictures as targets and human facial expressions (angry, happy, neutral) as distracters. Results demonstrated that IPV-exposed children, compared with nonexposed children, exhibited lower left FAA during resting state and reduced LPPs to oddball targets and affective faces relative to neutral faces in the oddball task. Together, these results suggest neural patterns associated with a blunted response to emotional stimuli and withdrawal tendencies, respectively, in young children exposed to IPV. Implications for emotional socialization in this vulnerable population are discussed.

J	Hodapp, A; Grimm, S				Hodapp, Alice; Grimm, Sabine			Neural signatures of temporal regularity and recurring patterns in random tonal sound sequences	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory sensory memory; entrainment; ERP; pattern detection; repetition		The auditory system is highly sensitive to recurring patterns in the acoustic input - even in otherwise unstructured material, such as white noise or random tonal sequences. Electroencephalography (EEG) research revealed a characteristic negative potential to periodically recurring auditory patterns - a response, which has been interpreted as memory trace-related and specific, rather than as a sign of periodicity-driven entrainment. Here, we aim to disentangle these two possible contributions by investigating the influence of a periodic sound sequence's inherent temporal regularity on event-related potentials. Participants were presented continuous sequences of short tones of random pitch, with some sequences containing a recurring pattern, and asked to indicate whether they heard a repetition. Patterns were either spaced equally across the random sequence (isochronous condition) or with a temporal jitter (jittered condition), which enabled us to differentiate between event-related potentials (and thus processing operations associated with a memory trace for a repeated pattern) and the periodic nature of the repetitions. A negative recurrence-related component could be observed independently of temporal regularity, was pattern-specific, and modulated by across trial repetition of the pattern. Critically, isochronous pattern repetition induced an additional early periodicity-related positive component, which started to build up already before the pattern onset and which was elicited undampedly even when the repeated pattern was occasionally not presented. This positive component likely reflects a sensory driven entrainment process that could be the foundation of a behavioural benefit in detecting temporally regular repetitions.

J	Chakraborty, S; Ray, D; Palit, I				Chakraborty, Suddhasatwa; Ray, Debtanu; Palit, Ishan			An EEG based comparative study on driver's performance under the influence of metal halide and high pressure sodium lighting	OPTIK			English	Article						Object detection; Event related potential (ERP); Metal halide lamp; High-pressure sodium lamp; Electroencephalography (EEG); Street Lighting	RESPONSES; CLASSIFICATION	For the last few decades the most favored light sources for road lighting designs are the Metal Halide (MH) and High Pressure sodium vapor (HPS). The use of LED has been increased profoundly in the recent time in different road lighting applications. One of the most important characteristics that differentiate both the light sources is their color. Although the spectral power density of both MH and HPS light sources contains peaks at different wavelengths throughout the visible spectrum but the color produced by the MH sources is mainly blue-white color and by the HPS sources are yellow. Recent study had shown that detection of object by the road users are highly influenced by lamp type (Biswas et al., 2018; Rea, 2013, 2014; Boyce Peter, 2014; Rea et al., 2010; Morante, n.d.). A comparative behavioral study along the performance analysis is thus very important from the driver's point of view under the spectrum of these two light sources. In this research work the behavioral and detailed performance analysis study of a subject driving a vehicle in a simulated road lighting condition illuminated by HPS and MH light sources has been conducted. The driver's time response along with electroencephalography (EEG) study was conducted to investigate the probable temporal processes and significant differences in the distribution of brain waves for detection of object located at on-axis (foveal). The results are compared for both the types of lamps and it has been found that metal halide lamps have better human cognitive performance.

A Systematic Review	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						melancholic depression; subtypes of depression; major depressive disorder; electroencephalography; biomarkers	ALPHA ASYMMETRY; MAJOR DEPRESSION; REM-SLEEP; EEG; DIAGNOSIS; POTENTIALS; SUBTYPES; LATENCY; IMPACT	Introduction: The objective of this systematic review was to investigate whether electroencephalographic parameters can serve as a tool to distinguish between melancholic depression, non-melancholic depression, and healthy controls in adults. Methods: A systematic review comprising an extensive literature search conducted in PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and PsycINFO in August 2020 with monthly updates until November 1st, 2020. In addition, we performed a citation search and scanned reference lists. Clinical trials that performed an EEG-based examination on an adult patient group diagnosed with melancholic unipolar depression and compared with a control group of non-melancholic unipolar depression and/or healthy controls were eligible. Risk of bias was assessed by the Strengthening of Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist. Results: A total of 24 studies, all case-control design, met the inclusion criteria and could be divided into three subgroups: Resting state studies (n = 5), sleep EEG studies (n = 10), and event-related potentials (ERP) studies (n = 9). Within each subgroup, studies were characterized by marked variability on almost all levels, preventing pooling of data, and many studies were subject to weighty methodological problems. However, the main part of the studies identified one or several EEG parameters that differentiated the groups. Conclusions: Multiple EEG modalities showed an ability to distinguish melancholic patients from non-melancholic patients and/or healthy controls. The considerable heterogeneity across studies and the frequent methodological difficulties at the individual study level were the main limitations to this work. Also, the underlying premise of shifting diagnostic paradigms may have resulted in an inhomogeneous patient population.

It begs the question of how humans react to and interact with robots in a coordinated manner and what the neural underpinnings of such behavior are. This exploratory study aims to understand the differences in human-human and human-robot interactions at a behavioral level and from a neurophysiological perspective. For this purpose, we adapted a collaborative dynamical paradigm from the literature. We asked 12 participants to hold two corners of a tablet while collaboratively guiding a ball around a circular track either with another participant or a robot. In irregular intervals, the ball was perturbed outward creating an artificial error in the behavior, which required corrective measures to return to the circular track again. Concurrently, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG). In the behavioral data, we found an increased velocity and positional error of the ball from the track in the human-human condition vs. human-robot condition. For the EEG data, we computed event-related potentials. We found a significant difference between human and robot partners driven by significant clusters at fronto-central electrodes. The amplitudes were stronger with a robot partner, suggesting a different neural processing. All in all, our exploratory study suggests that coordinating with robots affects action monitoring related processing. In the investigated paradigm, human participants treat errors during human-robot interaction differently from those made during interactions with other humans. These results can improve communication between humans and robot with the use of neural activity in real-time.

This paper attempts to quantify the face perceptual ability of human subjects using their memory responses, acquired by an electroencephalographic (EEG) device, during engagement of the human subjects in a face recognition task. The entire experimental protocol is designed in the settings of pattern recognition, comprising five main steps, namely artifact removal, feature extraction, classifier training and testing, and face-perception ability measurement. The primary objective of the paper is to design a deep neural network model that utilizes both the temporal and spatial EEG features to categorize the familiar face (FF) and unfamiliar face (UF) responses of human subjects from their brain signals. To extract the spatial information, the acquired raw EEG data is transformed into multi-spectral 2-dimensional images by a deep learning approach. The spatial information, along with the EEG time-frequency domain (temporal) features are then utilized to train the proposed deep neural network, which can preserve the spatial as well as temporal EEG features that are more robust and less sensitive to the variations along each dimension. The proposed deep neural network paradigm demonstrates promising results in classifying the EEG responses for FF and UF recognition with high classification accuracy. Biological underpinning of the cortical mechanism using sLORETA and event related potential (ERP) analysis in perceiving FFs and UFs by both the healthy controls and prosopagnosic patients is also a significant inclusion in the paper. The first and foremost advantage of the proposed work is that it provides a technological means to assess the variations in face perceptual ability of individuals. It can also be used as a biomarker for early prosopagnosia diagnosis.

Several deep learning models have been proposed to classify EEG signals in patients with various neurological diseases. However, no effective deep learning model for eventrelated potential (ERP) signal classification is yet available for amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Method: This study proposed a single-scale multi-input convolutional neural network (SSMICNN) method to classify ERP signals between aMCI patients with T2DM and the control group. Firstly, the 18-electrode ERP signal on alpha, beta, and theta frequency bands was extracted by using the fast Fourier transform, and then the mean, sum of squares, and absolute value feature of each frequency band were calculated. Finally, these three features are converted into multispectral images respectively and used as the input of the SSMICNN network to realize the classification task. Results: The results show that the SSMICNN can fuse MSI formed by different features, SSMICNN enriches the feature quantity of the neural network input layer and has excellent robustness, and the errors of SSMICNN can be simultaneously transmitted to the three convolution channels in the back-propagation phase. Comparison with Existing Method(s): SSMICNN could more effectively identify ERP signals from aMCI with T2DM from the control group compared to existing classification methods, including convolution neural network, support vector machine, and logistic regression. Conclusions: The combination of SSMICNN and MSI can be used as an effective biological marker to distinguish aMCI patients with T2DM from the control group.

Using an active oddball paradigm with unambiguous and ambiguous portrait paintings as the standard stimuli, our aim was to examine whether: creativity in the figural domain influences the perception of visual stimuli; any stages of visual processing; or if healthy aging has an effect on these processes. We investigated event related potentials (ERPs) and applied ERP decoding analyses in four groups: younger less creative; younger creative; older less creative; and older creative adults. The early visual processing did not differ between creativity groups. In the later ERP stages the amplitude for the creative compared with the less creative groups was larger between 300 and 500 ms. The stimuli types were clearly distinguishable: within the 300-500 ms range the amplitude was larger for ambiguous rather than unambiguous paintings, but this difference in the traditional ERP analysis was only observable in the younger, not elderly groups, who also had this difference when using decoding analysis. Our results could not prove that visual creativity influences the early stage of perception, but showed creativity had an effect on stimulus processing in the 300-500 ms range, in indexing differences in top-down control, and having more flexible cognitive control in the younger creative group.

A Guide for Researchers Considering Combined EEG-fMRI	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						simultaneous EEG and fMRI; multimodal neuroimaging; EEG-informed fMRI; fMRI-informed EEG; combined recording	VISUAL-EVOKED POTENTIALS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BOLD RESPONSES; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; ARTIFACT; MRI; BALLISTOCARDIOGRAM; ACQUISITION; INTEGRATION	Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provide non-invasive measures of brain activity at varying spatial and temporal scales, offering different views on brain function for both clinical and experimental applications. Simultaneous recording of these measures attempts to maximize the respective strengths of each method, while compensating for their weaknesses. However, combined recording is not necessary to address all research questions of interest, and experiments may have greater statistical power to detect effects by maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio in separate recording sessions. While several existing papers discuss the reasons for or against combined recording, this article aims to synthesize these arguments into a flow chart of questions that researchers can consider when deciding whether to record EEG and fMRI separately or simultaneously. Given the potential advantages of simultaneous EEG-fMRI, the aim is to provide an initial overview of the most important concepts and to direct readers to relevant literature that will aid them in this decision.

SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						self-referencing; memory; erp; self; eeg; subsequent memory	BOLD SIGNAL; ERP; RETRIEVAL; RELEVANCE; JUDGMENTS; ATTENTION; KNOWLEDGE; STRATEGY	The self-reference effect in memory (SRE), in which stimuli related to self are better remembered than other stimuli, has been studied often in the fMRI literature, but much less with EEG. In two experiments, we investigated how self-referencing modulated event-related potential (ERP) markers of the subsequent memory effect, testing whether the same components that reflect memory success are impacted or whether unique components are modulated by self-referencing. Participants were asked to evaluate whether an adjective accurately described either the self or a given other by making a yes/no key press during EEG recording. Then participants were given a surprise recognition memory test where they judged each adjective as old or new. We observed a main effect of self-relevance on a late positivity at right frontal electrodes. A very similar effect was observed when comparing words subsequently remembered to those that were forgotten. However, no interaction was found between self-relevance and subsequent memory, suggesting the frontal positivity is not exclusive to the SRE, but instead a reflection of deeper encoding that leads to better memory. Thus, this frontal positivity may be a marker of a deeper encoding process that is elicited by self-referencing but not exclusive to the SRE.

Developmental changes in external and internal performance monitoring across middle childhood: An ERP study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Development; ERN; FRN; Pe; Childhood	ERROR-RELATED-NEGATIVITY; FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; BRAIN POTENTIALS; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; CINGULATE CORTEX	Performance monitoring is critical for learning and behavioral adaption and is supported by both externally and internally sourced information. Cross-sectional studies indicate an increase in internal error processing across childhood, suggesting a potential developmental transition from reliance on external information to reliance on internally developed models. However, little research has examined the association between these constructs longitudinally. Data from 339 children assessed annually from kindergarten to 2nd grade were examined to determine the developmental trajectory of ERP indices of performance monitoring, and whether the association between these indices changes across time. EEG data were recorded during an incentivized Go/No-Go task and ERP component amplitudes were extracted as peak measures at Fz. Despite small increases in magnitude, no significant changes were observed in any of the ERPs. Multi-level regression analyses indicated that in kinder-garten a more negative feedback-related negativity (FRN) was associated with a more negative error-related negativity (ERN) and a more negative error positivity (Pe). Further, the association between the FRN and Pe changed over time, such that in 2nd grade the FRN and Pe decoupled from one another and were no longer associated. These results suggest that the development of performance monitoring through middle childhood may be a phasic process. More specifically, matured external feedback monitoring processes may first facilitate the development of conscious error recognition, and then the development of internal error monitoring pro-cesses. Once internal models of error monitoring are well-established, children may then reduce their utilization of external feedback.

Applying Spike-density component analysis for high-accuracy auditory event-related potentials in children	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Auditory event-related potentials (AEP); Spike-density component analysis; ERP analysis; Cortical maturation; Children	MISMATCH-NEGATIVITY MMN; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; CORTICAL PLASTICITY; ATTENTION-DEFICIT; MATURATION; ERP; BRAIN; PERCEPTION; RESPONSES; TIMBRE	Objective: Overlapping neurophysiological signals are the main obstacle preventing from using cortical auditory event-related potentials (AEPs) in clinical settings. Children AEPs are particularly affected by this problem, as their cerebral cortex is still maturing. To overcome this problem, we applied a new version of Spike-density Component Analysis (SCA), an analysis method recently developed, to isolate with high accuracy the neural components of auditory responses of 8-year-old children. Methods: Electroencephalography was used with 33 children to record AEPs to auditory stimuli varying in spectrotemporal features. Three different analysis approaches were adopted: the standard AEP analysis procedure, SCA with template-match (SCA-TM), and SCA with half-split average consistency (SCA-HSAC). Results: SCA-HSAC most successfully allowed the extraction of AEPs for each child, revealing that the most consistent components were P1 and N2. An immature N1 component was also detected. Conclusion: Superior accuracy in isolating neural components at the individual level was demonstrated for SCA-HSAC over other SCA approaches even for children AEPs. Significance: Reliable methods of extraction of neurophysiological signals at the individual level are crucial for the application of cortical AEPs for routine diagnostic exams in clinical settings both in children and adults.

Such efforts are challenged by an incomplete understanding of the functional significance of between-person differences in amplitudes and of nuisance factors that contribute to amplitude differences, a lack of standardization of methods, and the use of a convenience sample for the potentially normative database. To move ERPs toward standardization and useful norms, we encourage more research on the meaning of differences in ERN scores, including factors that influence between- and within-person variation, and the dissemination of protocols for data collection and processing.

Self-Reported Perceptual Aberrations in Psychosis Map to Event-Related Potentials and Semantic Appraisals of Objects	JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						psychosis; schizophrenia; visual processing; EEG	LATERAL OCCIPITAL COMPLEX; DOSE EQUIVALENTS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PERSONALITY; IMPAIRMENT; SCHIZOTYPY; MODEL; ABNORMALITIES; ORGANIZATION; INTEGRATION	Psychotic disorders have been associated with visual deficits and deviant semantic processing, making it unclear whether object detection abnormalities in psychosis originate from low-level or higher-order visual processes. The current study investigated how high-level visual processing is affected in psychosis by presenting object stimuli with equivalent low-level visual features. Outpatients with affective and nonaffective psychotic disorders, first-degree biological relatives, and psychiatrically unaffected individuals (N = 130) completed the Fragmented Ambiguous Object Task (FAOT) to assess recognition of objects in ambiguous stimuli. During the task, we recorded electroencephalography, quantified event-related potential (ERP) components (P1, N1, negative closure [N-CL], N400), and derived four spatiotemporal event-related potential factors using principal components analysis (PCA). In addition to traditional diagnoses, psychosis was characterized using a dimensional measure of individual differences in self-reported sensory experiences (perceptual absorption) calculated from scales that tap the psychotic domain of the hierarchical structure of psychopathology. Rates of detecting objects within fragmented stimuli failed to differ across diagnostic groups or significantly predict perceptual absorption (p =.057). PCA factors that reflected smaller N1 and larger NCL amplitudes were associated with detecting objects. Exploratory analyses revealed that higher perceptual absorption was associated with reductions in the N400 and a late positive PCA factor. Although early and midlatency brain responses modulate during object detection, late brain responses tied to semantic appraisal of objects are related to perceptual aberrations often reported by individuals with severe psychopathology. Dimensional measures of personality appear sensitive to variation in biological systems relevant to psychotic symptomatology and object perception.

There is a trade-off between accuracy and the time required for data acquisition. Additional time is needed to mount an EEG headset so that authentication requires several minutes, rendering it not very usable for most scenarios. In a scenario where an EEG headset is already worn for a different purpose, the setup time can be neglected and the time for data acquisition may be extended if it does not interfere with the subject's actual task, allowing continuous authentication. However, most proposed EEG-based authentication systems require the user to perform a certain task during data acquisition, distracting the user from the actual task. We conceptualize an EEG-based continuous authentication scheme that does not require the user to perform a task in addition to working at a screen. We propose two approaches based on well known brain responses, SSVEP and ERP.

Using Clustering to Examine Inter-individual Variability in Topography of Auditory Event-Related Potentials in Autism and Typical Development	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Autism; Heterogeneity; Clustering; Event-related potentials (ERPs); Sensory processing	EVOKED POTENTIALS; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; N1 WAVE; CHILDREN; MATURATION; AGE; HETEROGENEITY; SPEECH; COMMUNICATION; DIAGNOSIS	Although prior studies have compared sensory event-related potential (ERP) responses between groups of autistic and typically-developing participants, it is unclear how heterogeneity contributes to the results of these studies. The present study used examined individual differences in these responses. 130 autistic children and 81 typically-developing children, aged between 2 and 5 years, listened to tones at four identity levels while 61-channel electroencephalography was recorded. Hierarchical clustering was used to group participants based on rescaled ERP topographies between 51 and 350 ms. The hierarchical clustering analysis revealed substantial heterogeneity. Some of the seven clusters defined in this analysis were characterized by prolonged fronto-central positivities and/or weak or absent N2 negativities. However, many other participants fell into clusters in which N2 responses were present at varying latencies. Atypical response morphologies such as absent N2 responses and/or prolonged positive-going responses found in some autistic participants may account for prior research findings of attenuated N2 amplitudes in autism. However, there was also considerable overlap between groups, with participants of both groups appearing in all clusters. These results emphasize the utility of using clustering to explore individual differences in brain responses, which can expand on and clarify the results of analyses of group mean differences.

J	Albrecht, C; Bellebaum, C				Albrecht, Christine; Bellebaum, Christian			Disentangling effects of expectancy, accuracy, and empathy on the processing of observed actions	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						action observation; EEG; empathy; error processing; expectation; oERN	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PERSPECTIVE-TAKING; NEURAL MECHANISMS; ERROR-DETECTION; ERP COMPONENTS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; SYSTEMS	A number of studies suggest that event-related potential (ERP) components previously associated with error processing might represent expectation violation instead of valence. When observing others, these processes might further be modulated by trait empathy. We suggest that trait empathy modulates expectancy formation and that these expectancies then influence observed response processing as reflected in a frontocentral negative ERP component resembling the previously described observer error-related negativity. We acquired single trial ERPs of participants who observed another person in a true- or false-belief condition answering correctly or erroneously. Additionally, we prompted participants' expectancy in some trials. Using linear mixed model analyses, we found that for low empathy participants, expectations for the false-belief condition decreased throughout the experiment, so that expectations were more pronounced in participants with higher empathy toward the end of the experiment. We also found that single trial expectancy measures derived from regression models of the measured expectancies predicted the amplitude of the frontocentral negative ERP component, and that neither the addition of empathy nor accuracy or trial type (true- or false-belief) led to the explanation of significantly more variance compared with the model just containing expectancy as predictor. These results suggest that empathy modulates the processing of observed responses indirectly via its effect on expectancy of the response.

Sandeep Vara; Huang, Yufei; Lu, Yun-Chen; Shaw, Siddharth; Jung, Tzyy-Ping			SSVEP-assisted RSVP brain-computer interface paradigm for multi-target classification	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						electroencephalography; brain&#8211; computer interface; visual evoked potential; event-related potential; physiological biomarkers; multiple targets		Brain-computer Interface (BCI) is actively involved in optimizing the communication medium between the human brain and external devices.Objective. Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) is a robust and highly efficient BCI technique in recognizing target objects but suffers from limited target selections. Hybrid BCI systems that combine steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) and RSVP can mitigate this limitation and allow users to operate on multiple targets. Approach. This study proposes a novel hybrid SSVEP-RSVP BCI to improve the performance of classifying the target/non-target objects in a multi-target scenario. In this paradigm, SSVEP stimulation helps in identifying the user's focus location and RSVP stimuli that elicit event-related potentials differentiate target and non-target objects. Main results. The proposed model achieved an offline accuracy of 81.59% by using 12 electroencephalography (EEG) channels and an online (real-time) accuracy of 78.10% when only four EEG channels are considered. Further, the biomarkers of physiological states are analyzed to assess the cognitive states (mental fatigue and user attention) of the participants based on resting theta and alpha band powers. The results indicate an inverse relationship between the BCI performance and the resting EEG power, validating that the subjects' performance is affected by physiological states for long-term use of the BCI. Significance. Our findings demonstrate that the combination of SSVEP and RSVP stimuli improves the BCI performance and further enhances the possibility of performing multiple user command tasks, which are inevitable in real-world applications. Additionally, the cognitive state biomarkers discussed imply the need for an efficient and attractive experimental paradigm that reduces the physiological state disparities and provide enhanced BCI performance.

It is also very difficult to identify noise and signals as the input signal is unknown. In this work, we have validated textile-based EEG electrodes constructed from a poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate:/polydimethylsiloxane coated cotton fabric using a textile-based head phantom. The performance of the textile-based electrode has also been compared against a commercial dry electrode. The textile electrodes collected a signal to a smaller skin-to-electrode impedance (-18.9%) and a higher signal-to-noise ratio (+3.45%) than Ag/AgCl dry electrodes. From an EEGLAB, it was observed that the inter-trial coherence and event-related spectral perturbation graphs of the textile-based electrodes were identical to the Ag/AgCl electrodes. Thus, these textile-based electrodes can be a potential alternative to monitor brain activity.

Recent studies showed that the EEG signal of the task-state could better characterize the conscious state and cognitive ability of the brain, but it has rarely been used in consciousness assessment. A cue-guide motor task experiment was designed, and task-state EEG were collected from 18 patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS), 29 patients in a minimally conscious state (MCS), and 19 healthy controls. To obtain the markers of residual motor function in patients with DOC, the event-related potential (ERP), scalp topography, and time-frequency maps were analyzed. Then the coherence (COH) and debiased weighted phase lag index (dwPLI) networks in the delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands were constructed, and the correlations of network properties and JFK Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) motor function scores were calculated. The results showed that there was an obvious readiness potential (RP) at the Cz position during the motor preparation process in the MCS group, but no RP was observed in the UWS group. Moreover, the node degree properties of the COH network in the theta and alpha bands and the global efficiency properties of the dwPLI network in the theta band were significantly greater in the MCS group compared to the UWS group. The above network properties and CRS-R motor function scores showed a strong linear correlation. These findings demonstrated that the brain network properties of task-state EEG could be markers of residual motor function of DOC patients.

Adult attachment is related to maternal neural response to infant cues: an ERP study	ATTACHMENT & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Infant cues; mothers; adult attachment; ERP; social neuroscience		Maternal attachment security is an important predictor of caregiving . However, little is known regarding the neurobiological mechanisms by which attachment influences processing of infant cues, a critical component of caregiving. We examined whether attachment security, measured by the Adult Attachment Interview, might relate to neural responses to infant cues using event-related potentials. Secure (n=35) and insecure (n=24) mothers viewed photographs of infant faces and heard recordings of infant vocalizations while electroencephalography was recorded. We examined initial processing of infant faces (N170) and cries (N100), and attentional allocation to infant faces and cries (P300). Secure mothers were significantly faster than insecure mothers to orient to infant cries (N100), structurally encode their own infant's face (N170), and attend to infant faces (P300). These differences may elucidate mechanisms underlying how attachment may shape neural processing of infant cues and highlight the use ofsocial neuroscientific approaches in examining clinically relevant aspects of attachment.

Neural markers of proactive and reactive cognitive control are altered during walking: A Mobile Brain-Body Imaging (MoBI) study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Dual-task design; Attention; Event-related potential; ERP; EEG; Gait	DUAL-TASK INTERFERENCE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ATTENTIONAL CONTROL; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; MOTOR INTERFERENCE; GAIT VARIABILITY; CINGULATE CORTEX; CONTROL NETWORK; CHANGING PLANS; POTENTIAL ERP	The processing of sensory information and the generation of motor commands needed to produce coordinated actions can interfere with ongoing cognitive tasks. Even simple motor behaviors like walking can alter cognitive task performance. This cognitive-motor interference (CMI) could arise from disruption of planning in anticipation of carrying out the task (proactive control) and/or from disruption of the execution of the task (reactive control). In young healthy adults, walking-induced interference with behavioral performance may not be readily observable because flexibility in neural circuits can compensate for the added demands of simultaneous loads. In this study, cognitive-motor loads were systematically increased during cued task-switching while underlying neurophysiologic changes in proactive and reactive mechanisms were measured. Brain activity was recorded from 22 healthy young adults using 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) based Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) as they alternately sat or walked during performance of cued task-switching. Walking altered neurophysiological indices of both proactive and reactive control. Walking amplified cue-evoked late fontal slow waves, and reduced the amplitude of target-evoked fronto-central N2 and parietal P3. The effects of walking on evoked neural responses systematically increased as the task became increasingly difficult. This may provide an objective brain marker of increasing cognitive load, and may prove to be useful in identifying seemingly healthy individuals who are currently able to disguise ongoing degenerative processes through active compensation. If, however, degeneration continues unabated these people may reach a compensatory limit at which point both cognitive performance and control of coordinated actions may decline rapidly.

The signals were acquired during the presentation of three types of face expression stimuli -happy, fearful and neutral faces. EEGs are first decomposed using the Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition (MEMD) method to extract its Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), which provide information about the underlying activities of ERP components. The nonlinear sample entropy (SampEn) features, as well as the standard linear measurements utilizing maximum (Max.), minimum (Min), and standard deviation (Std.), are then extracted from each set of IMFs. These features are then evaluated by the statistical analysis tests and used to construct the input vectors for the Discriminant analysis (DA), Support vector machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classifiers. Experimental results show that the proposed features can differentiate the ASD and TD children using the happy stimulus dataset with high classification performance for all classifiers that reached 100% accuracy. This result suggests a general deficit in recognizing the positive expression in ASD children. Additionally, we found that the SampEn measurements computed from the alpha and theta bands and the linear features extracted from the delta band can be considered biomarkers for disturbances in Emotional Facial Expression (EFE) processing in ASD children.

In their seminal study, Tanaka et al. (Tanaka et al. 2006 J. Cogn. Neurosci.18, 1488-1497. (doi:10.1162/jocn.2006.18.9.1488)) required the identification of a particular novel face across 70 trials and found that the N250 component in the EEG event-related potentials became more negative from the first to the second half of the experiment, where it reached a similar amplitude as a well-known face. We were unable to directly replicate this finding in our study when we used the original split of trials. However, when we applied a different split of trials we observed very similar changes in N250 amplitude. We conclude that the N250 component is indeed sensitive to the build-up of a robust representation of a face in memory; the time course of this process appears to vary as a function of variables that may be determined in future research.

However, current methods do not exist that can pinpoint such an event. We recorded EEG from participants while they completed auditory oddball paradigm and Stroop tasks. To determine the time at which a change in cognitive load could be detected, we applied auditory tones at four time points before and after the onset of an incongruent Stroop trial: (1) 100 ms prior to the Stroop onset, (2) 100 ms post Stroop onset, (3) 300 ms post Stroop onset, and (4) 450 ms post Stroop onset. Event-related potential results suggest that cognitive load was highest at time points after 100 ms post Stroop onset. This work provides a method for identifying an increase in cognitive load, which could be an important diagnostic tool for device development and tuning.

Above the age of 50 years, hypothesized pronounced alterations in alpha and theta-band power at resting or across different WM-functioning brain states may well be due to pre-dementia cognitive impairments, or increasing severity of age-related neurological disorders. Executive working memory (EWM) functioning was assessed in older-adult participants (54 to 83 years old) by obtaining their WM-related EEG oscillations and WM performance scores. WM performance and WM brain-state EEG were recorded during online-WM periods as well as during specific online WM events within EWM periods, and during resting offline-WM periods that preceded online-WM periods. Left-prefrontal alpha-power was enhanced during offline-WM periods versus online-WM periods and was significantly related to WM accuracy. Left-prefrontal alpha power and left prefrontal-parietal theta power anterior-posterior difference-gradient during online WM activity were related to reaction times (RT's). Importantly, during active-storage events, WM-offset offline-periods, and preparatory pre-retrieval events, excessive left-prefrontal alpha activity was related to poor EWM performance. The potential for developing targeted noninvasive cognition-enhancing interventions and developing clinical-monitoring EEG-based biomarkers of pathological cognitive-decline in elderly people is discussed.

Previous studies have shown that targeted WM training has the potential to improve WM performance in older adults. In the present study, we investigated whether a multi-domain cognitive training program that was not designed to specifically target WM could improve the behavioral performance and affect the neural activity during WM retrieval in healthy older adults. We assigned healthy older participants (70-78 years old) from a local community into a training group who completed a 3-month multi-domain cognitive training and a control group who only attended health education lectures during the same period. Behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded from participants while performing an untrained delayed match or non-match to category task and a control task at a pre-training baseline session and a post-training follow-up session. Behaviorally, we found that participants in the training group showed a trend toward greater WM performance gains than participants in the control group. Event-related potential (ERP) results suggest that the task-related modulation of P3 during WM retrieval was significantly enhanced at the follow-up session compared with the baseline session, and importantly, this enhancement of P3 modulation was only significant in the training group. Furthermore, no training-related effects were observed for the P2 or N2 component during WM retrieval. These results suggest that the multi-domain cognitive training program that was not designed to specifically target WM is a promising approach to improve WM performance in older adults, and that training-related gains in performance are likely mediated by an enhanced modulation of P3 which might reflect the process of WM updating.

In this work, the relationship between the hemodynamic response and brain oscillation activity was investigated using the concurrent recording of fNIRS and EEG during ankle joint movements. Twenty subjects participated in this experiment. The EEG was recorded using 20 electrodes and hemodynamic responses were recorded using 32 optodes positioned over the motor cortex areas. The event-related desynchronization (ERD) feature was extracted from the EEG signal in the alpha band (8-11) Hz, and the concentration change of the oxy-hemoglobin (oxyHb) was evaluated from the hemodynamics response. During the motor execution of the ankle joint movements, a decrease in the alpha (8-11) Hz amplitude (desynchronization) was found to be correlated with an increase of the oxyHb (r = -0.64061, p < 0.00001) observed on the Cz electrode and the average of the fNIRS channels (ch28, ch25, ch32, ch35) close to the foot area representation. Then, the correlated channels in both modalities were used for ankle joint movement classification. The result demonstrates that the integrated modality based on the correlated channels provides a substantial enhancement in ankle joint classification accuracy of 93.01 +/- 5.60% (p < 0.01) compared with single modality. These results highlight the potential of the bimodal fNIR-EEG approach for the development of future BCI for lower limb rehabilitation.

Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying this ability is critical for comprehending attentional processes as well as neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by attentional deficits, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this study, we aimed to investigate how trait-like critical oscillations during rest relate to the P300 evoked potential-a biomarker commonly used to assess attentional deficits. We measured long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) in resting-state EEG oscillations as index for criticality of the signal. In addition, the attentional performance of the subjects was assessed as reaction time variability (RTV) in a continuous performance task following an oddball paradigm. P300 amplitude and latencies were obtained from EEG recordings during this task. We found that, after controlling for individual variability in task performance, LRTC were positively associated with P300 amplitudes but not latencies. In line with previous findings, good performance in the sustained attention task was related to higher P300 amplitudes and earlier peak latencies. Unexpectedly, we observed a positive relationship between LRTC in ongoing oscillations during rest and RTV, indicating that greater criticality in brain oscillations during rest relates to worse task performance. In summary, our results show that resting-state neuronal activity, which operates near a critical state, relates to the generation of higher P300 amplitudes. Brain dynamics close to criticality potentially foster a computationally advantageous state which promotes the ability to generate higher event-related potential (ERP) amplitudes.

Executive dysfunction widely exists in a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases, and is closely related to the decline of daily living ability and function. This study intends to explore the effect of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on executive function and its neural mechanism by using event-related potential (ERP), so as to provide basis for further study on the relationship between cerebral cortex and executive function. Methods: Task switching paradigm was used to study the cognitive flexibility in executive function. Thirty-one healthy subjects were randomly assigned to receive rTMS stimulations (1 Hz rTMS or sham rTMS) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) twice. The switching task and the electroencephalography EEG recordings were performed before (pre-rTMS/pre-sham rTMS) and immediately after the end of the rTMS application (post-rTMS/post-sham rTMS). Results: The analysis of RTs showed that the main effects of switching and time were statistically significant. Further analysis revealed that the RT of rTMS stimulation was longer than sham rTMS at post-stimulation. ERP analysis showed that there was a significant switching effect in frontal and central scalp location, and the P2 amplitude in switch trials was greater than that in non-switch trials. At post-stimulation, the N2 amplitude of rTMS is more negative than that of sham rTMS at non-switch trials, whereas no such difference was found at switch trials. The P3 amplitude and LPC amplitude are significantly reduced by rTMS at post-stimulation. Conclusion: Low-frequency rTMS of the left DLPFC can cause decline of cognitive flexibility in executive function, resulting in the change of N2 amplitude and the decrease of P3 and LPC components during task switching, which is of positive significance for the evaluation and treatment of executive function.

In this study, 23 college students underwent three sessions of a Clock task test before a 30-day high-altitude exposure (Test 1) and 1 week (Test 2) and 3 months (Test 3) after they returned to lowlands. The Clock task consists of a visual spatial angle and a visual non-spatial color discrimination subtask. Simultaneously, electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded during the Clock task. The behavioral results showed that, compared with Test 1, accuracy in Test 2 was significantly decreased in both the Angle and Color tasks, and reaction time (RT) was significantly increased in the Angle task. The event-related potentials results showed that, during both tasks amplitudes of the occipital N1 and P3 components during both tasks were significantly decreased in Test 2, compared with Test 1. Moreover, N1 amplitude was negatively correlated with RT and positively correlated with accuracy. Further time-frequency EEG analysis showed that theta power at occipital sites was significantly decreased in both tasks in Test 2, compared with Test 1, and was negatively correlated with RT in the Angle task. In Test 3, both the behavioral performance and EEG activity recovered to the baseline level in Test 1. These findings suggested that hypoxia impairs both visual spatial and visual non-spatial discriminations, and these impairments can recover after subjects return to lowlands. Inhibition of brain electrophysiological activity in the visual cortex may explain the deficits in visual cognition.

Complexity is one of the important cognitive attributes of icons, which affects the semantic cognitive process of icons. The impact of icon complexity on the cognitive was studied by event-related potential (ERP) technology. The ERP experiment applies "target-priming" paradigm, and the experiment materials adopt a mixed design of 3 shape complexity (low, medium, high) x 2 semantic complexity (single semantic, multi-semantic) x 2 semantic matching relationships (match, mismatch). Hypotheses were proposed before the experiment. Based on the analysis of response time, correct rate, ERP waveform characteristics and average amplitude, the hypotheses were discussed. The ERP experiment results show that N400 is more obvious in semantic inconsistencies but has a shorter latency period, which can be used as an objective evaluation basis for icon cognition; both shape complexity and semantic complexity have significant effect on semantic cognition; icons with more complex shapes and less complex semantics are more efficient in cognition. According to the experimental conclusion, influence factors of icon shape complexity are summarized from several calculation models of shape complexity, the ways to improve icon shape complexity are analyzed, and a method is proposed for icons optimization design by improving the complexity of icon shapes. The method is applied in an example, the improvement of complexity and the optimization of icon design scheme are verified by questionnaires, and the result shows that the method is effective.

Studying Implicit Attitudes Towards Smoking: Event-Related Potentials in the Go/NoGo Association Task	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Go; NoGo association task (GNAT); N200; EEG; ERP; implicit association; attitudes; cigarette smoking; addiction		Cigarette smoking and other addictive behaviors are among the main preventable risk factors for several severe and potentially fatal diseases. It has been argued that addictive behavior is controlled by an automatic-implicit cognitive system and by a reflective-explicit cognitive system, that operate in parallel to jointly drive human behavior. The present study addresses the formation of implicit attitudes towards smoking in both smokers and non-smokers, using a Go/NoGo association task (GNAT), and behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) measures. The GNAT assesses, via quantifying participants' reaction times, the strength of association between a target category and either pole of an evaluative dimension (positive or negative). EEG analysis is performed to determine the temporal course of the event-related potential (ERP) components underlying Go/NoGo decisions and implicit attitude formation. Both smokers and non-smokers showed prolonged reaction times to smoking-related pictures when the pictures were coupled with positive evaluative words ("incongruent condition"). This indicates negative implicit attitudes towards smoking in both groups alike at the time point of the behavioral response (600-700 ms post-stimulus). However, only the non-smokers, not the smokers, were found to show a delay of the N200 component in the incongruent condition. This is interpreted as reflecting ambivalent or even positive implicit attitudes towards smoking in the smoker group at the time point of the N200 (300-400 ms post-stimulus). Our study thus provides evidence for the hypothesis that implicit attitudes are subject to changes within several hundred milliseconds after stimulus presentation, and can be altered in the course of their formation.

Abnormally Large Baseline P300 Amplitude Is Associated With Conversion to Psychosis in Clinical High Risk Individuals With a History of Autism: A Pilot Study	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						autism spectrum disorder; psychosis; P300; EEG; conversion; prodrome		Psychosis rates in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are 5-35% higher than in the general population. The overlap in sensory and attentional processing abnormalities highlights the possibility of related neurobiological substrates. Previous research has shown that several electroencephalography (EEG)-derived event-related potential (ERP) components that are abnormal in schizophrenia, including P300, are also abnormal in individuals at Clinical High Risk (CHR) for psychosis and predict conversion to psychosis. Yet, it is unclear whether P300 is similarly sensitive to psychosis risk in help-seeking CHR individuals with ASD history. In this exploratory study, we leveraged data from the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS2) to probe for the first time EEG markers of longitudinal psychosis profiles in ASD. Specifically, we investigated the P300 ERP component and its sensitivity to psychosis conversion across CHR groups with (ASD+) and without (ASD-) comorbid ASD. Baseline EEG data were analyzed from 304 CHR patients (14 ASD+; 290 ASD-) from the NAPLS2 cohort who were followed longitudinally over two years. We examined P300 amplitude to infrequent Target (10%; P3b) and Novel distractor (10%; P3a) stimuli from visual and auditory oddball tasks. Whereas P300 amplitude attenuation is typically characteristic of CHR and predictive of conversion to psychosis in non-ASD sample, in our sample, history of ASD moderated this relationship such that, in CHR/ASD+ individuals, enhanced - rather than attenuated - visual P300 (regardless of stimulus type) was associated with psychosis conversion. This pattern was also seen for auditory P3b amplitude to Target stimuli. Though drawn from a small sample of CHR individuals with ASD, these preliminary results point to a paradoxical effect, wherein those with both CHR and ASD history who go on to develop psychosis have a unique pattern of enhanced neural response during attention orienting to both visual and target stimuli. Such a pattern stands out from the usual finding of P300 amplitude reductions predicting psychosis in non-ASD CHR populations and warrants follow up in larger scale, targeted, longitudinal studies of those with ASD at clinical high risk for psychosis.

Employing event-related potentials, we examined neural reactivity to infant emotional faces during the third trimester of pregnancy in expectant mothers (n = 38) and expectant fathers (n = 30). Specifically, expectant parents viewed infant distress and infant neutral faces while electroencephalography was simultaneously recorded. As a psychological measure, we assessed prenatal mind-mindedness towards the unborn child and examined whether neural processing of infant cues was associated with levels of mind-mindedness. Expectant fathers evidenced greater P300 reactivity to infant distress, relative to neutral, faces than expectant mothers. Furthermore, P300 reactivity to infant distress, relative to infant neutral, faces was associated with levels of prenatal mind-mindedness in expectant fathers but not expectant mothers. These findings indicate significant sex differences in the prenatal neural processing of infant cues and relations between neural reactivity to infant distress and the emergence of parental mind-mindedness.

Despite extensive researches, the neurobiological mechanism underlying ADHD is still left unveiled. Since the deficit functions, such as attention, have been demonstrated in ADHD, in our present study, based on the oddball P3 task, the corresponding electroencephalogram (EEG) of both healthy controls (HCs) and ADHD children was first collected. And we then not only focused on the event-related potential (ERP) evoked during tasks but also investigated related brain networks. Although an insignificant difference in behavior was found between the HCs and ADHD children, significant electrophysiological differences were found in both ERPs and brain networks. In detail, the dysfunctional attention occurred during the early stage of the designed task; as compared to HCs, the reduced P2 and N2 amplitudes in ADHD children were found, and the atypical information interaction might further underpin such a deficit. On the one hand, when investigating the cortical activity, HCs recruited much stronger brain activity mainly in the temporal and frontal regions, compared to ADHD children; on the other hand, the brain network showed atypical enhanced long-range connectivity between the frontal and occipital lobes but attenuated connectivity among frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes in ADHD children. We hope that the findings in this study may be instructive for the understanding of cognitive processing in children with ADHD.

Vulnerability to PIU was assessed through internet addiction test (IAT) in a sample of 23 participants. Moreover, they underwent a behavioral Iowa gambling task (IGT) for testing decision-making functioning and N2 event-related potentials (ERPs) component was monitored during an attentional inhibitory Go/NoGo task performance with addiction-related background pictures (videogames, online gambling, and neutral stimuli). IAT measure positively correlated with both IGT index and N2 variation at the Go/NoGo task. High-IAT young participants showed specific responses to internet addiction-related cues (pictures representing online gambling) in terms of ERPs amplitude of N2pc for Go trials in Pz. Findings suggested an early attentional facilitation effect for specific addiction-related stimuli, online gambling-related stimuli, suggesting a selective attention bias for salient stimuli in this population. While higher levels of IAT do not seem to correspond to a deficit in decision-making abilities, the selective attention mechanisms show to be partially biased in response to the salience of external cues.

However, recent accounts suggest that the P1 is associated with inhibiting the irrelevant visual field evidenced by a pronounced ipsilateral P1 during sustained attention to peripherally presented stimuli. The current EEG study further investigated this issue to reveal how lateralized ERP findings are modulated by face and emotional information. Therefore, participants were asked to fixate the center of the screen and pay sustained attention either to the right or left visual field, where angry or neutral faces or their Fourier phase-scrambled versions were presented. We found a bilateral P1 to all stimuli with relatively increased, but delayed, ipsilateral P1 amplitudes to faces but not to scrambles. Explorative independent component analyses dissociated an earlier lateralized larger contralateral P1 from a later bilateral P1. By contrast, the N170 showed a contralateral enhancement to all stimuli, which was most pronounced for neutral faces attended in the left hemifield. Finally, increased contralateral alpha power was found for both attended hemifields but was not significantly related to poststimulus ERPs. These results provide evidence against a general inhibitory role of the P1 but suggest stimulus-specific relative enhancements of the ipsilateral P1 for the irrelevant visual hemifield. The lateralized N170, however, is associated with stimulus amplification as a function of facial features.

Early identification of this stage therefore constitutes a major focus of current AD research, to enable early intervention. In this study, healthy adult participants with high and low SMCs (HSMCs and LSMCs) performed a Go/NoGo task during electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. Relative to LSMC participants, HSMC participants performed the task slower (longer reaction times) and showed changes in the eventrelated potential (ERP) components associated with response preparation (lower readiness potential -RPamplitude in the Go condition), and also related to response inhibition processes (lower N2-P3 amplitude in the NoGo condition). In addition, HSMC participants showed lower Go-N2 and NoGo-N2 peak-to-baseline amplitudes, however these results seem to be influenced by a negative tendency overlapping stimulus-related waveforms. The declines observed in this study are mostly consistent with those observed in aMCI participants, supporting the notion of the AD continuum regarding SMC state.

Initial evidence indicates disorder-specific and overlapping neurophysiological alterations using event-related potentials (ERPs) in individuals with BD or ADHD during attentional tasks, but it is unknown whether impairments generalize across other processes and tasks. We conduct the first comparison between women with ADHD (n = 20), women with BD (n = 20) and control women (n = 20) on ERPs from a performance-monitoring flanker task. The BD group showed a significantly attenuated frontal ERP of conflict monitoring (N2) compared to the ADHD group across both low-conflict (congruent) and high-conflict (incongruent) task conditions, and compared to controls in the high-conflict condition. However, when controlling for an earlier attentional ERP (frontal N1), which was significantly reduced in participants with BD compared to participants with ADHD and controls, N2 group differences were no longer significant. These results indicate that ERP differences in conflict monitoring may be attributable to differences in earlier attentional processes. These findings identify neural differences in early attention between BD and ADHD which precede conflict monitoring processes, potentially pointing to distinct neural mechanisms implicated in the two disorders.

It is hypothesised a predictable singularity avoidance strategy is preferred in pHRC as humans tend to maximise predictability when using complex systems. By using an electroencephalogram (EEG), it is possible to assess the predictability of a task through a feature found in event-related potentials (ERP) and called prediction-error negativity (PEN). In this paper, two research questions are addressed. Can a complex pHRC singularity avoidance strategy generate a detectable PEN? Are PEN and human preferences related when comparing different control settings in a singularity avoidance strategy? Fourteen participants compared two different sets of parameters (modes) in a singularity avoidance strategy based on the exponentially damped least-squared (EDLS) method. ERP results are presented in terms of power spectral density (PSD). ERP results were then compared with human preferences to see whether they are related. Results show that the mode that causes PEN is also the one that participants did not like, suggesting that a lack of predictability might have an impact on human preference.

Neurologic Characterization of Craniosynostosis: Can Direct Brain Recordings Predict Language Development?	JOURNAL OF CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article						Bayley Scales of Infant Development; craniosynostosis; electroencephalogram; event related potential; mismatch negativity waves; neurocognitive testing; nonsyndromic craniosynostosis		Purpose: Nonsyndromic craniosynostosis (NSC) is associated with language deficits. Conventional tests, such as the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID), may not reflect accurate long-term cognition. Alternatively, mismatch negativity (MMN) waves recorded via electroencephalogram (EEG) measure neural responses to speech and may objectively predict language development. This study aimed to (1) correlate infant MMN to future language achievement and (2) compare MMN among subtypes of NSC. Methods: Pre and postoperatively (mean operative age 9.5 months), NSC participants received the BSID and EEG phoneme-discrimination paradigm(80 dB,250 Hz). The MMN was the largest negative amplitude in the difference wave 80 to 300 ms after stimuli. To measure cognitive outcome, patients completed a neurodevelopmental battery (Wechsler-Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence and Wechsler-Fundamentals) at >6 years of age. Results: Eleven NSC patients with EEG testing in infancy were neurocognitively tested (average age 8.0 years; 27% female; 55% sagittal, 27% metopic, 9% unicoronal, 9% sagittal/metopic). The left frontal cluster MMN strongly correlated with word-reading (r = 0.713, P = 0.031), reading-comprehension (r = 0.745, P = 0.021), and language-composites (r = 0.0771, P = 0.015). Conversely, BSID scores did not yield significant predictive value (r<0.5, P>0.05). Follow-up event related potentials (ERP) comparison included 39 normal control, 18 sagittal, 17 metopic, 6 unilateral-coronal infants. Preoperatively, sagittal (P = 0.003) and metopic (P = 0.003) patients had attenuated left frontal MMN compared to controls. Postoperatively, the sagittal cohort was normalized to controls while metopic patients retained attenuations (P = 0.041). Conclusion: ERP assessment in NSC had significantly better predictive value for future neurocognition than the BSID. Preoperatively, sagittal and metopic patients had attenuated neural response to language; postoperatively, sagittal patients had improved responses in comparison to metopic patients. Use of ERP assessment may help tailor treatment for language deficits earlier in development.

However, this technique has some caveats: the ERPs have to be strictly time-locked with similar shape, i.e. emitted with the same latency and the same profile, with minor fluctuations of their amplitudes. Also, the method requires a huge number of valid trials (similar to 100) to efficiently raise the ERPs from the EEG trials. In the case of cognitive ERPs, as with the N400, the delivered stimulus has to be different for each trial, the latencies are varying, and the number of available trials is usually low. In this paper, an alternative method, coined Integral Shape Averaging (ISA) and its derivatives are detailed. ISA is robust to varying latencies and affine transforms of shape. Furthermore, a new method coined ISAD can be derived to extract ERPs even from a single trial experiment. The aim here is to illustrate the potential of ISAD for N400 component extraction on real EEG data, with emphasis on its general applicability for ERPs computation and its major assets like reduced experimental protocol. Some insights are also given on its potential use to study ERP variability, through shape and latency.

Alterations in sensory processing is a common phenotype of many genetic syndromes associated with intellectual disability (ID). It is currently unknown whether sensory processing alterations converge or diverge on brain responses between syndromes. Here, we compare for the first time four genetic conditions with ID using the same basic sensory learning paradigm. One hundred and five participants, aged between 3 and 30 years old, composing four clinical ID groups and one control group, were recruited: Fragile X syndrome (FXS; n = 14), tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC; n = 9), Down syndrome (DS; n = 19), SYNGAP1 mutations (n = 8) and Neurotypical controls (NT; n = 55)). All groups included female and male participants. Brain responses were recorded using electroencephalography (EEG) during an audio-visual task that involved three repetitions of the pronunciation of the phoneme /a/. Event Related Potentials (ERP) were used to: 1) compare peak-to-peak amplitudes between groups, 2) evaluate the presence of repetition suppression within each group and 3) compare the relative repetition suppression between groups. Our results revealed larger overall amplitudes in FXS. A repetition suppression (RS) pattern was found in the NT group, FXS and DS, suggesting spared repetition suppression in a multimodal task in these two ID syndromes. Interestingly, FXS presented a stronger RS on one peak-to-peak value in comparison with the NT. The results of our study reveal the distinctiveness of ERP and RS brain responses in ID syndromes. Further studies should be conducted to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in these patterns of responses.

Cannabis users demonstrate enhanced neural reactivity to reward: An event-related potential and time-frequency EEG study	ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS			English	Article						Cannabis; ERP; Marijuana; Reward positivity	FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; NEUROIMAGING METAANALYSIS; REGION RESPONSIVITY; MARIJUANA USE; MONETARY; VULNERABILITY; ASSOCIATION; ACTIVATION; DEPRESSION; MOTIVATION	Introduction: Disruptions in neural measures of reward responsiveness are implicated in risk for and the development of Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) in general, but it is not clear if this is also true for Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD). To date, no studies have examined neural reward responsiveness in cannabis users using EEG. Methods: Cannabis users (CU; n = 67) and non-users (n = 60) were drawn from larger studies of individuals with and without internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Groups were matched on current and lifetime psychopathology. Participants completed a validated monetary reward task during electroencephalogram (EEG). One-way between subject analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models examined group differences in four EEG indicators of reward responsiveness - the reward positivity (RewP) and feedback negativity (FN) event-related potentials and two time-frequency measures (reward-related delta and loss-related theta). Results: CU demonstrated an enhanced RewP to the attainment of monetary reward compared to non-users (p = .004), even after controlling for relevant covariates. Secondary analyses found that occasional CU, but not current CUD or remitted CUD, showed enhanced RewP compared to non-users. There were no significant differences in FN, reward-related delta, or loss-related theta time-frequency measures between groups. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to show preliminary evidence that CU have an enhanced RewP to reward and the extent of disruption may be related to CUD status.

J	Ghazikhani, H; Rouhani, M				Ghazikhani, Hamed; Rouhani, Modjtaba			A deep neural network classifier for P300 BCI speller based on Cohen's class time-frequency distribution	TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article						Cohen's class distribution; P300; brain-computer interface (bci); stacked autoencoders; event-related potential (ERP)		This paper presents a new method of predicting the P300 component of an electroencephalography (EEG) signal to recognize the characters in a P300 brain-computer interface (BCI) speller accurately. This method consists of a deep learning model and the nonlinear time-frequency features. It is believed that the combination of the deep model network and extracting the nonlinear features of the EEG led this research to a better prediction of the P300 and, therefore, character recognition. Cohen's class distribution is used in order to extract the nonlinear features of the EEG. Evaluating all of the kernels, Butterworth found to be more informative and it produced better results. Based on the differences observed between time-frequency responses of target and nontarget signals, specific subbands are selected to extract seven features. A deep-structured neural network, namely stacked sparse autoencoders, is applied for BCI character recognition. This deep network reduces the dimension of feature space by extracting unsupervised features. Then, the features are fed to a Softmax classifier. Afterward, the whole network passes a fine-tuning phase by a supervised backpropagation algorithm. For evaluating the work, Dataset II of BCI Competition III is utilized. Based on the results, this approach would improve the accuracy in both P300 detection and character recognition. This research results in 82.7% and 93.5% accuracy for P300 classification and character recognition, respectively.

Although the layout is an important design factor that affects interface aesthetics, whether it can trigger customer's aesthetic preferences in mobile marketing remains unexplored. To address this issue, we employ an empirical methodology of event-related potentials (EPR) in this study from the perspective of cognitive neuroscience and psychology. Subjects are presented with a series of mobile marketing interface images of different layouts with identical marketing content. Their EEG waves were recorded as they were required to distinguish a target stimulus from the others. After the experiment, each of the subjects chose five stimuli interfaces they like and five they dislike. By analyzing the ERP data derived from the EEG data and the behavioral data, we find significant differences between the disliked interfaces and the other interfaces in the ERP component of P2 from the frontal-central area in the 200-400 ms post-stimulus onset time window and LPP from both the frontal-central and parietal-occipital area in the 400-600 ms time window. The results support the hypothesis that humans do make rapid implicit aesthetic preferences for interface layouts and suggest that even under a free browsing context like the mobile marketing context, interface layouts that raise high emotional arousal can still attract more user attention and induce users' implicit aesthetic preference.

Evaluation of the frequency following response as a predictive biomarker of response to cognitive training in schizophrenia	PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH			English	Article						Frequency following response (FFR); Schizophrenia; Speech-in-noise recognition; Auditory cognitive training; Event-related potential (ERP); ERP psychometric reliability	BASE-LINE COMPARISONS; ANALYSIS ERA TOOLBOX; AUDITORY BRAIN-STEM; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; NORMAL-HEARING; DEFICITS; GENERALIZABILITY; RELIABILITY; IMPAIRMENT; P3A	Neurophysiological biomarkers of auditory processing show promise predicting outcomes following auditorybased targeted cognitive training (TCT) in schizophrenia, but the viability of the frequency following response (FFR) as a biomarker has yet to be examined, despite its ecological and face validity for auditory-based interventions. FFR is an event-related potential (ERP) that reflects early auditory processing. We predicted that schizophrenia patients would show acute- and longer-term FFR malleability in the context of TCT. Patients were randomized to either TCT (n = 30) or treatment as usual (TAU; n = 22), and electroencephalography was recorded during rapid presentation of an auditory speech stimulus before treatment, after one hour of training, and after 30 h of training. Whereas patients in the TCT group did not show changes in FFR after training, amplitude reductions were observed in the TAU. FFR was positively associated with performance on a measure of single word-in-noise perception in the TCT group, and with a measure of sentence-in-noise perception in both groups. Psychometric reliability analyses of FFR scores indicated high internal consistency but low one-hour and 12-week test-rest reliability. These findings support the dissociation between measures of speech discriminability along the hierarchy of cortical and subcortical early auditory information processing in schizophrenia.

Forty-five healthy subjects were randomly divided into moderate-intensity aerobic exercise [70% heart rate reserve (HRR)], low-intensity aerobic exercise (50% HRR), or control groups (sitting). Aerobic exercise was performed with cycling. Pressure pain threshold (PPT), heat pain threshold (HPT), event-related potential (ERP) induced by contact heat stimulus and pain scoring were measured before and after the intervention. We found that moderate-intensity aerobic exercise can increase the PPT (rectus femoris: t = -2.71, p = 0.017; tibialis anterior muscle: t = -2.36, p = 0.033) and HPT (tibialis anterior muscle: t = -2.219, p = 0.044) of proximal intervention sites rather than distal sites, and decreased pain scorings of contact heat stimulus. After moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, alpha oscillation power reflecting the central descending inhibitory function was enhanced (t = -2.31, p < 0.05). Low-intensity aerobic exercise mainly reduced the pain unpleasantness rating (Block 1: t = 2.415, p = 0.030; Block 2: t = 3.287, p = 0.005; Block 4: t = 2.646, p = 0.019; Block 5: t = 2.567, p = 0.022). Aerobic exercise had an overall EIH effect. Its hypoalgesic effect was related to exercise intensity and affected by the site and type of pain stimulus. Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise effectively reduced the sensitivity to various painful stimuli, and low-intensity aerobic exercise selectively inhibited the negative emotional pain response. The hypoalgesic mechanism of aerobic exercise involves the enhancement of the central descending inhibitory function.

Here, we propose a universal measure of data quality for ERP research-the standardized measurement error (SME)-which is a special case of the standard error of measurement. Whereas some existing metrics provide a generic quantification of the noise level, the SME quantifies the data quality (precision) for the specific amplitude or latency value being measured in a given study (e.g., the peak latency of the P3 wave). It can be applied to virtually any value that is derived from averaged ERP waveforms, making it a universal measure of data quality. In addition, the SME quantifies the data quality for each individual participant, making it possible to identify participants with low-quality data and "bad" channels. When appropriately aggregated across individuals, SME values can be used to quantify the combined impact of the single-trial EEG noise and the number of trials being averaged together on the effect size and statistical power in a given experiment. If SME values were regularly included in published articles, researchers could identify the recording and analysis procedures that produce the highest data quality, which could ultimately lead to increased effect sizes and greater replicability across the field.

Estimation of mental workload (MWL) levels by electroencephalography (EEG)-based mental state monitoring systems has been widely explored. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), elicited by ignored auditory probes, minimizes intrusiveness and has shown high performance for estimating MWL level when tested in laboratory situations. However, when facing real-world applications, the characteristics of ERP waveforms, like latency and amplitude, are often affected by noise, which leads to a decrease in classification performance. One approach to mitigating this is using spatial covariance, which is less sensitive to latency and amplitude distortion. In this study, we used ignored auditory probes in a single-stimulus paradigm and tested Riemannian processed covariance-based features for MWL level estimation in a realistic flight-control task. Approach. We recorded EEG data with an eight-channel system from participants while they performed a simulated drone-control task and manipulated MWL levels (high and low) by task difficulty. We compared support vector machine classification performance based on frequency band power features versus features generated via the Riemannian log map operator from spatial covariance matrices. We also compared accuracy of using data segmented as auditory ERPs versus non-ERPs, for which data windows did not overlap with the ERPs. Main results. Classification accuracy of both types of features showed no significant difference between ERPs and non-ERPs. When we ignore auditory stimuli to perform continuous decoding, covariance-based features in the gamma band had area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.883, which was significantly higher than band power features (AUC = 0.749). Significance. This study demonstrates that Riemannian-processed covariance features are viable for MWL classification under a realistic experimental scenario.

The analysis of electroencephalography signals has gained notoriety in studying human emotions because of its non-invasive nature. This paper presents a two-stage deep learning model to recognize emotional states by correlating facial expressions and brain signals. Most of the works related to the analysis of emotional states are based on analyzing large segments of signals, generally as long as the evoked potential lasts, which could cause many other phenomena to be involved in the recognition process. Unlike with other phenomena, such as epilepsy, there is no clearly defined marker of when an event begins or ends. The novelty of the proposed model resides in the use of facial expressions as markers to improve the recognition process. This work uses a facial emotion recognition technique (FER) to create identifiers each time an emotional response is detected and uses them to extract segments of electroencephalography (EEG) records that a priori will be considered relevant for the analysis. The proposed model was tested on the DEAP dataset.

We use so-called "covert" wh-questions in Mandarin to probe how such components generalize across different kinds of constructions. This study shows that covert Mandarin wh-questions do not elicit anterior negativities associated with memory maintenance, even when such a dependency is unambiguously cued. N = 37 native speakers of Mandarin Chinese read Chinese questions and declarative sentences word-by-word during EEG recording. In contrast to prior studies, no sustained anterior negativity (SAN) was observed between the cue word, such as the question-embedding verb "wonder," and the in-situ wh-filler. SANs have been linked with working memory maintenance, suggesting that grammatical features may not impose the same maintenance demands as the content words used in prior work.

Method: P200 amplitudes measured preconscious neural activity while viewing photo stimuli. Result: Participants engaged in preconscious categorization of all three types of photo stimuli. The largest P200 amplitudes appeared when viewing photos of Black gay couples, followed by White-Black gay couples, then White gay couples. Conclusion: Individuals begin to categorize same-sex couples by their racial makeup as early as 200 milliseconds. Evidence of preconscious categorization may be helpful in dispelling inaccuracies of using a colorblindness approach to counseling and supervision.

In the past, four methodological problems have complicated the analysis of such combined eye-tracking/electroencephalogram experiments: (1) the synchronization of data streams, (2) the removal of ocular artifacts, (3) the condition-specific temporal overlap between the brain responses evoked by consecutive fixations, and (4) the fact that numerous low-level stimulus and saccade properties also influence the postsaccadic neural responses. Although effective solutions exist for the first two problems, the latter two are only beginning to be addressed. In the current paper, we present and review a unified regression-based framework for FRP analysis that allows us to deconvolve overlapping potentials while also controlling for both linear and nonlinear confounds on the FRP waveform. An open software implementation is provided for all procedures. We then demonstrate the advantages of this proposed (non)linear deconvolution modeling approach for data from three commonly studied paradigms: face perception, scene viewing, and reading. First, for a traditional event-related potential (ERP) face recognition experiment, we show how this technique can separate stimulus ERPs from overlapping muscle and brain potentials produced by small (micro)saccades on the face. Second, in natural scene viewing, we model and isolate multiple nonlinear effects of saccade parameters on the FRP. Finally, for a natural sentence reading experiment using the boundary paradigm, we show how it is possible to study the neural correlates of parafoveal preview after removing spurious overlap effects caused by the associated difference in average fixation time. Our results suggest a principal way of measuring reliable eye movement-related brain activity during natural vision.

Such studies involve collecting electroencephalographic (EEG) data from subjects to train classifiers for decoding users' mental states. However, various sources of inter or intrasubject variabilities in brain signals render training classifiers in BCI systems challenging. From a machine learning perspective, this model training generally follows a common methodology: 1) apply some type of feature extraction, which can be time-consuming and may require domain knowledge and 2) train a classifier using extracted features. The advent of deep learning technologies has offered unprecedented opportunities to not only construct remarkably accurate classifiers but also to integrate the feature extraction stage into the classifier construction. Although integrating feature extraction, which is generally domain-dependent, into the classifier construction is a considerable advantage of deep learning models, the process of architecture selection for BCIs generally depends on domain knowledge. In this study, we examine the feasibility of conducting a systematic model selection combined with mainstream deep learning architectures to construct accurate classifiers for decoding P300 event-related potentials. In particular, we present the results of 232 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (4 datasets x 58 structures), 36 long short-term memory cells (LSTMs) (4 datasets x 9 structures), and 320 hybrid CNN-LSTM models (4 datasets x 80 structures) of varying complexity. Our empirical results show that in the classification of P300 waveforms, the constructed predictive models can outperform the current state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, which are partially or entirely inspired by domain knowledge.

Because of the clutter in social network services (SNS) like Facebook, creating engaging content that can generate click-through and sharing behaviors is becoming a key success factor for SNS marketing. We investigate the neural indicators of engagement with content as a driver of consumers ' click-through behavior in social media. Using a novel neuroscientific research methodology called event-related potentials (ERP), we find unique brainwave signals that combine P3 and late positive potential (LPP), increasing power signals with multiple exposures while young consumers are exposed to highly engaging Facebook posts. These unique brainwave signals in response to engagement with online content, which occur within 300 ms, are detected in the bilateral temporal brain areas. A new neuromarketing method will soon allow marketers to predict consumers ' online click-through behaviors from microsecond brain processes that occur almost simultaneously with the time of content exposure.

As a low-cost and efficient advertising solution, billboards are widely installed on side of the road, especially the motorway. However, the effect of billboards on driver distraction, eye gaze, and cognition has not been fully investigated. This study utilises a customised driving simulator and synchronised electroencephalography (EEG) and eye tracking system to investigate the cognitive processes relating to the processing of driver visual information. A distinction is made between eye gaze fixations relating to stimuli that assist driving and others that may be a source of distraction. The study compares the driver's cognitive responses to fixations on billboards with fixations on the vehicle dashboard. The measured eye-fixation related potential (EFRP) shows that the P1 components are similar; however, the subsequent N1 and P2 components differ. In addition, an EEG motor response is observed when the driver makes an adjustment of driving speed when prompted by speed limit signs. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed measurement system is a valid tool in assessing driver cognition and suggests the cognitive level of engagement to the billboard is likely to be a precursor to driver distraction. The experimental results are compared with the human information processing model found in the literature.

Effects of changes in end-tidal PO2 and PCO2 on neural responses during rest and sustained attention	PHYSIOLOGICAL REPORTS			English	Article						arterial blood gasses; attention; EEG; neural oscillations; neurovascular coupling; P3 ERP	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP-APNEA; CARBON-DIOXIDE; INTERMITTENT HYPOXIA; DOPPLER ULTRASOUND; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; VASCULAR-RESPONSE; HIGH-ALTITUDE; HYPERCAPNIA; ACTIVATION	Impairments of cognitive function during alterations in arterial blood gases (e.g., high-altitude hypoxia) may result from the disruption of neurovascular coupling; however, the link between changes in arterial blood gases, cognition, and cerebral blood flow (CBF) is poorly understood. To interrogate this link. we developed a multimodal empirical strategy capable of monitoring neural correlates of cognition and CBF simultaneously. Human participants performed a sustained attention task during hypoxia, hypercapnia, hypocapnia, and normoxia while electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and CBF (middle and posterior cerebral arteries; transcranial Doppler ultrasound) were simultaneously measured. The protocol alternated between rest and engaging in a visual target detection task that required participants to monitor a sequence of brief-duration colored circles and detect infrequent, longer duration circles (targets). The target detection task was overlaid on a large, circular checkerboard that provided robust visual stimulation. Spectral decomposition and event-related potential (ERP) analyses were applied to the EEG data to investigate spontaneous and task-specific fluctuations in neural activity. There were three main sets of findings: (1) spontaneous alpha oscillatory activity was modulated as a function of arterial CO2 (hypocapnia and hypercapnia), (2) task-related neurovascular coupling was disrupted by all arterial blood gas manipulations, and (3) changes in task-related alpha and theta band activity and attenuation of the P3 ERP component amplitude were observed during hypocapnia. Since alpha and theta are linked with suppression of visual processing and executive control and P3 amplitude with task difficulty, these data suggest that transient arterial blood gas changes can modulate multiple stages of cognitive information processing.

Particularly, the examination of N1 and P2 components of the auditory ERP may shed light on the impairments of information processing streams in schizophrenia. However, the habituation properties (i.e., decreasing amplitude with the repeated presentation of an auditory stimulus) of these components remain poorly studied compared to other auditory ERPs. Therefore, the current study used a roving paradigm to assess the modulation and habituation of N1 and P2 to simple (pure tones) and complex sounds (human voices and bird songs) in 26 first-episode patients with schizophrenia and 27 healthy participants. To explore the habituation properties of these ERPs, we measured the decrease in amplitude over a train of seven repetitions of the same stimulus (either bird songs or human voices). We observed that, for human voices, N1 and P2 amplitudes decreased linearly from stimulus 1-7, in both groups. Regarding bird songs, only the P2 component showed a decreased amplitude with stimulus presentation, exclusively in the control group. This suggests that patients did not show a fading of neural responses to repeated bird songs, reflecting abnormal habituation to this stimulus. This could reflect the inability to inhibit irrelevant or redundant information at later stages of auditory processing. In turn schizophrenia patients appear to have a preserved auditory processing of human voices.

Results showed a task-independent increase of the N170 component for faces associated with negative information, while interactions occurred for the Early Posterior Negativity (EPN) and the Late Positive Potential (LPP), showing ERP differences only when paying attention to the evaluative information. Trait anxiety and neuroticism did not influence ERP differences. Low agreeableness increased EPN differences during perceptual distraction. Thus, we observed that low agreeableness leads to early increased processing of potentially hostile faces, although participants were required to attend to a face-unrelated feature.

Brain event-related potentials predict individual differences in inhibitory control	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							RESPONSE-INHIBITION; EEG; STOP; MOTOR; MODELS; REGULARIZATION; IMPULSIVITY; COMPONENTS; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS	Stop-signal reaction time (SSRT), the time needed to cancel an already-initiated motor response, quantifies individual differences in inhibitory control. Electrophysiological correlates of SSRT have primarily focused on late event-related potential (ERP) components over midline scalp regions from successfully inhibited stop trials. SSRT is robustly associated with the P300, there is mixed evidence for N200 involvement, and there is little information on the role of early ERP components. Here, machine learning was first used to interrogate ERPs during both successful and failed stop trials from 64 scalp electrodes at 4 ms resolution (n = 148). The most predictive model included data from both successful and failed stop trials, with a cross-validated Pearson's r of 0.32 between measured and predicted SSRT, significantly higher than null models. From successful stop trials, spatio-temporal features overlapping the N200 in right frontal areas and the P300 in frontocentral areas predicted SSRT, as did early ERP activity (<200 ms). As a demonstration of the reproducibility of these findings, the application of this model to a separate dataset of 97 participants was also significant (r = 0.29). These results show that ERPs during failed stops are relevant to SSRT, and that both early and late ERP activity contribute to individual differences in SSRT. Notably, the right lateralized N200, which predicted SSRT here, is not often observed in neurotypical adults. Both the ascending slope and peak of the P300 component predicted SSRT. These results were replicable, both within the training sample and when applied to ERPs from a separate dataset.	[Rueda-Delgado, L. M.; O'Halloran, L.; Enz, N.; Ruddy, K.

This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of auditory and visual P300 in patients with TLE having unilateral HS using electroencephalography (EEG) and to study its correlation with cognition. Methods: This is a cross-sectional case-control study, where P300 characteristics in thirty patients with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis with refractory epilepsy were compared with fifteen age-, gender-, and years of education-matched healthy controls (M: F-10:5, mean age-28 +/- 4.76 years). Among patients, 15 belonged to the right HS group (M: F-9:6, age at onset-12.92 +/- 10.22 years, duration of epilepsy 16.67 +/- 9.38 years) and 15 to the left HS group (M: F-8:7, age at onset-10.62 +/- 7.18 years, duration of epilepsy-15.53 +/- 10.14 years). All subjects underwent EEG-based auditory and visual oddball tasks and cognitive assessment. The P300 latencies (in milliseconds) as well as amplitudes (in microvolts) were predicted in EEG and were correlated with cognitive scores. Source localization of P300 was performed with the CLARA algorithm. Results: The auditory P300 latencies in controls, right HS, and left HS were 323.93 +/- 40.28, 351.06 +/- 47.23, and 328.80 +/- 36.03, respectively (p = 0.18) and its amplitudes were 2.3040 +/- 1.46, 2.77 +/- 1.19, and 2.68 +/- 1.78, respectively (p = 0.48). Visual P300 latencies in controls, right HS, and left HS were 365.87 +/- 47.37, 359.67 +/- 64.45, and 376.00 +/- 60.06, respectively (p = 0.51) and its amplitudes were 3.93 +/- 2.28, 2.09 +/- 1.45, and 3.56 +/- 1.74, respectively (p = 0.014). Further, when compared to the control group the cognitive scores were lower in the patient group (p < 0.05). Significance: In comparison to the controls, patients with right HS recorded lesser amplitude on visual P300 and lower scores on cognitive tests. P300 and cognitive parameters exhibited varied relationship. P300 could be a complementary objective tool to assess cognition in patients with TLE. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Brain Responses to Surprising Stimulus Offsets: Phenomenology and Functional Significance	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						behavioral relevance; Electroencephalography (EEG); stimulus offset; surprise; Vertex Potential	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LASER-EVOKED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY CHANGE COMPLEX; EEG RESPONSES; ONSET; RAT; REFLECT; IDENTIFICATION; COMPONENTS; PATHWAYS	Abrupt increases of sensory input (onsets) likely reflect the occurrence of novel events or objects in the environment, potentially requiring immediate behavioral responses. Accordingly, onsets elicit a transient and widespread modulation of ongoing electrocortical activity: the Vertex Potential (VP), which is likely related to the optimisation of rapid behavioral responses. In contrast, the functional significance of the brain response elicited by abrupt decreases of sensory input (offsets) is more elusive, and a detailed comparison of onset and offset VPs is lacking. In four experiments conducted on 44 humans, we observed that onset and offset VPs share several phenomenological and functional properties: they (1) have highly similar scalp topographies across time, (2) are both largely comprised of supramodal neural activity, (3) are both highly sensitive to surprise and (4) co-occur with similar modulations of ongoing motor output. These results demonstrate that the onset and offset VPs largely reflect the activity of a common supramodal brain network, likely consequent to the activation of the extralemniscal sensory system which runs in parallel with core sensory pathways. The transient activation of this system has clear implications in optimizing the behavioral responses to surprising environmental changes.	[Somervail, R.; Bufacchi, R.

Learning dynamics of electrophysiological brain signals during human fear conditioning	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Sequential-set fear conditioning; EEG; C1; P1; N170; LPP	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TOP-DOWN CONTROL; PAIN PERCEPTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; ERP COMPONENTS; VISUAL-CORTEX; ELECTROCORTICAL EVIDENCE; EMOTIONAL PERCEPTION; PREDICTION ERRORS; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS	Electrophysiological studies in rodents allow recording neural activity during threats with high temporal and spatial precision. Although fMRI has helped translate insights about the anatomy of underlying brain circuits to humans, the temporal dynamics of neural fear processes remain opaque and require EEG. To date, studies on electrophysiological brain signals in humans have helped to elucidate underlying perceptual and attentional processes, but have widely ignored how fear memory traces evolve over time. The low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG demands aggregations across high numbers of trials, which will wash out transient neurobiological processes that are induced by learning and prone to habituation. Here, our goal was to unravel the plasticity and temporal emergence of EEG responses during fear conditioning. To this end, we developed a new sequential-set fear conditioning paradigm that comprises three successive acquisition and extinction phases, each with a novel CS+/CSset. Each set consists of two different neutral faces on different background colors which serve as CS+ and CS-, respectively. Thereby, this design provides sufficient trials for EEG analyses while tripling the relative amount of trials that tap into more transient neurobiological processes. Consistent with prior studies on ERP components, data-driven topographic EEG analyses revealed that ERP amplitudes were potentiated during time periods from 33-60 ms, 108-200 ms, and 468-820 ms indicating that fear conditioning prioritizes early sensory processing in the brain, but also facilitates neural responding during later attentional and evaluative stages. Importantly, averaging across the three CS+/CS- sets allowed us to probe the temporal evolution of neural processes: Responses during each of the three time windows gradually increased from early to late fear conditioning, while long-latency (460-730 ms) electrocortical responses diminished throughout fear extinction. Our novel paradigm demonstrates how short-, mid-, and long-latency EEG responses change during fear conditioning and extinction, findings that enlighten the learning curve of neurophysiological responses to threat in humans.

EEG as a Functional Marker of Nicotine Activity: Evidence From a Pilot Study of Adults With Late-Life Depression	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						nicotine; EEG; late-life depression; beta power; event-related oscillations	COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; TRANSDERMAL NICOTINE; PARIETAL CORTEX; ANTERIOR SHIFT; EXECUTIVE DYSFUNCTION; GENERATOR PATTERNS; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; FRONTAL SHIFT; DOUBLE-BLIND; ATTENTION	Late-life depression (LLD) is a debilitating condition that is associated with poor response to antidepressant medications and deficits in cognitive performance. Nicotinic cholinergic stimulation has emerged as a potentially effective candidate to improve cognitive performance in patients with cognitive impairment. Previous studies of nicotinic stimulation in animal models and human populations with cognitive impairment led to examining potential cognitive and mood effects of nicotinic stimulation in older adults with LLD. We report results from a pilot study of transdermal nicotine in LLD testing whether nicotine treatment would enhance cognitive performance and mood. The study used electroencephalography (EEG) recordings as a tool to test for potential mechanisms underlying the effect of nicotine. Eight non-smoking participants with LLD completed EEG recordings at baseline and after 12 weeks of transdermal nicotine treatment (NCT02816138). Nicotine augmentation treatment was associated with improved performance on an auditory oddball task. Analysis of event-related oscillations showed that nicotine treatment was associated with reduced beta desynchronization at week 12 for both standard and target trials. The change in beta power on standard trials was also correlated with improvement in mood symptoms. This pilot study provides preliminary evidence for the impact of nicotine in modulating cortical activity and improving mood in depressed older adults and shows the utility of using EEG as a marker of functional engagement in nicotinic interventions in clinical geriatric patients.

It can be employed to obtain the inference of change between the external environment and the internal psychology, which requires us to recognize different single trial event-related magnetic fields (ERFs) originated from different functional areas of the brain. Current recognition methods for the single trial data are mainly used for event-related potentials (ERPs) in the electroencephalography (EEG). Although the MEG shares the same signal sources with the EEG, much less interference from the other brain tissues may give the MEG an edge in recognition of the ERFs. In this work, we propose a new recognition method for the single trial auditory evoked magnetic fields (AEFs) through enhancing the signal. We find that the signal strength of the single trial AEFs is concentrated in the primary auditory cortex of the temporal lobe, which can be clearly displayed in the 2D images. These 2D images are then recognized by an artificial neural network (ANN) with 100% accuracy, which realizes the automatic recognition for the single trial AEFs. The method not only may be combined with the source estimation algorithm to improve its accuracy but also paves the way for the implementation of the brain-computer interface (BCI) with the MEG.

To study the effect of edge shape (sharp, round, and flat shape) of triangular ridges on brain activity during touching, electroencephalograph (EEG) signals during tactile perception were evaluated using event-related potentials (ERP) and non-linear analysis methods. The results showed that the early component of P100 and P200, and the late component of P300 were successfully induced during perceiving the ridged texture. The edge shape features affect the electrical activity of brain during the tactile perceptions. The sharp shape feature evoked fast P100 latency and high P100 amplitude. The flat texture with complex (sharp and flat) shape feature evoked fast P200 latency, high P200 amplitude and RQA parameters. Both of the sharp shape and complex shape feature tended to evoke high peak amplitude of P300. The large-scale structures of recurrence plots (RPs) and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) parameters can visually and quantitatively characterize the evolution regulation of the dynamic behavior of EEG system along with the tactile process. This study proved that RPs and RQA were protential methods for the feature extraction and state recognition of EEG during tactile perception of textured surface. This research contributes to optimize surface tactile characteristics on products, especially effective surface textures design for good grip.

Not all errors are alike: modulation of error-related neural responses in musical joint action	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						performance monitoring; errors; joint action; electroencephalography (EEG); piano performance	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; BRAIN POTENTIALS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; AUDITORY-FEEDBACK; ACTION SIMULATION; ACTION IDENTITY; PIANISTS; RECOGNITION; PERCEPTION; REPRESENTATION	During joint action, the sense of agency enables interaction partners to implement corrective and adaptive behaviour in response to performance errors. When agency becomes ambiguous (e.g. when action similarity encourages perceptual self-other overlap), confusion as to who produced what may disrupt this process. The current experiment investigated how ambiguity of agency affects behavioural and neural responses to errors in a joint action domain where self-other overlap is common: musical duos. Pairs of pianists performed piano pieces in synchrony, playing either the same pitches (ambiguous agency) or different pitches (unambiguous agency) while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded for each individual. Behavioural and event-related potential results showed no effects of the agency manipulation but revealed differences in how distinct error types are processed. Self-produced 'wrong note' errors (substitutions) were left uncorrected, showed post-error slowing and elicited an error-related negativity (ERN) peaking before erroneous keystrokes (pre-ERN). In contrast, self-produced 'extra note' errors (additions) exhibited pre-error slowing, error and post-error speeding, were rapidly corrected and elicited the ERN. Other-produced errors evoked a feedback-related negativity but no behavioural effects. Overall findings shed light upon how the nervous system supports fluent interpersonal coordination in real-time joint action by employing distinct mechanisms to manage different types of errors.

It may be hypothesized that higher task attentional/cognitive demand will result in larger differences in these paradigms, which may help understanding the substrates of cognitive deficits in this syndrome. To this aim, we performed an EEG study comparing the effects of increasing the attentional/cognitive load of an auditory N-back task on the Event-Related Potential in 50 subjects with schizophrenia (11 first episodes) and 35 healthy controls. We considered a post-target window of 1000 ms to explore possible between groups differences in N100, P300, and Late Slow Wave (LSW), and compared these components between 0-back ('lower attentional/cognitive load) and 1-back ('higher attentional/cognitive load') conditions. Our results showed that N100 and LSW amplitude increase from 0- to 1back condition was significantly larger in healthy controls compared to schizophrenia patients. Furthermore, LSW amplitude difference between 0- and 1-back conditions positively correlated with performance in the behavioral cognitive assessment. Taken together, these results support that higher task attentional/cognitive load (0-back vs. 1-back condition) increase N100 amplitude differences and reveal new findings related to the LSW component in schizophrenia.

However, recent studies showed no effects of perceptual load on early ERPs in response to task-irrelevant emotional faces. In this preregistered EEG study (N = 40), we investigated the effects of continuous perceptual load on ERPs to fearful and neutral task-irrelevant faces and their phase-scrambled versions. Perceptual load did not modulate face or emotion effects for the P1 or N170. In contrast, larger face-scramble and fearful-neutral differentiation were found during low as compared to high load for the Early Posterior Negativity (EPN). Further, face-independent P1, but face-dependent N170 emotional modulations were observed. Taken together, our findings show that P1 and N170 face and emotional modulations are highly resistant to load manipulations, indicating a high degree of automaticity during this processing stage, whereas the EPN might represent a bottleneck in visual information processing.

To do this, two different approaches are considered: a hierarchical tree-based algorithm, XGBoost, and feedfoward neural networks, highlighting the pros and cons of both approaches in the different steps of the classification task. Moreover, the sensitivity of the classification capabilities of the tool as a function of the number of available electrodes is also studied, highlighting what can be achieved by applying the method using commercial, wearable EEG systems. The main novelty of this work consists in significantly enlarging the pool of stimuli that the expert system can recognize and comprising different, possibly mixed, sensorial domains. The obtained results open the way to the design of portable devices for augmented communication systems, which can be of particular interest for the development of advanced Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) for communication with different types of neurologically impaired patients.

Here, we investigated how this learning process changes the neural encoding of natural speech by assessing the encoding of the linguistic feature hierarchy in second-language listeners. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded from native Mandarin speakers with varied English proficiency and from native English speakers while they listened to audio-stories in English. We measured the temporal response functions (TRFs) for acoustic, phonemic, phonotactic, and semantic features in individual participants and found a main effect of proficiency on linguistic encoding. This effect of second-language proficiency was particularly prominent on the neural encoding of phonemes, showing stronger encoding of "new" phonemic contrasts (i.e., English contrasts that do not exist in Mandarin) with increasing proficiency. Overall, we found that the nonnative listeners with higher proficiency levels had a linguistic feature representation more similar to that of native listeners, which enabled the accurate decoding of language proficiency. This result advances our understanding of the cortical processing of linguistic information in second-language learners and provides an objective measure of language proficiency.

In general, the EEG artifact removal methods have been considered as a fundamental preliminary step during EEG analysis. However, the associated challenges of EEG artifact removal methods should be addressed carefully, to fully utilize the data. This manuscript is based on the notion that the full capacity of the EEG artifact removal methods can be achieved while addressing the associated challenges well. Because these methods could enhance the inferences deduced from the EEG data. The focus of this manuscript is to elaborate challenges (e.g., the algorithm-specific challenges and general challenges) of the EEG artifact removal methods. Considering the challenges, the manuscript has presented recommendations to address them. The manuscript also provides information on Matlab and Pythonbased toolboxes developed for EEG preprocessing. In addition, this manuscript provides a brief account of the EEG artifact types along with an overview of the EEG artifact removal methods. In short, this manuscript provides information on various EEG artifact removal methods and the recommendations provided serve as guidelines for the selection of suitable tools and methods for EEG artifact corrections.

A better-described discriminative rapid touch system is comprised of fast conducting myelinated A beta-afferents and provides detailed information on touch location and features of a tactile stimulus. A recently discovered slow emotional touch system comprises unmyelinated C type afferents (C-tactile afferents) and yields virtually no information on the stimulus character but instead provides a feeling of pleasure in response to slow gentle touch, promoting affiliative behaviors. Neuroimaging studies revealed that C-tactile afferents project through spinothalamic tract to insula and prefrontal cortical networks related to social behavior but the dynamics of the cortical response is yet poorly studied. This pilot study aims to assess event -related potentials elicited by gentle stroking touch delivered by a robotic device with fast (30 cm/s) and slow (5 cm/s) velocities. Earlier ERP components, P600 and N900 were observed primarily at frontolateral electrodes; their amplitude was significantly larger for fast strokes which, taken together with their latency, links them to cortical processing of A beta-afferents response. Exclusive for slow strokes, we discovered P2100-N2300 complex, presumably related to An-response to stroke offset, and an ultra -late positive potential observed at 3000-4000 ms after stimulus onset, suggestively linked to processing of C-tactile afferent input. The data confirm earlier findings relating ultra-late positive potential to slow pleasant touch and help to distinguish between ERP components linked to A beta- and C-tactile afferent input.

A systematic review of cognitive event-related potentials in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Review						Event-related potentials; Alzheimer's disease; Mild cognitive impairment; Apolipoprotein-E epsilon 4; Biomarkers; Electroencephalography	SEMANTIC MEMORY ACTIVATION; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; WORD REPETITION; OLDER-ADULTS; P300 SUBCOMPONENTS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; GENETIC RISK	This systematic review examined whether event-related potentials (ERPs) during higher cognitive processing can detect subtle, early signs of neurodegenerative disease. Original, empirical studies retrieved from PsycINFO and PubMed were reviewed if they analyzed patterns in cognitive ERPs (>= 150 ms post-stimulus) differentiating mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), or cognitively intact elders who carry AD risk through the Apolipoprotein-E epsilon 4 allele (epsilon 4+) from healthy older adult controls (HC). The 100 studies meeting inclusion criteria (MCI = 47; AD = 47; epsilon 4+ = 6) analyzed N200, P300, N400, and occasionally, later components. While there was variability across studies, patterns of reduced amplitude and delayed latency were apparent in pathological aging, consistent with AD-related brain atrophy and cognitive impairment. These effects were particularly evident in advanced disease progression (i.e., AD > MCI) and in later ERP components measured during complex tasks. Although ERP studies in intact epsilon 4+ elders are thus far scarce, a similar pattern of delayed latency was notable, along with a contrasting pattern of increased amplitude, consistent with compensatory neural activation. This limited work suggests ERPs might be able to index early neural changes indicative of future cognitive decline in otherwise healthy elders. As ERPs are also accessible and affordable relative to other neuroimaging methods, their addition to cognitive assessment might substantively enhance early identification and characterization of neural dysfunction, allowing opportunity for earlier differential diagnosis and targeting of intervention. To evaluate this possibility there is urgent need for well-powered studies assessing late cognitive ERPs during complex tasks, particularly in healthy elders at risk for cognitive decline.

J	Pierce, LJ; Tague, EC; Nelson, CA				Pierce, Lara J.; Tague, Erin Carmody; Nelson, Charles A., III			Maternal stress predicts neural responses during auditory statistical learning in 26-month-old children: An event-related potential study*	COGNITION			English	Article						Maternal stress; Socioeconomic status; Auditory statistical learning; Event-related potential (ERP); Language	SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; TONE SEQUENCES; HUMAN INFANTS; EEG POWER; LANGUAGE; BRAIN; SEGMENTATION; MECHANISMS	Exposure to high levels of early life stress have been associated with long-term difficulties in learning, behavior, and health, with particular impact evident in the language domain. While some have proposed that the increased stress of living in a low-income household mediates observed associations between socioeconomic status (SES) and child outcomes, considerable individual differences have been observed. The extent to which specific variables associated with socioeconomic status - in particular exposure to stressful life events - influence the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying language acquisition are not well understood. Auditory statistical learning, or the ability to segment a continuous auditory stream based on its statistical properties, develops during early infancy and is one mechanism thought to underlie language learning. The present study used an event-related potential (ERP) paradigm to test whether maternal stress, adjusting for socioeconomic variables (e. g., family income, maternal education) was associated with neurocognitive processes underlying statistical learning in a sample of 26-month-old children (n = 23) from predominantly low- to middle-income backgrounds. Event-related potentials were recorded while children listened to a continuous stream of tri-tone "words" in which tone elements varied in transitional probability. "Tone-words" were presented in random order, such that Tone 1 always predicted Tones 2 and 3 (transitional probability for Tone 3 = 1.0), but Tone 1 appeared randomly. A larger P2 amplitude was observed in response to Tone 3 compared to Tone 1, demonstrating that children implicitly tracked differences in transitional probabilities during passive listening. Maternal reports of stress at 26 months, adjusting for SES, were negatively associated with difference in P2 amplitude between Tones 1 and 3. These findings suggest that maternal stress, within a low-SES context, is associated with the manner in which children process statistical properties of auditory input.

Trait anxiety has been proposed to modulate these responses, but it is yet unclear how such modulations depend on feature-based attention. In this preregistered study (N = 80), we investigated the effects of trait anxiety on ERP differences between fearful and neutral faces across three different tasks. Participants had to discriminate either the orientation of lines overlaid onto the faces, the gender of the face, or the emotional expression, thus increasing attention to emotionally relevant facial features across the tasks. Fearful versus neutral faces elicited increased P1 and N170 amplitudes across tasks and potentiated amplitudes when attention was directed to faces (early posterior negativity [EPN]) or the expression (EPN and late positive potential). Higher trait anxiety was related to smaller EPN differences between fearful and neutral faces during the perceptual discrimination task. This early relationship suggests reduced instead of amplified processing of fearful faces for high trait anxious participants under perceptual distraction.

In wakefulness, perception of periodicities supports the emergence of high-order representations such as the pulse-like meter perceived while listening to music. Electroencephalography (EEG) frequency-tagged responses elicited at envelope frequencies of musical rhythms have been shown to provide a neural representation of rhythm processing. Specifically, responses at frequencies corresponding to the perceived meter are enhanced over responses at meter-unrelated frequencies. This selective enhancement must rely on higher-level perceptual processes, as it occurs even in irregular (i.e., syncopated) rhythms where meter frequencies are not prominent input features, thus ruling out acoustic confounds. We recorded EEG while presenting a regular (unsyncopated) and an irregular (syncopated) rhythm across sleep stages and wakefulness. Our results show that frequency-tagged responses at meter-related frequencies of the rhythms were selectively enhanced during wakefulness but attenuated across sleep states. Most importantly, this selective attenuation occurred even in response to the irregular rhythm, where meter-related frequencies were not prominent in the stimulus, thus suggesting that neural processes selectively enhancing meter-related frequencies during wakefulness are weakened during rapid eye movement (REM) and further suppressed in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. These results indicate preserved processing of low-level acoustic properties but limited higher-order processing of auditory rhythms during sleep.

It has been repeatedly demonstrated that background (distractor) sound sources are easier to ignore when their spectrotemporal signature is predictable. Prior evidence suggests that this ability to exploit predictability for foreground-background segregation degrades with age. On a theoretical level, this has been related with an impairment in elderly adults' capabilities to detect certain types of sensory deviance in unattended sound sequences. Yet the link between those two capacities, deviance detection and predictability-based sound source segregation, has not been empirically demonstrated. Here we report on a combined behavioral-EEG study investigating the ability of elderly listeners (60-75 years of age) to use predictability as a cue for sound source segregation, as well as their sensory deviance detection capacities. Listeners performed a detection task on a target stream that can only be solved when a concurrent distractor stream is successfully ignored. We contrast two conditions whose distractor streams differ in their predictability. The ability to benefit from predictability was operationalized as performance difference between the two conditions. Results show that elderly listeners can use predictability for sound source segregation at group level, yet with a high degree of inter-individual variation in this ability. In a further, passive-listening control condition, we measured correlates of deviance detection in the event-related brain potential (ERP) elicited by occasional deviations from the same spectrotemporal pattern as used for the predictable distractor sequence during the behavioral task. ERP results confirmed neural signatures of deviance detection in terms of mismatch negativity (MMN) at group level. Correlation analyses at single-subject level provide no evidence for the hypothesis that deviance detection ability (measured by MMN amplitude) is related to the ability to benefit from predictability for sound source segregation. These results are discussed in the frameworks of sensory deviance detection and predictive coding.

Sixteen adolescents with NF1 were compared with controls on measures of WM and EEG was recorded during a WM nback task. The NF1 group showed poorer performance on measures of WM as compared to the control group. No group differences were observed in P300 amplitude at Pz, but P300 latency was shorter in the NF1 group. Topographic analyses of P300 amplitude showed group differences indicating neural processing differences in the NF1 group relative to controls, which possibly contribute to the cognitive deficits seen in this population.

However, most of these studies attended to physical pain despite evidence indicating that other forms of pain may also affect brain activity and emotional states in similar ways. To address this limitation, we compared empathic responses of 33 participants, some of whom had experienced a personal loss, across three conditions: observing strangers in physical pain, psychological pain, and a non-painful condition. We also examined the effect of presence of prior painful experience on empathic reactions. In addition, we examined the stimulation type, prior experience, and ERPs in the early Late Positive Potential (300-550 ms), late Late Positive Potential (550-800 ms), and very late Late Positive Potential (VLLPP; 800-1,050 ms) time windows. Behavioral data indicated that participants who had personally experienced a loss scored significantly higher on perspective taking in the psychological-pain condition. ERP results also indicated significantly lower intensity in Fp2, an electrode in the prefrontal region, within VLLPP time window for participants experiencing a loss in the psychological-pain condition. The results of both behavioral and ERP analysis indicated that prior experience of psychological pain is related to cognitive empathy, but not affective empathy. The implication of these findings for research on empathy, for the study of psychological pain, and the moderating influence of prior painful experiences are discussed.

J	Wang, SS; van den Berg, B				Wang, Susie; van den Berg, Berry			Neuroscience and climate change: How brain recordings can help us understand human responses to climate change	CURRENT OPINION IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review						EEG; ERP; Cognitive neuroscience; Environmental psychology; Climate Change	ERP; POTENTIALS; PERCEPTION; FAIRNESS; DECISION; CORTEX; P300; SELF	There is little published neuroscience research on the psychology of climate change. This review outlines how carefully designed experiments that measure key neural processes, linked to specific cognitive processes, can provide powerful tools to answer research questions in climate change psychology. We review relevant literature from social neuroscience that can be applicable to environmental research- the neural correlates of fairness and cooperation, altruistic behaviour and personal values- and discuss important factors when translating environmental psychology constructs to neuroscientific measurement. We provide a practical overview of how to implement environmental neuroscience using electroenceph-alography, summarising important event-related potential components and how they can be used to answer questions in climate change psychology. Challenges for the field include accurate attribution of findings, both within and between studies, the need for interdisciplinary collaboration, peer review and reporting processes.

J	Li, DY; Wang, XC				Li, Danyang; Wang, Xiaochun			Can ambient odors influence the recognition of emotional words? A behavioral and event-related potentials study	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						Olfaction; Odor context; Emotional word; ERP; Pleasant odor; Unpleasant odor	ATTENTION; ERP; CONCRETENESS; ADJECTIVES; COGNITION; LANGUAGE; CONTEXT; FASTER; MEMORY; FACE	Odor context can affect the recognition of facial expressions. However, there is no evidence to date that odor can regulate the processing of emotional words conveyed by visual words. An emotional word recognition task was combined with event-related potential technology. Briefly, 49 adults were randomly divided into three odor contexts (pleasant odor, unpleasant odor, and no odor) to judge the valence of emotional words (positive, negative, and neutral). Both behavioral and Electroencephalography (EEG) data were collected. Both the pleasant odor and unpleasant odor contexts shortened the response time of the subjects to emotional words. In addition, negative words induced greater amplitudes of early posterior negativity (EPN) and late positive potential (LPP) than the positive and neutral words. However, the neutral words induced a larger N400 amplitude than the positive and negative words. More importantly, the processing of emotional words was found to be modulated by external odor contexts. For example, during the earlier (P2) processing stages, pleasant and unpleasant odor contexts induced greater P2 amplitudes than the no odor context. In the unpleasant odor context, negative words with the same odor valence induced greater P2 amplitudes than the positive words. During the later (N400) stages, various regions of the brain regions exhibited different results. For example, in the left and right frontal areas of the brain, exposure to positive words in a pleasant odor context resulted in a smaller N400 amplitude than exposure to neutral words in the same context. Meanwhile, in the left and right central regions, emotional words with the same valence as pleasant or unpleasant odor contexts elicited the minimum N400 amplitude. Individuals are very sensitive to emotional information. With deeper processing, different cognitive processes are reflected and they can be modulated by external odors. In the early and late stages of word processing, both pleasant and unpleasant odor contexts exhibited an undifferentiated dominance effect and could specifically modulate affectively congruent words.

Studies provide a mixed picture of how such information affects event-related potentials (ERPs). We systematically examined the effect of feature-based attention on ERP modulations to briefly presented faces of individuals associated with a crime. The tasks required participants (N = 40 adults) to discriminate the orientation of lines overlaid onto the face, the age of the face, or emotional information associated with the face. Negative faces amplified the N170 ERP component during all tasks, whereas the early posterior negativity (EPN) and late positive potential (LPP) components were increased only when the emotional information was attended to. These findings suggest that during early configural analyses (N170), evaluative information potentiates face processing regardless of feature-based attention. During intermediate, only partially resource-dependent, processing stages (EPN) and late stages of elaborate stimulus processing (LPP), attention to the acquired emotional information is necessary for amplified processing of negatively evaluated faces.

This work is the first to systematically review -following PRISMA guidelines- the empirical evidence regarding the effects of BD on neural activity -assessed by electroencephalography- of adolescents and young adults. A systematic review was conducted in 34 studies (N = 1723). Results indicated that binge drinkers (BDs) showed similar behavioral performance as non/low drinkers. The most solid electrophysiological finding was an augmented P3 amplitude during attention, working memory and inhibition tasks. This increased neural activity suggests the recruitment of additional resources to perform the task at adequate/successful levels, which supports the neurocompensation hypothesis. Similar to alcoholics, BDs also displayed increased reactivity to alcohol-related cues, augmented resting-state electrophysiological signal and reduced activity during error detection -which gives support to the continuum hypothesis. Evidence does not seem to support greater vulnerability to BD in females. Replication and longitudinal studies are required to account for mixed results and to elucidate the extent/direction of the neural impairments associated with BD.

However, evidence of the benefits of combined physical and mental regimes over a sedentary lifestyle remain sparse. The goal of this study was to investigate potential mechanisms, from a source-resolved event-related-potential perspective, that could explain how practicing long-term physical and mental exercise can benefit neural processing during the execution of an attention switching task. Fifty-three healthy community volunteers who self-reported long-term practice of Tai Chi (n = 10), meditation + exercise (n = 16), simple aerobics (n = 15), or a sedentary lifestyle (n = 12), aged 47.8 +/- 14.6 (SD) were included in this analysis. All participants undertook high-density electroencephalography recording during a switch paradigm. Our results indicate that people who practice physical and mental exercise perform better in a task-switching paradigm. Our analysis revealed an additive effect of the combined practice of physical and mental exercise over physical exercise only. In addition, we confirmed the participation of frontal, parietal and cingulate areas as generators of event-related-potential components (N2-like and P3-like) commonly associated to the performance of switch tasks. Particularly, the N2-like component of the parietal and frontal domains showed significantly greater amplitudes in the exercise and mental training groups compared with aerobics and sedentary groups. Furthermore, we showed better performance associated with greater N2-like amplitudes. Our multivariate analysis revealed that activity type was the most relevant factor to explain the difference between groups, with an important influence of age, and body mass index, and with small effects of educational years, cardiovascular capacity, and sex. These results suggest that chronic combined physical and mental training may confer significant benefits to executive function in normally aging adults, probably through more efficient early attentional processing. Future experimental studies are needed to confirm our results and understand the mechanisms on parieto-frontal networks that contribute to the cognitive improvement associated with practicing combined mental and aerobic exercise, while carefully controlling confounding factors, such as age and body mass index.

J	Alsuradi, H; Park, W; Eid, M				Alsuradi, Haneen; Park, Wanjoo; Eid, Mohamad			Midfrontal theta oscillation encodes haptic delay	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PREDICTION ERRORS; EEG DYNAMICS; BETA; FEEDBACK; SYNCHRONIZATION; MODULATION; ADAPTATION; MOVEMENTS; RESPONSES; SIGNALS	Haptic technologies aim to simulate tactile or kinesthetic interactions with a physical or virtual environment in order to enhance user experience and/or performance. However, due to stringent communication and computational needs, the user experience is influenced by delayed haptic feedback. While delayed feedback is well understood in the visual and auditory modalities, little research has systematically examined the neural correlates associated with delayed haptic feedback. In this paper, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to study sensory and cognitive neural correlates caused by haptic delay during passive and active tasks performed using a haptic device and a computer screen. Results revealed that theta power oscillation was significantly higher at the midfrontal cortex under the presence of haptic delay. Sensory correlates represented by beta rebound were found to be similar in the passive task and different in the active task under the delayed and synchronous conditions. Additionally, the event related potential (ERP) P200 component is modulated under the haptic delay condition during the passive task. The P200 amplitude significantly reduced in the last 20% of trials during the passive task and in the absence of haptic delay. Results suggest that haptic delay could be associated with increased cognitive control processes including multi-sensory divided attention followed by conflict detection and resolution with an earlier detection during the active task. Additionally, haptic delay tends to generate greater perceptual attention that does not significantly decay across trials during the passive task.

In our study, three shapes of traffic symbols (circles, squares, and triangles) which are most commonly used in road driving were used to evaluate the elderly drivers' recognition. When traffic signs are randomly shown in HUD (head-up display), subjects compare them with the symbol displayed outside of the vehicle. In this test, we conducted a Go/Nogo test and determined the differences in ERP (event-related potential) data between correct and incorrect answers of EEG signals. As a result, the wrong answer rate for the elderly was 1.5 times higher than for the youths. All generation groups had a delay of 20-30 ms of P300 with incorrect answers. In order to achieve clearer differentiation, ERP data were modeled with unsupervised machine learning and supervised deep learning. The young group's correct/incorrect data were classified well using unsupervised machine learning with no pre-processing, but the elderly group's data were not. On the other hand, the elderly group's data were classified with a high accuracy of 75% using supervised deep learning with simple signal processing. Our results can be used as a basis for the implementation of a personalized safe driving system for the elderly.

Although such heterogeneity should be reflected in differential recruitment of neural mechanisms during ToM reasoning, no research has yet uncovered a mechanism that explains these individual differences. In this study, 78 (48 with ASD) adolescents viewed ToM vignettes and made mental-state inferences about characters' behavior while participant electrophysiology was concurrently recorded. Two candidate event-related-potentials (ERPs)-the late positive complex (LPC) and the late slow wave (LSW)-were successfully elicited. LPC scores correlated positively with ToM accuracy and negatively with ASD symptom severity. Note that the LPC partially mediated the relationship between ASD symptoms and ToM accuracy, which suggests that this ERP component, thought to represent cognitive metarepresentation, may help explain differences in ToM performance in some individuals with ASD.

To show different color lipsticks affect face perception processing, we used EEG to observe these event-related potential components in 19 participants exposed to visual stimuli under four conditions: red lips, yellow lips, blue lips, and no-makeup. The results indicate a significantly higher attractiveness score for red lips than the other three conditions and a significantly shorter P1 peak latency for red lips than blue lips or no-makeup. This may reflect that red lips attract attention more than blue or natural lips in the early stages of face processing. The results indicate that the peak of early posterior negativity for red lips occurred significantly longer than for yellow lips, blue lips, or no-makeup. Early posterior negativity amplitudes were significantly larger to red lips than blue lips or no-makeup. These results may indicate that, at later stages of face processing, the high attractiveness of red lips is associated with slower and careful processing. In contrast, blue lips, which have a low attractiveness score, are processed speedily and carelessly. These present results suggest a novel possibility that P1 and early posterior negativity can be used as a biomarker for temporal face perception processing of facial attractiveness in the human brain.

FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography; mismatch negativity; predictive coding; auditory processing; multivariate decoding		Mismatch negativity (MMN) is the electroencephalographic (EEG) waveform obtained by subtracting event-related potential (ERP) responses evoked by unexpected deviant stimuli from responses evoked by expected standard stimuli. While the MMN is thought to reflect an unexpected change in an ongoing, predictable stimulus, it is unknown whether MMN responses evoked by changes in different stimulus features have different magnitudes, latencies, and topographies. The present study aimed to investigate whether MMN responses differ depending on whether sudden stimulus change occur in pitch, duration, location or vowel identity, respectively. To calculate ERPs to standard and deviant stimuli, EEG signals were recorded in normal-hearing participants (N = 20; 13 males, 7 females) who listened to roving oddball sequences of artificial syllables. In the roving paradigm, any given stimulus is repeated several times to form a standard, and then suddenly replaced with a deviant stimulus which differs from the standard. Here, deviants differed from preceding standards along one of four features (pitch, duration, vowel or interaural level difference). The feature levels were individually chosen to match behavioral discrimination performance. We identified neural activity evoked by unexpected violations along all four acoustic dimensions. Evoked responses to deviant stimuli increased in amplitude relative to the responses to standard stimuli. A univariate (channel-by-channel) analysis yielded no significant differences between MMN responses following violations of different features. However, in a multivariate analysis (pooling information from multiple EEG channels), acoustic features could be decoded from the topography of mismatch responses, although at later latencies than those typical for MMN. These results support the notion that deviant feature detection may be subserved by a different process than general mismatch detection.

We measured EEG signals from 205 native Japanese speakers, who varied widely in English proficiency while they listened to natural speech in English. Following the EEG measurement, they completed a conventional English listening test for Japanese speakers. We estimated multivariate temporal response functions separately for word class, speech rate, word position, and parts of speech. We found significant negative correlations between listening score and 17 EEG features, which included peak latency of early components (corresponding to N1 and P2) for both open and closed class words and peak latency and amplitude of a late component (corresponding to N400) for open class words. On the basis of the EEG features, we generated a predictive model for Japanese speakers' English listening proficiency. The correlation coefficient between the true and predicted listening scores was 0.51. Our results suggest that L2 or foreign language ability can be assessed using neural signatures measured while listening to natural speech, without the need of a conventional paper test.

J	Daly, I				Daly, Ian			Neural component analysis: A spatial filter for electroencephalogram analysis	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Source localisation; EEG; Blind source separation; Source modelling	EEG; BRAIN; ARTIFACTS; P3A; CONDUCTIVITY; ALGORITHMS; SEPARATION; MOVEMENT; REMOVAL	Background: Spatial filtering and source separation are valuable tools in the analysis of EEG data. However, despite the well-known spatial localisation of individual cognitive processes within the brain, the available methods for source separation, such as the widely used blind source separation technique, do not take into account the spatial distributions and locations of sources. This can result in sub-optimal source identification. New method: We present a new method for deriving a spatial filter for EEG data that attempts to identify sources that are maximally spatially distinct from one another in terms of the spatial distributions of their projections. Results: We first evaluate our method with simulated EEG and show that it is able to separate EEG signals into components with distinct spatial distributions that closely resemble the original simulated sources. We also evaluate our method with real EEG and show it is able to identify a spatial filter that can be used to significantly improve classification accuracy of the P300 event-related potential (ERP). Comparison with existing methods: We compare our method to a state of the art blind source separation methods, fast independent component analysis (ICA) and common spatial patterns (CSP). We evaluate the methods suitability for a common source separation application, analysis of ERPs. Conclusions: Our results show that our method is well suited to identifying spatial filters for EEG analysis. This has potential applications in a wide range of EEG signal processing applications.

This study in 14 healthy volunteers examined the effects of a subanesthetic dose of the NMDAR antagonist ketamine on P300 and their relationship to psychomimetic symptoms and cortical source activity (with eLORETA). Ketamine reduced early (e-P3a) and late (l-P3a) novelty P300 at sensor (scalp)-level and at source-level in the salience network. Increases in dissociation symptoms were negatively correlated with ketamine-induced P3b changes, at sensor-level and source-level, in both salience and central executive networks. These P3a alterations during novelty processing, and the symptom-related P3b changes during target processing support a model of NMDAR hypofunction underlying disrupted auditory attention in schizophrenia.

Parallel studies reported a similar interference also for the EEG microstate at rest and in the period that anticipates a task. Here we investigated whether such interference was prolonged during the evoked activity in the framework of the semantic decision task. To this aim, rTMS was delivered over a core region of both the Default mode network and the language network (i.e., left angular gyrus, AG), previously associated to the current task, and as active control we stimulated the left IPS. When subjects received a non-active stimulation (i.e., Sham), in the period that follows the target onset (i.e., 2 sec after the rTMS) we found an interesting alternation of two dominant microstates (MS1, MS3), previously associated to the phonological network and the Cingulo-Opercular Network (CON), respectively. This dynamic was not altered when TMS was delivered over the left IPS. On the contrary, rTMS over left AG selectively suppressed the phonological-related microstate. These findings provide the first causal evidence of region specificity of the EEG microstates topography during the evoked activity corroborating the idea of a crucial role of AG in the semantic memory. Moreover, the present results might provide insight for understanding the neurophysiological correlates of language disorders e.g., aphasia as well as for planning non-invasive brain stimulation protocols for the rehabilitation.

However, most EEG measures previously used are either a univariate measure or a single type of brain connectivity, which may not fully capture the abnormal brain changes of SZ patients. In this paper, event-related potentials were collected from 45 SZ patients and 30 healthy controls (HCs) during a learning task, and then a combination of partial directed coherence (PDC) effective and phase lag index (PLI) functional connectivity were used as features to train a support vector machine classifier with leave-one-out cross-validation for classification of SZ from HCs. Our results indicated that an excellent classification performance (accuracy = 95.16%, specificity = 94.44%, and sensitivity = 96.15%) was obtained when the combination of functional and effective connectivity features was used, and the corresponding optimal feature number was 15, which included 12 PDC and three PLI connectivity features. The selected effective connectivity features were mainly located between the frontal/temporal/central and visual/parietal lobes, and the selected functional connectivity features were mainly located between the frontal/temporal and visual cortexes of the right hemisphere. In addition, most of the selected effective connectivity abnormally enhanced in SZ patients compared with HCs, whereas all the selected functional connectivity features decreased in SZ patients. The above results showed that our proposed method has great potential to become a tool for the auxiliary diagnosis of SZ.

In neuroscience for example, co-registration complements and overcomes some of the shortcomings of individual methods. However, precise synchronization of the different data streams involved is required before joint data analysis. Our article presents and evaluates a synchronization method which maximizes the alignment of information across time. Synchronization through common triggers is widely used in all existing methods, because it is very simple and effective. However, this solution has been found to fail in certain practical situations, namely for the spurious detection of triggers and/or when the timestamps of triggers sampled by each acquisition device are not jointly distributed linearly for the entire duration of an experiment. We propose two additional mechanisms, the "Longest Common Subsequence" algorithm and a piecewise linear regression, in order to overcome the limitations of the classical method of synchronizing common triggers. The proposed synchronization method was evaluated using both real and artificial data. Co-registrations of electroencephalographic signals (EEG) and eye movements were used for real data. We compared the effectiveness of our method to another open source method implemented using EYE-EEG toolbox. Overall, we show that our method, implemented in C++ as a DOS application, is very fast, robust and fully automatic.

They were asked to read social scenarios composed of positive or negative behaviors of others whose intentions are ambiguous followed by a disambiguation of others' real intentions (hostile vs non-hostile) behind their behaviors. Neural activity related to spontaneous intent attribution processes was measured using electroencephalography (EEG). The results showed that when non-hostile intentions were revealed following ambiguous-negative behaviors of others, the N400 effect was observed only in the TH group. Similarly, when hostile intentions were revealed following ambiguous-positive behaviors of others, the N400 effect was observed only in the TNH group. In other words, non-aggressive individuals were led to attribute either hostile or non-hostile intentions to the same ambiguous behaviors of others depending on which concepts or thoughts (hostile vs non hostile) were activated and accessible in memory by priming at the time of social interactions.

Since conversation requires constant monitoring, updating and selecting information, auditory working memory decline, rather than impoverished hearing acuity, has been suggested a core factor. However, in stark contrast to the visual domain, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying auditory working memory deficits in healthy aging remain poorly understood, especially those related to on-the-fly information processing under increasing load. Therefore, we investigated the behavioral costs and electrophysiological differences associated with healthy aging and working memory load during continuous auditory processing. We recorded EEG activity from 27 younger (-25 years) and 29 older (-70 years) participants during their performance on an auditory version of the n-back task with speech syllables and 2 workload levels ( 1-back; 2-back ). Behavioral measures were analyzed as indices of function; event-related potentials as proxies for sensory and cognitive processes; and theta oscillatory power as a reflection of memory and central executive function. Our results show age-related differences in auditory information processing within a latency range that is consistent with a series of impaired functions, from sensory gating to cognitive resource allocation during constant information updating, especially under high load.

We compared the automatic processing of threat and self-relevant stimuli using the no-report oddball paradigm. Participants looked at images on a computer screen that displayed fighting with opponents or interacting with friends or customers. The body action of the person depicted was performed either toward the viewing participant or toward other people. Participants watched without making an explicit response, and event-related potentials were measured with electroencephalography. We found that threat (vs. self-relevant) information elicited a larger P300 amplitude, and for nonthreatening events the P300 amplitude was larger for self-relevant than other-relevant stimuli. These results indicate that threat (vs. self-relevant) information demands more cognitive resources, possibly because people prioritize survival.

Specifically, participants were assigned into a high-power or low-power condition. Then, they were asked to detect a deviant angry expression from a high-power or low-power target among a series of neutral expressions, while behavioral responses and electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded. The behavioral results showed that high-power individuals responded faster to detect angry expressions than low-power individuals. The ERP analysis showed that high-power individuals showed larger P3 amplitudes in response to angry expressions than low-power individuals did. Target power increased the amplitudes of the P1, VPP, N3, and P3 in response to angry expressions did, but decreased the amplitudes of the N1 and N170 in response to angry expressions. The present study extended previous studies by showing that having more power could enhance individuals' neural responses to angry expressions in the late-stage processes, and individuals could show stronger neural responses to angry expressions from high-power persons in both the early- and late-stage processes.

Eighty typically developing children between the ages of 8 and 11 years completed a declarative learning task while their EEG was recorded. The study evaluated the predictive value of the FRN on learning retention as measured by accuracy on a follow-up test a day after the session. The FRN elicited by positive feedback was found to be predictive of learning retention in children. The relationship between the FRN and learning was moderated by age. The P3a was also found to be associated with learning, such that larger P3a to negative feedback was associated with better learning retention in children.

Spectral features of cortical auditory evoked potentials inform hearing threshold and intensity percepts in acoustic and electric hearing	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; classification; cortical auditory responses; frequency domain; event-related spectral perturbation; inter-trial coherence	EEG; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; CAEPS	Objective. Stimulus-elicited changes in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings can be represented using Fourier magnitude and phase features (Makeig et al (2004 Trends Cogn. Sci. 8 204-10)). The present study aimed to quantify how much information about hearing responses are contained in the magnitude, quantified by event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs); and the phase, quantified by inter-trial coherence (ITC). By testing if one feature contained more information and whether this information was mutually exclusive to the features, we aimed to relate specific EEG magnitude and phase features to hearing perception. Approach. EEG responses were recorded from 20 adults who were presented with acoustic stimuli, and 20 adult cochlear implant users with electrical stimuli. Both groups were presented with short, 50 ms stimuli at varying intensity levels relative to their hearing thresholds. Extracted ERSP and ITC features were inputs for a linear discriminant analysis classifier (Wong et al (2016 J. Neural. Eng. 13 036003)). The classifier then predicted whether the EEG signal contained information about the sound stimuli based on the input features. Classifier decoding accuracy was quantified with the mutual information measure (Cottaris and Elfar (2009 J. Neural. Eng. 6 026007), Hawellek et al (2016 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. 113 13492-7)), and compared across the two feature sets, and to when both feature sets were combined. Main results. We found that classifiers using either ITC or ERSP feature sets were both able to decode hearing perception, but ITC-feature classifiers were able to decode responses to a lower but still audible stimulation intensity, making ITC more useful than ERSP for hearing threshold estimation. We also found that combining the information from both feature sets did not improve decoding significantly, implying that ERSP brain dynamics has a limited contribution to the EEG response, possibly due to the stimuli used in this study. Significance. We successfully related hearing perception to an EEG measure, which does not require behavioral feedback from the listener; an objective measure is important in both neuroscience research and clinical audiology.

It plays a protective role in survival and exerts a vital impact on successful social interaction. Sleep loss, however, is commonplace in current society, and people are increasingly plagued by it. Previous studies have investigated whether sleep loss affects empathy for pain, yet the results were undecided. We aimed to determine whether this effect is existed and further explore the temporal and frequency dynamics of neural activities involved in this effect by recording the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We recruited 25 healthy adults (11 females) who were required to perform a pain judgement and unpleasantness rating about the presented nociceptive and neutral pictures after nocturnal sleep (NS) and sleep deprivation (SD), and their neuronal activities were recorded by event-related potentials (ERPs). Results showed a significantly decreased amplitude in the early components (N2, N340) of vicarious pain processing after SD. In further timefrequency (TF) analysis, a reduced energy occurred in theta2 (5-7 Hz) band under SD condition. Moreover, the decreased theta2 was positively correlated with the subjective ratings of both other's pain and selfunpleasantness only under SD condition. Our results indicated that SD impairs affective sharing of empathy for pain.

While it is unknown if these neural processes are affected in clinical populations, it is unclear if the avatar task can be applied to this group, due to the long duration and sensitivity to data loss. Thus, we performed a methodological study of the avatar task, testing the feasibility of a shortened experimental paradigm. Objective: To investigate whether previously reported behavioural and ERP effects in the avatar task can also be seen if analysing all trials (matching/non-matching) jointly, and whether they remain robust if only a subset of the data is analysed. Method: Healthy individuals (n = 20) completed the avatar task with ERP measurement. ERP components (P3, LFSW) and behavioural data were investigated by A) comparing use of only matching trials (n = 384) versus all trials (n = 768), and B) examining if reduced duration of assessment, by analysing only a subset of the data, impacts ERP findings. Results: We observed minimal differences when analysing data from only matching trial types compared to all trial types. Further, ERP amplitudes and latency findings were replicated when analysing only a subset of the data. Conclusions: The duration of the avatar task can be reduced to avoid long testing times, thus making it better suited for use in clinical populations.

Our understanding of this has advanced substantially with the development of multivariate decoding analyses. However, conventional electroencephalography (EEG) decoding predominantly uses the mean neural activation within the analysis window to extract category information. Such temporal averaging overlooks the within-trial neural variability that is suggested to provide an additional channel for the encoding of information about the complexity and uncertainty of the sensory input. The richness of temporal variabilities, however, has not been systematically compared with the conventional mean activity. Here we compare the information content of 31 variability-sensitive features against the mean of activity, using three independent highly varied data sets. In whole-trial decoding, the classical event-related potential (ERP) components of P2a and P2b provided information comparable to those provided by original magnitude data (OMD) and wavelet coefficients (WC), the two most informative variability-sensitive features. In time-resolved decoding, the OMD and WC outperformed all the other features (including the mean), which were sensitive to limited and specific aspects of temporal variabilities, such as their phase or frequency. The information was more pronounced in the theta frequency band, previously suggested to support feedforward visual processing. We concluded that the brain might encode the information in multiple aspects of neural variabilities simultaneously such as phase, amplitude, and frequency rather than mean per se. In our active categorization data set, we found that more effective decoding of the neural codes corresponds to better prediction of behavioral performance. Therefore, the incorporation of temporal variabilities in time-resolved decoding can provide additional category information and improved prediction of behavior.

In comparison to neuroimaging modalities such as MRI or PET, EEG is relatively cheap, non-invasive, portable, and simple to administer, making it an attractive tool for clinical deployment. Despite this, studies utilizing EEG to investigate obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are relatively sparse. This contrasts with a robust literature using other brain imaging methodologies. The present review examines studies that have used EEG to examine predictors and correlates of response in OCD and draws tentative conclusions that may guide much needed future work. Key findings include a limited literature base; few studies have attempted to predict clinical change from EEG signals, and they are confounded by the effects of both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. The most robust literature, consisting of several studies, has examined event-related potentials, including the P300, which several studies have reported to be abnormal at baseline in OCD and to normalize with treatment; but even here the literature is quite heterogeneous, and more work is needed. With more robust research, we suggest that the relatively low cost and convenience of EEG, especially in comparison to fMRI and PET, make it well-suited to the development of feasible personalized treatment algorithms.

To enable an intuitive motor imagery (MI) paradigm of "left," "right," "push," and "pull," a driving simulator based EEG data recording and automatic labeling platform is built for dataset making. In the preprocessing stage, a wavelet and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) combined method is used for artifact removal and improving signal-to-noise ratio. An ensemble learning based training and testing framework is proposed for MI EEG data classification. The average classification accuracy of proposed framework is about 91.75%. This approach essentially takes advantage of the common spatial pattern (CSP) with ability of extracting the feature of event-related potentials and the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with powerful capacity of feature learning and classification. To convert the classification results of EEG data segments into motion control signals of ground vehicle, shared control strategy is used to realize the control command of "left-steering," "right-steering," "acceleration," and "stop" considering collision avoidance with obstacles detected by a single-line LIDAR. The online experimental results on a model vehicle platform validate the significant performance of the established BCI system and reveal the application potential of BCI on the vehicle control and automation.

Experimental sleep restriction increases latency jitter in pain elicited cortical responses	HELIYON			English	Article						Sleep; Pain; Jitter; Event related potential; EEG; Cortical response	SINGLE; DEPRIVATION; POTENTIALS; INSOMNIA; SAMPLE; CORTEX; FIBER; ERPS	Objective: Previous studies have shown increased pain scores to painful stimulation after experimental sleep restriction, but reduced or unchanged magnitude of the event related potentials (ERPs) when averaged in the time-domain. However, some studies found increased response magnitude when averaging in the time-frequency domain. The aim of this study was to determine whether ERP-latency jitter may contribute to this discrepancy. Methods: Ninety painful electrical stimuli were given to 21 volunteers after two nights of 50% sleep restriction and after two nights of habitual sleep. ERPs were analyzed in the time-domain (N2-and P2-peaks) and time-frequency domain (power spectral density). We quantified latency jitter by the mean consecutive difference (MCD) between single-trial peak latencies and by phase locking value (PLV) across trials. Results: P2-MCD increased from 20.4 +/- 2.1 ms after habitual sleep to 24.3 +/- 2.2 ms after sleep restriction (19%, p = 0.038) and PLV decreased from 0.582 +/- 0.015 after habitual sleep to 0.536 +/- 0.015 after sleep restriction (7.9%, p = 0.009). We found no difference for N2-MCD. Conclusions: Our results indicate that partial sleep restriction increase latency jitter in cortical responses to experimental pain. Significance: Latency jitter may contribute to the discrepancies between ERP-responses in the time-frequency domain and time-domain. Latency jitter should be considered when ERPs are analyzed.

We examined the modulating influence of gender congruency and cognate status using a syntactic violation paradigm. Behavioural results demonstrated that participants were more sensitive to similarities at the syntactic level (gender congruency) than to phonological and orthographic overlap (cognate status). Electrophysiological data showed that they were sensitive to syntactic violations (P600 effect) already in early acquisition stages. However, P600 effect sizes were not modulated by gender congruency or cognate status. Therefore, our late learners of Spanish did not seem to be susceptible to influences from inherent noun properties when processing non-native noun phrases at the neural level. Our results contribute to the discussion about the neural correlates of grammatical gender processing and sensitivity to syntactic violations in early acquisition stages.

To experimentally explore the susceptibility to distraction, the Attention Modulation by Salience Task (AMST) is a validated paradigm measuring reaction times (RT) for processing auditory information while presenting task-irrelevant visual distractors of high or low salience. We extended the AMST by an emotional dimension of distractors and an EEG-based evaluation. We then investigated the effect of the stress-relieving medication Neurexan (Nx4) on the participants' susceptibility to distraction.Methods: Data from a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial (NEURIM study; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02602275) were exploratively reanalyzed post-hoc. In this trial, 39 participants received a single dose of placebo or Nx4 immediately before the AMST. Participants had to discriminate two different tone modulations (ascending or descending) while simultaneously perceiving task-irrelevant pictures of different salience (high or low) or valence (negative or positive) as distractors. Using EEG recordings, RT and the event-related potential (ERP) components N1, N2, and N3 were analyzed as markers for susceptibility to distraction.Results: In the placebo condition, we could replicate the previously reported task effects of salient distractors with longer RT for high salient distractors on the behavioral level. On the electrophysiological level, we observed significantly increased amplitudes of the N2 and N3 ERP components for positive emotional pictures. In terms of drug effect, we found evidence that Nx4 reduced distractibility by emotional distractors. The effect was shown by significantly reduced amplitudes of N2 and N3 ERP components and reduced RT for the positive valence domain under Nx4 compared to placebo. The Nx4 effects on RT and ERP components also showed a significant correlation.Conclusion: Emotional distractors in addition to the previously used salience distractors and the EEG based evaluation of ERPs valuably complement the AMST. Salient distractors were affecting attentional processes earlier, while valent distractors show modulatory effects later. Our results suggest that Nx4 has beneficial effects on attention by inhibiting the effect of task-irrelevant information and reducing susceptibility to emotionally distracting stimuli. The observation of a beneficial impact of Nx4 on attention regulation is supportive of Nx4's claim as a stress-relieving medication.

Detection of mind wandering using EEG: Within and across individuals	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DYNAMICS; DISRUPTS; ERROR; MODEL	Mind wandering is often characterized by attention oriented away from an external task towards our internal, self-generated thoughts. This universal phenomenon has been linked to numerous disruptive functional outcomes, including performance errors and negative affect. Despite its prevalence and impact, studies to date have yet to identify robust behavioral signatures, making unobtrusive, yet reliable detection of mind wandering a difficult but important task for future applications. Here we examined whether electrophysiological measures can be used in machine learning models to accurately predict mind wandering states. We recorded scalp EEG from participants as they performed an auditory target detection task and self-reported whether they were on task or mind wandering. We successfully classified attention states both within (person-dependent) and across (person-independent) individuals using event-related potential (ERP) measures. Non-linear and linear machine learning models detected mind wandering above-chance within subjects: support vector machine (AUC = 0.715) and logistic regression (AUC = 0.635). Importantly, these models also generalized across subjects: support vector machine (AUC = 0.613) and logistic regression (AUC = 0.609), suggesting we can reliably predict a given individual's attention state based on ERP patterns observed in the group. This study is the first to demonstrate that machine learning models can generalize to "never-seen-before" individuals using electrophysiological measures, highlighting their potential for real-time prediction of covert attention states.

Memory-Related Frontal Brainwaves Predict Transition to Mild Cognitive Impairment in Healthy Older Individuals Five Years Before Diagnosis	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE			English	Article						Amnestic mild cognitive impairment; cognitive ERP; delayed match-to-sample; dementia risk; EEG; memory-related potentials; working memory	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; NEURAL MECHANISMS; AMYLOID-BETA; BIOMARKERS; ASSOCIATION; EEG	Background: Early prognosis of high-risk older adults for amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), using noninvasive and sensitive neuromarkers, is key for early prevention of Alzheimer's disease. We have developed individualized measures in electrophysiological brain signals during working memory that distinguish patients with aMCI from age-matched cognitively intact older individuals. Objective: Here we test longitudinally the prognosis of the baseline neuromarkers for aMCI risk. We hypothesized that the older individuals diagnosed with incident aMCI already have aMCI-like brain signatures years before diagnosis. Methods: Electroencephalogram (EEG) and memory performance were recorded during a working memory task at baseline. The individualized baseline neuromarkers, annual cognitive status, and longitudinal changes in memory recall scores up to 10 years were analyzed. Results: Seven of the 19 cognitively normal older adults were diagnosed with incident aMCI for a median 5.2 years later. The seven converters' frontal brainwaves were statistically identical to those patients with diagnosed aMCI (n = 14) at baseline. Importantly, the converters' baseline memory-related brainwaves (reduced mean frontal responses to memory targets) were significantly different from those who remained normal. Furthermore, differentiation pattern of left frontal memory-related responses (targets versus nontargets) was associated with an increased risk hazard of aMCI (HR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.03, 2.08). Conclusion: The memory-related neuromarkers detect MCI-like brain signatures about five years before diagnosis. The individualized frontal neuromarkers index increased MCI risk at baseline. These noninvasive neuromarkers during our Bluegrass memory task have great potential to be used repeatedly for individualized prognosis of MCI risk and progression before clinical diagnosis.

Age-related changes in event related potentials, steady state responses and temporal processing in the auditory cortex of mice with severe or mild hearing loss	HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article						Aging; Presbycusis; Auditory cortex; Temporal processing; Gap processing; Central gain; Neural oscillations	FREQUENCY-MODULATED SWEEPS; GAP DETECTION THRESHOLDS; MOUSE MODEL; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; YOUNG; BRAIN; NOISE; SELECTIVITY; INHIBITION; NEURONS	Age-related changes in auditory processing affect the quality of life of older adults with and without hearing loss. To distinguish between the effects of sensorineural hearing loss and aging on cortical processing, the main goal of the present study was to compare cortical responses using the same stimulus paradigms and recording conditions in two strains of mice (C57BL/6J and FVB) that differ in the degree of age-related hearing loss. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were obtained from freely moving young and old mice using epidural screw electrodes. We measured event related potentials (ERP) and 40 Hz auditory steady-state responses (ASSR). We used a novel stimulus, termed the gap-ASSR stimulus, which elicits an ASSR by rapidly presenting short gaps in continuous noise. By varying the gap widths and modulation depths, we probed the limits of temporal processing in young and old mice. Temporal fidelity of ASSR and gap-ASSR responses were measured as phase consistency across trials (inter-trial phase clustering; ITPC). The old C57 mice, which show severe hearing loss, produced larger ERP amplitudes compared to young mice. Despite robust ERPs, the old C57 mice showed significantly diminished ITPC in the ASSR and gap-ASSR responses, even with 100% modulation depth. The FVB mice, which show mild hearing loss with age, generated similar ERP amplitudes and ASSR ITPC across the age groups tested. However, the old FVB mice showed decreased gap-ASSR responses compared to young mice, particularly for modulation depths < 100%. The C57 mice data suggest that severe presbycusis leads to increased gain in the auditory cortex, but with reduced temporal fidelity. The FVB mice data suggest that with mild hearing loss, age-related changes in temporal processing become apparent only when tested with more challenging sounds (shorter gaps and shallower modulation).

In the proposed method, three channels Pz, Cz, and Fz of brain signals were recorded from 40 participants in the four modes of closed eyes, open eyes, recall, and stimulation. After preprocessing, wide various features of EEG signals were extracted. Results have shown that after stimulation, the amplitude and the latency of the P300 component change with increasing age and the stages of Alzheimer's disease. In addition, the first changes in brain signal in mild Alzheimer's patients are increased activity in the theta band and decreased activity in the beta band, which is associated with a decrease in alpha-band activity. After selecting the proper features, linear discriminant analysis, and Elman and convolutional neural networks were used to classify the participants' features. The results showed that the Pz channel among three EEG signals and the stimulation mode among the four recording steps had greater accuracy than the others. By using features of the Pz channel, the accuracy of LDA was 59.4% and 66.4% in the recall and excitation modes, accuracy of Elman neural network was 92.3% and 94.1%, and CNN was 97.5% and 99% respectively. Results have shown that extracting appropriate linear and nonlinear features has increased the accuracy of the classifiers. In addition, due to the dynamic nature of the brain signal, the convolutional neural network had better performance than LDA and Elman.

Waves of Change: Brain Sensitivity to Differential, not Absolute, Stimulus Intensity is Conserved Across Humans and Rats	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						electrocorticography (ECoG); electroencephalography (EEG); behavioral relevance; multispecies investigation; saliency-detection		Living in rapidly changing environments has shaped the mammalian brain toward high sensitivity to abrupt and intense sensory events-often signaling threats or affordances requiring swift reactions. Unsurprisingly, such events elicit a widespread electrocortical response (the vertex potential, VP), likely related to the preparation of appropriate behavioral reactions. Although the VP magnitude is largely determined by stimulus intensity, the relative contribution of the differential and absolute components of intensity remains unknown. Here, we dissociated the effects of these two components. We systematically varied the size of abrupt intensity increases embedded within continuous stimulation at different absolute intensities, while recording brain activity in humans (with scalp electroencephalography) and rats (with epidural electrocorticography). We obtained three main results. 1) VP magnitude largely depends on differential, and not absolute, stimulus intensity. This result held true, 2) for both auditory and somatosensory stimuli, indicating that sensitivity to differential intensity is supramodal, and 3) in both humans and rats, suggesting that sensitivity to abrupt intensity differentials is phylogenetically well-conserved. Altogether, the current results show that these large electrocortical responses are most sensitive to the detection of sensory changes that more likely signal the sudden appearance of novel objects or events in the environment.

J	Bayet, L; Saville, A; Balas, B				Bayet, Laurie; Saville, Alyson; Balas, Benjamin			Sensitivity to face animacy and inversion in childhood: Evidence from EEG data	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Animacy; Face recognition; ERPs; Experience; Children; MVPA	OWN-RACE BIAS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; ERP EVIDENCE; AGE BIAS; PERCEPTION; ACCOUNT; N170; IDENTIFICATION; REPRESENTATION; COMPONENTS	Adults exhibit relative behavioral difficulties in processing inanimate, artificial faces compared to real human faces, with implications for using artificial faces in research and designing artificial social agents. However, the developmental trajectory of inanimate face perception is unknown. To address this gap, we used electroencephalography to investigate inanimate faces processing in cross-sectional groups of 5-10-year-old children and adults. A face inversion manipulation was used to test whether face animacy processing relies on expert face processing strategies. Groups of 5-7-year-olds (N = 18), 8-10-year-olds (N = 18), and adults (N = 16) watched pictures of real or doll faces presented in an upright or inverted orientation. Analyses of event-related potentials revealed larger N170 amplitudes in response to doll faces, irrespective of age group or face orientation. Thus, the N170 is sensitive to face animacy by 5-7 years of age, but such sensitivity may not reflect high-level, expert face processing. Multivariate pattern analyses of the EEG signal additionally assessed whether animacy information could be reliably extracted during face processing. Face orientation, but not face animacy, could be reliably decoded from occipitotemporal channels in children and adults. Face animacy could be decoded from whole scalp channels in adults, but not children. Together, these results suggest that 5-10-year-old children exhibit some sensitivity to face animacy over occipitotemporal regions that is comparable to adults.

Replicability of neural responses to speech accent is driven by study design and analytical parameters	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article								Recent studies have reported evidence that listeners' brains process meaning differently in speech with an in-group as compared to an out-group accent. However, among studies that have used electroencephalography (EEG) to examine neural correlates of semantic processing of speech in different accents, the details of findings are often in conflict, potentially reflecting critical variations in experimental design and/or data analysis parameters. To determine which of these factors might be driving inconsistencies in results across studies, we systematically investigate how analysis parameter sets from several of these studies impact results obtained from our own EEG data set. Data were collected from forty-nine monolingual North American English listeners in an event-related potential (ERP) paradigm as they listened to semantically congruent and incongruent sentences spoken in an American accent and an Indian accent. Several key effects of in-group as compared to out-group accent were robust across the range of parameters found in the literature, including more negative scalp-wide responses to incongruence in the N400 range, more positive posterior responses to congruence in the N400 range, and more positive posterior responses to incongruence in the P600 range. These findings, however, are not fully consistent with the reported observations of the studies whose parameters we used, indicating variation in experimental design may be at play. Other reported effects only emerged under a subset of the analytical parameters tested, suggesting that analytical parameters also drive differences. We hope this spurs discussion of analytical parameters and investigation of the contributions of individual study design variables in this growing field.	[Strauber, C.

J	Li, J; Xu, N; Zhong, YP				Li, Jin; Xu, Nian; Zhong, Yiping			Monetary payoffs modulate reciprocity expectations in outcome evaluations: An event-related potential study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Chicken game; event-related potential (ERP); feedback-related negativity (FRN); P3; reciprocity expectation	FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; PRISONERS-DILEMMA; DECISION-MAKING; SOCIAL DISTANCE; REWARD PREDICTION; P300; COOPERATION; POSITIVITY; CONTEXT; FRN	Choosing cooperation or aggression relies on reciprocity preferences which refer to the tendency of an individual to return cooperative or aggressive action for cooperative or aggressive action (i.e., positive or negative reciprocity preference). The reciprocity preference is positively correlated with reciprocity expectation, wherein individuals with stronger reciprocity preferences may have higher expectations than future cooperative or aggressive behavior should be delivered by beneficiaries (positive reciprocity expectation) or victims (negative reciprocity expectation). Although previous studies have demonstrated that the presence of monetary payoffs enhances reciprocity preferences, the modulation of monetary payoffs in reciprocity expectations remains unclear. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we examined how monetary payoffs modulated reciprocity expectations by adopting the Chicken game. Participants were asked to choose between cooperation and aggression with a putative opponent in the Chicken game involving the monetary (vs. non-monetary) payoffs. Participants' electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded when they saw the opponent's cooperative or aggressive decision. Results showed that compared to the non-monetary payoff trials, the feedback-related negativity (FRN) effect in response to the opponent's decisions was stronger following the participant's aggressive decision in the monetary payoff trials, whereas P3 was insensitive to monetary payoffs. These findings suggest that monetary payoffs heighten expectations of negative reciprocity at the earlier and automatic outcome processing stage.

J	Kuhlen, AK; Rahman, RA				Kuhlen, Anna K.; Rahman, Rasha Abdel			Joint Language Production: An Electrophysiological Investigation of Simulated Lexical Access on Behalf of a Task Partner	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-LEARNING MEMORY AND COGNITION			English	Article						electrophysiology; language production; picture naming; semantic interference; social interaction	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SEMANTIC INTERFERENCE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; WORD PRODUCTION; ERP; N400; SIMILARITY; ARTIFACTS; COMPONENT; DIALOGUE	This study investigates in a joint action setting a well-established effect in speech production, cumulative semantic interference, an increase in naming latencies when naming a series of semantically related pictures. In a joint action setting, two task partners take turns naming pictures. Previous work in this setting has demonstrated that naming latencies increase not only with each semantically related picture speakers named themselves, but also with each picture named by the partner (Hoedemaker et al., 2017; Kuhlen & Abdel Rahman, 2017). This suggests that speakers pursue lexical access on behalf of their partner. In 2 electrophysiological experiments (N = 30 each) we investigated the neuro-cognitive signatures of such simulated lexical access. As expected, in both experiments speakers' naming latency increased with successive naming instances within a given semantic category. Correspondingly, speakers' electroencephalographic recordings (EEG) showed an increasing posterior positivity between 250-400 ms, an event-related potential (ERP) modulation typically associated with lexical access. However, unlike previous experiments, speakers were not influenced by their partner's picture naming. Accordingly, we found no electrophysiological evidence of lexical access. To reconcile these findings we pooled behavioral data from five experiments (N = 144). Within this large sample we find empirical evidence for partner-elicited interference. Furthermore, our data suggest that speakers may be less affected by their partner's naming response in settings with remotely located task partners (as in present experiments). We conclude that speakers do not always represent their partner's naming response and that our experimental setting may have limited the participants' evaluation of the task as a joint action.

Evaluating users' preference for the appearance of humanoid robots via event-related potentials and spectral perturbations	BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Users' preference; humanoid robot appearance; neural dynamics; ERP; ERSP		Even though humanoid robots are being applied to diverse areas, the formation of users' preference for the appearance of humanoid robots remains unknown. The present study investigated users' neural dynamics underlying preference formation to evaluate users' preference for the appearance of humanoid robots. EEG signals were recorded in a preference categorisation task, and neural dynamics were analysed via event-related potentials and time-frequency analysis. The results showed that in the early stage, the preferred humanoid robot appearances elicited enhanced parieto-occipital N1, frontal P2, and early central and parieto-occipital theta rhythm power than the non-preferred appearances. In the later stage, the preferred humanoid robot appearances elicited enhanced scalp-distributed LPP and later central and parieto-occipital theta power than the non-preferred appearances. The results suggested that the formation of users' preference for the appearance of humanoid robots has a distinctive dual-stage of neural dynamics. The study provides designers with an objective method in evaluating users' preference for the appearance of humanoid robots.

We present RoLDSIS (regression on low-dimension spanned input space), a regression technique based on dimensionality reduction that constrains the solution to the subspace spanned by the available observations. This avoids regularization parameters in the regression procedure, as needed in shrinkage regression methods. Results We applied RoLDSIS to the EEG data collected in a phonemic identification experiment. In the experiment, morphed syllables in the continuum /da/-/ta/ were presented as acoustic stimuli to the participants and the event-related potentials (ERP) were recorded and then represented as a set of features in the time-frequency domain via the discrete wavelet transform. Each set of stimuli was chosen from a preliminary identification task executed by the participant. Physical and psychophysical attributes were associated to each stimulus. RoLDSIS was then used to infer the neurophysiological axes, in the feature space, associated with each attribute. We show that these axes can be reliably estimated and that their separation is correlated with the individual strength of phonemic categorization. The results provided by RoLDSIS are interpretable in the time-frequency domain and may be used to infer the neurophysiological correlates of phonemic categorization. A comparison with commonly used regularized regression techniques was carried out by cross-validation. Conclusion The prediction errors obtained by RoLDSIS are comparable to those obtained with Ridge Regression and smaller than those obtained with LASSO and SPLS. However, RoLDSIS achieves this without the need for cross-validation, a procedure that requires the extraction of a large amount of observations from the data and, consequently, a decreased signal-to-noise ratio when averaging trials. We show that, even though RoLDSIS is a simple technique, it is suitable for the processing and interpretation of neurophysiological signals.

In contrast to many previous studies, our sample comprises children, adolescents, and adults. We analyzed data from 447 ADHD patients and 227 healthy controls. By applying multivariate linear regression analyses, we controlled the group differences between ADHD patients and controls for age and sex. As dependent variables we used behavioral (number of omission and commission errors, reaction time, and reaction time variability) and neurophysiological measures (event-related potentials [ERPs]). In summary, we successfully replicated the deviations of ADHD subjects from healthy controls. The differences are small to moderate when expressed as effect size measures (number of omission errors: d = 0.60, reaction time variability: d = 0.56, contingent negative variation (CNV) and P3 amplitudes: -0.35 < d < -0.47, ERP latencies: 0.21 < d < 0.29). Further analyses revealed no substantial differences between ADHD subtypes (combined, inattentive, and hyperactive/impulsive presentation), subgroups according to high- and low-symptomatic burden or methylphenidate intake for their daily routine. We successfully replicated known differences between ADHD subjects and controls for the behavioral and neurophysiological variables. However, the small-to-moderate effect sizes limit their utility as biomarkers in the diagnostic procedure. The incongruence of self-reported symptomatic burden and clinical diagnosis emphasizes the challenges of the present clinical diagnosis with low reliability, which partially accounts for the low degree of discrimination between ADHD subjects and controls.

This study aimed to investigate which regions were involved during emergency braking, measuring the interactions and strength of the connections and describing coupling among these brain regions by dynamic causal modeling (DCM) parameters that we extracted from event-related potential signals, which were then estimated based on emergency braking data with visual stimulation. The data were reanalyzed from a simulator study, which was designed to create emergency situations for participants during a simple driving task. The experimental protocol includes driving a virtual reality car, and the subjects were exposed to emergency situations in a simulator system, while electroencephalogram, electro-oculogram, and electromyogram signals were recorded. In this research, locations of active brain regions in montreal neurological institute coordinates from event-related responses were identified using multiple sparse priors method, in which sensor space was allocated to resource space. Source localization results revealed nine active regions. After applying DCM on data, a proposed model during emergency braking for all people was obtained. The braking response time was defined based on the first noticeable (above noise-level) braking pedal deflection after an induced braking maneuver. The result revealed a significant difference in response time between subjects who have the lateral connection between visual cortex, visual processing, and detecting objects areas have shorter response time (p-value = 0.05) than the subjects who do not have such connections.

In this commentary, we assemble a group of established investigators and trainees to review key advances and anticipated developments in neuroscience research across five modalities most commonly employed in autism research: magnetic resonance imaging, functional near infrared spectroscopy, positron emission tomography, electroencephalography, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Broadly, neuroscience research has provided important insights into brain systems involved in autism but not yet mechanistic understanding. Methodological advancements are expected to proffer deeper understanding of neural circuitry associated with function and dysfunction during the next 40 years.

We found no differences in early or N400 ERP components between problems, suggesting that tie problems are not encoded faster or suffer from less interference than non-tie problems. However, a lesser negative amplitude of the N2 component was found for tie than non-tie problems. This suggests more working-memory and attentional resource requirements for non-tie problems and therefore more frequent use of retrieval for tie than non-tie problems. The possible peculiarity of problems involving a 1 was also investigated. We showed less negative N2 amplitudes for these problems than for other non-tie problems, suggesting less working-memory resources for 1-problems than other non-tie problems. This could be explained either by higher reliance on memory retrieval for 1-problems than non-1 problems or by the application of non-arithmetical rules for 1-problems.

This review focuses on the most relevant topics on brain-controlled vehicles, with a special reference to the terrestrial BCV (e.g., the mobile car, car simulator, real car, graphical and gaming car) and the aerial BCV, also called BCAV (e.g., real quadcopters, drones, fixed wings, graphical helicopter, and aircraft) controlled by using bio-signals, such as electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrooculogram (EOG), and Electromyogram (EMG). For instance, EEG-based algorithms detect patterns from the motor imaginary cortex area of the brain for intention detection, patterns like event-related desynchronization/event-related synchronization, steady-state visually evoked potentials, P300, and generated local evoked potential patterns. We have identified that the reported best-performing approaches employ machine learning and artificial intelligence optimization methods, namely support vector machine, neural network, linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbor, k-means, water drop optimization, and chaotic tug of war. We considered the following metrics to analyze the efficiency of the different methods: type and combination of bio-signals, time response, and accuracy values with statistical analysis. The present work provides an extensive literature review of the key findings of the past ten years, indicating future perspectives in the field.

AD causes significant disability due to the devastating impact on the patients' day-to-day living activities and their loss of independence. One such day-to-day activity is driving, a complex task that requires attention, concentration, the ability to follow particular steps, react to stimuli promptly, and the ability to perceive and interpret visual-spatial information, all of which can be impaired in AD. Therefore, to ensure the safety of AD patients and other drivers, it is important to develop accurate and low-cost diagnostic tools to assess patients' fitness-to-drive. In this study, we develop machine learning (ML) models to predict fitness-to-drive using the electroencephalogram (EEG) technique of event-related potential (ERP). Specifically, we develop random forest (RF) models using EEG signals in early-stage AD patients and age-matched controls and conduct numerical experiments to predict fitness-to-drive and other driving performance metrics, collected from driving simulator data. Our results show that RF models predict patients' fitness-to-drive with AUC=0.83 and provide accurate measures of other driving performance metrics. Therefore, ML and ERP offer a valuable approach to assess driving safety for patients with early AD symptoms in the laboratory setting.

J	Hamilton, A; Northoff, G				Hamilton, Arthur; Northoff, Georg			Abnormal ERPs and Brain Dynamics Mediate Basic Self Disturbance in Schizophrenia: A Review of EEG and MEG Studies	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						schizophrenia; sense of self; basic self; self disturbance; electroencephalography; event-related potentials; magnetoencepalography		Background: Interest in disordered sense of self in schizophrenia has recently re-emerged in the literature. It has been proposed that there is a basic self disturbance, underlying the diagnostic symptoms of schizophrenia, in which the person's sense of being a bounded individual continuous through time loses stability. This disturbance has been documented phenomenologically and at the level of cognitive tasks. However, the neural correlates of basic self disorder in schizophrenia are poorly understood. Methods: A search of PubMed was used to identify studies on self and schizophrenia that reported EEG or MEG data. Results: Thirty-three studies were identified, 32 using EEG and one using MEG. Their operationalizations of the self were divided into six paradigms: self-monitoring for errors, proprioception, self-other integration, self-referential processing, aberrant salience, and source monitoring. Participants with schizophrenia were less accurate on self-referential processing tasks and had slower response times across most studies. Event-related potential amplitudes differed across many early and late components, with reduced N100 suppression in source monitoring paradigms being the most replicated finding. Several studies found differences in one or more frequency band, but no coherent overall finding emerged in this area. Various other measures of brain dynamics also showed differences in single studies. Only some of the study designs were adequate to establish a causal relationship between the self and EEG or MEG measures. Conclusion: The broad range of changes suggests a global self disturbance at the neuronal level, possibly carried over from the resting state. Further studies that successfully isolate self-related effects are warranted to better understand the temporal-dynamic and spatial-topographic basis of self disorder and its relationship to basic self disturbance on the phenomenological level.

Two ERP effects of code-switching in naturalistic discourse	COGNITION			English	Article						Bilingualism; EEG; ERP; Form-based prediction; N400; LPC; Discourse	MASS UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ANTERIOR NEGATIVITY LAN; BRAIN POTENTIALS; SENTENCE CONTEXT; TIME-COURSE; SEMANTIC INTEGRATION; LEXICAL ACCESS; UPCOMING WORDS; MORPHOSYNTACTIC AGREEMENT	Bilingual speakers often switch between languages in conversation without any advance notice. Psycholinguistic research has found that these language shifts (or code-switches) can be costly for comprehenders in certain situations. The present study explores the nature of these costs by comparing code-switches to other types of unexpected linguistic material. To do this, we used a novel EEG paradigm, the Storytime task, in which we record readings of natural texts, and then experimentally manipulate their properties by splicing in words. In this study, we manipulated the language of our target words (English, Spanish) and their fit with the preceding context (strong-fit, weak-fit). If code-switching incurs a unique cost beyond that incurred by an unexpected word, then we should see an additive pattern in our ERP indices. If an effect is driven by lexical expectation alone, then there should be a non-additive interaction such that all unexpected forms incur a similar cost. We found three effects: a general prediction effect (a non-additive N400), a post-lexical recognition of the switch in languages (an LPC for code-switched words), and a prolonged integration difficulty associated with weak-fitting words regardless of language (a sustained negativity). We interpret these findings as suggesting that the processing difficulties experienced by bilinguals can largely be understood within more general frameworks for understanding language comprehension. Our findings are consistent with the broader literature demonstrating that bilinguals do not have two wholly separate language systems but rather a single language system capable of using two coding systems.

These defects negatively affect their social interactions. However, the cause of these defects is not clear. This study sought to explore whether MDD patients develop facial perceptual processing disorders with characteristics of brain functional connectivity (FC).Methods: Event-related potential (ERP) was used to explore differences between 20 MDD patients and 20 healthy participants with face and non-face recognition tasks based on 64 EEG parameters. After pre-processing of EEG data and source reconstruction using the minimum-norm estimate (MNE), data were converted to AAL90 template to obtain a time series of 90 brain regions. EEG power spectra were determined using Fieldtrip incorporating a Fast Fourier transform. FC was determined for all pairs of brain signals for theta band using debiased estimate of weighted phase-lag index (wPLI) in Fieldtrip. To explore group differences in wPLI, independent t-tests were performed with p < 0.05 to indicate statistical significance. False discovery rate (FDR) correction was used to adjust p-values.Results: The findings showed that amplitude induction by face pictures was higher compared with that of non-face pictures both in MDD and healthy control (HC) groups. Face recognition amplitude in MDD group was lower compared with that in the HC group. Two time periods with significant differences were then selected for further analysis. Analysis showed that FC was stronger in the MDD group compared with that in the HC group in most brain regions in both periods. However, only one FC between two brain regions in HC group was stronger compared with that in the MDD group.Conclusion: Dysfunction in brain FC among MDD patients is a relatively complex phenomenon, exhibiting stronger and multiple connectivity with several brain regions of emotions. The findings of the current study indicate that the brain FC of MDD patients is more complex and less efficient in the initial stage of face recognition.

To what extent digital media directly modulate children's perception and attention is largely unknown. We investigated the processing of task-irrelevant auditory information while 37 children aged 6;8-9;1-years played the identical card game on a tablet PC or with the experimenter in reality. The sound sequence included repeated standard sounds and occasionally novel sounds. Event-related potentials in the EEG, that reflect sound-related processes of perception and attention, were measured. Sounds evoked increased amplitudes of the ERP components P1, P2 and P3a during the interaction with the tablet PC compared to the human interaction. This indicates enhanced early processing of task-irrelevant information and increased allocation of attention to sounds throughout the interaction with a tablet PC compared to a human partner. Results suggest direct effects of typical situations, where children interact with a tablet PC, on neuronal mechanisms that drive perception and attention in the developing brain. More research into this phenomena is required to make specific suggestions for developing digital interactive learning programs.

However, relatively little is known regarding how these processes may be influenced by common naturalistic behaviors such as engaging in physical activity, which is thought to modulate the availability of neurometabolic resources. Here, we used an event-related potential (ERP) approach to determine whether various intensities of aerobic exercise might affect the concurrent performance of attentional control mechanisms. Participants performed an additional-singleton visual search task across three levels of aerobic activity while seated on a stationary bicycle: at rest, during moderate-intensity exercise, and during vigorous-intensity exercise. In addition to behavioral measures, attentional processing was assessed via lateralized ERPs referencing target selection (PCN) and distractor suppression (P-D) mechanisms. Whereas engaging in exercise resulted in speeded response times overall, moderate-intensity exercise was found to uniquely eliminate the expression of distractor interference by the PCN while also giving rise to an unanticipated distractor-elicited Ppc. These findings demonstrate workload-specific and object-selective influences of aerobic exercise on attentional processing, providing insights not only for approaching attention in real-world contexts but also for understanding how attentional resources are used overall.

In the present study, we used an implicit olfactory priming paradigm to test the influence of non-attentively perceived food odors on the cerebral activity underlying the processing of food pictures, in normal-weight, overweight, and obese adults. A pear odor and a pound cake odor were used as primes, respectively priming sweet low-energy-density foods and high-energydensity foods. Event-related potentials were recorded while the participants passively watched pictures of sweet low and high-energy-density foods, under the two priming conditions plus an odorless control condition. The amplitude and latency of several peaks were measured (P100, N100, P200, N400). As a major result, we found that weight status influences the cerebral activity underlying the processing of food cues outside of consciousness, as early as the first detectable P100 peak. ? 2021 IBRO.

It has originally been thought to be involved in early, structural processing steps, but currently more and more studies challenge this view and propose that it also takes part in higher level face processing, such as identification and recognition. Here we tested whether the OFA is involved in the initial steps of recognition memory and plays a causal role in the differential processing of familiar and unfamiliar faces. We used an offline, inhibitory continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) protocol over the right OFA and the vertex as control site. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recording of event-related potentials (ERPs), elicited by visually presented familiar (famous) and unfamiliar faces was performed before and after stimulation. We observed a difference in ERPs for famous and unfamiliar faces in a time-window corresponding to the N250 component. Importantly, this difference was significantly increased by cTBS of the right OFA, suggesting its causal role in the differential processing of familiar and unfamiliar faces. The enhancement occurred focally, at electrodes close to the right hemispheric cTBS site, as well as over similar occipitotemporal sites of the contralateral hemisphere. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing the causal role of the rOFA in the differential processing of familiar and unfamiliar faces, using combined cTBS and EEG recording methods. These results are discussed with respect to the nature of familiar face representations, supported by an extensive, bilateral network. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recently, a specific green oat formulation (Neuravena(R)) showed to have significant bioactive compounds potentially associated with the enhancement of processing speed, working memory and attention. The main aim of the current study was to compare the potential effect of acute administration of 800 mg of Neuravena(R) with placebo on a set of neurophysiological correlates of processing speed, attention, performance-monitoring and inhibitory control. Twenty healthy participants were randomized to receive either Neuravena(R) or placebo. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signal acquisition was obtained while participants carried out the modified Eriksen flanker and oddball tasks. Both groups were compared on measures of behavioral task performance, and a set of event-related potentials (ERPs) components related to performance monitoring (the error-related negativity; ERN and the N2), target detection, and attention (P3a/P3b). Following active-intervention N2, ERN, and P3a/P3b were significantly reduced and performance was faster, with no loss of accuracy. Conversely, no neurophysiological differences were found in the placebo group before and after treatment and performance worsened significantly in terms of reaction time and accuracy. Acute administration of 800 mg of Neuravena(R) appears to enhance the optimization of neural resources and positively influences cognitive performance in tasks associated with executive functions, processing speed and attention. Moreover, Neuravena(R) prevents the deleterious effects of tiredness during task performance.</p>	[Martinez-Horta, Saul; Kulisevsky, Jaime] Hosp Santa Creu & Sant Pau, Neurol Dept, Movement Disorders Unit, Barcelona, Spain; [Martinez-Horta, Saul; Kulisevsky, Jaime] Biomed Res Inst IIB St Pau, Barcelona, Spain; [Martinez-Horta, Saul; Kulisevsky, Jaime] Ctr Invest Red Enfermedades Neurodegenerat CIBERN, Madrid, Spain; [Ivanir, Eran] Frutarom Ltd, Migdal Haemeq, Israel; [Perrinjaquet-Moccetti, Tania; Keuter, Matthias Heinrich] Frutarom Switzerland Ltd, Wadenswil, Switzerland		Martinez-Horta, S (corresponding author), Hosp Santa Creu & Sant Pau, Neurol Dept, Movement Disorders Unit, Barcelona, Spain.; Martinez-Horta, S (corresponding author), Biomed Res Inst IIB St Pau, Barcelona, Spain.; Martinez-Horta, S (corresponding author), Ctr Invest Red Enfermedades Neurodegenerat CIBERN, Madrid, Spain.; Perrinjaquet-Moccetti, T (corresponding author), Frutarom Switzerland Ltd, Wadenswil, Switzerland.	smartinezho@santpau.cat; TPerrinjaquet-Moccetti@frutarom.com		Martinez-Horta, Saul/0000-0003-0125-7249	Frutarom Ltd.; Frutarom Switzerland Ltd.

Several electrophysiological studies showed that neural activity associated with the prospective and the retrospective component differed between older and younger adults. However, these studies mainly reported event-related potentials (ERP), without considering other oscillatory parameters of age-related neural modulations that might be associated with the two components. Objective: In the present study, we analysed electrophysiological data to describe the age-related patterns of brain oscillations associated with the prospective and the retrospective components of prospective memory. Methods: The prospective and the retrospective components were manipulated in two experiments. In experiment 1, the prospective component was manipulated by varying the cue distinctiveness (i.e., how easy it was to detect the cue based on colour). In experiment 2, the retrospective component was manipulated by varying the number of intentions to be remembered (i.e., one or two intentions). We used time-frequency analysis to characterise the EEG oscillatory activity in younger and older adults. Results: The prospective component was associated with age differences in alpha and beta frequency bands. Compared to younger adults, older adults showed a decrease of parietal alpha activity when they detected distinct prospective memory cues, and a decrease of parietal beta when they detected less distinct cues. Moreover, older adults showed less beta activity compared to the younger adults across experimental manipulations. No age differences emerged with respect to the retrospective component. Conclusions: The specific pattern of oscillatory activity associated with the prospective component in older adults could underlie the dynamic deployment of different attentional resources supporting cue detection. Moreover, beta activity in both experiments might support an attempt exerted by older adults to enhance task coordination processes. Overall, cluster-based permutation analyses provided a first description of the changes of the EEG time-frequency responses related to intention retrieval in older adults.

Scalp recordings of electrical brain activity time-locked to sensory events (event-related potentials; ERPs) provide precise information on the time-course of related altered neural activity, and can be used to model the cortical loci of the underlying neural networks. Establishing the test-retest reliability of these sensory brain responses in ASD is critical to their use as biomarkers of neural dysfunction in this population. Methods: EEG and behavioral data were acquired from 33 children diagnosed with ASD aged 6-9.4 years old, while they performed a child-friendly task at two different time-points, separated by an average of 5.2 months. In two blocked conditions, participants responded to the occurrence of an auditory target that was either preceded or not by repeating visual stimuli. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to assess test-retest reliability of measures of sensory (auditory and visual) ERPs and performance, for the two experimental conditions. To assess the degree of reliability of the variability of responses within individuals, this analysis was performed on the variance of the measurements, in addition to their means. This yielded a total of 24 measures for which ICCs were calculated. Results: The data yielded significant good ICC values for 10 of the 24 measurements. These spanned across behavioral and ERPs data, experimental conditions, and mean as well as variance measures. Measures of the visual evoked responses accounted for a disproportionately large number of the significant ICCs; follow-up analyses suggested that the contribution of a greater number of trials to the visual compared to the auditory ERP partially accounted for this. Conclusions: This analysis reveals that sensory ERPs and related behavior can be highly reliable across multiple measurement time-points in ASD. The data further suggest that the inter-trial and inter-participant variability reported in the ASD literature likely represents replicable individual participant neural processing differences. The stability of these neuronal readouts supports their use as biomarkers in clinical and translational studies on ASD. Given the minimum interval between test/retest sessions across our cohort, we also conclude that for the tested age-range of similar to 6 to 9.4 years, these reliability measures are valid for at least a 3-month interval. Limitations related to EEG task demands and study length in the context of a clinical trial are considered.

Temporal Dynamics of Event-Related Potentials during Inhibitory Control Characterize Age-Related Neural Compensation	SYMMETRY-BASEL			English	Article						inhibitory control; executive function; event-related potentials; electroencephalography; N200; P300; cognitive aging; neural recruitment	PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; OLDER-ADULTS; ERP COMPONENTS; BRAIN ACTIVATIONS; COGNITIVE DECLINE; CONFLICT; P300; GO; ANTERIORIZATION	Aging is accompanied by frontal lobe and non-dominant hemisphere recruitment that supports executive functioning, such as inhibitory control, which is crucial to all cognitive functions. However, the spatio-temporal sequence of processing underlying successful inhibition and how it changes with age is understudied. Thus, we capitalized on the temporal precision of event-related potentials (ERPs) to assess the functional lateralization of N200 (conflict monitoring) and P300 (inhibitory performance evaluation) in young and healthy older adults during comparably performed successful stop-signal inhibition. We additionally used temporal principal components analysis (PCA) to further interrogate the continuous spatio-temporal dynamics underlying N200 and P300 activation for each group. Young adults demonstrated left hemisphere-dominant N200, while older adults demonstrated overall larger amplitudes and right hemisphere dominance. N200 activation was explained by a single PCA factor in both age groups, but with a more anterior scalp distribution in older adults. The P300 amplitudes were larger in the right hemisphere in young, but bilateral in old, with old larger than young in the left hemisphere. P300 was also explained by a single factor in young adults but by two factors in older adults, including distinct parieto-occipital and anterior activation. These findings highlight the differential functional asymmetries of conflict monitoring (N200) and inhibitory evaluation and adaptation (P300) processes and further illuminate unique age-related spatio-temporal recruitment patterns. Older adults demonstrated lateralized recruitment during conflict processing and bilateral recruitment during evaluation and adaptation, with anterior recruitment common to both processes. These fine-grained analyses are critically important for more precise understanding of age-related compensatory activation.

However, it remains unclear how aspects of context in dynamic social interactions, such as observed nonverbal behaviors, may modulate cooperation decisions and the associated neural mechanisms. In this study, participants responded to offers from proposers to split $10 in an Ultimatum Game following observation of proposer approach (friendly) or avoidance (nonfriendly) behaviors, displayed by dynamic whole-body animated avatars, or following a nonsocial interaction control condition. As expected, behavioral results showed that participants tended to have greater acceptance rates for unfair offers following observed nonverbal social interactions with proposers compared with control, suggesting an enhancing effect of social interactions on cooperative decisions. ERP results showed greater N1 and N2 responses at the beginning of social interaction conditions compared with control, and greater sustained and late positivity responses for observed approach and avoidance proposer behaviors compared with control. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) results showed differential sensitivity within theta, alpha, and beta bands during observation of social interactions and offers that was associated with subsequent decision behaviors. Together, these results point to the impact of proposers' nonverbal behaviors on subsequent cooperation decisions at both behavioral and neural levels. The ERP and ERSP findings suggest modulated attention, monitoring, and processing of biological motion during the observed nonverbal social interactions, influencing the participants' responses to offers. These findings shed light on electrophysiological correlates of response to observed social interactions that predict subsequent social decisions.

A multidisciplinary expert panel reviewed the clinical literature and reached consensus about the EEG measures consistently found as abnormal in VCI patients with dementia. As compared to cognitively unimpaired individuals, those VCI patients showed (1) smaller amplitude of resting state alpha (8-12 Hz) rhythms dominant in posterior regions; (2) widespread increases in amplitude of delta (< 4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) rhythms; and (3) delayed N20 0/P30 0 peak latencies in averaged event-related potentials, especially during the detection of auditory rare target stimuli requiring participants' responses in "oddball" paradigms. The expert panel formulated the following recommendations: (1) the above EEG measures are not specific for VCI and should not be used for its diagnosis; (2) they may be considered as "neural synchronization" biomarkers to enlighten the relationships between features of the VCI-related cerebrovascular lesions and abnormalities in neurophysiological brain mechanisms; and (3) they may be tested in future clinical trials as prognostic biomarkers and endpoints of interventions aimed at normalizing background brain excitability and vigilance in wakefulness.

Neural Processing of Repeated Emotional Scenes in Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder, and Bipolar Disorder	SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN			English	Article						electroencephalography; psychosis spectrum; affective processing	INTERMEDIATE PHENOTYPES; WORKING-MEMORY; REGULATION ABNORMALITIES; BRAIN POTENTIALS; STRATEGIES FAIL; NETWORK; PSYCHOSIS; REPETITION; ATTENTION; ANHEDONIA	Impaired emotional processing and cognitive functioning are common in schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorders, causing significant socioemotional disability. While a large body of research demonstrates abnormal cognition/emotion interactions in these disorders, previous studies investigating abnormalities in the emotional scene response using event-related potentials (ERPs) have yielded mixed findings, and few studies compare findings across psychiatric diagnoses. The current study investigates the effects of emotion and repetition on ERPs in a large, well-characterized sample of participants with schizophrenia-bipolar syndromes. Two ERP components that are modulated by emotional content and scene repetition, the early posterior negativity (EPN) and late positive potential (LPP), were recorded in healthy controls and participants with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder with psychosis, and bipolar disorder without psychosis. Effects of emotion and repetition were compared across groups. Results displayed significant but small effects in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, with diminished EPN amplitudes to neutral and novel scenes, reduced LPP amplitudes to emotional scenes, and attenuated effects of scene repetition. Despite significant findings, small effect sizes indicate that emotional scene processing is predominantly intact in these disorders. Multivariate analyses indicate that these mild ERP abnormalities are related to cognition. psychosocial functioning, and psychosis severity. This relationship suggests that impaired copition, rather than diagnosis or mood disturbance, may underlie disrupted neural scene processing in schizophrenia-bipolar syndromes.

It is useful for the PSS provider to know the PSS value creation mechanism when customers are buying and utilizing a PSS, particularly in the service-dominant logic (SDL) and cognitive neuroscience perspective. This study solved the PSS implementation that satisfied the demands of both customers and manufacturers and the value cocreation mechanism during product and service configuration with the impacts of consumer learning and the service experience. The proposed neuroscience methodology is based on an ERP (event-related potential) experiment using PSS stimuli, representing the perception value creation process during customer decision making and the PSS configuration process. The effectiveness of the service experience is more important than customer knowledge during PSS value perception due to positive emotions with pleasant memories for the service experience and the conflicting cognition process of customer learning. The combination of service science and neurology may measure and observe human behavior and psychology through the brain science method and effectively solve the human factors in service science. The findings suggest a more objective and personalized understanding of PSS value perception, particularly the practical requirements of a resulted-oriented PSS and an application-oriented PSS.

However, it remains unclear whether and how the interaction between the two processes is altered in individuals with MCI. We collected electroencephalography (EEG) data from 30 older adults with MCI and 30 demographically matched healthy controls (HCs) when they were performing a perceptual decision-making task, in which we manipulated the cognitive load involved in task-relevant top-down processing and the surprise level involved in task-irrelevant bottom-up processing. We found the significant group difference in the interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes. HCs showed enlarged P3 and strengthened event-related microstate C on high (vs. low) surprise level trials under high cognitive load, while there was no such surprise effect suggesting distraction under low cognitive load. In contrast, participants with MCI showed increased P2 and P3 amplitudes and strengthened microstates C and D on high (vs. low) surprise level trials under low cognitive load yet no surprise effect under high load. These results suggested that participants with MCI were distracted by task-irrelevant information under low cognitive load, while under high load, they might experience a passive inhibition on the task-irrelevant bottom-up processing because of the exhaustion of attentional resources; in addition, this altered interaction observed in the MCI group occurred at the stages of selective attention and uncertainty reduction.

Recurve archers use a mechanical device called the "clicker" to check the draw length. The fall of the clicker that generates an auditory stimulus should evoke a response in the brain. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the event-related potentials during archery shooting as a response to the fall of the clicker. Fifteen high-level archers participated. An electro cap was placed on the archers' scalps, and continuous EEG activity was recorded (digitized at 1000 Hz) and stored for off-line analysis. The EEG data were epoched beginning 200 ms before and lasting 800 ms after stimulus marker signals. An operational definition has been developed for classifying hits corresponding to hit and/or miss areas. The hit area enlarged gradually starting from the centre of the target (yellow: 10) to blue (6 score) by creating ten hit area indexes. It is found that the snap of the clicker during archery shooting evokes N1-P2 components of long-latency evoked brain potentials. N1 amplitudes are significantly higher in hit area than that of miss areas for the 2nd and 4th indexes with 95% confidence intervals and 90% confidence intervals for the 1st and 3rd indexes with 90% confidence intervals. We conclude that the fall of the clicker in archery shooting elicits an N1 response with higher amplitude. Although evoked potential amplitudes were higher in successful shots, their latencies were not significantly different from the unsuccessful ones.

Understanding the neurophysiological difference between "voluntary stopping" and "involuntary stopping" caused by FOG is vital for the detection of and potential intervention for FOG in the daily lives of patients. This study characterised the electroencephalographic (EEG) signature associated with FOG in contrast to voluntary stopping. The protocol consisted of a timed up-and-go (TUG) task and an additional TUG task with a voluntary stopping component, where participants reacted to verbal "stop" and "walk" instructions by voluntarily stopping or walking. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) analysis was performed to study the dynamics of the EEG spectra induced by different walking phases, including normal walking, voluntary stopping and episodes of involuntary stopping (FOG), as well as the transition windows between normal walking and voluntary stopping or FOG. These results demonstrate for the first time that the EEG signal during the transition from walking to voluntary stopping is distinguishable from that during the transition to involuntary stopping caused by FOG. The EEG signature of voluntary stopping exhibits a significantly decreased power spectrum compared with that of FOG episodes, with distinctly different patterns in the delta and low-beta power in the central area. These findings suggest the possibility of a practical EEG-based tool that can accurately predict FOG episodes, excluding the potential confounding of voluntary stopping.

Here, we examined temporal dynamics underlying the modulations of the aversive mood state on neural responses of anticipating and perceiving affective pictures. Participants were asked to perform an affective cueing paradigm in both threat and safe contexts. In the task, a cue (S1) signaled the subsequent presentation of positive/negative event (e.g., happy or fearful faces) as an affective target stimulus (S2), and participants were instructed to indicate their subjective feelings in response to the target stimuli while electroencephalography (EEG) was recording. Our findings revealed that threat context compared with the safe context attenuated the contingent negative variation (CNV) responses to the cues of positive expressions, and decreased differential late positive potential (LPP) responses to the perception of negative and positive events. These findings suggest that aversive mood dampens the anticipation of positive events and inhibits the elaboration of negative events. The current findings do not only advance our understanding on the temporal characteristics of affective anticipation and experience but also have implications on the emotional deficits across various mental disorders characterized by chronic mood disturbances.

Studies have shown that salient target stimuli, such as one's own name, reduce the magnitude of this effect. Given indications that self-related processing is altered in autism, it is an open question whether this attentional self-bias is reduced in autism. To investigate this, in the current study we utilised an Attentional Blink paradigm involving one's own and others' names, in a group of 24 autistic adults, and 22 neurotypical adults, while measuring EEG. In line with previous studies, the Attentional Blink was reduced when the participant's own name was the second target, with no differences between autistic and neurotypical participants. ERP results show that the effect on the Attentional Blink of one's own name was reflected in increased N2 and P3 amplitudes, for both autistic and nonautistic individuals. This is the first event-related potential study of own-name processing in the context of the Attentional Blink. The results provide evidence of an intact attentional self-bias in autism, both at the behavioural and neural level.

Brief Report: Preliminary Evidence of the N170 as a Biomarker of Response to Treatment in Autism Spectrum Disorder	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						autism spectrum disoder; electroencephalography; N170; biomarker; pivotal response treatment	DIAGNOSTIC INTERVIEW; BRAIN POTENTIALS; FACE PERCEPTION	Background: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by primary difficulties in social function. Individuals with ASD display slowed neural processing of faces, as indexed by the latency of the N170, a face-sensitive event-related potential. Currently, there are no objective biomarkers of ASD useful in clinical care or research. Efficacy of behavioral treatment is currently evaluated through subjective clinical impressions. To explore whether the N170 might have utility as an objective index of treatment response, we examined N170 before and after receipt of an empirically validated behavioral treatment in children with ASD. Method: Electroencephalography (EEG) data were obtained on a preliminary cohort of preschool-aged children with ASD before and after a 16-week course of PRT and in a subset of participants in waitlist control (16-weeks before the start of PRT) and follow-up (16-weeks after the end of PRT). EEG was recorded while participants viewed computer-generated faces with neutral and fearful affect. Results: Significant reductions in N170 latency to faces were observed following 16 weeks of PRT intervention. Change in N170 latency was not observed in the waitlist-control condition. Conclusions: This exploratory study offers suggestive evidence that N170 latency may index response to behavioral treatment. Future, more rigorous, studies in larger samples are indicated to evaluate whether the N170 may be useful as a biomarker of treatment response.

Phonological Underspecification: An Explanation for How a Rake Can Become Awake	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ERP; EEG; underspecification; MMN; ERSP; theta; gamma; phonology		Neural markers, such as the mismatch negativity (MMN), have been used to examine the phonological underspecification of English feature contrasts using the Featurally Underspecified Lexicon (FUL) model. However, neural indices have not been examined within the approximant phoneme class, even though there is evidence suggesting processing asymmetries between liquid (e.g., //) and glide (e.g., /w/) phonemes. The goal of this study was to determine whether glide phonemes elicit electrophysiological asymmetries related to [consonantal] underspecification when contrasted with liquid phonemes in adult English speakers. Specifically, /alpha/ is categorized as [+consonantal] while /walpha/ is not specified [i.e., (-consonantal)]. Following the FUL framework, if /w/ is less specified than //, the former phoneme should elicit a larger MMN response than the latter phoneme. Fifteen English-speaking adults were presented with two syllables, /alpha/ and /walpha/, in an event-related potential (ERP) oddball paradigm in which both syllables served as the standard and deviant stimulus in opposite stimulus sets. Three types of analyses were used: (1) traditional mean amplitude measurements; (2) cluster-based permutation analyses; and (3) event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) analyses. The less specified /walpha/ elicited a large MMN, while a much smaller MMN was elicited by the more specified /alpha/. In the standard and deviant ERP waveforms, /walpha/ elicited a significantly larger negative response than did /alpha/. Theta activity elicited by /alpha/ was significantly greater than that elicited by /walpha/ in the 100-300 ms time window. Also, low gamma activation was significantly lower for /alpha/ vs. /walpha/ deviants over the left hemisphere, as compared to the right, in the 100-150 ms window. These outcomes suggest that the [consonantal] feature follows the underspecification predictions of FUL previously tested with the place of articulation and voicing features. Thus, this study provides new evidence for phonological underspecification. Moreover, as neural oscillation patterns have not previously been discussed in the underspecification literature, the ERSP analyses identified potential new indices of phonological underspecification.

The objective of this experimental project is to develop, test, and validate a data-driven neuroscience approach to understand the built environment's impact on occupant cognitive function and mental health. The present study utilized virtual environments and electroencephalogram (EEG) and event-related potential (ERP) approaches, to provide objective neurophysiological information about how sustainable buildings (SBs) impact people's affective and cognitive functioning differently compared to conventional building (CBs). The long-term goal is to assess the validity of sustainable building design protocols in promoting and increasing mental health and well-being and the mechanism used to accomplish these increases. The findings showed test subjects demonstrated increased visual system engagement and modulated attentional focus and control processing in the SB compared to the CB environments. The findings can be explained by the cognitive load theory, which is consistent with the interpretation of greater focus on the present environment and reduced internal mental processing (cf. mindfulness), based on the observed increased theta/delta activities and greater engagement of visual systems and corresponding decreases in frontal activity in the SB environment. In addition, the combination of virtual environment (VE) and EEG/ERP has the potential to advance design methods by soliciting occupants' responses prior to completion of the projects. Building design is more than aesthetics; expanding the horizon for neuroscience would eventually result in a new knowledge base for building design, particularly sustainable building design, since the sustainability of the building often needs to be quantified.

Enhanced contralateral theta oscillations and N170 amplitudes in occipitotemporal scalp regions underlie attentional bias to fearful faces	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						ERP; Attentional bias; Fearful faces; Theta; N170	OPEN-SOURCE TOOLBOX; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; NEURAL MECHANISMS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; BASAL FOREBRAIN; HUMAN AMYGDALA; TIME-COURSE; THREAT; PERCEPTION; LOCATION	Attending toward fearful faces and other threatening stimuli increase the chance of survival. The dot-probe task is a commonly used measure of spatial attention. Event-related potentials (ERPs) have been found to be a reliable measure of attentional bias. The dot-probe literature suggests that posterior contralateral N170 amplitudes are more enhanced by fearful faces compared to ipsilateral amplitudes. However, ERP methods remove non-phase locked frequencies, which provides additional information about neural activity. Specifically, theta oscillations (5-7 Hz) have been linked to attentional processing. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between posterior contralateral theta oscillations and N170 amplitudes in the dot-probe task. A modified dot-probe task was used with fear and neutral facial expressions and EEG data was recorded from 33 electrodes. The ERP and time-frequency data were extracted from the P7 and P8 electrodes (left and right occipitotemporal regions). This study found enhanced N170 amplitude and theta oscillations in the electrodes posterior contralateral to the fearful face. Contralateral N170 amplitudes and theta oscillations were related such that greater N170 amplitudes were associated with greater theta oscillations. The results indicated that increased contralateral N170 and theta oscillations are related to each other and underlie attentional bias to fearful faces.

Temporal predictions have been formalized in terms of the hazard function, which integrates prior beliefs on the likely timing of stimulus occurrence with information conveyed by the passage of time. However, how the human brain updates prior temporal beliefs is still elusive. Here we investigated electroencephalographic (EEG) signatures associated with Bayes-optimal updating of temporal beliefs. Given that updating usually occurs in response to surprising events, we sought to disentangle EEG correlates of updating from those associated with surprise. Twenty-six participants performed a temporal foreperiod task, which comprised a subset of surprising events not eliciting updating. EEG data were analyzed through a regression-based massive approach in the electrode and source space. Distinct late positive, centro-parietally distributed, event-related potentials (ERPs) were associated with surprise and belief updating in the electrode space. While surprise modulated the commonly observed P3b, updating was associated with a later and more sustained P3b-like waveform deflection. Results from source analyses revealed that neural encoding of surprise comprises neural activity in the cingulo-opercular network (CON) and parietal regions. These data provide evidence that temporal predictions are computed in a Bayesian manner, and that this is reflected in P3 modulations, akin to other cognitive domains. Overall, our study revealed that analyzing P3 modulations provides an important window into the Bayesian brain.

Electrocortical Effects of Acetaminophen during Emotional Picture Viewing, Cognitive Control, and Negative Feedback	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Acetaminophen; Emotion; Cognitive control; Psychophysiology		Acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, may have psychological effects, such as reducing social and emotional pain. The current study (N = 173) used electroencephalography (EEG) to extend past research on acetaminophen. Healthy undergraduate students (64.7% women, age M = 18.15, SD = 3.33) were randomly assigned to ingest 1,000 mg of acetaminophen or placebo before completing emotional picture viewing (n = 143), a flanker task (n = 69), and a probabilistic learning task (n = 143) while EEG was recorded. (Sample sizes used for the analyses of each task differ from the total N due to data loss.) We observed standard event-related potentials (ERPs), including emotion-modulated late positive potentials during picture viewing and feedback-related negativity during feedback on the probabilistic learning task. We also observed standard error-related and conflict-related ERPs in the flanker task but could not adequately assess acetaminophen's effect on flanker ERPs due to excessive data loss. Acetaminophen did not alter any of the ERPs, in contrast to predictions based on prior research. Exploratory analyses revealed that acetaminophen reduced the relationship between trait behavioral inhibition system sensitivity and emotion-modulated late positive potentials. Together these findings suggest that a standard dose of acetaminophen did not reliably alter neural indicators of emotional or feedback processing. Instead, preliminary findings from our study suggested that a more nuanced relationship may exist between acetaminophen and individual differences in emotional processing, although this latter finding calls for further replication.

Electroencephalography was adopted when 35 healthy adult females performing the No Go Flanker task before and after the Trier Social Stress Test. Both inhibition processes evoked N2 and P3 components, but only the response inhibition evoked the late positive potential (LPP), indicating the response inhibition needed continuous cognitive effort to inhibit the prepotent response. The N2 and the P3 amplitudes were decreased, while the LPP amplitudes were increased under acute stress. These results suggested that acute stress caused the detrimental effect by occupying cognitive resources. Contrastingly, individuals actively regulated and made more efforts to counteract the detrimental effect of acute stress on response inhibition. Thus, acute stress impaired cognitive inhibition but did not affect response inhibition.

In the study, we proposed a supervised learning approach, called regularized discriminative spatial network pattern(RDSNP), to predict individual responses with a small size of training data set. It constructs discriminative brain networks by calculating the phase lock value of different decision-making responses with single-trial EEG data. Then the single-trial spatial network topology was applied to extract the RDSNP features. Finally, a linear discriminate analysis(LDA) classifier was built on RDSNP features and used to predict individual decisions trial-by-trial. To verify the performance of RDSNP, we compared this approach with such widely used baseline feature extraction methods as event related potentials, network properties, principal component analysis in EEG signals of 16 subjects, which was acquired during the experiments of ultimatum game, in terms of accuracy and F1-score suggests that our approach achieve a better performance on predicting single-trial decisions.

Previous studies have mainly researched these responses in the temporal domain; hence, non-phase-locked or induced neural activities may have been ignored. Event-related potential (ERP) and time-frequency (TF) information, combined with clinical and cognitive profiles, may provide an insight into the pathophysiology and psychopathology of the CHR stage. The 104 CHR individuals who completed cognitive assessments and ERP tests were recruited and followed up between 2016 and 2018. Individuals with CHR were classified by three clinical subtypes demonstrated before, specifically 32 from Cluster-1 (characterized by extensive negative symptoms and cognitive deficits, at the highest risk for conversion to psychosis), 34 from Cluster-2 (characterized by thought and behavioral disorganization, with moderate cognitive impairment), and 38 from Cluster-3 (characterized by the mildest symptoms and cognitive deficits). Electroencephalograms were recorded during the auditory oddball paradigm. The P300 ERPs were analyzed in the temporal domain. The event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) and inter-trial coherence (ITC) were acquired by TF analysis. A reduced P300 response to target tones was noted in Cluster-1 relative to the other two clusters. Moreover, the P300 amplitude of Cluster-1 was associated with speed of processing (SoP) scores. Furthermore, the P300 amplitude of Cluster-3 was significantly correlated with verbal and visual learning scores. In the TF analysis, decreased delta ERSP and ITC were observed in Cluster-1; delta ITC was associated with SoP scores in Cluster-3. The results indicate relatively disrupted oddball responses in a certain CHR subtype and a close affinity between these electrophysiological indexes and attention, working memory, and declarative memory within different CHR clusters. These findings suggest that the auditory oddball response is a potential neurophysiological marker for distinct clinical subtypes of CHR.

The results showed that, the exogenous components P1 (100 ms) and P2 (200 ms) were mainly produced in the frontal, temporal, apical, and occipital regions, while the endogenous component P3 (300 ms) was mainly produced in the front-top area, the front-central area, the central-top area, and the top-pillow area. Regarding P1, the information transmission speed was faster than contrasting colours with matching process. Regarding P2, external and internal factors and their interactions significantly affected amplitude, whereas only interactions affected latency, and the interaction was stronger with colour matching. Regarding P3, colour matching type, involved brain area, and interactions had no significant effect on amplitude and latency. The information processing of same colour system in brain has shorter information processing time and faster information transmission. That indicated the EEG technology could provide objective visual cognitive aesthetic rules for silk fabric colour matching, and provide reference value for fabric manufacturers to timely understand consumers' preference for fabric colour categories.

Our previous research using event-related potentials (ERPs) has revealed patterns of neural activity that distinguish ethical decision making from decisions that do not involve an ethical component. In the current study, we sought to gain insight into the locus of the effect of ethical decision making on the posterior N2 component of the ERPs. The ERP data revealed that the N2 was greater in amplitude for control trials relative to ethical violation trials, and time-frequency analyses revealed that this resulted from a reduction in phase-locked activity across trials rather than a decrease in EEG power. These findings may indicate that ethical decision making related to information security is associated with a greater inward focus of attention than is the case for decision making on control trials.

Neural processing of self-produced and externally generated events in 3-month-old infants	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Sense of agency; 3-month-old infants; EEG; Prediction; Sensory attenuation; Action-effect association	SUPPRESSION; 2-MONTH-OLD; MECHANISMS; SOUNDS; AGENCY	Did I make that sound? Differentiating whether sensory events are caused by us or the environment is pivotal for our sense of agency. Adults can predict the sensory effects of their actions, which results in attenuated processing of self-produced events compared with externally generated events. Yet, little is known about whether young infants predict and discriminate self-produced events from externally produced events. Using electroencephalography (EEG), 3-month-olds' neural response to the same audiovisual stimulus was compared between a Self-produced condition and externally generated conditions with predictable timing (External-Regular) and irregular timing (External-Irregular). We hypothesized that if 3-month-olds predict self-produced events, their event-related potentials should be smallest for the Self-produced condition, strongest for the External-Irregular condition, and in between for the External-Regular condition. Cluster-based permutation tests indicated a more positive deflection (300-470 ms) for irregular stimuli compared with regular stimuli over the vertex. Contrasting the Self-produced and External-Irregular conditions showed a statistical trend within the same time window. Although not fully conclusive, this might suggest the emerging differentiation between self-produced and less predictable external events. However, there was no statistical evidence that infants differentiated self-produced events from temporally predictable external events. Our findings shed light on the emerging sense of agency and suggest that 3-month-olds are transitioning toward predicting and discriminating the consequences of their actions. (c) 2020 The Authors.

Therefore, a real-time preprocessing, analyzing, and visualization routine was developed based on electroencephalographic (EEG) data measured during a primary study. To explore users' behavioral and neurophysiological reactions, error-tolerance as well as possibilities to improve feedback accuracy by the means of feedback-based event-related potentials (ERPs), we provided either legit or inappropriate sham feedback in a second study. The kind of feedback (legit or inappropriate) had only marginal influence on participants' subsequent performance. On a neuronal level, we did not observe differences in the ERPs evoked by the legit and inappropriate feedback. In qualitative interviews, participants evaluated the feedback as interesting but also sometimes irritating due to odd feedback trials. Our study emphasizes the importance of performance accuracy and transparency towards users regarding the underlying feedback computations.

For three weeks they stayed in the water filled tub without bodily support in supine position while isolated by waterproof material (this procedure is known as dry immersion - DI). During this period, they performed computer mouse pointing task and corresponding brain activity was evaluated by means of EEG: movement related and cognitive event-related potentials as well as resting state electroencephalogram were registered). Pointing task was performed before DI and at the time after initial period of adaptation - at the 5th and 17th days of DI. No deterioration of pointing task performance was found. Movement related potentials were not changed as well as cognitive peak P3, and only N1 peak significantly decreased at the 17th day of DI. Occipital alpha EEG also became significantly more pronounced at the 17th day of DI. Dry immersion procedure is thought to reproduce space flight physiological effects quite well, due to the DI specific feature - support withdrawal. Thus, results obtained indicate that support withdrawal also affects brain functioning in a specific way: increased alpha EEG is accompanied by altered visual processing (as indexed by diminished N1). Although these alterations are not sufficient to disrupt well learned mouse pointing task.

Suggested visual blockade during hypnosis: Top-down modulation of stimulus processing in a visual oddball task	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVOKED POTENTIALS; INTRACEREBRAL POTENTIALS; RARE TARGET; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; HYPNOTIC ANALGESIA; NEURAL MECHANISMS; BRAIN; P300; EEG; ATTENTION	Several theories of hypnosis assume that responses to hypnotic suggestions are implemented through top-down modulations via a frontoparietal network that is involved in monitoring and cognitive control. The current study addressed this issue re-analyzing previously published event-related-potentials (ERP) (N1, P2, and P3b amplitudes) and combined it with source reconstruction and connectivity analysis methods. ERP data were obtained from participants engaged in a visual oddball paradigm composed of target, standard, and distractor stimuli during a hypnosis (HYP) and a control (CON) condition. In both conditions, participants were asked to count the rare targets presented on a video screen. During HYP participants received suggestions that a wooden board in front of their eyes would obstruct their view of the screen. The results showed that participants' counting accuracy was significantly impaired during HYP compared to CON. ERP components in the N1 and P2 window revealed no amplitude differences between CON and HYP at sensor-level. In contrast, P3b amplitudes in response to target stimuli were significantly reduced during HYP compared to CON. Source analysis of the P3b amplitudes in response to targets indicated that HYP was associated with reduced source activities in occipital and parietal brain areas related to stimulus categorization and attention. We further explored how these brain sources interacted by computing time-frequency effective connectivity between electrodes that best represented frontal, parietal, and occipital sources. This analysis revealed reduced directed information flow from parietal attentional to frontal executive sources during processing of target stimuli. These results provide preliminary evidence that hypnotic suggestions of a visual blockade are associated with a disruption of the coupling within the frontoparietal network implicated in top-down control.

To be detected with event-related potentials (ERPs), it requires an optimal signal-to-noise ratio. To investigate the nature of visual N40, we recorded EEG/ERP signals from 20 participants. Each of them was presented with 1800 spatial frequency gratings of 0.75, 1.5, 3 and 6 c/deg. Data were collected from 128 sites while participants were engaged in both passive viewing and attention conditions. N40 (30-55 ms) was modulated by alertness and selective attention; in fact, it was larger to targets than irrelevant and passively viewed spatial frequency gratings. Its strongest intracranial sources were the bilateral thalamic nuclei of pulvinar, according to swLORETA. The active network included precuneus, insula and inferior parietal lobule. An N80 component (60-90 ms) was also identified, which was larger to targets than irrelevant/passive stimuli and more negative to high than low spatial frequencies. In contrast, N40 was not sensitive to spatial frequency per se, nor did it show a polarity inversion as a function of spatial frequency. Attention, alertness and spatial frequency effects were also found for the later components P1, N2 and P300. The attentional effects increased in magnitude over time. The data showed that ERPs can pick up the earliest synchronized activity, deriving in part from thalamic nuclei, before the visual information has actually reached the occipital cortex.

A comparison of stages of attention for social and nonsocial stimuli in schizophrenia: An ERP study	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Social motivation; Social attention; Event-related potentials; Sustained attention; CNV	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; CLINICAL-ASSESSMENT INTERVIEW; PSYCHIATRIC RATING-SCALE; OPEN-SOURCE TOOLBOX; SYMPTOMS; MOTIVATION; ALERTNESS; FACES; P300; TIME	Social motivation disturbances have been long observed in people with schizophrenia, yet the underlying components that drive these impairments remain unclear. Social attention is one component of social motivation and involves stages of attentional orienting, alerting/sustained attention, and executive control. It is not known at which stage the breakdown in social attention occurs in schizophrenia. The present study examined the allocation of social versus nonsocial attention at multiple stages of processing using event related potential (ERP) components. Electroencephalography from 36 outpatients with schizophrenia and 20 healthy participants was recorded during a dot probe task while viewing social/nonsocial stimuli that assessed: (1) orienting (indexed by the N1pc), (2) sustained attention (Contingent Negative Variation, [CNV]), and (3) executive control of attention during target evaluation (P300). Additionally, we analyzed correlations between the ERPs and participants' reaction times (RT) to the targets. Schizophrenia participants oriented their attention equally to social and nonsocial stimuli (N1pc), showed greater sustained attention to social than nonsocial stimuli (i.e., larger CNV), and exerted greater executive control on social trials (i.e., larger P300) than nonsocial trials, similarly to healthy participants. However, schizophrenia participants showed diminished overall sustained attention (blunted CNV) during the task, compared with healthy participants. Furthermore, greater sustained attention (larger CNV) and greater executive control (larger P300) were associated with improved behavioral performance (faster RTs) for healthy participants, but not schizophrenia participants. Together, these findings suggest there is impaired sustained attention for both social and nonsocial stimuli in schizophrenia, and their attention may not correspond with their behavior.

Experiments in a driving simulator are a good choice to eliminate the risk for crashes and to present highly standardized stimulus combinations. In the present study, 72 subjects from four age groups completed a driving task that required occasional responses to the brake lights of a car in front. In addition, in certain experimental conditions, subjects had to respond to distracting visual or auditory stimuli. In addition to behavioral data, electrophysiological correlates of stimulus processing were derived from the electroencephalogram (EEG). In the two older groups, braking response times increased even in a simple task condition when visual distraction stimuli occurred. In more complex task conditions braking response times increased with acoustic and visual distractors in the middle-aged group as well. In these complex task conditions braking error rates, especially the missing of braking reaction in favor of the distracting task, increased under visual distraction with increasing age. Associated with this, a reduced P3b component in the event-related potential indicated an unfavorable allocation of mental resources. The study demonstrates the potential of driving simulators for studying effects of distraction, but also their limitations with respect to the interpretability of the results.

These include symptoms such as delusions of control, i.e. the belief that one's actions are controlled by an external agent. Models of self-disorders point at altered neural mechanisms of source monitoring, i.e. the ability of the brain to discriminate self-generated stimuli from those driven by the environment. However, evidence supporting this putative relationship is currently lacking. We performed electroencephalography (EEG) during self-paced, brisk right fist closures in ten (M=9; F=1) patients with Early-Course Schizophrenia (ECSCZ) and age and gender-matched healthy volunteers. We measured the Readiness Potential (RP), i.e. an EEG feature preceding self-generated movements, and movement-related EEG spectral changes. Self-disorders in ECSCZ were assessed with the Examination of Anomalous Self-Experience (EASE). Patients showed a markedly reduced RP and altered post-movement Event-Related Synchronization (ERS) in the beta frequency band (14-24 Hz) compared to healthy controls. Importantly, smaller RP and weaker ERS were associated with higher EASE scores in ECSCZ. Our data suggest that disturbances of neural correlates preceding and following self-initiated movements may reflect the severity of self-disorders in patients suffering from ECSCZ. These findings point towards deficits in basic mechanisms of sensorimotor integration as a substrate for self-disorders.

Especially for patients with a highly functional subtype of ASD, it remains uncertain whether these deficits and underlying neural mechanisms persist into adulthood. Research indicates differences in audiovisual speech processing between ASD and healthy controls (HC) in the auditory cortex. The temporal dynamics of these differences still need to be characterized. Thus, in the present study we examined 14 adult subjects with high-functioning ASD and 15 adult HC while they viewed visual (lip movements) and auditory (voice) speech information that was either superimposed by white noise (condition 1) or not (condition 2). Subject's performance was quantified by measuring stimulus comprehension. In addition, event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Results demonstrated worse speech comprehension for ASD subjects compared to HC under noisy conditions. Moreover, ERP-analysis revealed significantly higher P2 amplitudes over parietal electrodes for ASD subjects compared to HC.

However, the cognition-guided neurofeedback BCI dataset is extremely lacking at present. This paper provides a BCI dataset based on a novel cognition-guided neurofeedback on nicotine addiction. Twenty-eight participants are recruited and involved in two visits of neurofeedback training. This cognition-guided neurofeedback includes two phases: an offline classifier construction and a real-time neurofeedback training. The original electroencephalogram (EEG) raw data of two phases are provided and evaluated in this paper. The event-related potential (ERP) amplitude and channel waveform suggest that our BCI dataset is of good quality and consistency. During neurofeedback training, the participants' smoking cue reactivity patterns have a significant reduction. The mean accuracy of the multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) classifier can reach approximately 70%. This novel cognition-guided neurofeedback BCI dataset can be used to develop comparisons with other neurofeedback systems and provide a reference for the development of other BCI algorithms and neurofeedback paradigms on addiction.

However, fewer studies focused on beta band oscillations during postural control in upright stance. In this preliminary study, we examined beta rebound and other components of electroencephalogram (EEG) activity during perturbed upright stance to investigate supraspinal contributions to postural stabilization. Particularly, we aimed to clarify the timing and duration of beta rebound within a non-sustained, but long-lasting postural recovery process that occurs more slowly compared to upper extremities. To this end, EEG signals were acquired from nine healthy young adults in response to a brief support-surface perturbation, together with the center of pressure, the center of mass and electromyogram (EMG) activities of ankle muscles. Event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related spectral perturbations were computed from EEG data using the perturbation-onset as a triggering event. After short-latency (<0.3 s) ERPs, our results showed a decrease in high-beta band oscillations (event-related desynchronization), which was followed by a significant increase (event-related synchronization) in the same band, as well as a decrease in theta band oscillations. Unlike during upper extremity motor tasks, the beta rebound in this case was initiated before the postural recovery was completed, and sustained for as long as 3 s with small EMG responses for the first half period, followed by no excessive EMG activities for the second half period. We speculate that those novel characteristics of beta rebound might be caused by slow postural dynamics along a stable manifold of the unstable saddle-type upright equilibrium of the postural control system without active feedback control, but with active monitoring of the postural state, in the framework of the intermittent control.

However, acquiring the number of responses needed for this process is time consuming. We therefore propose a method for shortening the measurement time using weighted-average processing based on the output of deep learning. Using P300 as a representative component, here we focused on the shape of the ERP and evaluated whether our method emphasizes the P300 peak amplitude more than conventional averaging, while still maintaining the waveform shape and the P300 peak latency. Thus, using either CNN or EEGNet, the correlation coefficient reflecting the waveform shape, the peak P300 amplitude, and the peak latency were evaluated and compared with the same factors obtained from conventional waveform averaging. Additionally, the degree of background EEG suppression provided by our method was evaluated using the root mean square of the pre-stimulation waveform, and the number of fewer responses required for averaging (i.e., the reduction in measurement time) was calculated. The results showed that compared with P300 values obtained through conventional averaging, our method allowed for the same shape and response latency, but with a higher amplitude, while requiring a smaller number of responses. Our method showed that by using EEGNet, measurement time could be reduced by 13.7%. This corresponds to approximately a 40-second reduction for every 5 minutes of measurement time.

Brain Vital Signs in Elite Ice Hockey: Towards Characterizing Objective and Specific Neurophysiological Reference Values for Concussion Management	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography (EEG); event-related potentials; brain vital signs; ice hockey; normative data	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT; ERP; SKILLS; N1	Background: Prior concussion studies have shown that objective neurophysiological measures are sensitive to detecting concussive and subconcussive impairments in youth ice-hockey. These studies monitored brain vital signs at rink-side using a within-subjects design to demonstrate significant changes from pre-season baseline scans. However, practical clinical implementation must overcome inherent challenges related to any dependence on a baseline. This requires establishing the start of normative reference data sets. Methods: The current study collected specific reference data for N = 58 elite, youth, male ice-hockey players and compared these with a general reference dataset from N = 135 of males and females across the lifespan. The elite hockey players were recruited to a select training camp through CAA Hockey, a management agency for players drafted to leagues such as the National Hockey League (NHL). The statistical analysis included a test-retest comparison to establish reliability, and a multivariate analysis of covariance to evaluate differences in brain vital signs between groups with age as a covariate. Findings: Test-retest assessments for brain vital signs evoked potentials showed moderate-to-good reliability (Cronbach's Alpha > 0.7, Intraclass correlation coefficient > 0.5) in five out of six measures. The multivariate analysis of covariance showed no overall effect for group (p = 0.105), and a significant effect of age as a covariate was observed (p < 0.001). Adjusting for the effect of age, a significant difference was observed in the measure of N100 latency (p = 0.022) between elite hockey players and the heterogeneous control group. Interpretation: The findings support the concept that normative physiological data can be used in brain vital signs evaluation in athletes, and should additionally be stratified for age, skill level, and experience. These can be combined with general norms and/or individual baseline assessments where appropriate and/or possible. The current results allow for brain vital sign evaluation independent of baseline assessment, therefore enabling objective neurophysiological evaluation of concussion management and cognitive performance optimization in ice-hockey.

Recently, the notion of automaticity has been challenged by behavioral studies suggesting that dangerous objects elicit aversive affordances that interfere with encoding of an object's motor properties; however, related EEG studies have provided little support for these claims. We sought EEG evidence that would support the operation of an inhibitory mechanism that interferes with the motor encoding of dangerous objects, and we investigated whether such mechanism would be modulated by the perceived distance of an object and the goal of a given task. EEGs were recorded by 24 participants who passively perceived dangerous and neutral objects in their peripersonal, boundary, or extrapersonal space and performed either a reachability judgment task or a categorization task. Our results showed that greater attention, reflected in the visual P1 potential, was drawn by dangerous and reachable objects. Crucially, a frontal N2 potential, associated with motor inhibition, was larger for dangerous objects only when participants performed a reachability judgment task. Furthermore, a larger parietal P3b potential for dangerous objects indicated the greater difficulty in linking a dangerous object to the appropriate response, especially when it was located in the participants' extrapersonal space. Taken together, our results show that perception of dangerous objects elicits aversive affordances in a task-dependent way and provides evidence for the operation of a neural mechanism that does not code affordances of dangerous objects automatically, but rather on the basis of contextual information.

The continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) was registered and event-related brain potentials [ERPs] were analyzed in addition to picture-naming latencies. Experiment 1 used morphologically and semantically related distractor words to tap into different pre-articulatory planning stages during compound production. Relative to unrelated distractors, naming was speeded when distractors corresponded to morphemes of the compound (sun or flower for the target SUNFLOWER), but slowed when distractors were from the same semantic category as the compound (tulip -1 SUNFLOWER). Distractors from the same category as the compound's first constituent (moon -1 SUNFLOWER) had no influence. The diverging effects for semantic and morphological distractors replicate results from earlier studies. ERPs revealed different effects of morphological and semantic distractors with an interesting time course: morphological effects had an earlier onset. Comparable to the naming latencies, no ERP effects were obtained for distractors from the same semantic category as the compound's first constituent. Experiment 2 investigated the effectiveness of the latter distractors, presenting them with pictures of the compounds' first constituents (e.g., moon -1 SUN). Interference was confirmed both behaviorally and in the ERPs, showing that the absence of an effect in Experiment 1 was not due to the materials used. Considering current models of speech production, the data are best explained by a cascading flow of activation throughout semantic, lexical and morpho-phonological steps of speech planning.

Despite intensive investigations on PES, the adaptive nature of PES remains unresolved. Mere, we systematically examined this issue by manipulating response-stimulus intervals (RSIs) and examining their influence on behaviors and neural dynamics of PES. Behavioral and electrophysiological (EEG) measures were recorded while male and female human participants performed a four-choice flanker task as RSIs were manipulated. Behaviorally, PES showed maladaptive features at short RSIs but some adaptive features at long RSIs. EEG results indicated that RSIs did not affect basic error-related processing. indexed by the same pattern in the contrasts between flanker errors and correct responses on the error-related negativity (ERN). error positivity (Pe), or theta band, no matter at short or long RSIs. However, RSIs significantly influenced postflanker error attentional adjustment, motor inhibition, and sensory sensitivity. At short RSIs, compared with postcorrect trials, postflanker error trials elicited larger beta band power and smaller P1 amplitude but did not affect alpha band power, suggesting that motor processing was inhibited, and subsequent sensory processing was impaired, but no attentional adjustment occurred. By contrast, at long RSIs, postflanker error trials led to smaller alpha and beta band power but did not affect P1 amplitude, indicating that attentional adjustment but not motor inhibition occurred, and sensory processing was not impaired. Together with behavioral results, the current study demonstrated that PES was adaptive at long RSIs but maladaptive at short RSIs. We further discuss the role of central resources in the adaptability of PES.

The Effects of Priming Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation on Movement-Related and Mirror Visual Feedback-Induced Sensorimotor Desynchronization	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						theta burst stimulation; event-related desynchronization; metaplasticity; motor cortex; mirror visual feedback; occupational therapy		The potential benefits of priming intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) with continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) have not been examined in regard to sensorimotor oscillatory activities recorded in electroencephalography (EEG). The objective of this study was to investigate the modulatory effect of priming iTBS (cTBS followed by iTBS) delivered to the motor cortex on movement-related and mirror visual feedback (MVF)-induced sensorimotor event-related desynchronization (ERD), compared with iTBS alone, on healthy adults. Twenty participants were randomly allocated into Group 1: priming iTBS-cTBS followed by iTBS, and Group 2: non-priming iTBS-sham cTBS followed by iTBS. The stimulation was delivered to the right primary motor cortex daily for 4 consecutive days. EEG was measured before and after 4 sessions of stimulation. Movement-related ERD was evaluated during left-index finger tapping and MVF-induced sensorimotor ERD was evaluated by comparing the difference between right-index finger tapping with and without MVF. After stimulation, both protocols increased movement-related ERD and MVF-induced sensorimotor ERD in high mu and low beta bands, indicated by significant time effects. A significant interaction effect favoring Group 1 in enhancing movement-related ERD was observed in the high mu band [F-(1,F-18) = 4.47, p = 0.049], compared with Group 2. Our experiment suggests that among healthy adults priming iTBS with cTBS delivered to the motor cortex yields similar effects with iTBS alone on enhancing ERD induced by MVF-based observation, while movement-related ERD was more enhanced in the priming iTBS condition, specifically in the high mu band.

However, 40-Hz ASSR was not studied in relation to SHANK3 functioning. Here, we present a 15-year-old girl (SH01) with previously unreported duplication of the first seven exons of the SHANK3 gene (22q13.33). SH01's electroencephalogram (EEG) during 40-Hz click trains of 500 ms duration binaurally presented with inter-trial intervals of 500-800 ms were compared with those from typically developing children (n = 32). SH01 was diagnosed with mild mental retardation and learning disabilities (F70.88), dysgraphia, dyslexia, and smaller vocabulary than typically developing (TD) peers. Her clinical phenotype resembled the phenotype of previously described patients with 22q13.33 microduplications (approximate to 30 reported so far). SH01 had mild autistic symptoms but below the threshold for ASD diagnosis and microcephaly. No seizures or MRI abnormalities were reported. While SH01 had relatively preserved auditory event-related potential (ERP) with slightly attenuated P1, her 40-Hz ASSR was totally absent significantly deviating from TD's ASSR. The absence of 40-Hz ASSR in patients with microduplication, which affected the SHANK3 gene, indicates deficient temporal resolution of the auditory system, which might underlie language problems and represent a neurophysiological biomarker of SHANK3 abnormalities.

We analyze the potential predictive performance of event-related potential analysis in this high gamma band, provide evidence that detection algorithms should take into account the varying strength of a patient's common frequency extremes, and provide evidence that patient-specific approaches to machine learning algorithms may be more successful in the detection of pediatric seizures as they are more difficult to detect than adult seizures. Using these results, machine learning detection algorithm performance on pediatric patient data, which is prone to issues from limitations within the algorithms, may be significantly improved by incorporating high gamma band signal processing at the locations identified by this process.

The combination of VR with electroencephalography (EEG) presents further opportunities to improve therapeutic efficacy by personalizing the paradigm. Specifically, the idea is to synchronize the choice and timing of stimuli in the perceived virtual world with fluctuating brain states relevant to motor behavior. Here, we present an open source EEG single-trial based classification pipeline that is designed to identify ongoing brain states predictive of the planning and execution of movements. 9 healthy volunteers each performed 1080 trials of a repetitive reaching task with an implicit two-alternative forced choice, i.e., use of the right or left hand, in response to the appearance of a visual target. The performance of the EEG decoding pipeline was assessed with respect to classification accuracy of right vs. left arm use, based on the EEG signal at the time of the stimulus. Different features, feature extraction methods, and classifiers were compared at different time windows; the number and location of informative EEG channels and the number of calibration trials needed were also quantified, as well as any benefits from individual-level optimization of pipeline parameters. This resulted in a set of recommended parameters that achieved an average 83.3% correct prediction on never-before-seen testing data, and a state-of-the-art 77.1% in a real-time simulation. Neurophysiological plausibility of the resulting classifiers was assessed by time-frequency and event-related potential analyses, as well as by Independent Component Analysis topographies and cortical source localization. We expect that this pipeline will facilitate the identification of relevant brain states as prospective therapeutic targets in closed-loop EEG-VR motor neurorehabilitation.

Towards the Classification of Error-Related Potentials using Riemannian Geometry	2021 43RD ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE & BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (IEEE EMBC)	NOV 01-05, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, IEEE, Elsevier, Inst Engn & Technol			NEURAL SYSTEM	The error-related potential (ErrP) is an event-related potential (ERP) evoked by an experimental participant's recognition of an error during task performance. ErrPs, originally described by cognitive psychologists, have been adopted for use in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for the detection and correction of errors, and the online refinement of decoding algorithms. Riemannian geometry-based feature extraction and classification is a new approach to BCI which shows good performance in a range of experimental paradigms, but has yet to be applied to the classification of ErrPs. Here, we describe an experiment that elicited ErrPs in seven normal participants performing a visual discrimination task. Audio feedback was provided on each trial. We used multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings to classify ErrPs (success/failure), comparing a Riemannian geometry-based method to a traditional approach that computes time-point features. Overall, the Riemannian approach outperformed the traditional approach (78.2% versus 75.9% accuracy, p <0.05); this difference was statistically significant (p <0.05) in three of seven participants. These results indicate that the Riemannian approach better captured the features from feedback-elicited ErrPs, and may have application in BCI for error detection and correction.

An ERP study with older and younger adults	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Audiovisual integration; Multi-talker speech perception; Aging; Attention; Event-related potentials; Multisensory processing	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; MONTREAL COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT; VISUAL SPEECH; ATTENTIONAL CONTROL; INTEGRATION; PERCEPTION; BRAIN; ENHANCEMENT; POTENTIALS; SELECTION	In natural conversations, visible mouth and lip movements play an important role in speech comprehension. There is evidence that visual speech information improves speech comprehension, especially for older adults and under difficult listening conditions. However, the neurocognitive basis is still poorly understood. The present EEG experiment investigated the benefits of audiovisual speech in a dynamic cocktail-party scenario with 22 (aged 20-34 years) younger and 20 (aged 55-74 years) older participants. We presented three simultaneously talking faces with a varying amount of visual speech input (still faces, visually unspecific and audiovisually congruent). In a two-alternative forced-choice task, participants had to discriminate target words ("yes" or "no") among two distractors (one-digit number words). In half of the experimental blocks, the target was always presented from a central position, in the other half, occasional switches to a lateral position could occur. We investigated behavioral and electrophysiological modulations due to age, location switches and the content of visual information, analyzing response times and accuracy as well as the P1, N1, P2, N2 event-related potentials (ERPs) and the contingent negative variation (CNV) in the EEG. We found that audiovisually congruent speech information improved performance and modulated ERP amplitudes in both age groups, suggesting enhanced preparation and integration of the subsequent auditory input. In the older group, larger amplitude measures were found in early phases of processing (P1-N1). Here, amplitude measures were reduced in response to audiovisually congruent stimuli. In later processing phases (P2-N2) we found decreased amplitude measures in the older group, while an amplitude reduction for audiovisually congruent compared to visually unspecific stimuli was still observable. However, these benefits were only observed as long as no location switches occurred, leading to enhanced amplitude measures in later processing phases (P2-N2). To conclude, meaningful visual information in a multi-talker setting, when presented from the expected location, is shown to be beneficial for both younger and older adults.

The objective of the present study was to understand the cognitive and neural underpinnings of this phenomenon using event-related potentials (ERP) and their source localization using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography analysis (sLORETA). Twenty-four participants performed a money choice task, where they made choices between a smaller-sooner and a larger-later reward, which included trials with and without an immediately available option, while their electroencephalography (EEG) activity was recorded. Trials with and without immediacy were identical except that the latter involved a front-end delay added to both the rewards. Results showed that presence of immediacy made the choices significantly more impulsive. Presence of immediate reward elicited larger visual P2 and late positive potential (LPP), indicating enhanced capture of automatic and sustained attention respectively, and smaller N2, indicative of diminished engagement of cognitive control processes. Source localization revealed increased activity in the visual cortex in the presence of immediacy, signifying higher valuation. Higher activation of areas of insula during P2-suggesting increased awareness of visceral signals-predicted larger impulsive preference reversals. The results suggest that presence of immediate reward biases the choice very early during the decision making process by precipitating visceral states that triggers approach behaviour, and highlight the need to adopt strategies like precommitment to counter the effect.

Methods A total of 33 MwA patients and 20 healthy controls (HCs) were studied. They were balanced in age (35.12 +/- 8.94 vs 34.70 +/- 9.59 years, p = 0.872) and sex (69.7 vs 75.0% females, p = 0.761). ERPs were measured in response to both stimuli, where pictures were preceded with an object name that either matched or mismatched with the object. Averaged amplitudes, peaks, peak latencies, difference waves and topography were compared between MwA and HCs. Results MwA patients had significantly lower averaged amplitudes at the Fz and F4 sites during incongruent stimuli, as well as reduced peaks at the C3 and Pz sites. Topography showed a more widespread N400 effect over scalp relative to HCs. The difference ERP waveforms did not differ in the N400 effect between groups, but the P600 effect was significantly stronger in the HCs group relative to the MwA group at the Pz (6.52 +/- 2.57 vs. 3.50 +/- 3.15, p = 0.001) and P4 (5.86 +/- 2.79 vs. 3.95 +/- 3.64, p = 0.040) sites. Conclusions Picture-word matching tasks could serve as a potential new method for the investigation of semantic processing in MwA patients.

The current study extended this work to adolescence-and to evaluate the specificity of the relationship between flanker P300 to depressive symptoms versus anxiety symptoms, and whether the association between flanker P300 and depressive symptoms was moderated by biological sex. To this end, P300 amplitude, depression, anxiety, and sex were assessed in a large sample of 619 adolescents aged 11 to 14. Participants completed a speeded response flanker task while EEG was recorded, as well as self-reported measures of current depression and anxiety symptoms. Reduced P300 amplitude was related to both heightened depression and anxiety symptoms in zero-order correlations. Regression-based analyses suggest that reduced P300 was uniquely related to depressive symptoms. Furthermore, this negative association between P300 and depression was apparent in female adolescents, but not male adolescents. In sum, the current study suggests that flanker P300 amplitude may potentially serve as a neural marker specific to depression in females during adolescence.

Nevertheless, the neural mechanism that accounts for the differences between the two groups is still left unveiled. Using the event-related potential (ERP) and functional brain networks, the present study investigated the neural mechanism underpinning decision-making differences between adults and adolescents in the ultimatum game (UG). The results revealed that despite a higher medial frontal negativity (MFN) in response to unfair offers as compared to fair ones in adults, no difference was found in adolescents. Comparing the MFN with N1, one of the early ERP components, we found a larger MFN in adults but an opposite tendency in adolescents. The network analysis revealed that when responding to the unfair offers, the enhanced linkages are observed to be locally confined in the occipital cortex for adolescents, while the increased long-range linkages between the prefrontal and occipital areas could be found for adults. Taken together, our findings suggested that adolescents tend to the interest of offers while the adults prefer the rule of fairness in the context of unfairness. The social experience for the fairness establishment reshapes the two groups with different brain activities.

Evoked Potentials Differentiate Developmental Coordination Disorder From Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in a Stop-Signal Task: A Pilot Study	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						dyspraxia; executive function; response inhibition; electroencephalography; ERPs		Developmental Coordination Disorder and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder are unique neurodevelopmental disorders with overlaps in executive functions and motor control. The conditions co-occur in up to 50% of cases, raising questions of the pathological mechanisms of DCD versus ADHD. Few studies have examined these overlaps in adults with DCD and/or ADHD. Therefore, to provide insights about executive functions and motor control between adults with DCD, ADHD, both conditions (DCD + ADHD), or typically developed controls, this study used a stop-signal task and parallel EEG measurement. We assessed executive performance via go accuracy and go reaction time, as well as motor response inhibition via stop-signal reaction time. This was complemented with analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs). Based on existing investigations of adults with DCD or ADHD, we expected (1) groups would not differ in behavioral performance on stop and go trials, but (2) differences in ERPs, particularly in components N200 (index of cognitive control) and P300 (index of attention and inhibition) would be evident. The sample included N = 50 adults with DCD (n = 12), ADHD (n = 9), DCD + ADHD (n = 7), and control participants (n = 22). We replicated that there were no between-group differences for behavioral-level executive performance and motor response inhibition. However, on a physiological level, ERP components N200 and P300 differed between groups, particularly during successful response inhibition. These ERPs reflect potential endophenotypic differences not evident in overt behavior of participants with ADHD and/or DCD. This suggests a disorder specific employment of inhibition or general executive functions in groups of adults with DCD, DCD + ADHD, ADHD, or control participants.

Although the dysfunction of attention has been confirmed by neuropsychological research using scales, there is no event-related potentials (ERPs) research. The Attention Network Test (ANT) has been widely used to evaluate the three separate components of attention processing (alerting, orienting, and executive control). Twenty-seven paratroopers exposed to repetitive subconcussion (subconcussion group) and 25 matched healthy control participants (HCs group) were enrolled, and all of them performed the ANT test while continuous scalp electroencephalography data were recorded. On the behavioral performance level, the subconcussion group showed a slower task response, with an especially significant slower reaction time in alerting. Concerning ERP results, reduction amplitudes of cue-N1 in the alerting network were observed, indicating that this group was less able to make efficient use of cues and maintain an alerting state for incoming information. For the orienting network, no difference in N1 amplitude was observed between the two groups. Moreover, there was a reduced P3 amplitude in the executive control network in the subconcussion group compared with the HCs group, suggesting a dysfunction of attentional resource allocation and inhibition control in the former group. This study is, to our knowledge, the first analysis of the altered attention network caused by repetitive subconcussion from the perspectives of behavioral and neuropsychology levels. These preliminary results revealed the possible damage of the alerting and executive control networks and provided a reference for further research on subconcussion cognitive impairment.

The aim of this study was to examine the neural signature of IA in children and adolescents with ASD, and to elucidate potential links to contextual updating processes using electroencephalography. Results did not indicate that IA or early contextual updating was impaired in ASD. However, there was evidence of aberrant processing of expectation violations in ASD, particularly if the expectation was based on IA. Results are discussed within the context of impaired predictive coding in ASD.

The effects of such response history have often been tested using response inhibition tasks. Since previous studies have highlighted the effect of immediate action history formed directly before the subsequent response in a laboratory environment, we aimed to elucidate the longer-term effects of response history, using repetitive and habitual consumer behavior in daily life as the response history. We used event-related potentials recorded in a Go/No-go task to investigate brain activity related to inhibitory control, hypothesizing that stimuli with a high frequency of choice in everyday life would elicit stronger inhibition-related activity, that is, the No-go-N2 component. Participants were asked to evaluate the frequency of purchase and use of some products, such as food and drink or social networking services (SNS) in everyday situations. Images of each product were assigned as stimuli in the Go and No-go trials according to the frequency of choice. The results showed that frequently purchased No-go stimuli yielded a larger amplitude of the No-go-N2 component and a negative shift between 200 and 300ms after the presentation of No-go stimuli. The results suggest that frequently chosen products evoke stronger inhibition conflicts and require greater cognitive control to withhold a response. Our findings showed that repeated purchase behavior in daily life forms a response history and has a long-term influence on the inhibition of even simple approaching behaviors, such as button pressing.</p>	[Tsuji, Koki; Shibata, Midori; Terasawa, Yuri; Umeda, Satoshi] Keio Univ, Keio Global Res Inst, Tokyo, Japan; [Terasawa, Yuri; Umeda, Satoshi] Keio Univ, Dept Psychol, Tokyo, Japan		Tsuji, K (corresponding author), Keio Univ, Keio Global Res Inst, Tokyo, Japan.	kk_tsuji@keio.jp			Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) [JP18J15130, JP18H05525]	Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT))	This research was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows to KT (No. JP18J15130) and a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas to SU (No. JP18H05525) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT).		51	0	0	3	6	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND	1664-1078			FRONT PSYCHOL	Front.

Posttraumatic Stress Symptom Dimensions and Brain Responses to Startling Auditory Stimuli in Combat Veterans	JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						PTSD; mTBI; veterans; startle; EEG	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; UNPREDICTABLE THREAT; ANXIETY SENSITIVITY; PTSD SYMPTOMS; DISORDER; ANTICIPATION; INJURY; ATTENTION; INTENSITY; EXPERIENCES	Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is marked by alterations in emotional functioning, physiological reactivity, and attention. Neural reactivity to acoustic startle stimuli can be used to understand brain functions related to these alterations. Investigations of startle reactivity in PTSD have yielded inconsistent findings, which may reflect the heterogeneity of the disorder. Furthermore, little is known of how the common co-occurrence of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI; i.e., concussion) may influence neural reactivity. We examined the event-related potentials (ERPs) of combat veterans (n = 102) to acoustic startle probes delivered during viewing of pleasant, neutral, unpleasant, and combat-related pictures. Interview-based assessments yielded dimensional characterizations of PTSD and mTBI. The P3 ERP response to startle probes was reduced during all affective relative to neutral pictures but failed to be associated with a PTSD diagnosis. However, two separable domains of PTSD symptomatology were associated with startle ERPs regardless of the picture conditions. Maladaptive avoidance was associated with smaller N1, P2, and P3 amplitudes, while intrusive reexperiencing was associated with larger P2 amplitudes. There were no main effects of mTBI. Findings suggest that level of symptomatology rather than a formal diagnosis of PTSD better explains alterations in neural reactivity after traumatic events, while mild brain injuries have little impact. Avoidance symptoms of PTSD may dampen neural functions that facilitate reorientation to threat while intrusive reexperiencing of traumatic events appears to heighten sensory reactivity. Considering specific aspects of symptomatology provides insight into the neural basis of trauma-related psychopathology and may help guide individualization of clinical interventions.

Precise diagnosis prior to the onset of the symptoms can prevent the rapid progression of the emerging cognitive impairment. Recent progress has shown that electroencephalography (EEG) is the promising and cost-effective test to facilitate the detection of neurocognitive disorders. However, most of the existing works have been using only resting-state EEG. The efficiencies of EEG signals from various cognitive tasks, for DEM classification, have yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this study, we designed four cognitive tasks that engage different cognitive performances: attention, working memory, and executive function. We investigated these tasks by using statistical analysis on both time and frequency domains of EEG signals from three classes of human subjects: DEM, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal control (NC). We also further evaluated the classification performances of two features extraction methods: principal component analysis (PCA) and filter hank common spatial pattern (FBCSP). We found that the working memoryrelated tasks yielded good performances for DEM recognition in both cases using PCA and FBCSP. Moreover, FBCSP with features combination from four tasks revealed the best sensitivity of 0.87 and the specificity of 0.80. To our hest knowledge, this is the first work that concurrently investigated several cognitive tasks for DEM recognition using both statistical analysis and classification scores. Our results yielded essential information to design and aid in conducting further experimental tasks to early diagnose DEM patients.

Sebastian; Siddiquee, Masudur R.; Fei, Ding-Yu; Bai, Ou			Preliminary Study on Real-Time Prediction of Gait Acceleration Intention From Volition-Associated EEG Patterns	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Acceleration; Legged locomotion; Real-time systems; Task analysis; Prosthetics; Testing; Brain-computer interface; gait acceleration intention; threshold regulation; majority voting; wavelet transform; event related desynchronization; movement related cortical potential		Volitional control of prosthetic devices can potentially provide the user with a more natural movement experience. Currently, there is no feasible volitional triggering method to adapt the prosthetic device to user's intention to accelerate during walking. Therefore, real-time prediction of human acceleration intention from the pre-acceleration electroencephalogram (EEG), and subsequent adaptation of the prosthetic device's control parameters for seamless transition remains a daunting research area. In that aspect, this study investigates the neural changes responsive to human intention to accelerate during walking. Furthermore, this study also explores whether the acceleration intention can be predicted from real-time EEG to subsequently enable parametric adaptation for an external prosthetic device. EEG, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and ground reaction force (GRF) signals were collected from one healthy subject during walking with self-paced speed changes. A set of classifiers were explored to classify between constant speed and acceleration. The classifiers showed promising classification performance well above chance level in offline, pseudo-online and real-time scenarios. An accuracy of 85.9 +/- 2.9% was achieved in offline scenario, while pseudo-online classification resulted in a true positive rate (TPR) of 81.9 +/- 7.4% with 7.7 +/- 0.8 false positives/ min and a detection latency of -844 +/- 572 ms. In real-time scenario, 9 out of 12 acceleration events were predicted successfully with only 3 false predictions at an average latency of -741 ms. Moreover, offline data analysis suggested suppression of mu and beta rhythms related to gait acceleration between 2 seconds before and 1.5 seconds after the onset of acceleration. A slow increase in negative amplitude was also observed in near DC frequencies of EEG data acquired from the sensorimotor cortex. The findings of this study portray inspiring results in retrieving gait acceleration-associated neural changes for facilitating natural control of assistive devices.	[Hasan, S. M.

Calgary Comprehensive Epilepsy Pro	Clinical safety of intracranial EEG electrodes in MRI at 1.5 T and 3 T: a single-center experience and literature review	NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Review						Clinical safety; Intracranial electrodes; Magnetic resonance imaging		Purpose Intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) can be a critical part of presurgical evaluation for drug resistant epilepsy. With the increasing use of intracranial EEG, the safety of these electrodes in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environment remains a concern, particularly at higher field strengths. However, no studies have reported the MRI safety experience of intracranial electrodes at 3 T. We report an MRI safety review of patients with intracranial electrodes at 1.5 and 3 T. Methods One hundred and sixty-five consecutive admissions for intracranial EEG monitoring were reviewed. A total of 184 MRI scans were performed on 135 patients over 140 admissions. These included 118 structural MRI studies at 1.5 T and 66 functional MRI studies at 3 T. The magnetic resonance (MR) protocols avoided the use of high specific energy absorption rate sequences that could result in electrode heating. The intracranial implantations included 114 depth, 15 subdural, and 11 combined subdural and depth electrodes. Medical records were reviewed for patient-reported complications and radiologic complications related to these studies. Pre-implantation, post-implantation, and post-explantation imaging studies were reviewed for potential complications. Results No adverse events or complications were seen during or after MRI scanning at 1.5 or 3 T apart from those attributed to electrode implantation. There was also no clinical or imaging evidence of worsening of pre-existing implantation-related complications after MR imaging. Conclusion No clinical or radiographic complications are seen when performing MRI scans at 1.5 or 3 T on patients with implanted intracranial EEG electrodes while avoiding high specific energy absorption rate sequences.

Clas-sical conditioning studies have shown that aversively conditioned (CS+) faces potentiate different face processing stages as evidenced by increased early and late event-related potential (ERPs) components. However, it is unknown whether and how ERP modula-tions depend on certain attentional conditions. To examine this question, this preregis-tered study investigated ERPs to faces paired with aversive screams or neutral sounds under three tasks with increasing attention to CS + relevant features of the face: Partici-pants (N = 40) had to discriminate either the orientation of superimposed lines, perceived gender, or the CS association. We found potentiation of the N170, the Early Posterior Negativity (EPN), and, most remarkably, the Late Positive Potential (LPP) to CS + faces regardless of task condition. This finding suggests that, in contrast to other types of emotional information and learning, classical conditioning boosts early and late processing stages, even if no explicit attention to the face information or the CS association is required.

Electrophysiological investigation of reward anticipation and outcome evaluation during slot machine play	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Feedback related negativity (FRN); Delta oscillations; Frontal medial theta oscillations; Near miss; Frustrative nonreward		Slot machines are a popular form of gambling, offering a tractable way to experimentally model reward processes. This study used a 3-reel slot paradigm to assess psychologically distinct phases of reward processing, reflecting anticipation, and early- and late-stage outcome processing. EEG measures of winning, nearly missing (a losing outcome revealed at the final, third reel), and "totally" missing (a losing outcome revealed earlier, at the second reel) were collected from healthy adults (n=54). Condition effects were evaluated in: i) event-related potential (ERP) components reflecting anticipatory attention (stimulus preceding negativity, SPN) and outcome processing (reward positivity, RewP and late-positive potential, LPP) and ii) total power and phase synchrony of theta and delta band oscillations. Behaviorally, trial initiation was fastest after a near miss outcome and slowest after a winning outcome. As expected, a significant SPN was observed for possible wins (AA) vs. total misses (AB), consistent with reward anticipation. Larger win (AAA) vs. near miss (AAB) amplitudes were observed for the RewP; LPP amplitudes were largest for wins (AAA), intermediate for near misses (AAB), and smallest for total misses (ABC), reflecting significant early (RewP) and late-stage (LPP) outcome processing effects. There was an effect of reel position on the RewP, with larger amplitude in the final reel (AAA-AAB) relative to the 2nd-reel locked difference waves (AA-AB). Across all outcomes, near misses elicited the largest and most phase-synchronized theta responses, while wins elicited larger and more phase-synchronized delta responses than total misses, with delta band measures not distinguishing between near misses and wins. . Phase locking measures contrasting win vs. near miss delta and theta synchronization, within time windows corresponding to ERP measurements, covaried with RewP, but not SPN or LPP, amplitude. Lastly, EEG measures showed differential relationships with age and self-reported consummatory pleasure. In the context of slot machine play, where reward anticipation and attainment place minimal demands on effort and skill, ERP and time-frequency methods capture distinct neurophysiological signatures of reward anticipation and outcome processing.

However, low reliability and concentration difficulty for some patients during most MI-BCIs involving visual tasks affect the performance of MI-BCI. The integration of vibrotactile stimulation (VibraoStim) with MI-based BCI can solve those issues. Therefore, the objective of this study is to explore the different effects between eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) during VibroStim on the cerebral activity and network. We designed and conducted an experiment, in which VibroStim (75 Hz) was applied over the belly of the biceps muscle in the left arm for 15 healthy subjects during EC or EO. The resting-state and VibroStim brain activity with EC or EO were recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). The EEG analysis showed a significant increase in the delta and theta power at C4, and a significant decrease in the alpha power at C4 during EC VibroStim compared to the resting-state. No significant difference was identified in event-related desynchronization (ERD) following VibroStim during EC or EO. A significant increase in the global efficiency and a significant decrease in the characteristic path length during EC VibroStim were observed in the beta band, whereas no significant differ-ences were found during EO VibroStim. These findings indicate, VibroStim feedback, which is suitable for pa-tients with poor vision or those who have difficulty focusing on objects, may improve BCI decoding accuracy by increasing ERD lateralization whether subjects keep EO or EC.

CR is mostly studied using neuroimaging techniques such as functional MRI (fMRI) in which case individuals with a higher CR were observed to activate a smaller brain network compared to individuals with a lower CR, when performing a task equally effectively (higher efficiency), and electroencephalography (EEG) where a particular EEG component (P300) that reflects the attention and working memory load, has been targeted. Despite the contribution of multiple factors such as age, education (formal and informal), working, leisure, and household activities in CR formation, most neuroimaging studies, and those using EEG in particular, focus on formal education level only. The aim of the current EEG study is to investigate how the P300 component, evoked in response to an oddball paradigm, is associated with other components of CR besides education, such as working and leisure activity in older adults. We have used hereto a recently introduced CR index questionnaire (CRIq) that quantifies both professional and leisure activities in terms of their cognitive demand and number of years practiced, as well as a data-driven approach for EEG analysis. We observed complex relationships between CRIq subcomponents and P300 characteristics. These results are especially important given that, unlike previous studies, our measurements (P300 and CRIq) do not require active use of the same executive function and, thus, render our results free of a collinearity bias.

The Deficit of Multimodal Perception of Congruent and Non-Congruent Fearful Expressions in Patients with Schizophrenia: The ERP Study	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						EEG; event-related potentials; schizophrenia; fearful expressions; perception; non-congruent sounds	EVENT-RELATED P3A; EMOTIONAL FACE; 1ST-EPISODE PSYCHOSIS; RECOGNITION; INTEGRATION; VOICE	Emotional dysfunction, including flat affect and emotional perception deficits, is a specific symptom of schizophrenia disorder. We used a modified multimodal odd-ball paradigm with fearful facial expressions accompanied by congruent and non-congruent emotional vocalizations (sounds of women screaming and laughing) to investigate the impairment of emotional perception and reactions to other people's emotions in schizophrenia. We compared subjective ratings of emotional state and event-related potentials (EPPs) in response to congruent and non-congruent stimuli in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. The results showed the altered multimodal perception of fearful stimuli in patients with schizophrenia. The amplitude of N50 was significantly higher for non-congruent stimuli than congruent ones in the control group and did not differ in patients. The P100 and N200 amplitudes were higher in response to non-congruent stimuli in patients than in controls, implying impaired sensory gating in schizophrenia. The observed decrease of P3a and P3b amplitudes in patients could be associated with less attention, less emotional arousal, or incorrect interpretation of emotional valence, as patients differed from healthy controls in the emotion scores of non-congruent stimuli. The difficulties in identifying the incoherence of facial and audial components of emotional expression could be significant in understanding the psychopathology of schizophrenia.

Building on classic theories of feature binding, we first define the oscillatory signatures of integrating 'where' and 'when' information in working memory (WM) and then investigate the role of prefrontal cortex (PFC) in spatiotemporal integration. Fourteen individuals with lateral PFC damage and 20 healthy controls completed a visuospatial WM task while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. On each trial, two shapes were presented sequentially in a top/bottom spatial orientation. We defined EEG signatures of spatiotemporal integration by comparing the maintenance of two possible where-when configurations: the first shape presented on top and the reverse. Frontal deltatheta (delta theta; 2-7 Hz) activity, frontal-posterior dq functional connectivity, lateral posterior event-related potentials, and mesial posterior alpha phase-to-gamma amplitude coupling dissociated the two configurations in controls. WM performance and frontal and mesial posterior signatures of spatiotemporal integration were diminished in PFC lesion patients, whereas lateral posterior signatures were intact. These findings reveal both PFC-dependent and independent substrates of spatiotemporal integration and link optimal performance to PFC. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

According to this model, these sources of information modulate the comprehension of idioms at different time courses. In the current study, we investigated whether these linguistics factors modulate the neurophysiological underpinnings associated with processing of different types of idioms. Adult native speakers of English read sentences that contained idioms with high and low level of familiarity and literal plausibility while their electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Event-related potentials data showed that idioms with low level of familiarity elicited larger negativity starting from 300 ms post stimulus onset and lasted for about 200 ms. A similar negativity, but which started later (at around 400 ms post stimulus onset) was also observed for idioms with a low level of literal plausibility. These results are consistent with the multi-determined model of idiom processing indicating the role of these linguistics factors over different time courses. Finally, the observed negativity for low familiar and low literally plausible idioms was greater over the right hemisphere. Accordingly, the possible role of the right hemisphere in processing idioms will be discussed.

Recallable but not recognizable: The influence of semantic priming in recall paradigms	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Event-related potentials; Recollection; Familiarity; Priming; Cued recall	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; IMPLICIT MEMORY; ENCODING SPECIFICITY; CUED-RECALL; RECOGNITION MEMORY; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; RETRIEVAL-PROCESSES; REVERSE INFERENCE; MILD HYPOXIA; RECOLLECTION	When people can successfully recall a studied word, they should be able to recognize it as having been studied. In cued-recall paradigms, however, participants sometimes correctly recall words in the presence of strong semantic cues but then fail to recognize those words as actually having been studied. Although the conditions necessary to produce this unusual effect are known, the underlying neural correlates have not been investigated. Across five experiments, involving both behavioral and electrophysiological methods (EEG), we investigated the cognitive and neural processes that underlie recognition failures. Experiments 1 and 2 showed behaviorally that assuming that recalled items can be recognized in cued-recall paradigms is a flawed assumption, because recognition failures occur in the presence of cues, regardless of whether those failures are measured. With event-related potentials (ERPs), Experiments 3 and 4 revealed that successfully recalled words that are recognized are driven by recollection at recall and then by a combination of recollection and familiarity at ensuing recognition. In contrast, recognition failures did not show that memory signature and may instead be driven by semantic priming at recall and followed at recognition stages by negative-going ERP effects consistent with implicit processes, such as repetition fluency. These results demonstrate that recall - long-characterized as predominantly reflecting recollection-based processing in episodic memory - may at times also be served by a confluence of implicit cognitive processes.

Behavioural and electrophysiological correlates of lightness contrast and assimilation	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Lightness perception; Contrast; Assimilation; Event-related potentials; Reaction times	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INDUCTION; EEG; BRIGHTNESS; PERCEPTION; HANDEDNESS; LUMINANCE; ISSUES; MODEL	Lightness contrast and assimilation are opposite phenomena: in contrast grey targets appear darker when bordering bright rather than dark surfaces; in assimilation grey targets appear lighter when bordering bright rather than dark surfaces. The underlying neurophysiological mechanisms of these phenomena are not known. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between contrast and assimilation, and the timing and levels of perceptual and cognitive processing using combined behavioural and electrophysiological methods. Thirty undergraduate students (23 female, age range 18-48 years) participated in a forced-choice (grey target is lighter/darker than a comparison square) task, using stimuli designed such that the inducers were in two configurations (small and large) and two shades (white and black). The behavioural data (more consistent and faster responses) corroborated previous findings of stronger contrast effects with white inducers and stronger assimilation effects with black inducers. According to the Event-Related Potentials (ERP) results the mean amplitude was larger in conditions with less consistent and slower behavioural responses. Thus, with contrast responses P1 amplitude was larger with black than white inducers, and N1 amplitude was larger to assimilation than contrast when the configuration of the stimulus was held constant. These results suggest contrast may occur as early as P1 (similar to 110 ms) and assimilation may occur later in N2 (similar to 220 ms), whereas in some conditions, differences in ERPs associated with contrast vs assimilation may happen as early as in N1 (similar to 170 m), in occipital and parietal cortical sites.

Thirty volunteers were recruited and asked to watch a series of short VR videos designed in three dimensions: time, action (characters), and space. Electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded simultaneously during their participation. Subjective results show that any of the editing methods used would lead to an increased load and reduced immersion. Furthermore, the cognition of event segmentation theory also plays an instructive role in VR editing, with differences mainly focusing on frontal, parietal, and central regions. On this basis, visual evoked potential (VEP) analysis was performed, and the standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography algorithm (sLORETA) traceability method was used to analyze the data. The results of the VEP analysis suggest that shearing usually elicits a late event-related potential component, while the sources of VEP are mainly the frontal and parietal lobes. The insights derived from this work can be used as guidance for VR content creation, allowing VR image editing to reveal greater richness and unique beauty.

Thirty-four participants completed a self-reported measure of dialectical thinking, and their resting-state electroencephalography was recorded. After wave filtration and eye movement removal, time-frequency electroencephalography signals were converted into four frequency domains: delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (7-13 Hz), and beta (13-30 Hz). Functional principal component analysis with B-spline approximation was then applied for feature reduction. Five machine learning methods (support vector regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, K-nearest neighbors, random forest, and gradient boosting decision tree) were applied to the reduced features for prediction. The model ensemble technique was used to create the best performing final model. The results showed that the alpha wave of the electroencephalography signal in the early period (12-15 s) contributed most to the prediction of dialectical thinking. With data-driven electrode selection (FC1, FCz, Fz, FC3, Cz, AFz), the prediction model achieved an average coefficient of determination of 0.45 on 200 random test sets. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was found between the alpha value of standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography activity in the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and dialectical self-scale score. The prefrontal and midline alpha oscillations of resting electroencephalography are good predictors of the dispositional level of dialectical thinking, possibly reflecting these brain structures' involvement in dialectical thinking.

The present study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms of cognitive control during attentional processing of emotional faces among older adults. We used go/no-go detection tasks combined with event-related potentials and source localization to examine the effects of response inhibition on age-related positivity effects. Data were obtained from 23 older and 23 younger healthy participants. Behavioral results showed that the discriminability index (d') of older adults on fear trials was significantly greater than that of younger adults [t(44)=2.37, p=0.024, Cohen's d=0.70], whereas an opposite pattern was found in happy trials [t(44)=2.56, p=0.014, Cohen's d=0.75]. The electroencephalography results on the amplitude of the N170 at the left electrode positions showed that the fear-neutral face pairs were larger than the happy-neutral ones for the younger adults [t(22)=2.32, p=0.030, Cohen's d=0.48]; the older group's right hemisphere presented similar tendency, although the results were not statistically significant [t(22)=1.97, p=0.061, Cohen's d=0.41]. Further, the brain activity of the two hemispheres in older adults showed asymmetrical decrement. Our study demonstrated that the age-related "positivity effect" was not observed owing to the depletion of available cognitive resources at the early attentional stage. Moreover, bilateral activation of the two hemispheres may be important signals of normal aging.

We found that N1 and N2 segments of the evoked responses are associated with intra- and internetwork communications, respectively. In a separate cognitive experiment, evoked electrophysiological responses to visual target stimuli occurred with less temporal separation across pairs of electrodes that were located within the same fMRI-defined resting-state networks compared with those located across different resting-state networks.

However, processing of one's own face has rarely been investigated in the context of ASD. Thus, the aim of the present study was to elucidate the role of attentional biases in the processing of self- and other faces in ASD. To achieve this goal we presented participants with images of their own face, the face of a close-other, and famous and unknown faces in a Stroop-like paradigm. Participants (22 with ASD, 22 typically developing [TD]) were instructed to indicate the color of presented faces while EEG was recorded. Our event-related potential results clearly showed that self-face was associated with larger P3 amplitudes than all other faces in the TD group, thus indicating a strong attentional bias toward one's own face. In the ASD group, P3 to the self-face and the close-other's face did not differ, suggesting similar attentional biases in both cases. In line with these P3 findings, nonparametric cluster-based permutation tests showed an analogous pattern of results: significant clusters for the self-face compared with all other faces in the TD group, and no significant cluster in the ASD group. Overall, our findings revealed impaired attentional bias to one's own face and diminished self versus other differentiation in individuals with ASD. The similar neural underpinnings of the self-face and other faces supports previous findings indicating reduced self-prioritization among individuals with ASD.

Brain-computer interface (BCI) applications are developed to facilitate the lives of individuals who have not lost their brain functions yet have lost their motor and communication abilities. In this study, a BCI system is proposed to make classification using Bi-directional long short term memory (Bi-LSTM) neural networks. In the designed system, spectral entropy method including instantaneous frequency change of signal is used as feature fusion. In the study, electroencephalography (EEG) data of 10 participants are collected with Emotiv EPOC+ device using 2x2 visual stimulus matrix prepared on Unity. Each symbol of the 2x2 matrix includes stimulus such as doctor, police, fireman and family. These stimuli are demonstrated to participants with a fixed order. As data collection protocol, 200 ms stimulus time and 300 ms interstimulus interval are used. As the performance success of classification, the average accuracy rates are obtained to be 98.6% for training set and 96.9% for the test set. In addition, in classification of P300 EEG signals, the results obtained via Bi-LSTM are compared with the results obtained using 1 dimensional convolutional neural networks (1DCNN) and support vector machines (SVM) classification methods. Moreover, in the study, information transfer rate (ITR) is provided as 40.39 at an acceptable level.

Moreover, the exact role of individual differences in the observed effects is still largely unknown. In our Event-Related Potential (ERP) study we investigated whether training in a Real Time Strategy (RTS) video game StarCraft II can influence the ability to deploy visual attention measured by the Attentional Blink (AB) task. We also asked whether individual differences in a psychophysiological response in the AB task predict the effectiveness of the video game training. Forty-three participants (non-players) were recruited to the experiment. Participants were randomly assigned to either experimental (Variable environment) or active control (Fixed environment) group, which differed in the type of training received. Training consisted of 30 h of playing the StarCraft II game. Participants took part in two EEG sessions (pre- and post-training) during which they performed the AB task. Our results indicate that both groups improved their performance in the AB task in the post-training session. What is more, in the experimental group the strength of the amplitude of the P300 ERP component (which is related to a conscious visual perception) in the pre training session appeared to be predictive of the level of achievement in the game. In the case of the active control group in-game behaviour appeared to be predictive of a training-related improvement in the AB task. Our results suggest that differences in the neurophysiological response might be treated as a marker of future success in video game acquisition, especially in a more demanding game environment.

To achieve this goal, behavioral and electrophysiological (EEG) data were assessed from healthy control participants as well as kidney transplant and dialyzed patients performing a series of reaction time tasks. The results demonstrated that in patients who received kidney transplant a normalization of response latencies and brain preparatory activity was observed. At the same time, when compared to healthy individuals, increased attention engagement was observed in both clinical groups of patients.

We manipulated two types of Japanese verbs specifically used to represent respect for others, i.e., exalted and humble verbs, which represent respect for the person in the subject and the person in the object, respectively. We visually presented appropriate and anomalous sentences containing the two types of verbs and analyzed the electroencephalogram elicited by the verbs. We observed significant parietal negativity at a latency of approximately 400 ms for anomalous verbs compared with appropriate verbs. This parietal negativity could be a manifestation of the pragmatic process used to integrate the linguistic forms with the human relationships represented in the sentences. The topographies of these event-related potentials (ERPs) corresponded well with those of ERPs for two second-person pronouns in Chinese (plain ni and respectful nin). This correspondence suggests that the pragmatic integration process in honorific expressions is cross-linguistically common in part. Furthermore, we assessed the source localization by means of independent component (IC) analysis and dipole fitting and observed a significant difference in ERP between the honorific and control sentences in the IC cluster centered in the precentral gyrus and in the cluster centered in the medial part of the occipital lobe, which corresponded well with the functional magnetic resonance imaging findings for Japanese honorification. We also found several significant differences in the time-frequency analyses for the medial occipital cluster. These significant differences in the medial occipital cluster suggested that the circuit of the theory of mind was involved in the processing of Japanese honorification. Our results suggest that pragmatic and syntactic processing are performed in parallel because the person to be respected must fulfill the grammatical function appropriate for the honorific verb.

Predictive coding models of perception postulate that this phenomenon largely reflects the top-down attenuation of prediction errors. Electroencephalography research further demonstrated that repetition effects consist of sequentially ordered attention-independent and attention-dependent components in a context of high periodicity. However, the statistical structure of our auditory environment is richer than that of a fixed pattern. It remains unclear if the attentional modulation of repetition effects can be generalised to a setting which better represents the nature of our auditory environment. Here we used electroencephalography to investigate whether the attention-independent and attention-dependent components of repetition effects previously described in the auditory modality remain in a context of low periodicity where temporary disruption might be absent/present. Participants were presented with repetition trains of various lengths, with/without temporary disruptions. We found attention-independent and attention-dependent repetition effects on, respectively, the P2 and P3a eventrelated potential components. This pattern of results is in line with previous research, confirming that the attenuation of prediction errors upon stimulus repetition is first registered regardless of attentional state before further attenuation of attended but not unattended prediction errors takes place. However, unlike previous reports, these effects manifested on later components. This divergence from previous studies is discussed in terms of the possible contribution of contextual factors.

Combining correlational, experimental, and electroencephalography approaches, we tested the hypothesis that residential mobility may increase loss aversion. The results revealed a positive correlation between residential mobility and loss aversion (Study 1). These effects were moderated by individuals' residential mobility/stability mindsets. Behaviorally, we observed a positive association between residential mobility history and loss aversion among individuals with a high (vs. low) subjective uncertainty after manipulating their residential mobility mindset by priming them with a mobile or stable lifestyle (Study 2). On the neural level, we found that the mindset of residential mobility (vs. stability) enhanced the differential feedback-related negativity (FRN) modulations between the large-win and large-loss conditions among Chinese participants with a high subjective uncertainty (Study 3). In conclusion, residential mobility elevated loss aversion by enhancing feelings of subjective uncertainty. Our findings provide novel insights into how changes in the socioecological environment shape individuals' decision-making bias.

The present study was conducted to show that the dynamic change of underlying mental effort can be further estimated by measuring the strength of theta oscillations at a forehead site on the scalp. Fourteen healthy adults (M-age = 26.1 years) performed a passive listening (PL) task and an auditory digit span (DS) task, and electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded simultaneously during the two tasks. Considering that the digit span paradigm has often been conducted in a non-laboratory location, the EEG data were collected with a wireless single-channel headset system. The headset system was validated in this study by replicating the EEG (an enhancement of frontal theta power) as well as event-related potential (N200 and P300) responses to the deviant tone stimuli in the PL task. The outcomes of the DS task showed that the memory span of the participants was at least eight items. Moreover, frontal theta power in response to a list of six to eight digits increased significantly. This pattern of results supports a hypothesis that additional mental effort is required for short-term retention of verbal items when the number of stimulus items exceeds the newly proposed limit of short-term memory capacity. Some strengths and limitations of the current EEG headset system are also discussed.

When recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG), the MMR is traditionally extracted by subtracting the event-related potential/field (ERP/ERF) elicited in response to "deviant" sounds that occur randomly within a train of repetitive "standard" sounds. To overcome the limitations of this subtraction procedure, we propose a novel method which we call weighted-BSST/K, which uses only the deviant response to derive the MMR. We hypothesized that this novel weighted-BSST/K method highlights responses related to the detection of the deviant stimulus and is more sensitive than independent component analysis (ICA). To test this hypothesis and the validity and efficacy of the weightedB.C.Cr k in comparison with ICA (infomax), we evaluated the methods in 12 healthy adults. Auditory stimuli were presented at a constant rate of 2 Hz. Frequency MMRs at a sensor level were obtained from the bilateral temporal lobes with the subtraction approach at 96-276 ms (the MMR time range), defined on the basis of spatio-temporal cluster permutation analysis. In the application of the weighted-BSST/K, the deviant responses were given a constant weight on the MMR time range. The ERF elicited by the weighted deviant responses demonstrated one or a few dominant components representing the MMR with a high signal-to-noise ratio and similar topography to that of the sensor space analysis using the subtraction approach. In contrast, infomax or weighted-infomax revealed many minor or pseudo components as constituents of the MMR. Our new approach may assist in using the MMR in basic and clinical research.

Moreover, the boundaries of schizophrenia are not precisely demarcated from other nosologic categories, such as bipolar disorder. The early detection of schizophrenia can lead to a more effective treatment, improving patients? quality of life. Over the last decades, hundreds of studies aimed at specifying the neurobiological mechanisms that underpin clinical manifestations of schizophrenia, using techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG). Changes in event-related potentials of the EEG have been associated with sensory and cognitive deficits and proposed as biomarkers of schizophrenia. Besides contributing to a more effective diagnosis, biomarkers can be crucial to schizophrenia onset prediction and prognosis. However, any proposed biomarker requires substantial clinical research to prove its validity and costeffectiveness. Fueled by developments in computational neuroscience, automatic classification of schizophrenia at different stages (prodromal, first episode, chronic) has been attempted, using brain imaging pattern recognition methods to capture differences in functional brain activity. Advanced learning techniques have been studied for this purpose, with promising results. This review provides an overview of recent machine learningbased methods for schizophrenia classification using EEG data, discussing their potentialities and limitations. This review is intended to serve as a starting point for future developments of effective EEG-based models that might predict the onset of schizophrenia, identify subjects at high-risk of psychosis conversion or differentiate schizophrenia from other disorders, promoting more effective early interventions.

Here, we considered the role of memory strength in the discrimination process of such stimuli using a three-phase old/new recognition memory paradigm. Memory strength was manipulated as a function of the levels of processing (deep vs. shallow) and repetition. Behavioral results were matched to brain responses using EEG. We found that correct identification of the new abstract figures and non-words was superior to old item recognition when they were merely studied without repetition, but not when they were semantically processed or drawn. EEG results indicated that successful new item identification was marked by a combination of the absence of familiarity (N400) and recollection (P600) for the studied figures. For both the abstract figures and the non-words, the parietal P600 was found to differentiate between the old and new items (late old/new effects). The present study extends current knowledge on the processing of pre-experimentally unfamiliar figurative and verbal stimuli by showing that their discrimination depends on experimentally induced memory strength and that the underlying brain processes differ. Nevertheless, the P600, similar to pre-experimentally familiar figures and words, likely reflects improved recognition memory of meaningless pictorial and verbal items.

FDG-PET metabolic index of the best preserved hemisphere (MIBH) has been reported as a promising measure of consciousness but has never been externally validated and compared with other brain-imaging diagnostic procedures such as quantitative EEG. Methods: FDG-PET, quantitative EEG and cognitive evoked potential using an auditory oddball paradigm were performed in minimally conscious state (MCS) and vegetative state (VS) patient. We compared out-sample diagnostic and prognostic performances of PET-MIBH and EEG-based classification of conscious state to the current behavioral gold-standard, the Coma Recovery Scale - revised (CRS-R). Results: Between January 2016 and October 2019, 52 patients were included: 21 VS and 31 MCS. PET-MIBH had an AUC of 0.821 [0.694-0.930], sensitivity of 79% [62-91] and specificity of 78% [56-93], not significantly different from EEG (p = 0.628). Their combination accurately identified almost all MCS patients with a sensitivity of 94% [79-99%] and specificity of 67% [43-85]. Multimodal assessment also identified VS patients with neural correlate of consciousness (4/7 (57%) vs. 1/14 (7%), p = 0.025) and patients with 6-month recovery of command-following (9/24 (38%) vs. 0/16 (0%), p = 0.006), outperforming each technique taken in isolation. Conclusion: FDG-PET MIBH is an accurate and robust procedure across sites to diagnose MCS. Its combination with EEG-based classification of conscious state not only optimizes diagnostic performances but also allows to detect covert cognition and to predict 6-month command-following recovery demonstrating the added value of multimodal assessment of DoC.

The Event-Related Potential Evidence of Media Channel and News Type	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						trust in news; media channel; news type; event-related potential; N100; P200	SOFT NEWS; ONLINE; CREDIBILITY; PROFILE	Media is the principal source of public information, and people's trust in news has been a critical mechanism in social cohesion. In recent years, the vast growth of new media (e.g., internet news portals) has brought huge change to the way information is conveyed, cannibalizing much of the space of traditional media (e.g., traditional newspapers). This has led to renewed attention on media credibility. The study aims to explore the impact of media channel on trust in news and examine the role of news type. Twenty-six participants were asked to make trust-distrust decisions after reading a variety of news headlines from different media channels while undergoing electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring. The electrophysiological results showed that, for hard news (e.g., important news related to public life), the new media condition elicited smaller N100 and larger P200 amplitudes than the traditional media condition. However, for soft news (e.g., entertainment, and non-related to vital interest), there was no significant difference. The study suggests that the fitness of media channel and news type may influence the evaluation of news, impacting participants' affective arousal and attention allocation in the early stage and influencing trust in news. These results provide neurocognitive evidence of individuals' trust toward hard and soft news consumed via different media channels, yielding new insights into trust in media and contributing to media trust theory.

Both technical state of the art as well as measures and cognitive concepts are systematically addressed. Background Modern work is increasingly characterized by information processing. Therefore, the examination of mental states, mental load, or cognitive processing during work is becoming increasingly important for ergonomics. Results Mobile EEG allows to measure mental states and processes under real live conditions. It can be used for various research questions in cognitive neuroergonomics. Besides measures in the frequency domain that have a long tradition in the investigation of mental fatigue, task load, and task engagement, new approaches-like blink-evoked potentials-render event-related analyses of the EEG possible also during unrestricted behavior. Conclusion Mobile EEG has become a valuable tool for evaluating mental states and mental processes on a highly objective level during work. The main advantage of this technique is that working environments don't have to be changed while systematically measuring brain functions at work. Moreover, the workflow is unaffected by such neuroergonomic approaches.

The N2pc is a small amplitude transient interhemispheric voltage asymmetry used in cognitive neuroscience to investigate subject's allocation of selective visuo-spatial attention. N2pc is typically estimated by averaging the sweeps of the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal but, in absence of explicit normative indications, the number of sweeps is often based on arbitrariness or personal experience. With the final aim of reducing duration and cost of experimental protocols, here we developed a new approach to reliably predict N2pc amplitude from a minimal EEG dataset. Approach. First, features predictive of N2pc amplitude were identified in the time-frequency domain. Then, an artificial neural network (NN) was trained to predict N2pc mean amplitude at the individual level. By resorting to simulated data, accuracy of the NN was assessed by computing the mean squared error (MSE) and the amplitude discretization error (ADE) and compared to the standard time averaging (TA) technique. The NN was then tested against two real datasets consisting of 14 and 12 subjects, respectively. Main result. In simulated scenarios entailing different number of sweeps (between 10 and 100), the MSE obtained with the proposed method resulted, on average, 1/5 of that obtained with the TA technique. Implementation on real EEG datasets showed that N2pc amplitude could be reliably predicted with as few as 40 EEG sweeps per cell of the experimental design. Significance. The developed approach allows to reduce duration and cost of experiments involving the N2pc, for instance in studies investigating attention deficits in pathological subjects.

However, the neural mechanisms underlying aggression and retaliation remain unclear. Previous studies on social intentions are confounded by a low-level response-related brain activity. Using an Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface combined with the Chicken Game, our study examined the neural dynamics of aggression and retaliation after controlling for nonessential response-related neural signals. Our results show that aggression is associated with reduced alpha event-related desynchronization (alpha-ERD), indicating reduced mental effort. Moreover, retaliation and tit-for-tat strategy use are also linked with smaller alpha-ERD. Our study provides a novel method to minimize motor confounds and demonstrates that choosing aggression and retaliation is less effortful in social conflicts.

The time-locked neurodynamics of semantic processing in autism spectrum disorder: an EEG study	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						Semantic processing; EEG coherence; Autism spectrum disorder; Language	HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ARCUATE FASCICULUS; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; YOUNG-CHILDREN; WHITE-MATTER; LANGUAGE; COHERENCE; BRAIN; CONNECTIVITY	Language processing is often an area of difficulty in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Semantic processing-the ability to add meaning to a stimulus-is thought to be especially affected in ASD. However, the neurological origin of these deficits, both structurally and temporally, have yet to be discovered. To further previous behavioral findings on language differences in ASD, the present study used an implicit semantic priming paradigm and electroencephalography (EEG) to compare the level of theta coherence throughout semantic processing, between typically developing (TD) and ASD participants. Theta coherence is an indication of synchronous EEG oscillations and was of particular interest due to its previous links with semantic processing. Theta coherence was analyzed in response to semantically related or unrelated pairs of words and pictures across bilateral short, medium, and long electrode connections. We found significant results across a variety of conditions, but most notably, we observed reduced coherence for language stimuli in the ASD group at a left fronto-parietal connection from 100 to 300 ms. This replicates previous findings of underconnectivity in left fronto-parietal language networks in ASD. Critically, the early time window of this underconnectivity, from 100 to 300 ms, suggests that impaired semantic processing of language in ASD may arise during pre-semantic processing, during the initial communication between lower-level linguistic processing and higher-level semantic processing. Our results suggest that language processing functions are unique in ASD compared to TD, and that subjects with ASD might rely on a temporally different language processing loop altogether.

Clinical investigation of suicidality can be significantly improved by using standardized scales for assessing suicide risk. The choice of a method for assessing suicidality also has significant implications for the search of valid available biomarker of suicidal behavior, where a less complex suicidality assessment procedure yields inaccurate results. This article offers an overview and analyzes in detail clinical studies of suicidality by electrophysiological methods since 2005 to 5/2020, especially in connection with presumed pathophysiological mechanism of the suicidal brain" and the chosen method of sucidality assessment. Electrophysiological methods such as quantitative electroencephalography indicators, event-related potential, loudness dependence of the auditory evoked potential, polysomnography and heart rate variability offer a robust battery of easily available methods for assessing impaired emotional regulation. Nowadays it is unfortunately very difficult to point out the optimal electrophysiological examination of suicidal behaviour because of conflicting conclusion of presented studies which have been probably caused by various suicidal risk assessments, not always available data on affecting medication prior to testing and small samples of suicidal participants among studies. The most consistent and hopeful results are presented by evaluation of theta power by quantitative electroencephalography, although there are also few conflicting conclusions. The authors of this paper believe that this article could be good starting point for further research of electrophysiological methods in the field of suicidality.

Sedentary time is related to deficits in response inhibition among adults with overweight and obesity: An accelerometry and event-related brain potentials study	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Go; NoGo; obesity; P300; response inhibition; sedentary time	MEASURED PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; NEUROELECTRIC INDEXES; REGRESSION DILUTION; ERP COMPONENTS; UNITED-STATES; IMPULSIVITY; PERFORMANCE; SIGNAL; TASKS	Excessive sedentariness has been related to poorer cognitive control in adults. Sedentariness may compound obesity-related impairments in response inhibition, but its relationship to response inhibition remains poorly understood. This study investigated the relationship between accelerometer-measured sedentary time (ST, min/day), performance on the Oddball and NoGo tasks, N2 and P3-ERP indices of response inhibition and attentional control in 80 adults with overweight and obesity (55 females, M-age = 35.2 +/- 5.8 years, BMI = 32.8 +/- 5.3 kg/m(2)). ST was not related to performance on the Oddball task. However, more sedentary adults had larger P3b amplitude to targets. Higher ST was also related to increased attentional resource allocation during NoGo target and nontarget trials as indicated by higher P3b amplitudes across centroparietal sites (C1, Cz, C2, CP1, CPz, CP2; ps <= .03). ST was negatively indirectly related to target accuracy on NoGo trials through its association with faster response times to nontargets (95% percentile bootstrap CI for a standardized effect: -0.182, -0.014). ST was not related to N2 amplitude on either Oddball or NoGo target trials. Adjustment for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA; all models), age (models with P3b NoGo target amplitude, N2 NoGo target amplitude and latency), and % fat mass (models with target NoGo accuracy and N2 NoGo target amplitude) did not modulate behavioral findings. MVPA did not significantly predict P3b amplitude. Our results suggest suboptimal response inhibition due to trading accuracy for speed and despite the upregulation of attentional resources among more sedentary adults with overweight and obesity.

Comparing physiological responses during cognitive tests in virtual environments vs. in identical real-world environments	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							STROOP INTERFERENCE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; CINGULATE CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; COLOR; ATTENTION; DESIGN; PERCEPTION; SELECTION; DISTANCE	Immersive virtual environments (VEs) are increasingly used to evaluate human responses to design variables. VEs provide a tremendous capacity to isolate and readily adjust specific features of an architectural or product design. They also allow researchers to safely and effectively measure performance factors and physiological responses. However, the success of this form of design-testing depends on the generalizability of response measurements between VEs and real-world contexts. At the current time, there is very limited research evaluating the consistency of human response data across identical real and virtual environments. Rendering tools were used to precisely replicate a real-world classroom in virtual space. Participants were recruited and asked to complete a series of cognitive tests in the real classroom and in the virtual classroom. Physiological data were collected during these tests, including electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), electrooculography (EOG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and head acceleration. Participants' accuracy on the cognitive tests did not significantly differ between the real classroom and the identical VE. However, the participants answered the tests more rapidly in the VE. No significant differences were found in eye blink rate and heart rate between the real and VR settings. Head acceleration and GSR variance were lower in the VE setting. Overall, EEG frequency band-power was not significantly altered between the real-world classroom and the VE. Analysis of EEG event-related potentials likewise indicated strong similarity between the real-world classroom and the VE, with a single exception related to executive functioning in a color-mismatch task.

Deficits in Visual Processing During Hypoxia as Evidenced by Visual Mismatch Negativity	AEROSPACE MEDICINE AND HUMAN PERFORMANCE			English	Article						hypoxia; event-related potentials; mismatch negativity; visual processing	HYPOBARIC HYPOXIA; REACTION-TIME; EEG CHANGES; MMN	INTRODUCTION: Hypoxia is an ever-present threat in tactical aviation and gained recent attention due to its putative role in physiological episodes. Previous work has demonstrated that hypoxia negatively impacts a variety of sensory, cognitive, and motor systems. In particular, the visual system is one of the earliest systems affected by hypoxia. While the majority of previous studies have relied on self-report and behavioral testing, the use of event-related potentials as a novel tool to monitor responses to low oxygen in humans has recently been investigated. Specifically, ERP components that are evoked passively in response to unattended changes in background sensory stimulation have been explored. METHOD: Subjects (N = 28) completed a continuous visuomotor tracking task while EEG was recorded. During the tracking task, a series of "standard"color checkerboard patterns were presented in the periphery while occasionally a"deviant" color checkerboard was presented. The visual mismatch negativity (MMN) component was assessed in response to the deviant compared to the standard stimuli. Subjects completed two sessions in counterbalanced order that only differed by the oxygen concentration breathed (10.6% vs. 20.4%). RESULTS: Results demonstrated a significant reduction in the amplitude of the visual MMN under hypoxic compared to normoxic conditions, showing a 50% reduction in amplitude during hypoxia. Our results suggest that during low-oxygen exposure the ability to detect environmental changes and process sensory information is impaired. DISCUSSION: The visual MMN may represent an early and reliable predictor of sensory and cognitive deficits during hypoxia exposure, which may be of great use to the aviation community.

J	Brismar, T; Cooray, G; Sundgren, M; Hyllienmark, L				Brismar, Tom; Cooray, Gerald; Sundgren, Mathias; Hyllienmark, Lars			On the physiology of cognitive decline in type 1 diabetes	NEUROPHYSIOLOGIE CLINIQUE-CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Diabetes mellitus type 1; Cognition; Cognitive impairment; Psychomotor speed; Evoked potential; EEG; Human	PERFORMANCE; IMPAIRMENT; POTENTIALS; CHILDREN; EEG	Objectives. - Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) may be associated with cognitive impairment and notably a decline in psychomotor speed, information processing speed and attention. The mechanism for this decline is uncertain. Previous studies by our group and others have demonstrated a decline in EEG-power and event-related potential amplitude in T1DM. The objectives of the present study were to explore whether 1) the association between event-related potential (N100) amplitude and psychomotor speed is different between T1DM and healthy subjects, and 2) the decline in N100 amplitude depends on duration of diabetes. Methods. - Patients with T1DM (N = 204) and healthy control subjects (N = 358) were included in a cross-sectional study. Event-related brain potentials were recorded with auditory reaction tasks. Psychomotor speed was evaluated with the Grooved Pegboard test in a subset of the patients (N = 70) and the healthy control subjects (N = 89). Results. - Patients with T1DM had a decrease in the N100 amplitude that correlated with a decline in psychomotor speed, longer duration of diabetes and increasing age. In healthy controls, the N100 amplitude did not decrease with age and the association between psychomotor speed and N100 amplitude was absent. Conclusion. - The association between psychomotor speed and N100 amplitude is likely to be a specific trait for T1DM since it was not found in healthy controls and was dependent on diabetes duration. Our findings indicate that the pathogenesis of cognitive decline in T1DM may involve a disease-related factor with a long-term influence on the N100 amplitude. (C) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

J	Gagnon, ME; Labbe, AP; Blanchette, I				Gagnon, Marie-Eve; Labbe, Annie-Pier; Blanchette, Isabelle			Exploring the mechanisms responsible for the modulating role of frowning in emotional reasoning: An ERP study	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Reasoning; Emotion; Facial expression; Event-related potentials	CONFLICT; COMPONENT; GO	Studies show that emotions impact reasoning, and that emotions are embodied. A recent study revealed that emotions embodied in facial expressions can modulate the impact of emotional content on reasoning accuracy. In the current study, we aimed to explore the mechanisms responsible for the impact of frowning on emotional reasoning using electrophysiology. We examined two reasoning-related ERPs: the N400 related to inference process and the N2 related to conflict detection. We also measured the LPP, associated with sustained attention to emotional stimuli. Twenty-six participants completed a reasoning task with emotional content while we recorded their brain activity with electroencephalography. In one block, they were instructed to solve syllogisms while voluntarily frowning. In another block, they were asked to solve syllogisms while contracting a non-facial muscle. Results revealed that frowning influenced sustained attention towards emotional stimuli, as measured through LPP. Frowning also showed a trend for a deleterious effect on the inference process measured through the N400. In line with the dual process models, this suggests that frowning impacts sustained attention, but surprisingly it might also impact Type 2 processes. This study provides useful insight regarding the link between reasoning and emotions in the body.

Considering that functional lateralization can be affected by handedness, spinal and cerebral pain-related responses may be different between right- and left-handed individuals. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the cortical and spinal mechanisms of nociceptive integration when nociceptive stimuli are applied to right -handed vs. left -handed individuals. The NFR, evoked potentials (ERP: P45, N100, P260), and event-related spectral perturbations (ERSP: theta, alpha, beta and gamma band oscillations) were compared between ten right-handed and ten left-handed participants. Pain was induced by transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the lower limbs and left upper limb. Stimulation intensity was adjusted individually in five counterbalanced conditions of 21 stimuli each: three unilateral (right lower limb, left lower limb, and left upper limb stimulation) and two bilateral conditions (right and left lower limbs, and the right lower limb and left upper limb stimulation). The amplitude of the NFR, ERP, ERSP, and pain ratings were compared between groups and conditions using a mixed ANOVA. A significant increase of responses was observed in bilateral compared with unilateral conditions for pain intensity, NFR amplitude, N100, theta oscillations, and gamma oscillations. However, these effects were not significantly different between right- and left-handed individuals. These results suggest that spinal and cerebral integration of bilateral nociceptive inputs is similar between right- and left-handed individuals. They also imply that pain-related responses measured in this study may be examined independently of handedness.

Investigating Cortical Buffering Effects of Acute Moderate Intensity Exercise: A cTBS Study Targeting the Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						TBS; rTMS (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation); exercise; DLPFC (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex); cortex; health	THETA-BURST STIMULATION; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; AEROBIC EXERCISE; WORKING-MEMORY; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; ACUTE STRESS	Background: The beneficial effects of both single-session bouts of aerobic exercise and therapeutic exercise interventions on the cortical regions associated with top-down attentional control [i.e., prefrontal cortex (PFC)] have been well documented. However, it remains unclear whether aerobic exercise can be used to buffer against suppressive influences on the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC).</p> Objective: The current study sought to determine whether a single session of moderate intensity aerobic exercise can offset the expected suppressive effects of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC).</p> Methods: Twenty-two right-handed participants (aged 19-30) completed a 20-minute movement-only control session [10% heart rate reserve (HRR)] and moderate intensity (50% HRR) exercise in a counterbalanced order. Following each exercise session, participants received active cTBS to the left dlPFC. Changes in executive functions were quantified using a Flanker paradigm employed at baseline, post-exercise and post-cTBS time points. Additionally, EEG was used to measure changes in event-related potential components related to inhibitory control (i.e., N2) and attentional control (i.e., P3) during the flanker task.</p> Results: Behavioral results from the flanker task revealed a significant improvement in task performance following an acute bout of moderate intensity exercise. Furthermore, the effect of cTBS in both the movement-only control and moderate intensity conditions were non-significant. Similarly, EEG data from P3b and N2 ERP components revealed no changes to amplitude across time and condition. P3b latency data revealed a significant effect of time in both the moderate intensity and movement-only conditions, such that P3b latencies were significantly shorter across time points. Latency data within the N2 ERP component revealed no significant interactions or main effects.</p> Conclusion: The findings of the current study provide tentative support for the hypothesis that both moderate and light intensity exercise promote cortical buffering against the suppressive effects of cTBS targeting the dlPFC. However, in the absence of a no-movement control, a lack of expected suppressive effects of cTBS cannot be ruled out.</p>	[Manocchio, Felicia] Univ Waterloo, Sch Publ Hlth Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Lowe, Cassandra J.] Western Univ, Brain & Mind Inst, London, ON, Canada; [Lowe, Cassandra J.] Western Univ, Dept Psychol, London, ON, Canada		Lowe, CJ (corresponding author), Western Univ, Brain & Mind Inst, London, ON, Canada.; Lowe, CJ (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Psychol, London, ON, Canada.	clowe3@uwo.ca			Canada First Research Fund Initiative BrainsCAN	Canada First Research Fund Initiative BrainsCAN	CL receives funding from the Canada First Research Fund Initiative BrainsCAN.

Problematic smartphone use is consistently associated with increased levels of depression and lower selfcontrol, and pathological technology use more generally may be associated with reduced activity in the reward system, an effect that is also observed in depression and with poor self-control. The current study sought to examine the association between problematic smartphone use and event-related potentials (ERPs) related to reward processing, and to determine whether reward processing, depressive symptoms and self-control have shared or unique influences on problematic smartphone use. The sample was drawn from a university student population (N = 94, age M = 19.34, SD = 1.23 years, 67 female, 25 male, 1 gender non-conforming, 1 unidentified). Participants performed a gambling task while EEG was recorded and completed measures of smartphone pathology, depressive symptoms and self-control. The ERP data revealed that increasing problematic smartphone use was associated with reduced ERP amplitude for gains and losses when individuals were the agent of choice, but not when the computer chose. This may reflect a selective association between problematic smartphone use and neural prediction errors. Regression analyses revealed that reward processing, depressive symptoms and self-control were predictors of problematic smartphone use, possibly revealing multiple pathways to problematic smartphone use.

Switch and mixing effects are associated with increased power in broad frontoparietal networks, typically stronger in the theta band (similar to 4-8 Hz). However, it is not yet known whether mixing and switch costs rely upon common or distinct networks. In this study, we examine proactive and reactive control networks linked to task switching and mixing effects, and whether strength of connectivity in these networks is associated with behavioural outcomes. Participants (n = 197) completed a cued-trials task-switching paradigm with concurrent electroencephalography, after substantial task practice to establish strong cue-stimulus-response representations. We used inter-site phase clustering, a measure of functional connectivity across electrode sites, to establish cross-site connectivity from a frontal and a parietal seed. Distinct theta networks were activated during proactive and reactive control periods. During the preparation interval, mixing effects were associated with connectivity from the frontal seed to parietal sites, and switch effects with connectivity from the parietal seed to occipital sites. Lateralised occipital connectivity was common to both switch and mixing effects. After target onset, frontal and parietal seeds showed a similar pattern of connectivity across trial types. These findings are consistent with distinct and common proactive control networks and common reactive networks in highly practised task-switching performers.

J	Pomiechowska, B; Gliga, T				Pomiechowska, Barbara; Gliga, Teodora			Nonverbal category knowledge limits the amount of information encoded in object representations: EEG evidence from 12-month-old infants	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE			English	Article						cognition; object representation; language; EEG; infancy		To what extent does language shape how we think about the world? Studies suggest that linguistic symbols expressing conceptual categories ('apple', 'squirrel') make us focus on categorical information (e.g. that you saw a squirrel) and disregard individual information (e.g. whether that squirrel had a long or short tail). Across two experiments with preverbal infants, we demonstrated that it is not language but nonverbal category knowledge that determines what information is packed into object representations. Twelve-month-olds (N = 48) participated in an electroencephalography (EEG) change-detection task involving objects undergoing a brief occlusion. When viewing objects from unfamiliar categories, infants detected both across- and within-category changes, as evidenced by their negative central wave (Nc) event-related potential. Conversely, when viewing objects from familiar categories, they did not respond to within-category changes, which indicates that nonverbal category knowledge interfered with the representation of individual surface features necessary to detect such changes. Furthermore, distinct patterns of gamma and alpha oscillations between familiar and unfamiliar categories were evident before and during occlusion, suggesting that categorization had an influence on the format of recruited object representations. Thus, we show that nonverbal category knowledge has rapid and enduring effects on object representation and discuss their functional significance for generic knowledge acquisition in the absence of language.

In this scenario, the behaviors of the sensory motor rhythms and the brain connectivity present themselves as sources of information that can contribute to interpreting the cortical effect of these technologies. This study aims to analyze how sensory motor rhythms and cortical connectivity behave when volunteers command reactive motor imagery (MI) BCI that provides passive pedaling feedback. We studied 8 healthy subjects who performed pedaling MI to command an electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCI with a motorized pedal to receive passive movements as feedback. The EEG data were analyzed under the following four conditions: resting, MI calibration, MI online, and receiving passive pedaling (on-line phase). Most subjects produced, over the foot area, significant event-related desynchronization (ERD) patterns around Cz when performing MI and receiving passive pedaling. The sharpest decrease was found for the low beta band. The connectivity results revealed an exchange of information between the supplementary motor area (SMA) and parietal regions during MI and passive pedaling. Our findings point to the primary motor cortex activation for most participants and the connectivity between SMA and parietal regions during pedaling MI and passive pedaling.

Closed-loop EEG study on visual recognition during driving	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain&#8211; computer interfaces; electroencephalography; eye tracking; driving; visual recognition	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; FIXATION-RELATED POTENTIALS; SEARCH; P300; TARGET; SIGNAL; TIME; P3A; BCI	Objective. In contrast to the classical visual brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigms, which adhere to a rigid trial structure and restricted user behavior, electroencephalogram (EEG)-based visual recognition decoding during our daily activities remains challenging. The objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of decoding the EEG signature of visual recognition in experimental conditions promoting our natural ocular behavior when interacting with our dynamic environment. Approach. In our experiment, subjects visually search for a target object among suddenly appearing objects in the environment while driving a car-simulator. Given that subjects exhibit an unconstrained overt visual behavior, we based our study on eye fixation-related potentials (EFRPs). We report on gaze behavior and single-trial EFRP decoding performance (fixations on visually similar target vs. non-target objects). In addition, we demonstrate the application of our approach in a closed-loop BCI setup. Main results. To identify the target out of four symbol types along a road segment, the BCI system integrated decoding probabilities of multiple EFRP and achieved the average online accuracy of 0.37 +/- 0.06 (12 subjects), statistically significantly above the chance level. Using the acquired data, we performed a comparative study of classification algorithms (discriminating target vs. non-target) and feature spaces in a simulated online scenario. The EEG approaches yielded similar moderate performances of at most 0.6 AUC, yet statistically significantly above the chance level. In addition, the gaze duration (dwell time) appears to be an additional informative feature in this context. Significance. These results show that visual recognition of sudden events can be decoded during active driving. Therefore, this study lays a foundation for assistive and recommender systems based on the driver's brain signals.

However, current guidelines and checklists appear to have limited adoption, as systematic reviews have shown the journal article format is highly prone to errors, ambiguities and omissions of methodological details. This is a problem for transparency in the scientific record, along with reproducibility and metascience. Following lessons learned in the high complexity fields of aviation and surgery, we conclude that new tools are needed to overcome the limitations of written methodology descriptions, and that these tools should be developed through community consultation to ensure that they have the most utility for EEG stakeholders. As a first step in tool development, we present the ARTEM-IS Statement describing what action will be needed to create an Agreed Reporting Template for Electroencephalography Methodology - International Standard (ARTEM-IS), along with ARTEM-IS Design Guidelines for developing tools that use an evidence-based approach to error reduction. We first launched the statement at the LiveMEEG conference in 2020 along with a draft of an ARTEM-IS template for public consultation. Members of the EEG community are invited to join this collective effort to create evidencebased tools that will help make the process of reporting methodology intuitive to complete and foolproof by design.

This electroencephalography study further examined whether and how musical expertise affects high-level predictive semantic processing in speech comprehension. Musicians and non-musicians listened to semantically strongly/weakly constraining sentences, with each sentence being primed by a congruent/incongruent sentence-prosody. At the target nouns, a N400 reduction effect (strongly vs. weakly constraining) was observed in both groups, with the onset-latency of this effect being delayed for incongruent (vs. congruent) priming. At the transitive verbs preceding these target nouns, musicians' event-related-potential amplitude (in incongruent-priming) and beta-band oscillatory power (in congruent- and incongruent-priming) showed a semantic-constraint effect, and were correlated with the predictability of incoming nouns; non-musicians only demonstrated an event-related-potential semantic-constraint effect, which was correlated with the predictability of current verbs. These results indicate musical expertise enhances semantic prediction tendency in speech comprehension, and this effect might be not just an aftereffect of facilitated acoustic/phonological processing.

J	Feldmann-Wustefeld, T				Feldmann-Wustefeld, Tobias			Neural evidence for dynamic within-trial changes in allocation of visual attention	VISUAL COGNITION			English	Article						Visual attention; suppression; N2pc; Pd; EEG	CAPTURE; SEARCH; TRACKING	In their article "Progress toward resolving the attentional capture debate", Luck et al. (2021. Progress toward resolving the attentional capture debate. Visual Cognition, 29(1), 1-21.) aim at reconciling stimulus-driven, goal-driven and signal suppression accounts of visual attention. At the center of their model is a "control state" that determines activations on a priority map and thus under which circumstances a stimulus captures attention or can be suppressed. In this commentary I will outline neural evidence that suggests that various factors simultaneously affect the control state and that speak against a dichotomy of "attentional capture versus suppression." For example, EEG studies using event-related potentials (ERPs) suggest that attention can be captured without suppression, that suppression can be applied reactively as a response to capture, and suppression can be proactively applied to prevent capture. ERP results furthermore suggest that different degrees of attentional enhancement and suppression are applied to stimuli and that attentional subprocesses are interdependent. This indicates that the priority map can change dynamically within a trial, and behavioral effects may be a snapshot of a specific distribution of resources on the priority map at a particular moment. I suggest that EEG measures can be used to quantify the relative contribution of attentional factors to determine attention deployment under those circumstances.

An ERP study	PSYCH JOURNAL			English	Article						emotional prosody; event-related potential (ERP); mismatch negativity (MMN); P3a; participant's own name	SUBJECTS OWN NAME; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; SEX-DIFFERENCES; TIME-COURSE; ATTENTION; BRAIN; MECHANISMS; VOICE; RECOGNITION	In this study, we investigated whether self-relevant information can accelerate the processing of emotional information. Our experiment, based on a passive auditory oddball paradigm, involved recording electroencephalography while participants listened to stimuli comprising their own names (ONs) and unfamiliar names (UNs) spoken with varying emotional prosody. At 220-300 ms, mismatch negativity (MMN) was more negative for ONs and angry prosody than for UNs and neutral prosody, respectively. These results suggest that attention is involuntarily attracted by ONs and emotional prosody, and that both types of information are given priority processing, even under pre-attentive conditions. Importantly, ONs with angry prosody induced more negative MMN than did similar UNs and ONs with neutral prosody, which indicates that the motivational significance embedded in angry prosody promotes the self-reference effect and, thus, involves more attention resources. At 300-500 ms, ONs triggered smaller P3a than did UNs, suggesting that less cognitive resources are required to process self-relevant information. These results suggest that self-relevant and emotional information of preferential processing interact with each other during the pre-attentive stage, with self-reference enhancing the processing of emotional information.

Baseline corrected power of scalp current density transformed EEG was statistically assessed with cluster-based permutation testing. Delta and theta activities revealed differences in their spatial properties at the time of finger tapping execution. Theta synchronization showed a contralateral double activation in the parietal and fronto-central regions, while delta activity appeared in the central contralateral channels. Differences in the spatiotemporal topography between delta and theta activity in the course of movement execution were identified on high density EEG.

Nevertheless, previous work showed that applying this straight reasoning does not always lead to the desired results at behavioural level. Here, we investigated electrophysiological markers of AtDCS-mediated effects on visuo-spatial contextual learning (VSCL). In order to assess cortical excitability changes after 3 mA AtDCS applied over posterior parietal cortex, event-related potentials (ERPs) were collected during task performance. Additionally, AtDCS-induced effects on cortical excitability were explored by measuring TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) collected before AtDCS, after AtDCS and after AtDCS and VSCL interaction. Behavioural results revealed that the application of AtDCS induced a reduction of VSCL. At the electrophysiological level, ERPs showed enhanced cortical response (P2 component) in the group receiving Real-AtDCS as compared to Sham-AtDCS. Cortical responsiveness at rest as measured by TEP, did not indicate any significant difference between Real- and Sham-tDCS groups, albeit a trend was present. Overall, our results suggest that AtDCS increases cortical response to incoming visuo-spatial stimuli, but with no concurrent increase in learning. Detrimental effects on behaviour could result from the interaction between AtDCS- and task-mediated cortical activation. This interaction might enhance cortical excitability and hinder normal task-related neuroplastic phenomena subtending learning.

In EEG, inverted faces are often reported to evoke an enhanced amplitude and delayed latency of the N170 ERP. This response has been attributed to the indexing of specialized face processing mechanisms within the brain. However, inspection of the literature revealed that, although N170 is consistently delayed to a variety of face representations, only photographed faces invoke enhanced N170 amplitudes upon inversion. This suggests that the increased N170 amplitudes to inverted faces may have other origins than the inversion of the face's structure. We hypothesize that the unique N170 amplitude response to inverted photographed faces stems from multiple expectation violations, over and above structural inversion. For instance, rotating an image of a face upside-down not only violates the expectation that faces appear upright but also lifelong priors about illumination and gravity. We recorded EEG while participants viewed face stimuli (upright vs. inverted), where the faces were illuminated from above versus below, and where the models were photographed upright versus hanging upside-down. The N170 amplitudes were found to be modulated by a complex interaction between orientation, lighting, and gravity factors, with the amplitudes largest when faces consistently violated all three expectations. These results confirm our hypothesis that face inversion effects on N170 amplitudes are driven by a violation of the viewer's expectations across several parameters that characterize faces, rather than a disruption in the configurational disposition of its features.

Twenty-four participants were required to decide whether to accept the extension of one brand (stimulus 1) to a certain product category (stimulus 2) in a 2 familiarity x 2 category paradigm. Stimulus 1 consisted of household appliance brands that had different degrees of familiarity (high familiarity vs. low familiarity) to a certain participant, and stimulus 2 consisted of two categories of products (high conflict vs. low conflict). Twenty-two sets of valid data were used for data analysis. We found greater N270 amplitudes in the low-familiarity brand condition and in the high-conflict product category condition, which meant that the participants had to devote more cognitive resources when the brand was less familiar and felt more conflict when the brand was extended to the high-conflict product category. According to the time-frequency analysis results, brand familiarity and product category were found to have a significant effect on the amplitude of theta-band power (4-7.5 Hz) at frontal electrodes in the time period of 270 & minus;340 ms. This result indicated that the activity of individual nodes of the language processing networks increased when the extension product category was mismatched with respect to the brand name and that the related memory of the brand was activated and the long-term memory was extracted when the participants faced the high-familiarity brand extension. The study provides an insightful view of how brand familiarity and category influence consumers' cognitive processes regarding brand extension. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. and Japan Neuroscience Society.

However, the short calibration time can cause the problems, such as small training data, the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio of event-related potentials (ERPs), and inter-trial variability of ERPs, which will increase classification difficulty. In this work, a novel convolution network of multi-windows spatial-temporal features analysis was proposed to alleviate the temporal variability and improve the classification performance for single-trial EEG data. According to the phase-locked information of ERPs, the single-trial was split as the input of the network using the sliding window method. The network adopted three depthwise convolution layers to learn the spatiotemporal features in different windows. The separable convolution was utilized to extract the global features of all windows. Compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms using RSVP datasets of 12 subjects, the proposed network had better classification performance and the online application potential of RSVP-BCI.

This undisclosed analytic flexibility is particularly relevant in EEG research, where a myriad of preprocessing and analysis pipelines can be used to extract information from complex multidimensional data. One solution to limit confirmation and hindsight bias by disclosing analytic choices is preregistration: researchers write a time-stamped, publicly accessible research plan with hypotheses, data collection plan, and the intended preprocessing and statistical analyses before the start of a research project. In this manuscript, we present an overview of the problems associated with undisclosed analytic flexibility, discuss why and how EEG researchers would benefit from adopting preregistration, provide guidelines and examples on how to preregister data preprocessing and analysis steps in typical ERP studies, and conclude by discussing possibilities and limitations of this open science practice.

Furthermore, when compared with printed words, lexical effects (e.g., word-frequency effect) are magnified for less intelligible (difficult) handwriting (Barnhart and Goldinger, 2010; Perea et al., 2016). This boost has been interpreted in terms of greater influence of top-down mechanisms during visual word recognition. In the present experiment, we registered the participants' ERPs to uncover top-down processing effects on early perceptual encoding. Participants' behavioral and EEG responses were recorded to high- and low-frequency words that varied in script's legibility (printed, easy handwritten, difficult handwritten) in a lexical decision experiment. Behavioral results replicated previous findings: word-frequency effects were larger in difficult handwriting than in easy handwritten or printed conditions. Critically, the ERP data showed an early effect of word-frequency in the N170 that was restricted to the difficult-to-read handwritten condition. These results are interpreted in terms of increased attentional deployment when the bottom-up signal is weak (difficult handwritten stimuli). This attentional boost would enhance top-down effects (e.g., lexical effects) in the early stages of visual word processing.

However, these distinctions remain debated at both behavioral and neurophysiological levels, not least due to confounds related to diverging experimental settings. Furthermore, the neural dynamics underpinning these two putative processes remain poorly understood. To tackle this, we designed a paradigm presenting 20 new spoken words in association with pictures in either FM or EE settings, closely matched for auditory and visual features and overall task demands. We tested word acquisition using a range of behavioral measures as well as passive event-related potential (ERP) responses, an established measure of word memory trace activation, and compared brain activity elicited by novel FM and EE words before and after the learning session. Behavioral data obtained in free recall, recognition and semantic word-picture matching tasks indicated successful acquisition of new words after just 10 exposures. Crucially, we found no behavioral evidence of different acquisition outcomes between FM and EE learning. ERP data, which exhibited the main response peaks at similar to 170, 250, and 520 ms, also indicated successful learning, with statistically different responses between novel and familiar words present only before, but not after the training, suggesting rapid formation of new neural memory circuits matching in activation those for previously known words. Furthermore, already at the earliest peak, we found different topographic distributions for the two learning types, with left-lateralized FM dynamics, suggestive of core language system involvement, and more diffuse activity for EE items, possibly suggesting the role of attention/executive control network. A similar effect also manifested later, at similar to 520 ms. Our data suggest that while both EE and FM learning can be successful for rapid word acquisition at the behavioral level, the diverging electrophysiological patterns suggest a dissociation between the neural systems underpinning these learning strategies.

We compared free action selection with instructed action, where the movement type was externally cued, in order to investigate the action selection and action representation in a Libet's task. Temporal and spatial locus of these processes was examined using the combination of high-density electroencephalography, topographic analysis of variance, and source reconstruction. Instructed action, engaging representation of the response movement, was associated with distinct negativity at the parietal and centroparietal channels starting around 750 ms before the movement, which has a source particularly in the bilateral inferior parietal lobule. This suggests that in delayed-action tasks, the process of action representation in the inferior parietal lobule may play an important part in the larger parieto-frontal activity responsible for movement selection.

This paper is divided into two main parts, i.e., diagnosis and prognosis, each consisting of three subsections, namely, (i) resting-state EEG, including spectral power, functional connectivity, dynamic functional connectivity, graph theory, microstates and nonlinear measurements, (ii) sleep patterns, including rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, slow-wave sleep and sleep spindles and (iii) evoked potentials, including the P300, mismatch negativity, the N100, the N400 late positive component and others. Finally, we summarize our findings and conclude that QEEG is a useful tool when it comes to defining the diagnosis and prognosis of DOC patients.

Inhibitory Control Elicited by Physical Activity and Inactivity Stimuli: An Electroencephalography Study	MOTIVATION SCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography; response inhibition; go; no-go; energetic cost minimization; physical activity	EXERCISE; SYSTEM; ERP; RELIABILITY; GUIDELINES; MODEL	The theory of effort minimization in physical activity argues that individuals have an automatic attraction toward effort minimization. To engage in a physically active behavior, this automatic attraction needs to be overridden by controlled processes. However, direct evidence showing that inhibitory control is required to avoid effort minimization is lacking. Here, we used go/no-go tasks and electroencephalography to assess the neural correlates of inhibitory control associated with visual stimuli depicting physical inactivity or physical activity, or depicting control stimuli in 50 healthy young adults. The N2 event-related potential component amplitude was used as a physiological index of inhibitory control. Results showed significant two-way interactions between the type of trials (i.e., go vs. no-go trials) and the type of stimuli on N2, revealing a significantly more pronounced no-go effect (i.e., higher N2 in no-go relative to go trials) for control and physical inactivity stimuli compared with physical activity stimuli. Simple tests further revealed that N2 amplitude was more negative in no-go than go trials for control stimuli (b = -.91 mu V, 95% CI = -1.42 to -.40 mu V, p < .001) and for stimuli depicting physical inactivity (b = -.58 mu V, 95% CI = -1.08 to -.08 mu V, p = .025). By contrast, we found no evidence of significant differences in N2 amplitude between no-go and go trials for stimuli depicting physical activity (b = .20 mu V, 95% CI = -.31 to .70 mu V, p = .445). These findings suggest that inhibiting responses to physical inactivity stimuli requires significantly higher inhibitory control than inhibiting responses to physical activity stimuli.

Predicting cognitive load from raw electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings remains a challenge because of the high degree of noise due to technical variations in the recording process and the multi-factorial nature of the mapping between the EEG data and cognitive load. We present parameter optimized deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models in predicting cognitive load and address issues related to noise, data representation, and a small number of samples. We reduce the noise by computing event-related potential (ERP) from raw data. We transform time-series signal into a spatial-spectral representation called Topomap, which maintains both spatial (electrode location) and spectral (frequency) information embedded in EEG recordings. We developed an eigenspace-based bootstrap sampling technique to generate enough samples to train deep CNN models. We use two different strategies to predict four different levels of cognitive load. First, we use power spectral densities of three individual frequency bands (Theta, Alpha, Beta) of the encoding period to create a spatial-spectral representation called topomap. Second, we combine all three bands to develop a composite topomap to compare the predictive power of individual and composite representation. We implement parameter-optimized CNN models to learn the mapping between spectral-spatial information and cognitive load for both individual and composite topomap. We performed Empirical evaluations to determine the role of different frequency bands in predicting four cognitive load levels. The prediction accuracy of CNN models built using Theta, Alpha, Beta bands, and composite representation are 86%, 85%, 88%, 90% respectively. The results suggest that the Beta band has the most predictive power and composite representation produces higher accuracy than the individual frequency bands.

A visual mismatch-negativity study	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Oddball presentation; Categorization; Event-related potentials (ERP); EEG; Reflection and rotation sets; Bayesian statistics	ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; PERCEPTUAL ORGANIZATION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY; TASK; GOODNESS; PATTERN; MMN; DISTRACTION; LANGUAGE	Perceptual categorization is an important cognitive function. In the auditory domain, categorization already occurs within the first 200 ms of information processing, as indexed by the mismatch negativity. Here, we assessed the characteristics of the visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) elicited during the categorization of previously unknown visual stimuli. To examine this, we used five-dot patterns with characteristics that allow for the formation of categories through rotation and reflection but not through other physical properties. To assess whether or not between-category and within-category vMMN differ in amplitude, the data was analyzed with the Bayesian approach. We observed that both between-category and within-category deviants elicited a vMMN, but that both vMMNs were comparable in magnitude. This finding suggests that abstract categorical representations are not always automatically processed at early visual stages and demonstrates limitations of generalization from the auditory domain to visual domain.

We measured the MMN using 128-channel EEG longitudinally (2-5 timepoints) in 60 ALS patients and cross-sectionally in 62 healthy controls. Using dipole fitting and linearly constrained minimum variance beamforming we investigated cortical source activity changes over time. In ALS, the inferior frontal gyri (IFG) show significantly lower baseline activity compared to controls. The right IFG and both superior temporal gyri (STG) become progressively hyperactive longitudinally. By contrast, the left motor and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices are initially hyperactive, declining progressively. Baseline motor hyperactivity correlates with cognitive disinhibition, and lower baseline IFG activities correlate with motor decline rate, while left dorsolateral prefrontal activity predicted cognitive and behavioural impairment. Shorter survival correlates with reduced baseline IFG and STG activity and later STG hyperactivation. Source-resolved EEG facilitates quantitative characterization of symptom-associated and symptom-preceding motor and cognitive-behavioral cortical network decline in ALS. (c) 2021 The Authors.

However, the neural mechanism of interruption has yet to be understood clearly, and previous studies have largely ignored the role of fatigue state. To address these issues, the present study explores the behavioral and electrophysiological effects of interruption on WM performance using electroencephalography (EEG) data. The moderating effect of fatigue is also explored. The participants performed spatial 2-back tasks with math task interruption, suspension interruption, and non-interruption under different fatigue states. The results show that interruption led to increased alpha activity and P300 amplitude, indicating inhibitory control to interference from irrelevant information. Analysis of P200 amplitude revealed that interruption affected attentional reallocation when resuming the primary task. Increased theta power indicated an increased demand for information maintenance during the interruption. A speeding-up effect was discovered after interruption; however, fatigue impaired cognitive ability and further exacerbated the negative effects of interruption on WM and behavioral performance. These findings contribute to a better understanding of cognitive activity during the interruption and of the interaction with fatigue, and provide further support for the theory of memory for goals (MFG).

Evidence from behavioral and ERP measures	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Numerical surface forms; Strategy execution; Subtraction; Event-related potential	ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; NUMBER; INFORMATION; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; CHOICE; TASK	In this study, to investigate the influence of numerical surface forms on strategy execution in subtraction and addition, 25 college students were required to perform a mental arithmetic task. Behavioral and electroencephalography responses were recorded to explore the stages of strategy execution. Arithmetic problems were presented within 11-20 by Arabic, Chinese and English numerals, respectively. The results showed that, compared with Arabic and Chinese numerals, participants had longer RTs under the condition of English numerals. English numerals induced stronger N100, P200 and P300 amplitudes, and longer latency in P200 and P300 amplitudes than in other conditions. These findings indicated that numerical surface forms affected the execution of mental arithmetic strategies, with Chinese and English numerals being processed deeper in the brain. Especially, the English digital word form occupied more psychological resources, and it was activated more in the frontal area and the parietal area, which would obviously hinder the processing of arithmetic information.

Notwithstanding, it remains uncertain if only the most expected word is anticipated, as postulated by the serial graded hypothesis, or if all probable words are pre-activated, as proposed by the parallel probabilistic hypothesis. To test these contrasting accounts, we compared the processing of expected and unexpected words with second-best words, i.e. the second most expected word in a sentence. The results, from 30 participants, revealed a graded facilitation effect for the expected words, indexed by the N400 mean amplitude, which was the least negative for the most expected words, intermediate for second-best words, and most negative for unexpected words. The Post-N400 Positivity analysis did not reveal any significant effects. The facilitation effect found for the most expected and second-best words suggests that readers can pre-activate multiple candidates during sentence comprehension.

The aim is to investigate how differences in personality might affect morphosyntactic processing and whether it may be affected by social presence. In a correctness judgement task, participants read sentences that were correct or contained a morphosyntactic error, either while alone or in the mere presence of a confederate. Participants' NEO-FFI personality inventory scores were used to analyse behavioural, and event related potential data. Neuroticism and Extraversion interacted with error rate and reaction time, while Conscientiousness only interacted with reaction time. A weak N400-like component to morphosyntactic anomalies was triggered for introverts in the social presence condition, compared to a LAN in the alone one, while a LAN was triggered in both conditions for extraverts. Whereas higher Conscientiousness was related to a stronger LAN and a weaker P600 component, lower Conscientiousness reflected the opposite pattern.

J	Zhou, WJ; Deng, LQ; Ding, JH				Zhou Wenjie; Deng Liqun; Ding Jinhong			Neural mechanism underlying the effects of object color on episodic memory	ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						color diagnosticity; episodic memory; ERPs; familiarity; recollection	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; REAL-WORLD OBJECTS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; SURFACE COLOR; FEATURE BINDING; BRAIN POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY; FAMILIARITY; RECOLLECTION; ERP	Color diagnosticity is the degree to which a color is associated with or symbolizes a particular object. Typical color is often associated with high color diagnostic objects and activates the visual (perceptual) or semantic (conceptual) knowledge in long-term memory. However, the relationship between different processing levels (perceptual and conceptual) of object color information and episodic memory retrieval components (familiarity and recollection) remains poorly understood. It is hypothesized that color information can facilitate memory encoding at the perceptual level but inhibit it at the conceptual level. In recognition retrieval, color has a greater impact on familiarity and recollection at the perceptual level, while at the conceptual level, recollection is more affected than familiarity. In the present study, event-related potential (ERP) and a study-test paradigm were used to investigate the effects of color consistency (visual color input and object color knowledge) on episodic memory encoding and retrieval by using pictures and names of objects with high color diagnosticity. Twenty-seven college students participated in experiment 1. During the study phase, a picture of an object in its diagnostic color (such as a red apple) or non-diagnostic color (purple banana) was presented on a white background for 500ms. The participants were asked to determine whether the color of the object in each picture was consistent with its actual (diagnostic) color. During the test phase, participants provided old/new judgments about the objects that had appeared in the study phase and the equal number of new items. Twenty-five college students participated in the experiment. A similar procedure was used for experiment two, except that items were the names of the objects in their diagnostic or non-diagnostic color rather than pictures. During both experiments, the participants responded by pressing a mouse button. Their reaction time and EEG (electroencephalography) were recorded. The results of experiment 1 showed that, during the encoding phase, color-inconsistent objects were identified less accurately and more slowly, and this triggered a larger N400 than the color-consistent ones. During the retrieval phase the color-consistent objects were recalled more quickly and accurately, and this triggered larger FN400 (frontal negativity) values than the color-inconsistent objects. However, the opposite effects were observed in experiment 2. Color-inconsistent object names were identified more quickly and accurately, and they elicited the same ERP wave as the color-consistent names. During the recognition stage, the color had an effect only during the period of late positive components (LPCs). In conclusion, color was found to have different effects on encoding and retrieval of episodic memory at both perceptual and semantic levels. (1) Color had different effects on item coding at the perceptual and semantic levels. Color consistency was found to help the viewer identify objects at the perceptual level, but it hindered object identification at the semantic level. (2) Color congruence was here found to promote familiarity and recollection in object retrieval (perceptual level), but it only improved recollection of an object's name (conceptual level). (3) The consistency effect in the processing of object name recognition showed that color is closely related to object name, and it also affects the semantic representation of objects, which further supports the spreading activation model.

At present, it is difficult to diagnose the patients with disorders of consciousness (DOCs) because motor responses in these patients may be very limited and inconsistent. Electrophysiological criteria, such as event-related potentials or motor imagery, have also been studied to establish a diagnosis and prognosis based on command-following or active paradigms. However, the use of such task-based techniques in DOC patients is methodologically complex and requires careful analysis and interpretation. The present paper focuses on the analysis of sleep patterns for the evaluation of DOC and its relationships with diagnosis and prognosis outcomes. We discuss the concepts of sleep patterns in patients suffering from DOC, identification of this challenging population, and the prognostic value of sleep. The available literature on individuals in an unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) or minimally conscious state (MCS) following traumatic or nontraumatic severe brain injury is reviewed. We can distinguish patients with different levels of consciousness by studying sleep patients with DOC. Most MCS patients have sleep and wake alternations, sleep spindles and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, while UWS patients have few EEG changes. A large number of sleep spindles and organized sleep-wake patterns predict better clinical outcomes. It is expected that this review will promote our understanding of sleep EEG in DOC.

Distributional learning of speech sound categories is gated by sensitive periods	COGNITION			English	Article						Statistical learning; Sensitive period; Phoneme; Infancy; Electroencephalography (EEG); ERP oddball task	PHONETIC PERCEPTION; LISTENERS LEARN; LANGUAGE; INFANTS; PLASTICITY; PHONOLOGY; DISCRIMINATION; EXPERIENCE; EXPOSURE; ENGLISH	Perceptual attunement to the native phonetic repertoire occurs over the first year of life: an infant's discrimination of non-native phonetic contrasts declines while their discrimination of native phonetic contrasts improves, with the timing of change consistent with sensitive periods. The statistics of speech sound distributions is one source of input used to collapse non-native phonetic category boundaries, while sharpening native ones. Distributional learning can be a domain-general mechanism, yet given the timing of perceptual attunement, we hypothesized that this learning mechanism may be maturationally delimited in the content domain of phonetic categories. Here, we assessed whether sensitivity to the distribution of speech sounds in the environment declines as the period of perceptual attunement closes. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate whether neuronal responses to native 'ra' and 'la' phones are modulated differently in older vs young infants by exposure to either a bimodal or unimodal sound distribution spanning the [r] similar to [l] phoneme space. The native contrast, ra-la, is discriminable at all three ages, ensuring that we were testing the distributional learning mechanism, rather than confounding it with a decline in discrimination to a non-native distinction. English monolingual infants (n = 131) at 5-, 9- and 12-months-old were familiarized to either a unimodal or bimodal distribution of /ra/-/la/ speech sounds. Immediately following familiarization, an ERP oddball task was used to assess discrimination. Results showed that brief exposure to a bi- vs uni-modal distribution is sufficient to alter neuronal responses to subsequent /ra/ vs /la/ speech sounds at 5-months and 9-months, but not at 12-months. These results are the first to capture a progressive decline in sensitivity to distributional statistics in the environment. A potential mechanistic explanation based on critical period biology is discussed.

Mediofrontal event-related potentials (ERPs), in particular the feedback-related negativity (FRN)/reward positivity (RewP), are related to PE signaling, but there is disagreement as to whether the FRN/RewP encode signed or unsigned PEs. PE encoding can potentially be dissected by time-frequency analysis, as frontal theta [4-8 Hz] might represent poor outcomes, while central delta [1-3 Hz] might instead represent rewarding outcomes. However, cortical PE signaling in negative reinforcement is still poorly understood, and the role of cortical PE representations in behavioral reinforcement learning following negative reinforcement is relatively unexplored. We recorded EEG while participants completed a task with matched positive and negative reinforcement outcome modalities, with parametrically manipulated single-trial outcomes producing positive and negative PEs. We first demonstrated that PEs systematically influence future behavior in both positive and negative reinforcement conditions. In negative reinforcement conditions, mediofrontal ERPs positively signaled unsigned PEs in a time window encompassing the P2 potential, and negatively signaled signed PEs for a time window encompassing the FRN/RewP and frontal P3 (an "aversion positivity"). Central delta power increased parametrically with increasingly aversive outcomes, contributing to the "aversion positivity". Finally, negative reinforcement ERPs correlated with RTs on the following trial, suggesting cortical PEs guide behavioral adaptations. Positive reinforcement PEs did not influence ERP or time-frequency activity, despite significant behavioral effects. These results demonstrate that mediofrontal PE signals are a mechanism underlying negative reinforcement learning, and that delta power increases for aversive outcomes might contribute to the "aversion positivity."

We proposed a novel MI-based BCI paradigm based on the sixth-finger which imagines controlling the extra fingermovements. The goal of this work was to investigate the EEG characteristics and the application potential of MI-based BCI systems based on the new imagination paradigm (sixth-finger MI). 14 subjects participated in the experiment involving the sixth-finger MI tasks and rest state. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) was adopted to analyze EEG spatial and time-frequency features. Common spatial patterns (CSP) were used for feature extraction and classification was implemented by support vector machine (SVM). ERD (event-related desynchronization) was found in the supplementary motor area (SMA) and primary motor area (M1) with a faint contralateral dominance. Unlike traditional human hand MI, ERD was also found in frontal lobe. The highest accuracy of 80% and mean accuracy of 70%.

The majority of previous reports of the brain correlates of this illusion are based on func-tional neuroimaging. Contrary to the electroencephalogram (EEG) however, such technologies are not suitable for bedside or ambulant use. While a handful of studies have shown EEG changes during FPS, it remains underin-vestigated whether these changes were due to the perceived illusion or the perceived vibration. Here, we aimed at disentangling the neural correlates of the illusory movement from those produced by the vibration sensation by comparing the neural responses to two vibration types, one that did and one that did not elicit an illusion. We recruited 40 nave participants, 20 for the EEG experiment and 20 for a supporting behavioral study, who received functional tendon co-vibration on the biceps and triceps tendon at their left elbow, pseudo-randomly switching between the illusion and non-illusion trials. Time-frequency decomposition uncovered a strong and lasting event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the mu and beta band in both conditions, suggesting a strong somatosensory response to the vibration. Additionally, the analysis of the evoked potentials revealed a significant difference between the two experimental conditions from 310 to 990ms post stimulus onset. Training classifiers on the frequency-based and voltage-based correlates of illusion perception yielded above chance accuracies for 17 and 13 out of the 20 subjects respectively. Our findings show that FPS-induced illusions produce EEG corre-lates that are distinct from a vibration-based control and which can be classified reliably in a large number of participants. These results encourage pursuing EEG-based detection of kinesthetic illusions as a tool for clinical use, e.g., to uncover aspects of cognitive perception in unresponsive patients.

White matter microstructural organization and functional activity can be assessed in unison. At first glance, however, the corresponding findings appear variable, both in the healthy brain and in numerous neuro-pathologies. To identify consistent associations between structural and functional connectivity and possible impacts for the clinic, we reviewed the literature of combined recordings of electro-encephalography (EEG) and diffusion-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It appears that the strength of event-related EEG activity increases with increased integrity of structural connectivity, while latency drops. This agrees with a simple mechanistic perspective: the nature of microstructural white matter influences the transfer of activity. The EEG, however, is often assessed for its spectral content. Spectral power shows associations with structural connectivity that can be negative or positive often dependent on the frequencies under study. Functional connectivity shows even more variations, which are difficult to rank. This might be caused by the diversity of paradigms being investigated, from sleep and resting state to cognitive and motor tasks, from healthy participants to patients. More challenging, though, is the potential dependency of findings on the kind of analysis applied. While this does not diminish the principal capacity of EEG and diffusion-based MRI co-registration, it highlights the urgency to standardize especially EEG analysis.

The question arises how comparable these types of insight are. Here, we set out (1) to evaluate the usefulness of the matchstick arithmetic task for investigating cognitive and neural processes underlying insight-based problem solving, (2) to determine whether the Aha! Experience is diminished over a multitude of trials, and (3) to compare true (correctly solved), false (incorrectly solved), and induced insights. To this end, we analysed solution rates, response times, strength of the Aha! experience, and event-related potentials (ERPs). Our results showed that the Aha! experience was not weakened over 40 trials, but showed the importance of the time for a solution attempt. True, false, and induced insights differed with regard to Aha! ratings and ERP amplitude -2000 to -1500 ms before the response. Our study underscores the importance of the operationalization of insight.

Categorization abilities are typically measured by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) similarity subtest, which consists of naming the shared category of two items (e.g., 'How are beer and coffee alike'). Previous studies show that categorization, as measured by similarity tasks, requires executive control functions. However, other theories and studies indicate that semantic memory is organized into taxonomic and thematic categories that can be activated implicitly in semantic priming tasks. To explore whether categories can be primed during a similarity task, we developed a double semantic priming paradigm. We measured the priming effect of two primes on a target word that was taxonomically or thematically related to both primes (double priming) or only one of them (single priming). Our results show a larger and additive priming effect in the double priming condition compared to the single priming condition, as measured by both response times and, more consistently, event-related potentials. Our results support the view that taxonomic and thematic categorization can occur during a double priming task and contribute to improving our knowledge on the organization of semantic memory into categories. These findings show how abstract categories can be activated, which likely shapes the way we think and interact with our environment. Our study also provides a new cognitive tool that could be useful to understand the categorization difficulties of neurological patients.

Expanding our understanding of sensory gating in children with autism spectrum disorders	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Sensory gating; Autism spectrum disorders; Electroencephalography (EEG); Auditory filtering; Time-frequency analysis	GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; P50 SUPPRESSION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; N100	Objective: This study examined sensory gating in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Gating is usually examined at the P50 component and rarely at mid- and late-latency components. Methods: Electroencephalography data were recorded during a paired-click paradigm, from 18 children with ASD (5-12 years), and 18 typically-developing (TD) children. Gating was assessed at the P50, N1, P2, and N2 event-related potential components. Parents of all participants completed the Short Sensory Profile (SSP). Results: TD children showed gating at all components while children with ASD showed gating only at P2 and N2. Compared to TD children, the ASD group showed significantly reduced gating at P50, N1, and P2. No group differences were found at N2, suggesting typical N2 gating in the ASD group. Time-frequency analyses showed reduced orientation and neural synchronization of auditory stimuli. P50 and N1 gating significantly correlated with the SSP. Conclusion: Although children with ASD have impaired early orientation and filtering of auditory stimuli, they exhibited gating at P2 and N2 components suggesting use of different gating mechanisms compared to TD children. Sensory deficits in ASD may relate to gating. Significance: The data provide novel evidence for impaired neural orientation, filtering, and synchronization in children with ASD.

Accumulating studies have demonstrated the crucial role of frontal and parietal areas in attention. However, the effect of posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) in attention is still unclear. To address this question, in this study, we measured transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced event-related potentials (ERPs) to determine the extent of involvement of the right pSTS in attentional processing. We hypothesized that TMS would enhance the activation of the right pSTS during feature discrimination processing. We recruited 21 healthy subjects who performed the dual-feature delayed matching task while undergoing single-pulse sham or real TMS to the right pSTS 300 ms before the second stimulus onset. The results showed that the response time was reduced by real TMS of the pSTS as compared to sham stimulation. N270 amplitude was reduced during conflict processing, and the time-varying network analysis revealed increased connectivity between the frontal lobe and temporo-parietal and occipital regions. Thus, single-pulse TMS of the right pSTS enhances feature discrimination processing and task performance by reducing N270 amplitude and increasing connections between the frontal pole and temporo-parietal and occipital regions. These findings provide evidence that the right pSTS facilitates feature discrimination by accelerating the formation of a dynamic network.

To investigate these mechanisms of cognitive reserve, we focused on electrophysiological correlates of cognitive performance, namely on an event-related measure of auditory memory and on a measure of global coherence. Both measures have shown to be sensitive markers for cognition and might therefore be suitable to investigate potential training- and lifestyle-related changes. Here, we report on the results of an electrophysiological sub-study that correspond to previously published behavioral findings. Altogether, 65 older adults with subjective or objective cognitive impairment and aged 60-88 years were assigned to a 10-week cognitive (n = 19) or a 10-week PT (n = 21) or to a passive control group (n = 25). In addition, self-reported lifestyle was assessed at baseline. We did not find an effect of both training groups on electroencephalography (EEG) measures of auditory memory decay or global coherence (ps >= 0.29) and a more active lifestyle was not associated with improved global coherence (p = 0.38). Results suggest that a 10-week unimodal cognitive or PT and an active lifestyle in older adults at risk for dementia are not strongly related to improvements in electrophysiological correlates of cognition.

A combined behavioural and EEG study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH-NEGATIVITY MMN; LATE POSITIVE COMPLEX; INVOLUNTARY ATTENTION; MENTAL CHRONOMETRY; MELODIC CONTOUR; P3 LATENCY; BRAIN; MEMORY; ERP	The human auditory system often relies on relative pitch information to extract and identify auditory objects; such as when the same melody is played in different keys. The current study investigated the mental chronometry underlying the active discrimination of unfamiliar melodic six-tone patterns by measuring behavioural performance and event-related potentials (ERPs). In a roving standard paradigm, such patterns were either repeated identically within a stimulus train, carrying absolute frequency information about the pattern, or shifted in pitch (transposed) between repetitions, so only relative pitch information was available to extract the pattern identity. Results showed that participants were able to use relative pitch to detect when a new melodic pattern occurred. Though in the absence of absolute pitch sensitivity significantly decreased and behavioural reaction time to pattern changes increased. Mismatch-Negativity (MMN), an ERP indicator of auditory deviance detection, was elicited at approximately 206 ms after stimulus onset at frontocentral electrodes, even when only relative pitch was available to inform pattern discrimination. A P3a was elicited in both conditions, comparable in amplitude and latency. Increased latencies but no differences in amplitudes of N2b, and P3b suggest that processing at higher levels is affected when, in the absence of absolute pitch cues, relative pitch has to be extracted to inform pattern discrimination. Interestingly, the response delay of approximately 70 ms on the behavioural level, already fully manifests at the level of N2b. This is in accordance with recent findings on implicit auditory learning processes and suggests that in the absence of absolute pitch cues a slowing of target selection rather than a slowing of the auditory pattern change detection process causes the deterioration in behavioural performance.

However, the effect of chronic stress on response inhibition has not been investigated. A major examination was adopted as a chronic stressor in this study. Both the stress and control groups performed a modified Go/Nogo task. In each trial, a probe stimulus (left or right arrow) was presented immediately after the Go/Nogo task. The probe reaction time (RT) was used as an index of cognitive load during the task. Event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked by Go/Nogo stimuli were investigated. The RTs for the Go stimulus and the probe stimulus were shorter for the stress group than for the control group. This superior performance by stressed participants might suggest a promoted task processing efficiency during the dual task under stress. A smaller probe RT effect (RTNogo - RTGo) was found in the stress group than in the control group, indicating a facilitatory effect of stress on conflict resolution. The ERP results showed that the P2 Go/Nogo effect was smaller for the stress group than for the control group, driven by an increased P2 amplitude after Go trials for the stress group. This might indicate an enhancement of attentional resource allocation to the Go stimuli under stress. Both the Nogo P3 amplitude and the P3 Go/Nogo effect were enhanced in the stress group than in the control group, suggesting that conflict resolution was enhanced under stress. These results demonstrate that chronic academic stress might facilitate response inhibition by promoting conflict resolution.

The amplitude of the auditory event-related potential (ERP) component N1 seems to closely reflect this matching process, while the later positive component (P2/ P3a) has been associated with judgments of agency, which are also sensitive to contextual top-down information. In this study, we examined the effect of perceived control over sound production on the processing of self-generated and external stimuli, as reflected in these components. We used a new version of a classic two-button choice task to induce different degrees of the illusion of control (IoC) and recorded ERPs for the processing of self-generated and external sounds in a subsequent task. N1 amplitudes were reduced for self-generated compared to external sounds, but not significantly affected by IoC. P2/3a amplitudes were affected by IoC: We found reduced P2/3a amplitudes after a high compared to a low IoC induction training, but only for self-generated, not for external sounds. These findings suggest that prior contextual belief information induced by an IoC affects later processing as reflected in the P2/P3a, possibly for the formation of agency judgments, while early processing reflecting motor-based predictions is not affected.

Cognitive control and emotion regulation are two major aspects involved in self-regulation, both of which are mechanisms to support goal-directed behaviors. Here, we aimed to elucidate whether the neural processes involved in emotion regulation and cognitive control could predict the cortisol response to stress. Therefore, we recorded first electroencephalography (EEG) during a cognitive conflict task (Simon task) and an emotion regulation task (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) before healthy participants (n = 72) underwent a psychosocial stressor. Our results showed that late positive potentials (LPPs) during the emotion regulation task predicted both cortisol reactivity to and recovery from stress. Cognitive control and its neural underpinning, however, did not predict the individual stress response. These findings indicate that neural emotion regulation processes can predict HPA axis response to stress, and suggest a differential involvement of cognitive and affective components of self-regulation in the adaptation to stressful events.

Non-invasive practical EEG headset available in the market brings more and more research in the field of BCI. BCI applications such as speller device is used both in entertainment field and health industry for typing using brain without using hands. There are a variety of paradigms available for designing a BCI based speller device. Here the primary design goals are to analyze the following parameters: speed in terms of the information transfer rate (ITR) and accuracy of word selection and increasing user friendliness. The common requirement for each method is stimulus design. In most cases the stimulus designs are responsible for the performance factors. This paper analyses the design of those stimuli used in the speller device and the associated Event Related Potential (ERP). The design parameters common to all the methodologies and performance parameters are also systematically discussed. The character selection time with each type of stimuli also has been compared.

Design, setting, and participants: In this cross-sectional study of 79 community-based older adults, aged 60-75 years, participants completed online surveys and in-person neuropsychological and electroencephalogram (EEG) assessments. Measurements: Measures included: the Change subscale of the Metamemory in Adulthood Questionnaire, NIH Toolbox Emotions battery (Perceived Stress and Psychological Well-Being), Geriatric Depression Scale, Geriatric Anxiety Scale, electrocortical measures (EEG), California Verbal Learning Test, 3rd Edition, and diagnostic ratings for mild and major neurocognitive disorders based on full neuropsychological battery, clinical interview, and two-clinician consensus. Results: P300 amplitude was associated with long-delay verbal memory recall and diagnostic rating. SMCs were not associated with objective memory or diagnostic rating. SMCs were associated with higher perceived stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms and lower psychological well-being. Conclusions: Neural indicators such as the P300 may be useful for early detection of cognitive impairment. SMCs were not a reliable indicator of early memory impairment in relation to neuropsychological or neural indicators, but may be a useful indicator of unreported stress and mood symptoms in clinical settings.

Yet, little is known about the modulating role of cross-linguistic influence (CLI) on the temporal unfolding of non-native production and the locus of target language selection. In this study, we explored CLI effects on non-native noun phrase production with behavioural and neural methods. We were particularly interested in the modulation of the P300 as an index for inhibitory control, and the N400 as an index for co-activation and CLI. German late learners of Spanish overtly named pictures while their EEG was monitored. Our results indicate traceable CLI effects at the behavioural and neural level in both early and late production stages.

Event-related changes in spectral EEG activity reflect cortical processing but are sparsely investigated in relation to sensorimotor processing in dystonia. This study investigates modulation of sensorimotor cortex EEG activity in response to a proprioceptive stimulus in children with dystonia and dystonic cerebral palsy (CP). Proprioceptive stimuli, comprising brief stretches of the wrist flexors, were delivered via a robotic wrist interface to 30 young people with dystonia (20 isolated genetic/idiopathic and 10 dystonic CP) and 22 controls (mean age 12.7 years). Scalp EEG was recorded using the 10-20 international system and the relative change in post-stimulus power with respect to baseline was calculated for the alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (14-30 Hz) fre-quency bands. A clear developmental profile in event-related spectral changes was seen in controls. Controls showed a prominent early alpha/mu band event-related desynchronisation (ERD) followed by an event-related synchro-nisation (ERS) over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex following movement of either hand. The alpha ERD was significantly smaller in the dystonia groups for both dominant and non-dominant hand movement (ANCOVA across the 3 groups with age as covariate: dominant hand F(2,47) = 4.45 p = 0.017; non-dominant hand F(2,42) = 9.397 p < 0.001. Alpha ERS was significantly smaller in dystonia for the dominant hand (ANCOVA F(2,47) = 7.786 p = 0.001). There was no significant difference in ERD or ERS between genetic/idiopathic dystonia and dystonic CP. Conclusion: Modulation of alpha/mu activity by a proprioceptive stimulus is reduced in dystonia, demonstrating a developmental abnormality of sensorimotor processing which is common to isolated genetic/idiopathic and acquired dystonia/dystonic CP.

Although neuroimaging studies have investigated neural processes associated with different types of vibrotactile feedback, encoding vibration intensity in the brain remains largely unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate neural processes associated with vibration intensity using electroencephalography. Twenty-nine healthy participants (aged 18-40 years, nine females) experienced vibrotactile feedback at the distal phalanx of the left index finger with three vibration intensity conditions: no vibration, low-intensity vibration (1.56 g), and high-intensity vibration (2.26 g). The alpha and beta band event-related desynchronization (ERD) as well as P2 and P3 event-related potential components for each of the three vibration intensity conditions are obtained. Results demonstrate that the ERD in the alpha band in the contralateral somatosensory and motor cortex areas is significantly associated with the vibration intensity. The average power spectral density (PSD) of the peak period of the ERD (400-600 ms) is significantly stronger for the high- and low-vibration intensity conditions compared to the no vibration condition. Furthermore, the average PSD of the ERD rebound (700-2,000 ms) is significantly maintained for the high-vibration intensity compared to low-intensity and no vibration conditions. Beta ERD signals the presence of vibration. These findings inform the development of quantitative measurements for vibration intensities based on neural signals.

The current study examined whether the P300, elicited from imperative stimuli in a gambling task, relates to depression - and can be utilized in tandem with the RewP to better account for individual differences in depression. Methods: In the current study, 80 adults with current depression (Mage = 39.65, 79% female) and 43 healthy controls (Mage = 37.02, 81% female) completed clinical interviews, self-report questionnaires, and the doors gambling task while EEG was recorded. Results: Results indicated a reduced P300 to doors stimuli (i.e., doors P300) in depression, especially among depressed individuals reporting heightened anhedonia. Gain and loss feedback P300s did not differ between groups. Moreover, the doors P300 moderated the association between RewP and depression status: individuals with relatively intact reward processing (i.e., larger RewP) were more likely to be currently depressed if they exhibited a reduced P300. Limitations: The majority of the sample identified as Caucasian which reduces generalizability of current results. Additionally, the current study is cross sectional design which limits insight into how these ERPs coincide with changes in the disorder. Conclusions: The current study demonstrates that a novel P300 component to the doors stimulus appears to be blunted in currently depressed individuals, and that using the doors P300 in combination with the RewP accounts for significantly more variance in depression.

Gathering this information can also help us make decisions, control processes, and analyze what happens and when it happens. In fact, a scientific investigation is the way scientists use the scientific method to collect the data and evidence that they plan to analyze. Neuroscience and other related activities are set to collect their own big datasets, but to exploit their full potential, we need ways to standardize, integrate, and synthesize diverse types of data. Although the use of low-cost ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG) devices has increased, such as those whose price is below 300 USD, their role in neuroscience research activities has not been well supported; there are weaknesses in collecting the data and information. The primary objective of this paper was to describe a tool for data management and visualization, called MuseStudio, for low-cost devices; specifically, our tool is related to the Muse brain-sensing headband, a personal meditation assistant with additional possibilities. MuseStudio was developed in Python following the best practices in data analysis and is fully compatible with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), which specifies how brain data must be managed. Our open-source tool can import and export data from Muse devices and allows viewing real-time brain data, and the BIDS exporting capabilities can be successfully validated following the available guidelines. Moreover, these and other functional and nonfunctional features were validated by involving five experts as validators through the DESMET method, and a latency analysis was also performed and discussed. The results of these validation activities were successful at collecting and managing electroencephalogram data.

A large number of studies have explored the effect of social crowding on consumers' feelings and behaviours in real shopping scenes, whereas few studies have examined the potential marketing effect of social crowding on online mobile consumption behaviour despite mobile commerce's increasing popularity in recent years. The current intends to explore the effect of social crowding on online mobile purchase and its underlying neural basis. Methods: The current study employed a questionnaire survey and an implicit panic buying experiment, in which the participants were asked to press the button as soon as possible to buy the showed product. A 2-level social crowding (low vs high) x 2-level feedback of panic buying (success vs fail) design was employed to test the negative impact of social crowding on consumers' online mobile purchase intention by using electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Results: Behaviorally, participants showed higher purchase intention in low social crowding environment compared with the high crowding condition. The event-related potentials (ERPs) results indicated that consumers had a higher affective/motivational evaluation (reflected in a smaller feedback-related negativity (FRN) amplitude) regarding the successful rather than the failing feedback in the low social crowding condition. However, this difference was not detected in the high social crowding condition. Meanwhile, more attentional resources (reflected in a greater P300 amplitude) were directed toward processing the feedback outcomes in the low rather than the high social crowding condition. Conclusion: The current study provided neurophysiological response that social crowding negatively influences consumers' online purchase intention. Some implications for theory and practice were also discussed.

The attention bottleneck model of psychopathy asserts that the behavior of individuals higher on psychopathy is due to an exaggerated attention bottleneck that constrains all information processing, regardless of the information's potential goal-relevance. To date, the majority of research on the attention bottleneck model of psychopathy conceptually applied the tenets of the model but did not implement methods that directly test an exaggeration of the bottleneck in psychopathy. Accordingly, the presence of an exaggerated bottleneck, the exact expression of that bottleneck, and its potential mechanistic relevance for behavior in individuals higher on psychopathy remains untested. To address these gaps, a sample of 78 male community members, evaluated for psychopathic traits using the Self-Report Psychopathy-III scale, completed an EEG-based dual-task paradigm examining short stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA; 300 ms), long SOA (1,100 ms), and single-task baseline conditions. Additionally, participants were asked about their frequency of real-world risky, impulsive, and antisocial behaviors. Psychopathy was associated with slower reaction times to second targets (T2s) presented during the dual-task conditions, relative to the baseline condition. Psychopathy also was associated with blunted P300 responses, a neural index of stimulus evaluation, across all types of T2 events. Finally, bottleneck-related interference during the short SOA events mediated the relationship between psychopathy and real-world behavior. These findings suggested that individuals higher on psychopathy exhibit an exaggerated bottleneck which produces intense and long-lasting interference, impacting all information processing and partially contributing to their maladaptive behavior.

Others show disruptive sensitivity to visual stimuli with no other obvious pathology or symptom profile (visual stress) which can extend to discomfort and nausea. We used event-related potentials (ERPs) to explore the neural correlates of visual stress and headache proneness. We analysed ERPs in response to thick (0.37 cycles per degree [c/deg]), medium (3 c/deg) and thin (12 c/deg) gratings, using mass univariate analysis, considering three factors in the general population: headache proneness, visual stress and discomfort. We found relationships between ERP features and the headache and discomfort factors. Stimulus main effects were driven by the medium stimulus regardless of participant characteristics. Participants with high discomfort ratings had larger P1 components for the initial presentation of medium stimuli, suggesting initial cortical hyperexcitability that is later suppressed. The participants with high headache ratings showed atypical N1-P2 components for medium stripes relative to the other stimuli. This effect was present only after repeated stimulus presentation. These effects were also explored in the frequency domain, suggesting variations in intertrial theta band phase coherence. Our results suggest that discomfort and headache in response to striped stimuli are related to different neural processes; however, more exploration is needed to determine whether the results translate to a clinical migraine population.

While there has been some evidence suggesting sleep disruption in relation to impaired inhibitory control, a major component of executive function, little is known about the underlying neural processing in insomnia. The current study aimed to examine the differences in the behavioral responses and electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of inhibitory control between youths with insomnia and healthy sleepers. Twenty-eight participants with insomnia disorder and 31 healthy sleeper controls aged between 15 and 25 completed the study. Electroencephalographic activity was recorded during the Cued Go/NoGo (CGNG) task, a task assessing inhibitory control. Although insomnia group exhibited comparable behavioral performance to the healthy sleeper group, they showed impaired attention preparation, as displayed by a smaller contingent negative variation (CNV) component (F = 4.10, p = 0.048) after cue onset; and demonstrated impaired inhibitory control, as evidenced by smaller N2 and theta power on 200-350 ms (MANCOVA multivariate Group effect, F = 5.85, p < 0.001). The results suggested that youths with insomnia demonstrated altered brain activity during inhibitory control, despite their comparable behavioral performance. Given that impaired inhibitory control is often implicated in psychopathology, future studies with a longitudinal design are needed to further explore the long-term impacts and trajectory of altered inhibitory control in youths with insomnia.

This phenomenon can be explained by the "arousal mechanism." Participants demonstrated individual differences in emotion perception. In other words, high emotional awareness resulted in high emotional arousal, and vice versa. This study extended existing findings by exploring the influence of emotional awareness on time perception in a temporal generalization task, while recording electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. The findings revealed that in the positive emotion condition, the high emotional awareness group made more overestimations, compared with the low emotional awareness group. However, no difference was observed in the neutral or negative emotion conditions. Moreover, the event-related potential (ERP) results showed that in the positive emotion condition, the high awareness group elicited larger vertex positive potential (VPP) amplitudes, compared with that of the low awareness group. However, no such differences were observed in the neutral and negative emotion conditions. Moreover, the contingent negative variation (CNV) (200-300, 300-490 ms) component showed that in the positive emotion, the amplitudes of the high awareness group were larger than that of the low awareness group; however, they did not show differences in the neutral condition. The findings of this study suggest that high emotional awareness produces higher physiological arousal; moreover, when participants were required to estimate the time duration of emotional pictures, they tended to make higher time overestimation. Thus, our results support the relationship between emotional awareness and time perception.

J	Li, BW; Lin, YF; Gao, XR; Liu, ZW				Li, Bowen; Lin, Yanfei; Gao, Xiaorong; Liu, Zhiwen			Enhancing the EEG classification in RSVP task by combining interval model of ERPs with spatial and temporal regions of interest	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						BCI; RSVP; interval model of ERPs; spatial projection; temporal auto-weighting		Objective. Brain-computer interface (BCI) systemsdirectly translate human intentions to instructions for machines by decoding the neural signals. The rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task is a typical paradigm of BCIs, in which subjects can detect the targets in the high-speed serial images. There are still two main challenges in electroencephalography (EEG) classification for RSVP tasks: inter-trial variability of event-related potentials (ERPs) and limited trial number of EEG training data. Approach. This study proposed an algorithm of discriminant analysis and classification for interval ERPs (DACIE) in RSVP tasks. Firstly, an interval model of ERPs was exploited to solve the inter-trial variability problem. Secondly, a spatial structured sparsity regularization was utilized to reinforce the important channels, which provided a spatial region of interest (sROI). Meanwhile, a temporal auto-weighting technique was conducted to emphasize the important discriminant components, which obtained a temporal regions of interest (tROIs). Thirdly, classification features were obtained by the discriminant eigenvalue analysis to avoid the ill-conditioned estimation of covariance matrix caused by fewer training trials. Main results. EEG datasets of 12 subjects in RSVP tasks were analyzed to evaluate the classification performance of proposed algorithm. The average accuracy rate, true positive rate, false positive rate and AUC value are 96.9%, 81.6%, 2.8% and 0.938, respectively. Compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithm can provide significantly better classification performance. Significance. The interval model of ERPs was exploited in a spatial linear discriminant framework to overcome the inter-trial variability. The sROIs and tROIs were explored to reinforce the pivotal channels and temporal components. And the proposed algorithm can provide good performance with fewer training trials.

We present a novel approach to the classification of visual ERPs collected from 6-month-old infants using intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) derived from empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Selected features were used as inputs to two machine learning methods (support vector machines and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN)) using nested cross validation. Different runs were executed for the modelling and classification of the participants in the control and high-risk (HR) groups and the classification of diagnosis outcome within the high-risk group: HR-ASD and HR-noASD. The highest accuracy in the classification of familial risk was 88.44%, achieved using a support vector machine (SVM). A maximum accuracy of 74.00% for classifying infants at risk who go on to develop ASD vs. those who do not was achieved through k-NN. IMF-based extracted features were highly effective in classifying infants by risk status, but less effective by diagnostic outcome. Advanced signal analysis of ERPs integrated with machine learning may be considered a first step toward the development of an early biomarker for ASD.

Attention bias modification in drug addiction: Enhancing control of subsequent habits	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						addiction; attention bias; cognitive reappraisal; EEG; eye tracking	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EMOTION REGULATION; VISUAL FIXATIONS; NEURAL SYSTEMS; EYE TRACKING; COCAINE; CUES; REAPPRAISAL; SEVERITY; INDIVIDUALS	A relapse in addiction is often precipitated by heightened attention bias to drug-related cues, underpinned by a subcortically mediated transition to habitual/automatized responding and reduced prefrontal control. Modification of such automatized attention bias is a fundamental, albeit elusive, target for relapse reduction. Here, on a trial-by-trial basis, we used electroencephalography and eye tracking with a task that assessed, in this order, drug cue reactivity, its instructed self-regulation via reappraisal, and the immediate aftereffects on spontaneous (i.e., not instructed and automatized) attention bias. The results show that cognitive reappraisal, a facet of prefrontal control, decreased spontaneous attention bias to drug-related cues in cocaine-addicted individuals, more so in those with less frequent recent use. The results point to the mechanisms underlying the disruption of automatized maladaptive drug-related attention bias in cocaine addiction. These results pave the way for future studies to examine the role of such habit disruption in reducing compulsive drug seeking outside the controlled laboratory environment, with the ultimate goal of developing a readily deployable cognitivebehavioral and personalized intervention for drug addiction.

The positive P300 component of visual event-related potentials (ERPs) used in BCI spellers has individual variations of amplitude and latency that further changse with brain abnormalities such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This leads to the necessity for the users to train the speller themselves, which is a very time-consuming procedure. To achieve subject-independence in a P300 speller, ensemble classifiers are proposed based on classical machine learning models, such as the support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and the convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed voters were trained on healthy subjects' data using a generic training approach. Different combinations of electroencephalography (EEG) channels were used for the experiments presented, resulting in single-channel, four-channel, and eight-channel classification. ALS patients' data represented robust results, achieving more than 90% accuracy when using an ensemble of LDA, kNN, and SVM on four active EEG channels data in the occipital area of the brain. The results provided by the proposed ensemble voting models were on average about 5% more accurate than the results provided by the standalone classifiers. The proposed ensemble models could also outperform boosting algorithms in terms of computational complexity or accuracy. The proposed methodology shows the ability to be subject-independent, which means that the system trained on healthy subjects can be efficiently used for ALS patients. Applying this methodology for online speller systems removes the necessity to retrain the P300 speller.

Still, little is known about the cerebral odor processing in this age group. Studies of olfactory function relied mostly on behavioral, autonomic, and facial responses of infants.The aim of the present study was to investigate central odor processing in infants focusing on electroencephalography (EEG)-derived responses to biologically significant odors, namely a food and a non-food odor. A total of 21 term-born, healthy infants participated (11 boys and 10 girls; age range 2-9 months, mean 5.3 +/- 2.2 months). Odor stimuli were presented using a computer-controlled olfactometer. Breast milk was used as food odor. Farnesol was presented as a non-food odor. In addition, odorless air was used as a control stimulus. Each stimulus was presented 30 times for 1 s with an interstimulus interval of 20 s. EEG was recorded from 9 electrodes and analyzed in the frequency domain. EEG amplitudes in the delta frequency band differed significantly after presentation of food (breast milk) odor in comparison to the control condition and the non-food odor (farnesol).These changes were observed at the frontal recording positions. The present study indicates that central odor processing differs between a food and a non-food odor in infants. Results are interpreted in terms of focused attention towards a physiologically relevant odor (breast milk), suggesting that olfactory stimuli are of specific significance in this age group.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns from brain activity and deep learning techniques are valuable resources in achieving this identification. We propose automated techniques that can process raw EEG waveforms to identify children who may have an increased risk of schizophrenia compared to typically developing children. We also analyse abnormal features that remain during developmental follow-up over a period of similar to 4 years in children with a vulnerability to schizophrenia initially assessed when aged 9 to 12 years. EEG data from participants were captured during the recording of a passive auditory oddball paradigm. We undertake a holistic study to identify brain abnormalities, first by exploring traditional machine learning algorithms using classification methods applied to hand-engineered features (event-related potential components). Then, we compare the performance of these methods with end-to-end deep learning techniques applied to raw data. We demonstrate via average cross-validation performance measures that recurrent deep convolutional neural networks can outperform traditional machine learning methods for sequence modeling. We illustrate the intuitive salient information of the model with the location of the most relevant attributes of a post-stimulus window.

The use of classification algorithms can clarify the understanding of these factors. This study was aimed at measuring electrophysiological responses to food/nonfood stimuli and applying classification techniques to discriminate the responses using a single-sweep dataset. Twenty-one right-handed male athletes with body mass index (BMI) levels between 18.5% and 25% (mean age: 21.05 +/- 2.5) participated in this study voluntarily. The participants were asked to focus on the food and nonfood images that were randomly presented on the monitor without performing any motor task, and EEG data have been collected using a 16-channel amplifier with a sampling rate of 1024 Hz. The SensoMotoric Instruments (SMI) iView XTM RED eye tracking technology was used simultaneously with the EEG to measure the participants' attention to the presented stimuli. Three datasets were generated using the amplitude, time-frequency decomposition, and time-frequency connectivity metrics of P300 and LPP components to separate food and nonfood stimuli. We have implemented k-nearest neighbor (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR), Bayesian classifier, decision tree (DT), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifiers on these datasets. Finally, the response to food-related stimuli in the hunger state is discriminated from nonfood with an accuracy value close to 78% for each dataset. The results obtained in this study motivate us to employ classifier algorithms using the features obtained from single-trial measurements in amplitude and time-frequency space instead of applying more complex ones like connectivity metrics.

Online sentence processing impairments in agrammatic and logopenic primary progressive aphasia: Evidence from ERP	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Primary progressive aphasia; Event-related potentials; Sentence processing; Semantics; Morphosyntax; Verb-argument structure		Evidence from psycholinguistic research indicates that sentence processing is impaired in Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA), and more so in individuals with agrammatic (PPA-G) than logopenic (PPA-L) subtypes. Studies have mostly focused on offline sentence production ability, reporting impaired production of verb morphology (e.g., tense, agreement) and verb-argument structure (VAS) in PPA-G, and mixed findings in PPA-L. However, little is known about real-time sentence comprehension in PPA. The present study is the first to compare realtime semantic, morphosyntactic and VAS processing in individuals with PPA (10 with PPA-G and 9 with PPA-L), and in two groups of healthy (22 young and 19 older) individuals, using event-related potentials (ERP). Participants were instructed to listen to sentences that were either well-formed (n = 150) or contained a violation of semantics (e.g., *Owen was mentoring pumpkins at the party, n = 50), morphosyntax (e.g., *The actors was singing in the theatre, n = 50) or VAS (*Ryan was devouring on the couch, n = 50), and were required to perform a sentence acceptability judgment task while EEG was recorded. Results indicated that in the semantic task both healthy and PPA groups showed an N400 response to semantic violations, which was delayed in PPA and older (vs. younger) groups. Morphosyntactic violations elicited a P600 in both groups of healthy individuals and in PPA-L, but not in PPA-G. A similar P600 response was also found only in healthy individuals for VAS violations; whereas, abnormal ERP responses were observed in both PPA groups, with PPA-G showing no evidence of VAS violation detection and PPA-L showing a delayed and abnormally-distributed positive component that was negatively associated with offline sentence comprehension scores. These findings support characterizations of sentence processing impairments in PPA-G, by providing online evidence that VAS and morphosyntactic processing are impaired, in the face of substantially preserved semantic processing. In addition, the results indicate that on-line processing of VAS information may also be impaired in PPA-L, despite their near-normal accuracy on standardized language tests of argument structure production.

J	Scheeff, J; Schneidt, A; Schonenberg, M				Scheeff, Jonathan; Schneidt, Alexander; Schoenenberg, Michael			Does attentional focus modulate affective information processing in male violent offenders with psychopathic traits?	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article						affective processing; electrophysiology; psychopathy	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EMOTION; STARTLE; PICTURES; FEAR	Antisocial and psychopathic individuals are characterized by a reduced responsivity to affective information. Yet, the role of attentional processes as possible modulator of these deficits is poorly understood. The current study investigated early and late processing of emotional stimuli in a sample of incarcerated offenders while manipulating the attentional focus. Twenty-seven male violent offenders with psychopathic traits and 27 healthy controls completed two experimental tasks while electroencephalography (EEG) data were collected. Task 1 assessed indirect processing of emotional or neutral distractors during a perceptual judgment task, while Task 2 measured direct processing of the emotional or neutral stimuli and required participants to rate the stimuli regarding valence and arousal. EEG data indicated no differences in early stage processing (early posterior negativity) between the experimental groups. However, we found significant group differences with regard to the late processing stage (late positive potential, LPP). Controls showed increased LPP amplitudes in Task 2 as compared to Task 1, indicating that task demands (i.e., attentional focus) had an effect on the processing of the emotional stimuli. In contrast, LPP amplitudes in the violent offender group were largely unaffected by task demands, suggesting specific late alterations in the neural processing of emotional stimuli. In sum, this study provides new evidence for a modulatory impact of attention on affective information processing in male violent offenders with psychopathic traits.

To comprehend entire sentences, segments consisting of multiple words need to be memorized for at least a while. However, it has been noted previously that we struggle to memorize segments longer than approximately 2.7 s. We hypothesized that electrophysiological processing cycles within the delta band (<4 Hz) underlie this time constraint. Participants' EEG was recorded while they listened to temporarily ambiguous sentences. By manipulating the speech rate, we aimed at biasing participants' interpretation: At a slow rate, segmentation after 2.7 s would trigger a correct interpretation. In contrast, at a fast rate, segmentation after 2.7 s would trigger a wrong interpretation and thus an error later in the sentence. In line with the suggested time constraint, the phase of the delta-band oscillation at the critical point in the sentence mirrored segmentation on the level of single trials, as indicated by the amplitude of the P600 event-related brain potential (ERP) later in the sentence. The correlation between upstream delta-band phase and downstream P600 amplitude implies that segmentation took place when an underlying neural oscillator had reached a specific angle within its cycle, determining comprehension. We conclude that delta-band oscillations set an endogenous time constraint on segmentation.

The N170 event-related potential reflects delayed neural response to faces when visual attention is directed to the eyes in youths with ASD	AUTISM RESEARCH			English	Article						autism; EEG; event-related potential; face perception; N170; social neuroscience		Atypical neural response to faces is thought to contribute to social deficits in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Compared to typically developing (TD) controls, individuals with ASD exhibit delayed brain responses to upright faces at a face-sensitive event-related potential (ERP), the N170. Given observed differences in patterns of visual attention to faces, it is not known whether slowed neural processing may simply reflect atypical looking to faces. The present study manipulated visual attention to facial features to examine whether directed attention to the eyes normalizes N170 latency in ASD. ERPs were recorded in 30 children and adolescents with ASD as well as 26 TD children and adolescents. Results replicated prior findings of shorter N170 latency to the eye region of the face in TD individuals. In contrast, those with ASD did not demonstrate modulation of N170 latency by point of regard to the face. Group differences in latency were most pronounced when attention was directed to the eyes. Results suggest that well-replicated findings of N170 delays in ASD do not simply reflect atypical patterns of visual engagement with experimental stimuli. These findings add to a body of evidence indicating that N170 delays are a promising marker of atypical neural response to social information in ASD. Lay Summary This study looks at how children's and adolescents' brains respond when looking at different parts of a face. Typically developing children and adolescents processed eyes faster than other parts of the face, whereas this pattern was not seen in ASD. Children and adolescents with ASD processed eyes more slowly than typically developing children. These findings suggest that observed inefficiencies in face processing in ASD are not simply reflective of failure to attend to the eyes.

However, approximately one third of stroke patients do not receive early in hospital rehabilitation programs due to insufficient medical facilities or lack of motivation. Gait triggered mixed reality (GTMR) is a cognitive-motor dual task with multisensory feedback tailored for lower-limb post-stroke rehabilitation, which we propose as a potential method for addressing these rehabilitation challenges. Simultaneous gait and EEG data from nine stroke patients was recorded and analyzed to assess the applicability of GTMR to different stroke patients, determine any impacts of GTMR on patients, and better understand brain dynamics as stroke patients perform different rehabilitation tasks. Walking cadence improved significantly for stroke patients and lower-limb movement induced alpha band power suppression during GTMR tasks. The brain dynamics and gait performance across different severities of stroke motor deficits was also assessed; the intensity of walking induced event related desynchronization (ERD) was found to be related to motor deficits, as classified by Brunnstrom stage. In particular, stronger lower-limb movement induced ERD during GTMR rehabilitation tasks was found for patients with moderate motor deficits (Brunnstrom stage IV). This investigation demonstrates the efficacy of the GTMR paradigm for enhancing lower-limb rehabilitation, explores the neural activities of cognitive-motor tasks in different stages of stroke, and highlights the potential for joining enhanced rehabilitation and real-time neural monitoring for superior stroke rehabilitation.

Twenty-three student participants took part in an EEG experiment with two separate sessions. Happy or sad mood inductions were followed by series of individually presented positive, negative, or neutral adjectives in L1 (German) or L2 (English) and evaluative decisions had to be performed. Visual event-related potentials elicited during word processing were analyzed during N1 (125-200 ms), Early Posterior Negativities (EPN, 200-300 ms and 300-400 ms), N400 (350-450 ms), and the Late Positive Potential (LPP, 500-700 ms). Mood induction differentially impacted word processing already on the N1, with stronger left lateralization following happy than sad mood induction in L1, but not in L2. Moreover, regardless of language, early valence modulation was found following happy but not sad mood induction. Over occipital areas, happy mood elicited larger amplitudes of the mood-congruent positive words, whereas over temporal areas mood-incongruent negative words had higher amplitudes. In the EPN-windows, effects of mood and valence largely persisted, albeit with no difference between L1 and L2. N400 amplitude was larger for L2 than for L1. On the LPP, mood-incongruent adjectives elicited larger amplitudes than mood-congruent ones. Results reveal a remarkably early valence-general effect of mood induction on cortical processing, in line with previous reports of N1 as a first marker of contextual integration. Interestingly, this effect differed between L1 and L2. Moreover, mood-congruent effects were found in perceptual processing and mood-incongruent ERP amplification in higher-order evaluative stages.

Dietary lutein plus zeaxanthin and choline intake is interactively associated with cognitive flexibility in middle-adulthood in adults with overweight and obesity	NUTRITIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Carotenoids; phosphatidylcholine; cognition; biomarker; macular pigmentation; MPOD; electroencephalography; cognitive control	ESSENTIAL NUTRIENT	Background:The xanthophyll carotenoids lutein+zeaxanthin and the dietary component choline have been linked to benefits in cognition. However, knowledge on the interactive influence of these dietary components on cognitive function is sparse. Design:80 middle-aged adults with overweight and obesity (Body Mass Index: (BMI) >= 25.0 kg/m(2)), completed 7-day diet records, venous blood draws, heterochromatic flicker photometry, assessment of intelligence quotient (IQ), and a cognitive flexibility task while undergoing electroencephalographic recording for event-related potential (ERP) extraction. Multiplicative interaction terms and hierarchical linear regressions, controlling for age, BMI, sex, annual household income, and IQ were utilized to assess independent and interactive contributions of dietary and biomarker data on Switch task outcomes. Results:Higher intake of lutein+zeaxanthin and choline was associated interactively, but not independently, with faster reaction time (RT), after controlling for pertinent covariates. Dietary intake of lutein+zeaxanthin and choline was associated with serum lutein concentrations, but not with plasma choline metabolites nor macular pigmentation. Plasma phosphatidylcholine (PC) concentrations were associated with higher accuracy in Switch trials, while no other biomarkers were associated with cognitive outcomes. Dietary intake and biomarker data were not related to the N2 nor P3 ERP component. Conclusions:Among a sample of adults with overweight and obesity, greater intake of choline and lutein+zeaxanthin was associated with faster performance on a cognitive flexibility task. Future work examining methods of increasing consumption of both of these dietary components as a possible means of improving or maintaining cognitive flexibility among adults with overweight and obesity is therefore warranted.

For addressing this, we introduce LEDA, localized-EEG dynamics analyzer, offering our novel techniques, namely (1)the localized source activity to duration (LSAD) ratio that elegantly combines voxel activation with temporal information enabling a spatiotemporal condition comparison, (2)cortical region's activation-duration summary generation, (3)anatomical dominance calculator, and (4)voxel activations' GIF animation extraction feature. They effectively explore and quantify physiological spatiotemporal dynamics and provide insights more intuitive than EEG/ERP biomarkers. To demonstrate, we chose to study sensory gating deficits in schizophrenia for which the P50 wave biomarker is widely discussed. EEG response (64 channels@1 kHz) to auditory paired-click paradigm from 9 patients and 9 controls was processed to ERP. Source localization was achieved by using sLORETA, a widely-used source reconstruction algorithm. LSAD ratio of patients significantly differed from that of controls for the auditory cortical regions (p value < 0.05). It revealed that inhibitory alpha activity pattern was prominent in parietal, temporal and occipital lobe for controls and not patients. Conversely, the frontal lobe, specifically the middle frontal gyrus, was temporally the most active analogously across all subjects. LEDA also extracted that swift alpha activity exists between 100 and 300 ms time period. These derived results match with existing fMRI studies, speak beyond P50 wave suppression biomarker and emphasize that our methods successfully uncovered meaningful brain mechanisms at high spatiotemporal resolution. They are provided as an open-source MATLAB based toolbox for applicability to other neuronal pathological investigations.

Previous research demonstrated that subjects are more efficient in the recognition of images representing self rather than others' body effectors (self-advantage). Here, we verified whether, at an electrophysiological level, bodily-self recognition modulates change detection responses. In a first EEG experiment (discovery sample), event-related potentials (ERPs) were elicited by a pair of sequentially presented visual stimuli (vS1; vS2), representing either the self-hand or other people's hands. In a second EEG experiment (replicating sample), together with the previously described visual stimuli, also a familiar hand was presented. Participants were asked to decide whether vS2 was identical or different from vS1. Accuracy and response times were collected. In both experiments, results confirmed the presence of the self-advantage: participants responded faster and more accurately when the self-hand was presented. ERP results paralleled behavioral findings. Anytime the self-hand was presented, we observed significant change detection responses, with a larger N270 component for vS2 different rather than identical to vS1. Conversely, when the self-hand was not included, and even in response to the familiar hand in Experiment 2, we did not find any significant modulation of the change detection responses. Overall our findings, showing behavioral self-advantage and the selective modulation of N270 for the self-hand, support the existence of a specific mechanism devoted to bodily-self recognition, likely relying on the multimodal (visual and sensorimotor) dimension of the bodily-self representation. We propose that such a multimodal self-representation may activate the salience network, boosting change detection effects specifically for the self-hand. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Isoflurane effects on the N1 and other long-latency auditory evoked potentials in Wistar rats	NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article						ERP; Anesthesia; Auditory N1; AEP; EEG; Attention; Arousal	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; MEASURING DEPTH; ANESTHESIA; STANDARDS; PROPOFOL; SEDATION; HUMANS; WAVE; ETA	Long-latency auditory evoked potentials (LLAEPs) may help further advances in understanding consciousness under general anesthesia and promote more objective means of assessing sedation depth than conventional clinical signs. Among the LLAEP components, the auditory N1 shows promise as a measure of sedation depth and a marker of consciousness, but findings are so far inconclusive. Research with animals can help elucidate the effects of various anesthetics on the N1 and other LLAEPs, but investigations of LLAEPs under anesthesia in animals is lacking. To address this deficit, we examined the P1, N1, P2, and N2, along with their corresponding peak-to-peak complexes, in 10 Wistar rats anesthetized with 1.5-2 % isoflurane in pure oxygen and again after recovery. While under anesthesia, subdermal needle electrodes were inserted and secured for electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. LLAEPs were assessed during a 20-min, passive, two-tone (500 ms inter-tone interval) paradigm with randomized short (1 s) and long (5 s) inter-pair intervals (IPIs). Overall, while the LLAEP peaks under isoflurane were less defined, they were not eliminated. The peak-to-peak amplitudes, particularly the P1-N1, were significantly smaller under isoflurane than during post-recovery. Our preliminary findings indicate that isoflurane produces global suppression across LLAEP components, presumably reflecting impaired integration of top-down and bottom-up attention and sensory systems under profound sedation with isoflurane.

Its success largely depends on performance, including the information transmission rate (ITR) and detection rate (i.e., accuracy). To achieve good performance, we proposed a multiscale convolutional neural network (MS-CNN) model that consists of seven layers. First, an upfront data set was used to train the MS-CNN, aiming to obtain a subject-unspecific model (universal model) for P300 detection. Second, this universal model was adapted by a portion of data derived from a subject to update the model to obtain a subject-specific model by incorporating a transfer learning technique. We applied the proposed model in the brain-computer interface ( BCI) Controlled Robot Contest at the 2019 World Robot Conference, and our performance was the best among the teams in the contest. In the contest, ten healthy young subjects were randomly assigned by the contest committee to assess the model. Our model achieved they best P300 detection performance (higher accuracy with less repetition time). The ITR for the subject-unspecific case was 13.49 bits/min, while the ITR for the subject-specific case was 12.13 bits/min when the repetitions were fewer than six. It is believed that our method may pave a promising path for taking a further step toward efficient implementation of the P300-based spelling system.

There is lack of literature regarding the study of cognitive functions in GDM. Recent evidences suggests an increase in accumulation of serum Advanced glycated end products (AGE'S) during GDM. Accumulation of AGE's in brain can induce changes in permeability of blood brain barrier and creates oxidative stress and inflammation that can alter cognitive functions. In this study we hypothesize that diagnosis of GDM in pregnancy is related to lower cognitive scores which is correlated to increased serum AGE's level. Method This was a cross sectional case control study which recruited 60 participants in total consisting of two groups with 30 participants in each - diagnosed cases of GDM and healthy pregnant controls. Subjects were recruited from OPD of Obstetrics & Gynecology department in a tertiary care hospital in South India at gestational age of 32-36 weeks. On the first appointment, biochemical parameters of Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) & HbA1C was measured in both groups. Serum was obtained for testing levels of N Carboxy methyl lysine (N-CML) (a form of AGE). On second appointment, pen and paper neurocognitive tests including Montreal cognitive tests (MOCA) and Trail making test (TMT A & B) was presented. Event related potentials (ERP's) are time locked EEG wave signals produced in response to a sensory, motor or cognitive event. P300 is an "endogenous" ERP produced by cognitive processing in response to a stimuli presented to subject. P300 wave Latency and amplitude was recorded in both the groups as an objective marker of cognitive processing. Above mentioned biochemical and neurocognitive parameters were compared between both the groups and correlation analysis between serum AGE levels and neurocognitive parameters was performed using SPSS software. Results Biochemical parameters of HbAIC & N-CML(A form of AGE) levels were increased in GDM group (HbA1C 6.01 +/- 0.30 and N CML 236.25 +/- 68.9) vs Control group (HbA1C 4.11 +/- 0.68 and NCML 198.42 +/- 44.2). Scores in MOCA were significantly lower in GDM (28 (27-29)) group as compared to controls (24 (23-25)). GDM subjects took significantly greater time to perform TMT A (24.59 +/- 2.60 s) test than controls (29.7 +/- 1.72 s). Significant changes were not found in P300 Latency & amplitude in GDM group. Decreased MOCA scores and increased duration of TMT A attempt were correlated with increased serum AGE concentration in GDM group. Conclusions Our study indicates the vulnerability of women suffering from GDM to cognitive impairment during pregnancy. Lower scores in cognitive tests were correlated to AGE accumulation in GDM women.

J	Euler, MJ; Schubert, AL				Euler, Matthew J.; Schubert, Anna-Lena			Recent developments, current challenges, and future directions in electrophysiological approaches to studying intelligence	INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						EEG; Event-related potential; Time-frequency analysis; Intelligence; Cognitive abilities	AUDITORY-DISCRIMINATION TASK; NEURAL EFFICIENCY; FLUID INTELLIGENCE; WORKING-MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; EEG ALPHA; GENERAL INTELLIGENCE; RETEST RELIABILITY; THETA OSCILLATIONS; REACTION-TIME	EEG studies represent an important sub-discipline in the field of intelligence research and have significant potential to advance the theoretical understanding and practical applications of the construct. This commentary reviews key themes and major developments in the field from the last several decades, and outlines open questions and future directions for the next phase of research. Two main areas of progress in recent years relate to (1) improvements in study design and psychometric approaches, and (2) increased integration with cognitive psychology and neuroscience. In turn, these advances have clarified several themes and pressing issues. These include: The need to establish the replicability and effect sizes of key effects, the need to explicitly attend to the distinction between trait- and task-related sources of variance in correlations between intelligence and EEG variables, the need to systematically identify and test moderators of those relationships, the need for greater use of formal modeling at the level of measurement and theory, and the need for continued integration of theoretical advances from related disciplines. We argue that an increased focus on these issues can yield rapid progress in this area over the coming years. The commentary concludes with suggestions for both immediate priorities and long-term directions in basic and applied EEG research on intelligence.

EEG was recorded for stationary sounds and for three patterns of sound motion produced by changes in interaural time differences. We explored the effect of motion velocity on the MOR potential, and also on the event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITC) calculated from the time-frequency decomposition of EEG signals. The phase coherence of slow oscillations increased with an increase in motion velocity similarly to the magnitude of cN1 and cP2 components of the MOR response. The delta-to-alpha inter-trial spectral power remained at the same level up to, but not including, the highest velocity, suggesting that gradual spatial changes within the sound did not induce non-coherent activity. Conversely, the abrupt sound displacement induced theta-alpha oscillations which had low phase consistency. The findings suggest that the MOR potential could be mainly generated by the phase resetting of slow oscillations, and the degree of phase coherence may be considered as a neurophysiological indicator of sound motion processing.

ATTENTION PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS			English	Article						Audition; Methods; EEG; MEG; Multisensory processing	FEATURE CONJUNCTIONS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; HUMANS; COMPONENT; DYNAMICS; SOUNDS; P300; ERP	What happens if a visual cue misleads auditory expectations? Previous studies revealed an early visuo-auditory incongruency effect, so-called incongruency response (IR) of the auditory event-related brain potential (ERP), occurring 100 ms after onset of the sound being incongruent to the preceding visual cue. So far, this effect has been ascribed to reflect the mismatch between auditory sensory expectation activated by visual predictive information and the actual sensory input. Thus, an IR should be confined to an asynchronous presentation of visual cue and sound. Alternatively, one could argue that frequently presented congruent visual-cue-sound combinations are integrated into a bimodal representation whereby violation of the visual-auditory relationship results in a bimodal feature mismatch (the IR should be obtained with asynchronous and with synchronous presentation). In an asynchronous condition, an either high-pitched or low-pitched sound was preceded by a visual note symbol presented above or below a fixation cross (90% congruent; 10% incongruent), while in a synchronous condition, both were presented simultaneously. High-pitched and low-pitched sounds were presented with different probabilities (83% vs. 17%) to form a strong association between bimodal stimuli. In both conditions, tones with pitch incongruent with the location of the note symbols elicited incongruency effects in the N2 and P3 ERPs; however, the IR was only elicited in the asynchronous condition. This finding supports the sensorial prediction error hypothesis stating that the amplitude of the auditory ERP 100 ms after sound onset is enhanced in response to unexpected compared with expected but otherwise identical sounds.

One question that arises is: How rapidly do neural processes set in when processing statements that reflect moral value containing information? In the current study, participants read sentences about morally relevant statements (e.g., 'Wars are acceptable') and expressed their (dis)agreement with the statements while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Multivariate pattern classification (MVPA) was used during language processing to predict the individual's response. Our results show that (1) the response ('yes' vs. 'no') could be predicted from 180 ms following the decision-relevant word (here acceptable), and (2) the attitude (pro vs. contra the topic) could be predicted from 170 ms following the topic word (here wars). We suggest that the successful MVPA classification is due to different brain activity patterns evoked by differences in activated mental representations (e.g. valence, arousal, etc.) depending on whether the attitude towards the topic is positive or negative and whether it is in accordance with the presented decisive word or not.

Neural indicators of articulator-specific sensorimotor influences on infant speech perception	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						infancy; sensorimotor; speech perception; EEG	ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; INFORMATION; HIERARCHY; HUMANS; BRAIN; FACE	While there is increasing acceptance that even young infants detect correspondences between heard and seen speech, the common view is that oral-motor movements related to speech production cannot influence speech perception until infants begin to babble or speak. We investigated the extent of multimodal speech influences on auditory speech perception in prebabbling infants who have limited speech-like oral-motor repertoires. We used event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine how sensorimotor influences to the infant's own articulatory movements impact auditory speech perception in 3-mo-old infants. In experiment 1, there were ERP discriminative responses to phonetic category changes across two phonetic contrasts (bilabial-dental /ba/-/da/; dental-retroflex /da/-/cia/) in a mismatch paradigm, indicating that infants auditorily discriminated both contrasts. In experiment 2, inhibiting infants' own tongue-tip movements had a disruptive influence on the early ERP discriminative response to the /da/-/cia/ contrast only. The same articulatory inhibition had contrasting effects on the perception of the /ba/-/da/ contrast, which requires different articulators (the lips vs. the tongue) during production, and the /da/-/cia/ contrast, whereby both phones require tongue-tip movement as a place of articulation. This articulatory distinction between the two contrasts plausibly accounts for the distinct influence of tongue-tip suppression on the neural responses to phonetic category change perception in definitively prebabbling, 3-mo-old, infants. The results showing a specificity in the relation between oral-motor inhibition and phonetic speech discrimination suggest a surprisingly early mapping between auditory and motor speech representation already in prebabbling infants.

We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate whether exposure to EA relates to distortions in responses to different facial emotions at three levels: 1) event-related potentials of the P100 and N170, 2) amygdala functional magnetic resonance imaging responses, and 3) accuracy rate or reaction time in behavioral data. METHODS: The systematic literature search (PubMed and Web of Science) up to April 2020 resulted in 29 behavioral studies (n = 8555), 32 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies (n = 2771), and 3 electroencephalography studies (n = 197) for random-effect meta-analyses. RESULTS: EA was related to heightened bilateral amygdala reactivity to sad faces (but not other facial emotions). Exposure to EA was related to faster reaction time but a normal accuracy rate in response to angry and sad faces. In response to fearful and happy faces, EA was related to a lower accuracy rate only in individuals with recent EA exposure. This effect was more pronounced in individuals with exposure to EA before (vs. after) the age of 3 years. These findings were independent of psychiatric diagnoses. Because of the low number of eligible electroencephalography studies, no conclusions could be reached regarding the effect of EA on the event-related potentials. CONCLUSIONS: EA relates to alterations in behavioral and neurophysiological processing of facial emotions. Our study stresses the importance of assessing age at exposure and time since EA because these factors mediate some EA-related perturbations.

An ERP study	RESEARCH IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS			English	Article						Auditory oddball; MMN; P3a; ASD; Developmental delay; Neural adaptation	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; SPEECH SOUNDS; P3 AMPLITUDE; HIGH-RISK; CHILDREN; PERCEPTION; DISCRIMINATION; METAANALYSIS; FEATURES	Background: Sound perception in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is usually at typical levels, even when auditory stimuli carry a social value, as it is the case for speech. Nevertheless, orienting to sounds in a speech context might be atypical in some individuals with ASD, which in ERP studies is reflected by a diminished P3a component. As P3 values and cognitive abilities seem to be inversely related under some circumstances, the current study investigates whether diminished attentional orienting to sounds in speech is equally observable in children with ASD with and without developmental delay (DD). Method: Children with typical development (TD, n = 17) or ASD, with or without comorbid DD (ASD/DD, n = 22, and ASD/noDD, n = 12), aged 1.5 through 4 years took part in a passive auditory oddball task while EEG data were recorded. The paradigm consisted in the presentation of two deviant stimuli (one vowel sound and one complex tone) either in a speech or in a nonspeech context. Results: We found overall more negative MMN voltages in both ASD groups compared to TD. For P3a mean voltages, we found an attenuated response in children ASD/noDD when deviant tones were presented in speech, but not in other conditions. Children with ASD/DD did not differ from TD in P3a mean voltages. Conclusion: Atypical speech sound processing might be more accentuated in children with ASD/ noDD than in their peers with comorbid DD. This finding is interpreted within the theoretical framework of neural adaptation.

This however, contrasts with recent studies showing that conflict processing, a key component of executive functions that relies on ACC, remains relatively intact in SZ. The current study aimed to investigate this issue through two well-known electrophysiological signatures of conflict processing that have been suggested to originate from ACC, i.e., the N2 component of event-related potentials (ERPs) and frontal midline theta (FMO) oscillations. We recorded 64-channel scalp electroencephalography from 29 SZ (17 women; mean age: 30.4 years) and 31 healthy control subjects (HC; 17 women; mean age: 29.1 years) performing a modified flanker task. Behavioral data revealed no significant differences in flanker conflict effects (lower accuracy and longer reaction times in incongruent trials than in congruent trials) between HC and SZ. Trial-averaged ERP and spectral analysis suggested that both N2 and FMO were significantly impaired in SZ relative to HC. Furthermore, by sorting incongruent trials according to their reaction times within individual subjects, we found that the trial-by-trial modulation of N2 (larger amplitude and longer latency in slower trials) which was observed and localized in ACC for HC was totally absent for SZ. By contrast, the trial-by-trial modulation of FMO (larger power in slower trials) was observed and localized in ACC for both groups, despite a smaller magnitude in SZ, which suggested that FMO, not N2, might serve as the neural substrate of conflict processing in SZ. Taken together, our results enrich the current neurocognitive models of SZ by revealing dissociable neural responses between N2 and FMO during conflict processing in SZ.

Mobile ear-EEG to study auditory attention in everyday life Auditory attention in everyday life	BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS			English	Article						Auditory attention; Beyond-the-lab; P3 ERP; Long-term recording; Mobile cognition		Most research investigating auditory perception is conducted in controlled laboratory settings, potentially restricting its generalizability to the complex acoustic environment outside the lab. The present study, in contrast, investigated auditory attention with long-term recordings (> 6 h) beyond the lab using a fully mobile, smartphone-based ear-centered electroencephalography (EEG) setup with minimal restrictions for participants. Twelve participants completed iterations of two variants of an oddball task where they had to react to target tones and to ignore standard tones. A rapid variant of the task (tones every 2 s, 5 min total time) was performed seated and with full focus in the morning, around noon and in the afternoon under controlled conditions. A sporadic variant (tones every minute, 160 min total time) was performed once in the morning and once in the afternoon while participants followed their normal office day routine. EEG data, behavioral data, and movement data (with a gyroscope) were recorded and analyzed. The expected increased amplitude of the P3 component in response to the target tone was observed for both the rapid and the sporadic oddball. Miss rates were lower and reaction times were faster in the rapid oddball compared to the sporadic one. The movement data indicated that participants spent most of their office day at relative rest. Overall, this study demonstrated that it is feasible to study auditory perception in everyday life with long-term ear-EEG.

J	He, Q; Pursiainen, S				He, Qin; Pursiainen, Sampsa			An extended application 'Brain Q' processing EEG and MEG data of finger stimulation extended from 'Zeffiro' based on machine learning and signal processing	COGNITIVE SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article						Machine learning; Data analysis and signal processing; Functional analysis; Dipole reconstruction; EEG and MEG data; Bayes Optimization; Cognitive computation	MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; MODELS; OSCILLATIONS	Goal: To apply signal processing and machine learning skills and knowledge in processing the EEG and MEG signal and further localize and evaluate the source of the finger stimulation. Methods: Cognitive control is usually applied in information processing and behavioral response. In the preprocessing, baseline correction is implemented to analyze the pre-stimuli, combining ERP to mark the event related potential, studying the time-locked only behavior. Z-score transform, coherence and spec trum are calculated and analyzed in the functional connectivity analysis. In addition to the functional analysis, Bayes Optimizer evaluates the neuro imaging according to the hierarchical Bayes. The introduction of the application is described from both user and developer's prospects. Results: Introduction of both user and developers aspects, on its modules from pre-processing, functional analysis and results visualization and evaluation is conducted with one specific clinical data case, including the correlation is higher especially on gamma band and the MVAR coherence on the whole source space depicting the relation between different regions, especially on somatosensory (compared by thalamus) when stimulated by finger activity, phase-lock property of the E/MEG signal and etc. Compared to a manual selection, the scaling parameter prediction can be improved with support vector machine (SVM). The evaluation results with Bayes Optimization, location prediction is superior in the somatosensory area and in the thalamus, the total reconstructed source space is larger, one of the realization of cognitive system comparing different kernels and classifiers. The SVM and discriminant classifier gives similar results evaluating the dipole localization and the parameter choice related as well to the shape parameter, noise level, hyperprior and etc. Conclusion: Approaches of Brain Q are found to be suitable for pre-processing for the EEG and MEG data. The system is capable of functional analysis including coherence and spectral related computation. Machine learning techniques are conducted as well to analyze and evaluate the result of the dipole reconstruction and help to predict the better model parameters and the localization of the origin dipoles. A case on finger stimulation clinical data is conducted and the results of the analysis temporarily and spatially manifests its functionality for users and potential extensions for developers.

Parietal P3 and midfrontal theta prospectively predict the development of adolescent alcohol use	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Adolescent alcohol use; EEG; ERP; endophenotype; longitudinal design; P3; theta	SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS; EVENT-RELATED OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIAL AMPLITUDE; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; DECISION-MAKING; HEAVY-DRINKING; FOLLOW-UP; HIGH-RISK; DRUG-USE; BRAIN	Background Subclinical adolescent alcohol use is highly prevalent and may have deleterious effects on important psychosocial and brain outcomes. Prior research has focused on identifying endophenotypes of pathological drinking, and the predictors of normative drinking remain understudied. This study investigated the incremental predictive value of two potential psychophysiological endophenotypes, P3 amplitude (an index of decision making) and midfrontal theta power (a correlate of attentional control), for prospectively predicting the expression and initiation of alcohol use emerging in adolescence. Methods A large (N = 594) epidemiological sample was prospectively assessed at ages 11/14/17. Alcohol/substance use was assessed at all ages via a computerized self-report inventory. EEG was recorded at age-14 during a visual oddball task to elicit P3 and theta. Results Reduced target-related P3 and theta at age-14 prospectively predicted drinking at age-17 independent of one another. Among alcohol-naive individuals at age-14, attenuated P3 and theta increased the odds of new-onset alcohol behaviors 3 years later. Importantly, the endophenotypes provided significant incremental predictive power of future non-clinical alcohol use beyond relevant risk factors (prior alcohol use; tobacco/illicit drug initiation; parental alcohol use disorder). Conclusions The current report is the first of our knowledge to demonstrate that deviations in parietal P3 and midfrontal theta prospectively predict the emergence of normative/non-pathological drinking. P3 and theta provide modest yet significant explanatory variance beyond prominent self-report and familial risk measures. Findings offer strong evidence supporting the predictive utility of P3 and theta as candidate endophenotypes for adolescent drinking.

J	Bruchmann, M; Schindler, S; Dinyarian, M; Straube, T				Bruchmann, Maximilian; Schindler, Sebastian; Dinyarian, Mandana; Straube, Thomas			The role of phase and orientation for ERP modulations of spectrum-manipulated fearful and neutral faces	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; ERPs; fearful faces; orientational average; P1; N170; EPN; phase spectrum	FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; SPATIAL-FREQUENCY; ATTENTION; N170; ORGANIZATION; SENSITIVITY; POTENTIALS; COMPONENTS; AWARENESS; VARIANCE	Prioritized processing of fearful compared to neutral faces has been proposed to result from evolutionary adaptation of the contrast sensitivity function (CSF) to the features of emotionally relevant faces and/or vice versa. However, it is unknown whether a stimulus merely has to feature the amplitude spectrum of a fearful face to be prioritized or whether the relevant spatial frequencies have to occur with specific phases and orientations. Prioritized processing is indexed by specific increases of Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) of the EEG and occurs throughout different early processing stages, indexed by emotion-related modulations of the P1, N170, and EPN. In this pre-registered study, we manipulated phase and amplitude properties of the Fourier spectra of neutral and fearful faces to test the effect of phase coherence (PC, face vs. scramble) and orientation coherence (OC, original vs. rotational average) and their interactions with differential emotion processing. We found that differential emotion processing was not present at the level of P1 but strongly affected N170 and EPN. In both cases, intact phase coherence was required for enhanced processing of fearful faces. OC did not interact with emotion. While faces produced the typical N170 effect, we observed a reversed effect for scrambles. Additional exploratory independent component analysis (ICA) suggests that this reversal could signal a mismatch between an early "perceptual hypothesis" and feedback of configural information. In line with our expectations, fearful-neutral differences for the N170 and EPN depend on configural information, i.e., recognizable faces.

Specifically, the study of neuro-sensory detection lends itself widely to understanding the human brain. Mismatch Negativity (MMN) is an important Event-Related Potential (ERP) response to an oddball stimulus which is preceded by repeated homogeneous stimulation. MMN is associated with perceptual learning and medical diagnostics among other applications. Currently, MMN detection relies on visual inspection of ERPs by skilled clinicians which makes for a costly, slow and subjective tool. In this paper, we use MMN to quantify the discriminative abilities of healthy or diagnosed subjects. We introduce a novel algorithmic method to extract and select important trial-specific features for discriminating standard from deviant responses. We utilize machine learning and classification approaches to evaluate our novel model using single-subject trial data while minimizing the number of necessary selection features provided by statistical test parameters and Genetic Algorithm (GA). In this work, a large variety of methods with 27 subjects, hundreds of trials and electrode counts compete for the definitive discrimination of MMN events. Our model requires only one EEG channel, a single subject and as low as five deviant tones. The results show statistically significant detection improvement over the traditional methods while maximizing resource economy.

However, most of the ErrP studies only focus on how to distinguish the correct and wrong conditions, which is not enough for the BCI application in real scenarios. Therefore, it is necessary to study the ErrPs induced by the prediction deviants with varying degrees, concurrently test the separability of such EEG features. To this end, electroencephalogram (EEG) data of twelve healthy subjects were recorded when they participated in a direction prediction experiment. There are three prediction -deviant conditions in it, i.e., correct prediction, 90 degrees deviant, 180 degrees deviant. Event-related potential and inter-trial coherence were analyzed. Consequently, the error-related negativity (ERN) and N450 component in FCZ were significantly modulated by the degrees of prediction deviants, especially in the low-frequency band (<13Hz). Moreover, single-trial classification was adopted to test the separability of these features; the averaged accuracies between any two conditions were 87.75%, 85.25%, 64.79 degrees A. This study demonstrates the prediction deviants with varying degrees can induce separable ErrP features, which provide a deeper understanding of the ErrP signatures for developing BCIs.

J	Pontynen, H; Salminen, N				Pontynen, Henri; Salminen, Nelli			Cortical Processing of Binaural Cues as Shown by EEG Responses to Random-Chord Stereograms	JARO-JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR RESEARCH IN OTOLARYNGOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Random-chord stereogram; Interaural envelope correlation; Binaural hearing; Auditory scene analysis	AUDITORY OBJECT FORMATION; INTERAURAL TIME DIFFERENCE; HUMAN EVOKED-POTENTIALS; INFORMATIONAL MASKING; TEMPORAL COHERENCE; COCKTAIL PARTY; SPATIAL RELEASE; PERCEPTUAL ORGANIZATION; STREAM SEGREGATION; CONCURRENT VOWELS	Spatial hearing facilitates the perceptual organization of complex soundscapes into accurate mental representations of sound sources in the environment. Yet, the role of binaural cues in auditory scene analysis (ASA) has received relatively little attention in recent neuroscientific studies employing novel, spectro-temporally complex stimuli. This may be because a stimulation paradigm that provides binaurally derived grouping cues of sufficient spectro-temporal complexity has not yet been established for neuroscientific ASA experiments. Random-chord stereograms (RCS) are a class of auditory stimuli that exploit spectro-temporal variations in the interaural envelope correlation of noise-like sounds with interaurally coherent fine structure; they evoke salient auditory percepts that emerge only under binaural listening. Here, our aim was to assess the usability of the RCS paradigm for indexing binaural processing in the human brain. To this end, we recorded EEG responses to RCS stimuli from 12 normal-hearing subjects. The stimuli consisted of an initial 3-s noise segment with interaurally uncorrelated envelopes, followed by another 3-s segment, where envelope correlation was modulated periodically according to the RCS paradigm. Modulations were applied either across the entire stimulus bandwidth (wideband stimuli) or in temporally shifting frequency bands (ripple stimulus). Event-related potentials and inter-trial phase coherence analyses of the EEG responses showed that the introduction of the 3- or 5-Hz wideband modulations produced a prominent change-onset complex and ongoing synchronized responses to the RCS modulations. In contrast, the ripple stimulus elicited a change-onset response but no response to ongoing RCS modulation. Frequency-domain analyses revealed increased spectral power at the fundamental frequency and the first harmonic of wideband RCS modulations. RCS stimulation yields robust EEG measures of binaurally driven auditory reorganization and has potential to provide a flexible stimulation paradigm suitable for isolating binaural effects in ASA experiments.

We assessed the ability of the EEG analysis algorithm Brain Network Analysis (BNA) to measure cognitive function in 15q13.3 deletion patients, and to differentiate between patient and control groups. EEG data was collected from 10 individuals with 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome (14-18 years of age), as well as 30 age-matched healthy controls, as the subjects responded to Auditory Oddball (AOB) and Go/NoGo cognitive tasks. It was determined that BNA can be used to evaluate cognitive function in 15q13.3 microdeletion patients. This analysis also significantly differentiates between patient and control groups using 5 scores, all of which are produced from ERP peaks related to late cortical components that represent higher cognitive functions of attention allocation and response inhibition (P < 0.05).

Successful single trial classification holds potential for translation into the clinical realm for real-time detection of memory and other cognitive states to provide real-time interventions (i.e., brain-computer interfaces). However, most of these stud-ies -and classification analyses in general - do not make clear if the chosen methodology is optimally suited for the classification of memory-related brain states. To address this problem, we systematically compared different methods for every step of classification (i.e., feature extraction, feature selection, classifier selection) to investi-gate which methods work best for decoding episodic memory brain states -the first analysis of its kind. Using an adult lifespan sample EEG dataset collected during performance of an episodic context encoding and retrieval task, we found that no specific feature type (including Common Spatial Pattern (CSP)-based features, mean, vari -ance, correlation, features based on AR model, entropy, phase, and phase synchronization) outperformed others consistently in distinguishing different memory classes. However, extracting all of these feature types consistently outperformed extracting only one type of feature. Additionally, the combination of filtering and sequential for-ward selection was the optimal method to select the effective features compared to filtering alone or performing no feature selection at all. Moreover, although all classifiers performed at a fairly similar level, LASSO was con-sistently the highest performing classifier compared to other commonly used options (i.e., naive Bayes, SVM, and logistic regression) while naive Bayes was the fastest classifier. Lastly, for multiclass classification (i.e., levels of context memory confidence and context feature perception), generalizing the binary classification using the binary decision tree performed better than the voting or one versus rest method. These methods were shown to outperform alternative approaches for three orthogonal datasets (i.e., EEG working memory, EEG motor imagery, and MEG working memory), supporting their generalizability. Our results provide an optimized methodological process for classifying single-trial neural data and provide important insight and recommendations for a cognitive neuroscientist's ability to make informed choices at all stages of the classification process for predicting memory and other cognitive states.

J	Yuan, GJ; Liu, GY				Yuan, Guangjie; Liu, Guangyuan			Mate preference and brain oscillations: Initial romantic attraction is associated with decreases in alpha- and lower beta-band power	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						event-related desynchronization; event-related potential; individual preference; mate selection; romantic attraction	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; LOVE; DECISIONS; ATTENTION; ERD/ERS; LUST	Initial romantic attraction (IRA) refers to a series of positive reactions (such as feelings of exhilaration and compulsive thinking) toward desirable potential partners, usually at initial or early-stage encounters when no close relationship has yet been established. After decades of effort, the evolutionary value and key characteristics of IRA are well understood. However, the brain mechanisms associated with IRA are unclear. To address this question, we simulated a mate selection platform similar to that of Tinder. When participants assessed their romantic interest in potential partners on the platform, their electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded in real time. The behavioral data demonstrated that IRA to ideal potential partners mainly reflects the dimensions of arousal and domination. The main study finding was that processing of the individual preference faces that resulted in IRA was associated with a decrease in power in the alpha and lower beta bands over the posterior and anterior sensor clusters; this occurred between 870 and 2,000 ms post-stimulus. Key findings regarding event-related potentials (ERPs) sensitive to individual stimuli preferences were replicated. The results support the hypothesis that brain oscillations in the alpha and lower beta range may reflect modulation in cortical activity associated with individual mate preferences.

J	Hein, TP; de Fockert, J; Ruiz, MH				Hein, Thomas P.; de Fockert, Jan; Ruiz, Maria Herrojo			State anxiety biases estimates of uncertainty and impairs reward learning in volatile environments	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Anxiety; Uncertainty; Hierarchical Bayesian inference; Computational modeling; Precision-weighted prediction error; Single-trial EEG	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; HIERARCHICAL PREDICTION ERRORS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DECISION-MAKING; TRAIT ANXIETY; FREE-ENERGY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; MODEL; MIDBRAIN; CORTEX	Clinical and subclinical (trait) anxiety impairs decision making and interferes with learning. Less understood are the effects of temporary anxious states on learning and decision making in healthy populations, and whether these can serve as a model for clinical anxiety. Here we test whether anxious states in healthy individuals elicit a pattern of aberrant behavioural, neural, and physiological responses comparable with those found in anxiety disorders-particularly when processing uncertainty in unstable environments. In our study, both a state anxious and a control group learned probabilistic stimulus-outcome mappings in a volatile task environment while we recorded their electrophysiological (EEG) signals. By using a hierarchical Bayesian model of inference and learning, we assessed the effect of state anxiety on Bayesian belief updating with a focus on uncertainty estimates. State anxiety was associated with an underestimation of environmental uncertainty, and informational uncertainty about the reward tendency. Anxious individuals' beliefs about reward contingencies were more precise (had smaller uncertainty) and thus more resistant to updating, ultimately leading to impaired reward-based learning. State anxiety was also associated with greater uncertainty about volatility. We interpret this pattern as evidence that state anxious individuals are less tolerant to informational uncertainty about the contingencies governing their environment and more willing to be uncertain about the level of stability of the world itself. Further, we tracked the neural representation of belief update signals in the trial-by-trial EEG amplitudes. In control participants, lower-level precision-weighted prediction errors (pwPEs) about reward tendencies were represented in the ERP signals across central and parietal electrodes peaking at 496 ms, overlapping with the late P300 in classical ERP analysis. The state anxiety group did not exhibit a significant representation of low-level pwPEs, and there were no significant differences between the groups. Smaller variance in low-level pwPE about reward tendencies in state anxiety could partially account for the null results. Expanding previous computational work on trait anxiety, our findings establish that temporary anxious states in healthy individuals impair reward-based learning in volatile environments, primarily through changes in uncertainty estimates, which play a central role in current Bayesian accounts of perceptual inference and learning.

New Method: In this paper we describe an infrastructure for the development of standardized procedures for semi and fully automated pre-processing of EEG data. Our pipeline incorporates several methods to isolate cortical signal from noise, maintain maximal information from raw recordings and provide comprehensive quality control and data visualization. In addition, batch processing procedures are integrated to scale up analyses for processing hundreds or thousands of data sets using HPC clusters. Results: We demonstrate here that by using the EEG Integrated Platform Lossless (EEG-IP-L) pipeline's signal quality annotations, significant increase in data retention is achieved when applying subsequent post-processing ERP segment rejection procedures. Further, we demonstrate that the increase in data retention does not attenuate the ERP signal. Conclusions: The EEG-IP-L state provides the infrastructure for an integrated platform that includes long-term data storage, minimal data manipulation and maximal signal retention, and flexibility in post processing strategies.

J	Keefe, JM; Stormer, VS				Keefe, Jonathan M.; Stormer, Viola S.			Lateralized alpha activity and slow potential shifts over visual cortex track the time course of both endogenous and exogenous orienting of attention	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							SPATIAL ATTENTION; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; EEG; MODULATION; MECHANISMS; COMPONENTS; COMPETITION; INHIBITION; VOLUNTARY; REFLECT	Spatial attention can be oriented endogenously, based on current task goals, or exogenously, triggered by salient events in the environment. Based upon literature demonstrating differences in the time course and neural substrates of each type of orienting, these two attention systems are often treated as fundamentally distinct. However, recent studies suggest that rhythmic neural activity in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) and slow waves in the event-related potential (ERP) may emerge over parietal-occipital cortex following both endogenous and exogenous attention cues. To assess whether these neural changes index common processes of spatial attention, we conducted two within-subject experiments varying the two main dimensions over which endogenous and exogenous attention tasks typically differ: cue informativity (spatially predictive vs. non-predictive) and cue format (centrally vs. peripherally presented). This task design allowed us to tease apart neural changes related to top-down goals and those driven by the reflexive orienting of spatial attention, and examine their interactions in a novel hybrid cross-modal attention task. Our data demonstrate that both central and peripheral cues elicit lateralized ERPs over parietal-occipital cortex, though at different points in time, consistent with these ERPs reflecting the orienting of spatial attention. Lateralized alpha activity was also present across all tasks, emerging rapidly for peripheral cues and sustaining longer for spatially informative cues. Overall, these data indicate that distinct slow-wave ERPs index the spatial orienting of endogenous and exogenous attention, while lateralized alpha activity represents a common signature of visual-cortical biasing in anticipation of potential targets across both types of attention.

Participants were instructed to grasp a handle and rotate it to a target position according to a given visual cue. After participants started their movements, a secondary cue was triggered, which indicated whether the initial or final goals had changed (or not) while the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. The results showed that the perturbed initial goals significantly slowed down the reaching action, compared to the perturbed final goals. In the event-related potentials (ERPs), a larger anterior P3 and a larger central-distributed late positivity (600-700 ms) time-locked to the perturbations were found for the initial than for the final goal perturbations. Source analyses found stronger left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) activations for the perturbed initial goals than for the perturbed final goals in the P3 time window. These findings suggest that perturbations in the initial goals have stronger interferences with the execution of grasp-to-rotate movements than perturbations in the final goals. The interferences seem to be derived from both inappropriate action inhibitions and new action implementations during the movement correction.

Early institutionalized care disrupts the development of emotion processing in prosody	DEVELOPMENT AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; emotion recognition; ERPs; institutionalized care; prosody	COMMUNICATING EMOTION; EARLY INTERVENTION; BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS; EARLY DEPRIVATION; BRAIN RESPONSES; CHILDREN; FACE; RECOGNITION; EXPRESSIONS; LANGUAGE	Millions of children worldwide are raised in institutionalized settings. Unfortunately, institutionalized rearing is often characterized by psychosocial deprivation, leading to difficulties in numerous social, emotional, physical, and cognitive skills. One such skill is the ability to recognize emotional facial expressions. Children with a history of institutional rearing tend to be worse at recognizing emotions in facial expressions than their peers, and this deficit likely affects social interactions. However, emotional information is also conveyed vocally, and neither prosodic information processing nor the cross-modal integration of facial and prosodic emotional expressions have been investigated in these children to date. We recorded electroencephalograms (EEG) while 47 children under institutionalized care (IC) (n = 24) or biological family care (BFC) (n = 23) viewed angry, happy, or neutral facial expressions while listening to pseudowords with angry, happy, or neutral prosody. The results indicate that 20- to 40-month-olds living in IC have event-related potentials (ERPs) over midfrontal brain regions that are less sensitive to incongruent facial and prosodic emotions relative to children under BFC, and that their brain responses to prosody are less lateralized. Children under IC also showed midfrontal ERP differences in processing of angry prosody, indicating that institutionalized rearing may specifically affect the processing of anger.

P300 Characterization Through Granger Causal Connectivity in the Context of Brain-Computer Interface Technologies	ADVANCES IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, IWANN 2021, PT I	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	16th International Work-Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (IWANN)	JUN 16-18, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	Univ Granada, Univ Malaga, Polytechn Univ Catalonia		Brain networks; Standard electrodes; Functional connectivity; Event-related potential; Bayesian linear discriminant analysis; Sequential forward electrode selection; EEG signal; Oddball paradigm; Inter-subject variability	CLASSIFICATION; ODDBALL	The analysis of connectivity in brain networks has been widely researched and it has been shown that certain cognitive processes require the integration of distributed brain areas. Functional connectivity attempts to statistically quantify the interdependence between these brain areas. In this paper, we propose an analysis of functional connectivity in the Event-Related Potential (ERP) context, more specifically on the P300 component using the Granger Causality measure. To this end, we propose a methodology that consists in quantifying the causality in the P300 and non-P300 signals in the context of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). Causality is calculated using two approaches: i) using standard electrodes and, ii) using electrodes selected using Bayesian Linear Discriminant Analysis and sequential forward electrode selection (BLDA-FS). Based on this analysis, it is shown that the Granger Causality metric is valid to show a significant connectivity difference between P300 and non-P300 signals. The electrodes selected using BLDA-FS were found to be more discriminative in this regard. Studying functional connectivity using Granger Causality allowed us to identify the changes in connectivity detected during the presence of a target stimulus compared to a non-target stimulus. This additional information about the connectivity differences found can be incorporated as a new feature in further studies, allowing for better detection of the P300 signal and consequently improving the performance of P300-based BCIs.

The Late Positive Potential as a Reliable Neural Marker of Cognitive Reappraisal in Children and Youth: A Brief Review of the Research Literature	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review						emotion regulation; cognitive reappraisal; electroencephalogram; late positive potential; child and youth mental health	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FRONTAL EEG ASYMMETRY; EMOTION REGULATION; MENTAL-HEALTH; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ADOLESCENT HEALTH; ANXIETY; CHILDHOOD; PICTURES; ERP	The mental health of young people is a growing public health concern. With socio-emotional difficulties in youth often resulting in psychiatric disorders later in life and most with mental health conditions rather stabilizing in time, it is essential to support healthy socio-emotional development. With a comprehensive definition of mental health, since emotion regulation (ER) plays a critical role in prevention, it becomes imperative to better understand how children effectively manage their emotions from an early age. Determining effective use of ER skills relies on adequate measurements. Typical methods of data collection in children present consistent shortcomings. This review addresses research findings considering the suitability of the late positive potential measured through electroencephalogram as a neural indicator of ER in children and youth. There is growing evidence, as reported in this review, that indicates that the late positive potential may be a reliable neural indicator of children's cognitive reappraisal abilities more specifically. Results generally suggest that the late positive potential amplitudes are sensitive to directed reappraisal in children. However, given the scant research, questions remain regarding developmental trends, methodology, interindividual variability, reappraisal of various stimuli, and how the late positive potential may relate to more traditional measures of ER. Directions for future research are provided, which are expected to address unanswered research questions and fill literature gaps. Taken together, the findings reviewed indicate that the late positive potential is generally sensitive to directed cognitive reappraisal in children and that there is promise of establishing this neural marker as an indicator of ER.

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a leading genetic cause of intellectual disability and ASD behaviors. As in most children with ASD, atypical sensory processing is a common symptom in FXS, frequently manifesting as sensory hypersensitivity. Auditory hypersensitivity is a highly debilitating condition in FXS that may lead to language delays, social anxiety and ritualized repetitive behaviors. Animal models of FXS, including Fmr1 knock out (KO) mouse, also show auditory hypersensitivity, providing a translation relevant platform to study underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. The focus of this review is to summarize recent studies in the Fmr1 KO mouse that identified neural correlates of auditory hypersensitivity. We review results of electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in the Fmr1 KO mice and highlight EEG phenotypes that are remarkably similar to EEG findings in humans with FXS. The EEG phenotypes associated with the loss of FMRP include enhanced resting EEG gamma band power, reduced cross frequency coupling, reduced sound-evoked synchrony of neural responses at gamma band frequencies, increased event-related potential amplitudes, reduced habituation of neural responses and increased non-phase locked power. In addition, we highlight the postnatal period when the EEG phenotypes develop and show a strong association of the phenotypes with enhanced matrix-metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity, abnormal development of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing inhibitory interneurons and reduced formation of specialized extracellular matrix structures called perineuronal nets (PNNs). Finally, we discuss how dysfunctions of inhibitory PV interneurons may contribute to cortical hyperexcitability and EEG abnormalities observed in FXS. Taken together, the studies reviewed here indicate that EEG recordings can be utilized in both pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, while at the same time, used to identify cellular and circuit mechanisms of dysfunction in FXS. New therapeutic approaches that reduce MMP-9 activity and restore functions of PV interneurons may succeed in reducing FXS sensory symptoms. Future studies should examine long-lasting benefits of developmental vs. adult interventions on sensory phenotypes.

While many studies have investigated how isolated elements of tonal and rhythmic properties are processed in the human brain, it remains unclear whether these findings with such controlled stimuli are generalizable to complex stimuli in the real world. In the current study, we present an analytical framework of a linearized encoding analysis based on a set of music information retrieval features to investigate the rapid cortical encoding of tonal and rhythmic hierarchies in natural music. We applied this framework to a public domain EEG dataset (OpenMIIR) to deconvolve overlapping EEG responses to various musical features in continuous music. In particular, the proposed framework investigated the EEG encoding of the following features: tonal stability, key clarity, beat, and meter. This analysis revealed a differential spatiotemporal neural encoding of beat and meter, but not of tonal stability and key clarity. The results demonstrate that this framework can uncover associations of ongoing brain activity with relevant musical features, which could be further extended to other relevant measures such as time-resolved emotional responses in future studies.

However, brain indicators of communication are typically observed only after speech act onset, and it is unclear when any anticipatory brain activity prior to speaking might first emerge, along with the communicative intentions it possibly reflects. Here, we investigated brain activity prior to the production of different speech act types, request and naming actions performed by uttering single words embedded into language games with a partner, similar to natural communication. Starting ca. 600 msec before speech onset, an event-related potential maximal at fronto-central electrodes, which resembled the Readiness Potential, was larger when preparing requests compared to naming actions. Analysis of the cortical sources of this anticipatory brain potential suggests a relatively stronger involvement of fronto-central motor regions for requests, which may reflect the speaker's expectation of the partner actions typically following requests, e.g., the handing over of a requested object. Our results indicate that different neuronal circuits underlying the processing of different speech act types activate already before speaking. Results are discussed in light of previous work addressing the neural basis of speech act understanding and predictive brain indexes of language comprehension. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Development of the N400 for Word Learning in the First 2 Years of Life: A Systematic Review	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review						infants (birth to 2 years); N400; event related potentials; lexicon acquisition; word learning; semantic processing; language acquisition	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; VOCABULARY GROWTH; CEREBRAL SPECIALIZATION; LANGUAGE-ACQUISITION; BRAIN RESPONSES; FAMILIAR WORDS; ERP EVIDENCE; AT-RISK; INFANTS	The N400 ERP component is a direct neural index of word meaning. Studies show that the N400 component is already present in early infancy, albeit often delayed. Many researchers capitalize on this finding, using the N400 component to better understand how early language acquisition unfolds. However, variability in how researchers quantify the N400 makes it difficult to set clear predictions or build theory. Not much is known about how the N400 component develops in the first 2 years of life in terms of its latency and topographical distributions, nor do we know how task parameters affect its appearance. In the current paper we carry out a systematic review, comparing over 30 studies that report the N400 component as a proxy of semantic processing elicited in infants between 0 and 24 months old who listened to linguistic stimuli. Our main finding is that there is large heterogeneity across semantic-priming studies in reported characteristics of the N400, both with respect to latency and to distributions. With age, the onset of the N400 insignificantly decreases, while its offset slightly increases. We also examined whether the N400 appears different for recently-acquired novel words vs. existing words: both situations reveal heterogeneity across studies. Finally, we inspected whether the N400 was modulated differently with studies using a between-subject design. In infants with more proficient language skills the N400 was more often present or showed itself here with earlier latency, compared to their peers; but no consistent patterns were observed for distribution characteristics of the N400. One limitation of the current review is that we compared studies that widely differed in choice of EEG recordings, pre-processing steps and quantification of the N400, all of which could affect the characteristics of the infant N400. The field is still missing research that systematically tests development of the N400 using the same paradigm across infancy.

However, most of these studies mainly reported behavioral data and were conducted on highly hypnotizable individuals. Thus, the question of the neural locus of the effects and their generalizability remains open. In the present study, we used the Stroop task in a within-subject design to test the neurocognitive effects of two hypnotic suggestions: the perceptual request to focus only on the central letter of the words and the semantic request to observe meaningless symbols. Behavioral results indicated that the two types of suggestions did not alter response time (RT), but both favored more accurate performance compared to the control condition. Both types of suggestions increased sensory awareness and reduced discriminative visual attention, but the perceptual request selectively engaged more executive control of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and the semantic request selectively suppressed the temporal cortex activity devoted to graphemic analysis of the words. The present findings demonstrated that the perceptual and the semantic hypnotic suggestions reduced Stroop errors through common and specific top-down modulations of different neurocognitive processes but left the semantic activation unaltered. Finally, as we also recruited participants with a medium level of hypnotizability, the present data might be considered potentially representative of the majority of the population.

However, the neural mechanisms underlying LFS are poorly understood. We investigated cortical activation changes occurring during LFS and if changes were associated with reduced nociceptive processing and increased amplitude of spontaneous cortical oscillations post-treatment. Methods: LFS was applied to the radial nerve of 25 healthy volunteers over two sessions using active (1 Hz) or sham (0.02 Hz) frequencies. Changes in resting electroencephalography (EEG) and laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) were investigated before and after LFS. Somatosensory-evoked potentials were recorded during LFS and source analysis was carried out. Results: Ipsilateral midcingulate and operculo-insular cortex source activity declined linearly during LFS. Active LFS was associated with attenuated long-latency LEP amplitude in ipsilateral frontocentral elec-trodes and increased resting alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (16-24 Hz) band power in electrodes overlying operculo-insular, sensorimotor and frontal cortical regions. Reduced ipsilateral operculo-insular cortex source activity during LFS correlated with a smaller post-treatment alpha-band power increase. Conclusions: LFS attenuated somatosensory processing both during and after stimulation. Significance: Results further our understanding of the attenuation of somatosensory processing both dur -ing and after LFS. (c) 2021 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Assessing Cognitive Capacity by P3 During a Complex Manual Control Task	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						manual docking task; secondary task; free cognitive capacity; P3 brain potential	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DUAL-TASK; ERP; PERFORMANCE; STIMULI; COMPONENTS; RESOURCES; WORKLOAD	Our aim was to adapt a classical P3 method to assess the free cognitive capacity during spacecraft docking training in space. Electroencephalogram (EEG) measurement in space is limited by several conditions. Based on experience with our own EEG experiments on MIR and ISS, we decided to use dry electrodes and restricted the electrode placement to the forehead. We examined whether P3 can be reliably obtained under these conditions. Subjects had to perform a manually controlled docking task simultaneously with an acoustic monitory task. The P3 component was evoked by the acoustic stimuli of the secondary task. Twenty-six subjects participated in this study, situated in a space simulation on earth. After a familiarization session, they performed the docking tasks at three difficulty levels: low, medium, and difficult. In the secondary task, subjects had to discriminate between a low (750 Hz) and a high (1,000 Hz) tone, which differed in probability of 90% and 10%, respectively. The subjects had to count the high tone and after 10 relevant tones and had to give a voice command to a power supply configuration. P3 amplitude was largest and the latency shortest during the medium difficult task. A decision matrix based on differences between the relevant and irrelevant P3 was calculated for each subject and each task. The results suggest that P3 can be recorded during a complex manual control task and can be used to assess individual free cognitive capacity.

Early and late components of the RP may indicate clinical-neurophysiological features such as motivation, preparation, intention, and initiation of voluntary movements. In the present study, we hypothesized that electrical pain stimuli modulate the preparatory brain activity for movement. The grand average evoked potentials were measured at sensory motor regions with EEG during an experimental protocol consisting of painful and nonpainful stimuli. Our results demonstrated that painful stimuli were preceded by an enhanced RP when compared to non-painful stimuli at the Cz channel (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the mean amplitude of the RP at the early phase was significantly higher for the painful stimuli when compared to the non-painful stimuli (p < 0.05). Our results indicate that electrical painful stimuli, which can be considered as an unpleasant and stressful condition, modulate the motor preparation at sensory motor regions to a different extent when compared to non-painful electrical stimuli. Since early component of the RP represents cortical activation due to anticipation of the stimuli and the allocation of attentional resources, our results suggest that painful stimuli may affect the motor preparation processes and the prediction of the movement at the cortical level.

J	Leandri, G; Schenone, A; Leandri, M				Leandri, Gaia; Schenone, Angelo; Leandri, Massimo			Detection of movement related cortical potentials in freehand drawing on digital tablet*	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Movement related potentials; Steady state; Motivation; Creativity; Freehand drawing; Tablet	FINGER	Background: Cortical activity connected to movements has been investigated long since, and is related, among other factors, to saliency of the gesture. However, experiments performed on movements in actual situations are rare, as most of them have been performed in laboratory simulations. Besides, no research seems to have been carried out on subjects during freehand drawing. New method: We propose a method based upon a commercial drawing tablet and wireless pen, that has been synchronized with EEG recording by means of a piezoelectric sensor attached to the pen tip. Complete freedom of movement is allowed, and any kind of drawing style can be performed using currently available graphics software. Results: EEG recordings during meaningful drawing were compared with recordings where the pen was tapped and shifted on tablet without specific purpose. With reference to T0 event (pen touching tablet), several components could be observed in pre- and post-T0 epochs. The most important appeared to be a triphasic wave (N150, P-40 and N + 30), where P-40 showed a striking difference between drawing and tap session, being much larger in the former. Comparison with existing methods: Onset of muscle EMG is usually employed for synchronization. In complex and free gestures too many muscles are active to allow reliable identification of such reference. Our method provides a precise trigger event easily detected without movement constraints. Conclusions: With this method it will be possible to record EEG activity related to creative aspects of drawing and explore other skilled movements.

All of these early life adversities can have long-lasting effects on brain function, especially the executive functions. Working memory, as one of the most studied aspects of executive functions, is also reported to be impaired in children with early adversity. However, limited data are available regarding how early life adverse events affect the neural dynamic associated with working memory processing in AIDS orphans. This study applied the electroencephalogram (EEG) technique to investigate the working memory process in 81 AIDS orphans and 62 non-orphan controls with n-back tasks. Results from EEG analysis and time-frequency analysis showed that AIDS orphans displayed smaller N2 and larger P2, P3 activation as well as enhanced theta and attenuated alpha band oscillations compared to the controls. The present findings indicated a deficit in working memory process in AIDS orphans and suggested that this deficit might be due to the impairments in attention allocation, detection and classi?cation of stimuli and updating process in working memory.

Brain responses to such self-initiated sounds have been shown to be attenuated, in particular the so-called N1 component measured with electroencephalography (EEG). This attenuation has been proposed to be the effect of an internal forward model that allows for cancellation of the sensory consequences of a motor command. In the current study we asked whether the attenuation due to self-initiation of a sound also affects a later event-related potential - the so-called motion-onset response - that arises in response to moving sounds. To this end, volunteers were instructed to move their index fingers either left or rightward which resulted in virtual movement of a sound either to the left or to the right. In Experiment 1, sound motion was induced with in-ear head-phones by shifting interaural time and intensity differences and thus shifting the intracranial sound image. We compared the motion-onset responses under two conditions: a) congruent, and b) incongruent. In the congruent condition, the sound image moved in the direction of the finger movement, while in the incongruent condition sound motion was in the opposite direction of the finger movement. Clear motion-onset responses with a negative cN1 component peaking at about 160 ms and a positive cP2 component peaking at about 230 ms after motion-onset were obtained for both the congruent and incongruent conditions. However, the motion-onset responses did not significantly differ between congruent and incongruent conditions in amplitude or latency. In Experiment 2, in which sounds were presented with loudspeakers, we observed attenuation for self-induced versus externally triggered sound motion-onset, but again, there was no difference between congruent and incongruent conditions. In sum, these two experiments suggest that the motion-onset response measured by EEG can be attenuated for self-generated sounds. However, our result did not indicate that this attenuation depended on congruency of action and sound motion direction.

This has been investigated using oddball designs in which sequences of often-appearing (i.e., expected) stimuli are interspersed with rare (i.e., surprising) deviants. Resulting differences in electrophysiological responses following surprising compared to expected stimuli are known as visual mismatch responses (VMRs). VMRs are thought to index co-occurring contributions of stimulus repetition effects, expectation suppression (that occurs when one's expectations are fulfilled), and expectation violation (i.e., surprise) responses; however, these different effects have been conflated in existing oddball designs. To better isolate and quantify effects of expectation suppression and surprise, we adapted an oddball design based on Fast Periodic Visual Stimulation (FPVS) that controls for stimulus repetition effects. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) while participants (N = 48) viewed stimulation sequences in which a single face identity was periodically presented at 6 Hz. Critically, one of two different face identities (termed oddballs) appeared as every 7th image throughout the sequence. The presentation probabilities of each oddball image within a sequence varied between 10 and 90%, such that participants could form expectations about which oddball face identity was more likely to appear within each sequence. We also included 'expectation neutral' 50% probability sequences, whereby consistently biased expectations would not be formed for either oddball face identity. We found that VMRs indexed surprise responses, and effects of expectation suppression were absent. That is, ERPs were more negative-going at occipitoparietal electrodes for surprising compared to neutral oddballs, but did not differ between expected and neutral oddballs. Surprising oddball-evoked ERPs were also highly similar across the 10-40% appearance probability conditions. Our findings indicate that VMRs which are not accounted for by repetition effects are best described as an all-or-none surprise response, rather than a minimisation of prediction error responses associated with expectation suppression.

Evidence for such integration is that odors can have taste properties (odor-induced taste). Most brain areas involved in flavor perception are high-level areas; however, primary gustatory and olfactory areas also show activations in response to a combination of odor and taste. While the regions involved in flavor perception are now quite well identified, the network's organization is not yet understood. Using a close to real salty soup model with electroencephalography brain recording, we evaluated whether odor-induced saltiness enhancement would result in differences of amplitude and/or latency in late cognitive P3 peak mostly and/or in P1 early sensory peak. Three target solutions were created from the same base of green-pea soup: i) with a "usual" salt concentration (PPS2), ii) with "reduced" salt (PPS1: -50%), and iii) with reduced salt and a "beef stock" odor (PPS1B). Sensory data showed that the beef odor produced saltiness enhancement in PPS1B in comparison to PPS1. As the main EEG result, the late cognitive P3 peak was delayed by 25 ms in the odor-added solution PPS1B compared to PPS1. The odor alone did not explain this peak amplitude and higher latency in the P3 peak. These results support the classical view that high-level integratory areas process odor-taste interactions with potential top-down effects on primary sensory regions. (C) 2020 IBRO.

Previous studies have provided behavioral evidence of atypical auditory processing towards IDS in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), while the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms remain unknown. This event-related potential (ERP) study investigated the neural coding of formant-exaggerated speech and nonspeech in 24 4- to 11-year-old children with ASD and 24 typically-developing (TD) peers. The EEG data were recorded using an alternating block design, in which each stimulus type (exaggerated/non-exaggerated sound) was presented with equal probability. ERP waveform analysis revealed an enhanced P1 for vowel formant exaggeration in the TD group but not in the ASD group. This speech-specific atypical processing in ASD was not found for the nonspeech stimuli which showed similar P1 enhancement in both ASD and TD groups. Moreover, the time-frequency analysis indicated that children with ASD showed differences in neural synchronization in the delta-theta bands for processing acoustic formant changes embedded in nonspeech. Collectively, the results add substantiating neurophysiological evidence (i.e., a lack of neural enhancement effect of vowel exaggeration) for atypical auditory processing of IDS in children with ASD, which may exert a negative effect on phonetic encoding and language learning. Lay summary Atypical responses to motherese might act as a potential early marker of risk for children with ASD. This study investigated the neural responses to such socially relevant stimuli in the ASD brain, and the results suggested a lack of neural enhancement responding to the motherese even in individuals without intellectual disability.

Luan			Psychometric properties of the late positive potential in combat-exposed veterans	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						ERPs; Emotion; Late positive potential; Post-traumatic stress disorder; Psychometrics		Trauma exposure is prevalent, associated with multiple forms of psychopathology, and thought to alter the neurobiological substrates of threat processing. The late positive potential (LPP) is an event-related potential (ERP) that may be a clinically useful probe of the neurobiology of threat processing. Despite evidence that combat-exposed veterans exhibit aberrant threat modulation of the LPP, no studies to date have tested the psychometric properties of the LPP in combat trauma-exposed, symptomatic veterans. The primary aim of the current study was to evaluate the reliability (internal consistency, retest reliability) and convergent validity of LPP modulation by threatening faces and scenes in two common tasks among combat-exposed veterans. Participants included 82 combat-exposed veterans who completed face-matching and emotion regulation tasks during EEG recording at baseline and twelve weeks. Internal consistencies of the early LPP time windows (<1000 ms) were acceptable in both tasks, whereas they were poor in late time windows (>1000 ms). Twelve-week retest reliabilities were fair for the early window LPPs to threatening scenes and fear faces, as well as in the late time window for fear faces. Reliabilities were better for individual condition compared to difference scores. Finally, LPPs modulated by threatening scenes and faces were unrelated. Together, these results suggest that the LPPs to threatening scenes and faces reflect distinct forms of threat processing in combat-exposed veterans, and their reliabilities for the early window indicate potential clinical utility in this population.

Aims: In this preliminary study, we used event-related potentials to examine the recognition process in a visual episodic memory task in cannabis users (CU) and cannabis polydrug users (PU). We hypothesized that CU and PU will have both-behavioral and psychophysiological-indicators of memory processes affected, compared to matched non-using controls with the PU expressing more severe changes. Methods 29 non-using controls (CG), 24 CU and 27 PU were enrolled into the study. All participants completed a visual learning recognition task while brain electrical activity was recorded. Event-related potentials were calculated for familiar (old) and new images from a signal recorded during a subsequent recognition test. We used receiver operating characteristic curves for behavioral data analysis. Results The groups did not differ in memory performance based on receiver operating characteristic method in accuracy and discriminability indicators nor mean reaction times for old/new images. The frontal old/new effect expected from prior research was observed for all participants, while a parietal old/new effect was not observed. While, the significant differences in the late parietal component (LPC) amplitude was observed between CG and PU but not between CG and CU nor CU and PU. Linear regression analysis was used to examine the mean amplitude of the LPC component as a predictor of memory performance accuracy indicator. LPC amplitude predicts recognition accuracy only in the CG. Conclusion The results showed alterations in recognition memory processing in CU and PU groups compared to CG, which were not manifested on the behavioral level, and were the most prominent in cannabis polydrug users. We interpret it as a manifestation of the cumulative effect of multiple drug usage in the PU group.

The neural sources of the MMN have been previously attributed to a fronto-temporo-parietal network which crucially overlaps with the so-called auditory dorsal stream, involving inferior and middle frontal, inferior parietal, and superior and middle temporal regions. These cortical areas are structurally connected by the arcuate fasciculus (AF), a three-branch pathway supporting the feedback-feedforward loop involved in auditory-motor integration, auditory working memory, storage of acoustic templates, as well as comparison and update of those templates. Here, we characterized the individual differences in the white-matter macrostructural properties of the AF and explored their link to the electrophysiological marker of passive change detection gathered in a melodic multifeature MMN-EEG paradigm in 26 healthy young adults without musical training. Our results show that left fronto-temporal white-matter connectivity plays an important role in the pre-attentive detection of rhythm modulations within a melody. Previous studies have shown that this AF segment is also critical for language processing and learning. This strong coupling between structure and function in auditory change detection might be related to life-time linguistic (and possibly musical) exposure and experiences, as well as to timing processing specialization of the left auditory cortex. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in which the relationship between neurophysiological (EEG) and brain whitematter connectivity indexes using DTI-tractography are studied together. Thus, the present results, although still exploratory, add to the existing evidence on the importance of studying the constraints imposed on cognitive functions by the underlying structural connectivity.

Impact of emotionally-charged images and trial order on downstream cognitive processing: An ERP study	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Emotion regulation; Cognitive processing; Trial order; N2; LPP; ERP	ELECTROCORTICAL RESPONSE; NEURAL MECHANISMS; NEGATIVITY BIAS; TIME-COURSE; BRAIN; ATTENTION; REAPPRAISAL; COMPONENT; PICTURES; MODULATE	Theories of emotion-cognition interactions suggest that emotional valence can both facilitate or limit cognitive performance. One cause for the mixed findings may be the order (random versus non-random presentation) in which emotional stimuli are presented. To investigate the impact of stimuli order on cognitive control processing, EEG data were recorded as 130 undergraduate students (M age = 22.2, SD = 5.4; 79 female) completed a modified version of the AX-Continuous Performance Task in which the cue was followed by an emotionallyvalenced image (positive, negative, and neutral). Specifically, the task was designed so that valenced images were presented in either a block or random order, prior to probe presentation. We examined two event-related potentials (ERPs), the N2, which reflects aspects of cognitive control, and the late positive potential (LPP), which reflects attention allocation to emotional stimuli. We assessed the impact of emotionally oriented attention (LPP) on downstream cognitive control (N2) and how this relationship might differ for a block versus random (order of emotional image) task design. Consistent with the LPP literature, we found a main effect of image valence with the negative trials showing larger LPPs than the positive and neutral trials. For N2s, we found that the negative trials were associated with smaller N2s than both the positive and neutral trials. We observed that as LPP amplitude increased, subsequent N2 amplitude was reduced, specifically for negative trials in the random design. These results suggest an emotion-related depletion of neural cognitive resources. Lastly, we found larger N2s for the block design versus the random design. Together, these results indicate the importance of paying attention to both trial order (block versus random) and within trial stimulus sequence when designing emotion induction tasks.

However, the decoding of premovements from EEG signals remains a challenge for noninvasive BCI. This work aims to decode human intention (movement or rest) before movement onset from EEG signals. We propose to decode premovement patterns from movement-related cortical potential activities with task-related component analysis and canonical correlation patterns (TRCA+CCPs). Specifically, we first optimize the MRCP data with the spatial filter TRCA. CCPs are then extracted from the optimized signals. The extracted CCPs are classified with the linear discriminated analysis classifier. We applied the classification in a sliding window, which changes from readiness potential (RP section) to movement-monitoring potential (MMP section). The classification result on event-related desynchronization (ERD) indicates that the motor cortex becomes active as the limbs move. When applying classification between elbow flexion and rest, the proposed TRCA+CCP method achieves an accuracy of 0.9001 +/- 0.0997 in the RP section. The previous methods, discriminative canonical pattern matching + common spatial pattern (DCPM+CSP) and the optimized DCPM+CSP method, exhibit accuracy values of 0.7827 +/- 0.1276 and 0.8141 +/- 0.1295 for the RP section, respectively. Compared with these methods, the proposed TRCA+CCP method achieves higher average accuracy in the RP section. The proposed TRCA+CCP method can decode the patterns in the RP section efficiently, which indicates that the premovement patterns in EEG signals can be decoded before execution of the movement. The system is expected to assist movement detection in ERD analysis.

These interfaces record a user's brain activity and translate it into control commands for external devices, thus providing the PNS with additional artificial outputs. In this framework, the BCIs based on the P300 Event-Related Potentials (ERP), which represent the electrical responses recorded from the brain after specific events or stimuli, have proven to be particularly successful and robust. The presence or the absence of a P300 evoked potential within the EEG features is determined through a classification algorithm. Linear classifiers such as stepwise linear discriminant analysis and support vector machine (SVM) are the most used discriminant algorithms for ERPs' classification. Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the EEG signals, multiple stimulation sequences (a.k.a. iterations) are carried out and then averaged before the signals being classified. However, while augmenting the number of iterations improves the Signal-to-Noise Ratio, it also slows down the process. In the early studies, the number of iterations was fixed (no stopping environment), but recently several early stopping strategies have been proposed in the literature to dynamically interrupt the stimulation sequence when a certain criterion is met in order to enhance the communication rate. In this work, we explore how to improve the classification performances in P300 based BCIs by combining optimization and machine learning. First, we propose a new decision function that aims at improving classification performances in terms of accuracy and Information Transfer Rate both in a no stopping and early stopping environment. Then, we propose a new SVM training problem that aims to facilitate the target-detection process. Our approach proves to be effective on several publicly available datasets.

Sequential gains and losses during gambling feedback: Differential effects in time-frequency delta and theta measures	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						decision-making; feedback processing; oscillation; time frequency analyses; reward; sequential outcomes	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; TO-TARGET INTERVAL; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; MEDIOFRONTAL NEGATIVITIES; REWARD POSITIVITY; P300; ERROR; ERP	One critical aspect of reward-feedback is the impact of local outcome history-how past experiences with choices and outcomes influences current behavior and neural activity. Yet, prior event-related potential work in this area has been contentious. This study contributes to this field by using time-frequency measures to better isolate constituent processes. Specifically, we identify how theta and delta are differentially sensitive to local outcome history. Participants completed a binary monetary choice task while we collected EEG data. Unbeknownst to them, trial outcomes were manipulated into pre-determined sequences, ranging from one to eight gains or losses in a row. Analyses were arranged by sequence establishment (first 2 trials of a sequence) and continuation (prolonged sequences of 3-8 trials). During the establishment of a sequence, delta activity to gains and losses were virtually identical on the first (change) trial, demonstrating marked divergence only on the second trial. This difference grew throughout the continuation period, as delta activity was sustained with accruing gains but declined with multiple losses. Theta activity, conversely, demonstrated a maximal loss-gain difference on the change trial but was insensitive to the establishment of a new sequence. Differential theta activity between outcomes decreased as sequences continued, with theta activity increasing over accruing gains and remaining stable over losses. Results indicate that delta-gain and theta-loss signals are relatively stable across sequential outcomes. Furthermore, theta is most sensitive to loss-gain differences on the initial change trial, while delta is more sensitive to gain-loss differences with the continuation of a sequence.

Early auditory-evoked potentials in body dysmorphic disorder: An ERP/ sLORETA study	PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH			English	Article						Body Dysmorphic Disorder; EEG; N100 component; Prepulse Inhibition; sLORETA	ACOUSTIC STARTLE RESPONSE; TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; PREPULSE INHIBITION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; N1 WAVE; REFLEX; CORTEX; SCHIZOPHRENIA; FACILITATION; COMPONENTS	Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is characterized by excessive preoccupation with imagined or slight physical defects in appearance. BDD is associated with cognitive impairments (attention, visual processing). Our study aims to evaluate the early neural responses (N100, P200) to prepulse inhibition (PPI) and prepulse facilitation (PPF), to investigate attentional processing of BDD in the auditory domain. Fifty-five adults took part: 30 BDD patients and 25 healthy controls. We compared their brain responses to PPI and PPF by analyzing global field power (GFP), event-related potentials (ERPs) and their respective sources. BDD exhibited reduced N100 amplitudes compared to healthy controls in response to the startle tone elicited by both PPI and PPF, potentially suggesting impaired allocation of attention. Interestingly, the lower the GFP at the N100, the higher the BDD severity. Source reconstruction analysis showed reduced activation for BDD during the N100 time window in PPI. Scalp responses and source activations in PPI were decreased overall compared to PPF, confirming the gating effect of PPI. We provided evidence that the N100 may serve as an electrophysiological marker of BDD, predicting its severity. Our study demonstrated the potential of using ERPs combined with behavioural PPI and PPF protocols to advance our understanding of BDD pathophysiology.

J	Gosselin, L; Sabourin, L				Gosselin, Leah; Sabourin, Laura			Lexical-semantic processing costs are not inherent to intra-sentential code-switching: The role of switching habits	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Code-switching; Event-related potentials; Bilingualism; Sentence processing	GENDER AGREEMENT; BRAIN POTENTIALS; BILINGUALS SWITCH; COMPREHENSION; ERP; VOLUNTARY; LANGUAGES; SPANISH; CONTEXTS; NUMBER	A bank of past electrophysiological research suggests that code-switching (i.e., the use of multiple languages during a single conversational event) is characterized by increased processing costs. However, the majority of these studies tested bilinguals who did not necessarily code-switch on a regular basis. In order to investigate the impact of switching habits on language processing, two groups of French-English bilinguals (habitual codeswitchers and non-habitual code-switchers) read sentences containing unilingual and switched determiner phrases while their EEG was recorded. The findings indicate important processing differences between the groups. Notably, switched trials (particularly those with a French determiner) generated an increased negativity from 300 to 500 ms for non-habitual code-switchers, but not for habitual code-switchers. The veritable impact of switching habits were also supported by a correlation analysis. This finding suggests that code-switching is not inherently effortful to process, but rather, that comprehension costs are related to idiosyncratic factors, such as the extent of prior exposure to code-switched input. An LPC was also observed from 500 to 900 for habitual codeswitchers; for non-habitual switchers, this effect may have been attenuated by the long-lasting N400 effect. We advance several possible interpretations for the late positivity. Altogether, the results from the current study support the claim that the code-switching cost observed in previous literature may be linked to the bilingual samples tested in those studies: habitual code-switchers may not find switches effortful to process, but not all bilinguals code-switch. We highlight the importance of experience and individual differences in the study of bilingual cognition.

We investigated motivational salience as a possible underlying mechanism using event-related potentials (ERPs) as indicators of motivated attention allocation (P300) and sustained processing (LPP). Methods: We collected ERPs (P300: 350-400 ms; LPP: 600-1000 ms) from 21 women with full-syndrome or partially remitted BN and 21 healthy women (HC), matched for age and body mass index. Idiosyncratic negative and neutral situations were used to induce corresponding mood states (counterbalanced), before participants viewed images of high- and low-calorie foods and neutral objects, and provided ratings for pleasantness and desire to eat. Results: P300 was larger for foods than objects; LPP was largest for high-calorie foods, followed by low-calorie foods, then objects. The BN group showed an increased desire to eat high-calorie foods under negative mood and stronger mood induction effects on ERPs than the HC group, with generally reduced P300 and a small increase in LPP for high-calorie foods. Effects were limited to circumscribed electrode positions. Exploratory analyses showed clearer effects when comparing high vs. low emotional eaters. Conclusion: We argue that negative mood decreased the availability of cognitive resources (decreased P300) in BN, thereby facilitating disinhibition and food cravings (increased desire-to-eat ratings). Increased sustained processing might be linked to emotional eating tendencies rather than BN pathology per se, and reflect approach motivation, conflict, or regulatory processes. Negative mood appears to induce complex changes in food image processing, whose understanding may contribute to the development of tailored interventions in the future.	[Lutz, Annika P.

To explore the reliability scores for the P1 and N1 components in two sessions (separated by an average of 116 days), twenty subjects performed a visual lateralized detection paradigm and EEG recording (58 channels) were employed. The session factor did not modulate the P1/N1 latencies. The visual field factor (left (LVF) or right (RVF)) was a determinant for the P1 and N1 topographical distributions as shown in previous studies. Moreover, topographical maps of the grand average showed a very strong correlation level between sessions (>0.9). Finally, individual maps demonstrated that the classic contralateral pattern for the P1 and N1 components was not always present in all subjects. In particular, compared to the N1 component, the P1 component exhibited a more complex set of individual topographical distributions, revealing that some steps are more heterogeneous among human subjects in early visual processing.

Thus, the present study investigated the visual N100 and P200 event-related potentials components associated with attention using a 2-back working memory task in healthy neurotic and nonneurotic participants, evaluated using the Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness Five Factor Inventory. A total of 35 healthy participants were asked to perform the 2-back task while recording electroencephalographic activity from 64 electrodes on the scalp. Analysis of the N100 and P200 amplitude and latency in high neuroticism and low neuroticism subjects showed an increased P200 amplitude and latency for high neuroticism subjects in the frontal and parietal regions, respectively. However, there were no significant performance differences between the high and low neuroticism subjects for the 2-back working memory task. Therefore, the results suggest that neuroticism is associated with the P200 component elicited in the context of a working memory task.

Evidence indicates that the facilitation in the detection of multisensory stimuli is modulated by the perceptual load, the amount of information involved in the processing of the stimuli. Here, we used a realistic virtual reality environment while concomitantly acquiring Electroencephalography (EEG) and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) to investigate how multisensory signals impact target detection in two conditions, high and low perceptual load. Different multimodal stimuli (auditory and vibrotactile) were presented, alone or in combination with the visual target. Results showed that only in the high load condition, multisensory stimuli significantly improve performance, compared to visual stimulation alone. Multisensory stimulation also decreases the EEG-based workload. Instead, the perceived workload, according to the "NASA Task Load Index" questionnaire, was reduced only by the trimodal condition (i.e., visual, auditory, tactile). This trimodal stimulation was more effective in enhancing the sense of presence, that is the feeling of being in the virtual environment, compared to the bimodal or unimodal stimulation. Also, we show that in the high load task, the GSR components are higher compared to the low load condition. Finally, the multimodal stimulation (Visual-Audio-Tactile-VAT and Visual-Audio-VA) induced a significant decrease in latency, and a significant increase in the amplitude of the P300 potentials with respect to the unimodal (visual) and visual and tactile bimodal stimulation, suggesting a faster and more effective processing and detection of stimuli if auditory stimulation is included. Overall, these findings provide insights into the relationship between multisensory integration and human behavior and cognition.

Here, an Expert Panel from the Electrophysiology Professional Interest Area of the Alzheimer's Association reviewed the field literature and reached consensus on the event-related electroencephalographic oscillations (EROs) that show consistent abnormalities in patients with significant cognitive deficits due to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's (PD), Lewy body (LBD), and cerebrovascular diseases. Converging evidence from oddball paradigms showed that, as compared to cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults, AD patients had lower amplitude in widespread delta (>4 Hz) and theta (4-7 Hz) phase-locked EROs as a function of disease severity. Similar effects were also observed in PD, LBD, and/or cerebrovascular cognitive impairment patients. Non-phase-locked alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) oscillations were abnormally reduced (event-related desynchronization, ERD) in AD patients relative to CU. However, studies on patients with other dementias remain lacking. Delta and theta phase-locked EROs during oddball tasks may be useful neurophysiological biomarkers of cognitive systems at work in heuristic and intervention clinical trials performed in AD patients, but more research is needed regarding their potential role for other dementias.

Neural activity during response inhibition associated with improvement of dysphoric symptoms of PTSD after trauma-focused psychotherapy-an EEG-fMRI study	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; ADOLESCENT EARTHQUAKE SURVIVORS; STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIOR THERAPY; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; ACTIVATION; DEPRESSION; GO/NOGO; FEAR; NETWORKS	Although trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT) is the frontline treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), up to one half of patients do not respond optimally to this treatment. Inhibitory functions are important for successful management of PTSD, yet there is a dearth of knowledge regarding the extent to which neural mechanisms unpinning response inhibition are associated with TF-CBT response. Treatment-seeking PTSD patients (n=40) were assessed during a response inhibition task (the Go/No-Go task) while undergoing functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) and event-related potentials (ERP) in separate sessions. PTSD symptom severity was assessed with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, before undergoing nine sessions of TF-CBT. They were then reassessed post-treatment to estimate reduction in fear and dysphoric symptoms of PTSD. Although neural responses during the inhibitory task did not predict overall symptom change, reduced activation in the left precuneus and the right superior parietal cortex predicted greater improvement in dysphoric symptoms. ERP responses during response inhibition indicated that lower P3 peak latency predicted greater reduction of dysphoric symptoms. There were no significant predictors of changes of fear symptoms. These findings indicate that neural activity associated with response inhibition can act as a predictive biomarker of TF-CBT response for PTSD symptoms. This pattern of findings underscores the importance of delineating the role of biomarkers to predict remission of subtypes of PTSD.

Assessing combinatorial effects of HIV infection and former cocaine dependence on cognitive control processes: A high-density electrical mapping study of response inhibition	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Abstinence; Event-related potential; ERP; AIDS; Inhibitory control; Executive function; Cognition; Drug abuse	DISEASE PROGRESSION; BRAIN; NEUROBIOLOGY; USERS; ABSTINENT; DEFICITS; EEG; MODULATION; ACTIVATION; IMPAIRMENT	Stimulant drug use in HIV + patients is associated with poor personal and public health outcomes, including high-risk sexual behavior and faster progression from HIV to AIDS. Inhibitory control-the ability to withhold a thought, feeling, or action-is a central construct involved in the minimization of risk-taking behaviors. Recent neuroimaging and behavioral evidence indicate normalization of inhibitory control processes in former cocaine users as a function of the duration of drug abstinence, but it is unknown whether this recovery trajectory persists in former users with comorbid HIV. Here, we investigate the neural correlates of inhibitory control in 103 human subjects using high-density EEG recording as participants performed a Go/NoGo response inhibition task. Four groups of participants were recruited, varying on HIV and cocaine-dependence status. Electrophysiological responses to successful inhibitions and behavioral task performance were compared among groups. Results indicate persistent behavioral and neurophysiological impairment in HIV+ patients' response inhibition despite current abstinence from cocaine. Analysis of task performance showed that HIV+ abstinent cocaine-dependent participants demonstrate the lowest performance of all groups across all metrics of task accuracy. Planned comparisons of electrophysiological components revealed a main effect of scalp site and an interaction between HIV-status and scalp site on N2 amplitudes during successful inhibitions. Analysis of the P3 time region showed a main effect of scalp site and an interaction between HIV-status and cocaine dependence. These results suggest synergistic alterations in the neurophysiology of response inhibition and indicate that abstinence-related recovery of inhibitory control may be attenuated in patients with HIV.

Less known are the complex processes and related asymmetries occurring when a word is compared with the previous one, according to specific tasks. To this end, we used a paradigm based on 80 sequential word pair comparisons and three blocked tasks: phonological, semantic and orthographical matching judgment. Participants had to decide whether the target word (W2) did or did not match the prime word (W1), presented 2 sec before, according to the task. The event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked by W2 in 20 participants have been analyzed. The first negative wave, the Recognition Potential (RP), peaking at about 120 ms over parietal sites, showed greater amplitude at left sites in all tasks, thus revealing the typical left-lateralization. At frontal sites, only the phonological task showed left lateralization. The following N400 (300-450 ms) showed an interesting interaction: Match trials elicited greater left asymmetry on frontal regions to phonological than to semantic than to visual-perceptual tasks, whereas mismatch trials induced an inverted asymmetry, marked by greater amplitude over right frontal sites, regardless of the task. Concerning the late N400 (450-600 ms), phonological and semantic tasks showed an overlapping pattern, with left lateralization in match and right lateralization in mismatch conditions. Results point to complex task- and time-dependent hemispheric asymmetries in word matching.

Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to examine the effects of self-determined choice-as an experimental manipulation of intrinsic motivation and emotional stimulus content on task preparation and engagement in a temporal production task. Behavioral results indicated a modulation of time processing depending on choice and emotional content. Underlying EEG signals revealed differential modulations by choice on the contingent negative variation (CNV) during task and response preparation and by emotional content on the late positive potential (LPP) in response to the onset of an emotional picture during temporal production. Also, we obtained preliminary evidence for interaction effects of choice and emotional content on the LPP. The feedback-related negativity (FRN) in response to information regarding temporal production success was also affected by interactions of choice and emotional content. These findings indicate that besides separate effects of motivation and emotion, there may be time windows during task engagement in which both factors jointly affect cognitive processing. These results are interpreted as dynamic modulations of attentional resource allocation.

RREPs were evoked by short inspiratory occlusions (150 ms) while EEG was continuously measured. The mean amplitudes of the RREP components Nf, P1, N1, P2, and P3 were studied. For the no dyspnea condition, moderate test-retest reliability for Nf (intraclass correlation coefficient ICC: 0.73) and P1 (ICC: 0.74), good test-retest reliability for N1 (ICC: 0.89) and P3 (ICC: 0.76), and excellent test-retest reliability for P2 (ICC: 0.92) was demonstrated. For the dyspnea condition, moderate test-retest reliability was found for Nf (ICC: 0.69) and P1 (ICC: 0.57) and good test-retest reliability for N1 (ICC: 0.77), P2 (ICC: 0.84), and P3 (ICC: 0.77). This indicates that the RREP components Nf, P1, N1, P2, and P3, elicited by inspiratory occlusions, show adequate reliability in a test-retest study design with or without parallel sustained resistive load-induced dyspnea.

Some studies have focused on the interaction between senders in communicative situations and how the knowledge about the speaker can bias language comprehension. However, the mere effect of a face as a social context on language processing remains unknown. In the present study, we used event-related potentials to investigate the semantic and morphosyntactic processing of speech in the presence of a photographic portrait of the speaker. In Experiment 1, we show that the N400, a component related to semantic comprehension, increased its amplitude when processed within this minimal social context compared to a scrambled face control condition. Hence, the semantic neural processing of speech is sensitive to the concomitant perception of a picture of the speaker's face, even if irrelevant to the content of the sentences. Moreover, a late posterior negativity effect was found to the presentation of the speaker's face compared to control stimuli. In contrast, in Experiment 2, we found that morphosyntactic processing, as reflected in left anterior negativity and P600 effects, is not notably affected by the presence of the speaker's portrait. Overall, the present findings suggest that the mere presence of the speaker's image seems to trigger a minimal communicative context, increasing processing resources for language comprehension at the semantic level.

J	Pei, LS; Ouyang, G				Pei, Leisi; Ouyang, Guang			Online recognition of handwritten characters from scalp-recorded brain activities during handwriting	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						handwriting; EEG; ERP; brain computer interface	EEG	Objective. Brain-computer interfaces aim to build an efficient communication with the world using neural signals, which may bring great benefits to human society, especially to people with physical impairments. To date, the ability to translate brain signals to effective communication outcome remains low. This work explores whether the handwriting process could serve as a potential interface with high performance. To this end, we first examined how much the scalp-recorded brain signals encode information related to handwriting and whether it is feasible to precisely retrieve the handwritten content solely from the scalp-recorded electrical data. Approach. Five participants were instructed to write the sentence 'HELLO, WORLD!' repeatedly on a tablet while their brain signals were simultaneously recorded by electroencephalography (EEG). The EEG signals were first decomposed by independent component analysis for extracting features to be used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize the written symbols. Main results. The accuracy of the CNN-based classifier trained and applied on the same participant (training and test data separated) ranged from 76.8% to 97.0%. The accuracy of cross-participant application was more diverse, ranging from 14.7% to 58.7%. These results showed the possibility of recognizing the handwritten content directly from the scalp level brain signal. A demonstration of the recognition system in an online mode was presented. The major factor that grounded the recognition was the close association between the rich dynamics of electroencephalogram source activities and the kinematic information during the handwriting movements. Significance. This work revealed an explicit and precise mapping between scalp-level electrophysiological signals and linguistic information conveyed by handwriting, which provided a novel approach to developing brain computer interfaces that focus on semantic communication.

Somatosensory contribution to audio-visual speech processing	CORTEX			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Event-related potentials; Orofacial somatosensory processing; Audio-visual speech perception; Multisensory integration	MOTOR THEORY; PERCEPTION; CORTEX; BRAIN; ENHANCEMENT; INTEGRATION; ACTIVATION; DYNAMICS; SYSTEM; FMRI	Recent studies have demonstrated that the auditory speech perception of a listener can be modulated by somatosensory input applied to the facial skin suggesting that perception is an embodied process. However, speech perception is a multisensory process involving both the auditory and visual modalities. It is unknown whether and to what extent somatosensory stimulation to the facial skin modulates audio-visual speech perception. If speech perception is an embodied process, then somatosensory stimulation applied to the perceiver should influence audio-visual speech processing. Using the McGurk effect (the perceptual illusion that occurs when a sound is paired with the visual representation of a different sound, resulting in the perception of a third sound) we tested the prediction using a simple behavioral paradigm and at the neural level using event-related potentials (ERPs) and their cortical sources. We recorded ERPs from 64 scalp sites in response to congruent and incongruent audio-visual speech randomly presented with and without somatosensory stimulation associated with facial skin deformation. Subjects judged whether the production was /ba/ or not under all stimulus conditions. In the congruent audio-visual condition subjects identifying the sound as /ba/, but not in the incongruent condition consistent with the McGurk effect. Concurrent somatosensory stimulation improved the ability of participants to more correctly identify the production as /ba/ relative to the nonsomatosensory condition in both congruent and incongruent conditions. ERP in response to the somatosensory stimulation for the incongruent condition reliably diverged 220 msec after stimulation onset. Cortical sources were estimated around the left anterior temporal gyrus, the right middle temporal gyrus, the right posterior superior temporal lobe and the right occipital region. The results demonstrate a clear multisensory convergence of somatosensory and audio-visual processing in both behavioral and neural processing consistent with the perspective that speech perception is a self-referenced, sensorimotor process.

This body of work has suggested that nonaffective mechanisms, such as cognitive load have a role to play in reducing emotional response. For example, the late positive potential (LPP), which tracks attention to salient stimuli, is reduced when task-irrelevant negative and neutral stimuli are presented under high compared with low working memory load. Using positive stimuli, working memory load has been shown to reduce the LPP elicited by positive words and faces but has not previously been shown to modulate the LPP elicited by positive scenes. Emotional scenes are the predominant type of stimuli used in the broader emotion regulation literature, are more arousing than faces, and have been shown to more strongly modulate the LPP. Here, 41 participants performed a working memory task interspersed with the presentation of positive and neutral scenes, while electroencephalography was recorded. Results showed that the LPP was increased for positive compared with neutral pictures and reduced on high-load compared to low-load trials. Working memory performance was worse on high-load compared with low-load trials, although it was not significantly correlated with the LPP, and picture type did not affect working memory performance. Results bridge to the willful emotion regulation literature to increase understanding of the mechanisms underlying positive emotion regulation, which has been relatively unexamined.

Neurodevelopmental effects of childhood malnutrition: A neuroimaging perspective	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Neuroimaging; Malnutrition; Children; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Electroencephalography; Functional near-infrared spectroscopy	SUBSEQUENT BEHAVIORAL-DEVELOPMENT; SEVERE INFANTILE MALNUTRITION; NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; SEVERE UNDERNUTRITION; MATERNAL DEPRESSION; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; FEEDING PRACTICES; PHYSICAL GROWTH; IRON-DEFICIENCY	Approximately one in five children worldwide suffers from childhood malnutrition and its complications, including increased susceptibility to inflammation and infectious diseases. Due to improved early interventions, most of these children now survive early malnutrition, even in low-resource settings (LRS). However, many continue to exhibit neurodevelopmental deficits, including low IQ, poor school performance, and behavioral problems over their lifetimes. Most studies have relied on neuropsychological tests, school performance, and mental health and behavioral measures. Few studies, in contrast, have assessed brain structure and function, and to date, these have mainly relied on low-cost techniques, including electroencephalography (EEG) and evoked potentials (ERP). The use of more advanced methods of neuroimaging, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), has been limited by cost factors and lack of availability of these technologies in developing countries, where malnutrition is nearly ubiquitous. This report summarizes the current state of knowledge and evidence gaps regarding childhood malnutrition and the study of its impact on neurodevelopment. It may help to inform the development of new strategies to improve the identification, classification, and treatment of neurodevelopmental disabilities in underserved populations at the highest risk for childhood malnutrition.

According to the theory of "embodied cognition," the semantic content of cognitive processes is represented by multimodal networks in the brain, which include body-related functions. Such multimodal representations could offer a mechanism, which explains mutual influences between cognition and sleep. Here we tested whether sleep-related words are represented in multimodal networks by examining the effect of congruent versus incongruent body positions on word processing during wakefulness. We experimentally manipulated the body position of 66 subjects (19-40 years old) between standing upright and lying down. Sleep- and activity-related words were presented around the individual speech recognition threshold. Our results show that word processing was facilitated in congruent body positions (sleep words: lying down and activity words: standing upright) compared with incongruent body positions, as indicated by a reduced N400 in the congruent condition with the lowest volume. In addition, early sensory components of the ERP (N180 and P280) were enhanced, suggesting that words were also acoustically better understood in a congruent body position. However, the difference in ERPs did not translate to differences on a behavioral level. Our results support the prediction of embodied processing of sleep- and activity-related words. Body position potentially induces a pre-activation of multimodal networks, thereby enhancing access to the semantic concepts of words related to current body position. The link between semantic meaning and body-related function could be a key element in explaining the influences of cognitive processing on sleep.

Associations between Task-Related Modulation of Motor-Evoked Potentials and EEG Event-Related Desynchronization in Children with ADHD	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						ADHD; event-related desynchronization; mirror overflow; response inhibition; TMS	DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; INTRACORTICAL INHIBITION; MAGNETIC STIMULATION; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; TMS; SYNCHRONIZATION; BIOMARKERS; EXCITABILITY; RELIABILITY	Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have previously shown a decreased magnitude of event-related desynchronization (ERD) during a finger-tapping task, with a large between-group effect. Because the neurobiology underlying several transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measures have been studied in multiple contexts, we compared ERD and 3 TMS measures (resting motor threshold [RMT], short-interval cortical inhibition [SICI], and task-related up-modulation [TRUM]) within 14 participants with ADHD (ages 8-12 years) and 17 control children. The typically developing (TD) group showed a correlation between greater RMT and greater magnitude of alpha (10-13 Hz, here) ERD, and there was no diagnostic interaction effect, consistent with a rudimentary model of greater needed energy input to stimulate movement. Similarly, inhibition measured by SICI was also greater in the TD group when the magnitude of movement-related ERD was higher; there was a miniscule diagnostic interaction effect. Finally, TRUM during a response-inhibition task showed an unanticipated pattern: in TD children, the greater TMS task modulation (TRUM) was associated with a smaller magnitude of ERD during finger-tapping. The ADHD group showed the opposite direction of association: Greater TRUM was associated with larger magnitude of ERD. Prior EEG results have demonstrated specific alterations of task-related modulation of cortical physiology, and the current results provide a fulcrum for multimodal study.

In previous individual differences studies, the speed (measured in easy tasks) and accuracy (difficult tasks) of face cognition (FC, involving perception and recognition of faces) have been shown to form distinct abilities, going along with divergent factorial structures. This result has been replicated, but remained unexplained. To fill this gap, we first parameterized the sub-processes under- lying speed vs. accuracy in easy and difficult memory tasks for faces and houses in a large sample. Then, we analyzed event-related potentials (ERPs) extracted from the EEG by using residue iteration decomposition (RIDE), yielding a central (C) component that is comparable to a purified P300. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to estimate face specificity of C component latencies and amplitudes. If performance in easy tasks relies on purely general processes that are insensitive to stimulus content, there should be no specificity of individual differences in the latency recorded in easy tasks. However, in difficult tasks specificity was expected. Results indicated that, contrary to our predictions, specificity occurred in the C component latency of both speed-based and accuracy-based measures, but was stronger in accuracy. Further analyses suggested specific relation- ships between the face-related C latency and FC ability. Finally, we detected specificity in RTs of easy tasks when single tasks were modeled, but not when multiple tasks were jointly modeled. This suggests that the mechanisms leading to face specificity in performance speed are distinct across tasks. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals suffer inevitable interference from artifacts during the acquisition process. These artifacts make the analysis and interpretation of EEG data difficult. A major source of artifacts in EEGs is ocular activity. Therefore, it is important to remove ocular artifacts before further processing the EEG data. Approach. In this study, an automatic ocular artifact removal (AOAR) method for EEG signals is proposed based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and empirical mode decomposition (EMD). First, the amplitude of EEG data was normalized in order to ensure its non-negativity. Then, the normalized EEG data were decomposed into a set of components using NMF. The components containing ocular artifacts were extracted automatically through the fractal dimension. Subsequently, the temporal activities of these components were adaptively decomposed into some intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by EMD. The IMFs corresponding to ocular artifacts were removed. Finally, the de-noised EEG data were reconstructed. Main results. The proposed method was tested against seven other methods. In order to assess the effectiveness and reliability of the AOAR method in processing EEG data, experiments on ocular artifact removal were performed using simulated EEG data. Experimental results indicated that the proposed method was superior to the other methods in terms of root mean square error, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and correlation coefficient, especially in cases with a lower SNR. To further evaluate the potential applications of the proposed method in real life, the proposed method and others were applied to preprocess real EEG data recorded from children with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). After artifact rejection, the event-related potential feature was extracted for classification. The AOAR method was best at distinguishing the children with ADHD from the others. Significance. These results indicate that the proposed AOAR method has excellent prospects for removing ocular artifacts from EEG data.

However, neurocomputational mechanisms by which IU affects emotional predictions are unclear. This high-density EEG study investigated if IU predicted event-related potentials (ERPs) and brain sources activity developing along the stages of emotional predictions, as a function of contextual uncertainty. Thirty-six undergraduates underwent a S1-S2 paradigm, with emotional faces and pictures as S1s and S2s, respectively. Contextual uncertainty was manipulated across three blocks, each with 100%, 75%, or 50% S1-S2 emotional congruency. ERPs, brain sources and their relationship with IU scores were analyzed for each stage. IU did not affect prediction generation. During prediction implementation, higher IU predicted larger Contingent Negative Variation in the 75% block, and lower left anterior cingulate cortex and supplementary motor area activations. During prediction updating, as IU increased P2 to positive S2s decreased, along with P2 and Late Positive Potential in the 75% block, and right orbito-frontal cortex activity to emotional S2s. IU was therefore associated with altered uncertainty assessment and heightened attention deployment during implementation, and to uncertainty avoidance, reduced attention to safety cues and disrupted access to emotion regulation strategies during prediction updating.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						mental fatigue; table tennis; electroencephalography; event related potentials; visuomotor performance	EGO-DEPLETION; BRAIN	Mental fatigue (MF) is a psychobiological state negatively impacting both cognitive and physical performance. Although recent research implies that some table tennis (TT) performance outcomes are impaired by MF, open skill sports such as TT require a more detailed overview of MF-related performance decrements. Moreover, research into MF and sport-specific psychomotor performance lacks the inclusion of brain-related measurements to identify MF mechanisms. Eleven experienced TT players participated in this randomized counterbalanced crossover trial. Participants were either required to perform an individualized Stroop task (MF condition) or watch a documentary (control condition). The primary outcomes were reaction time on a sport-specific visuomotor task and EEG activity throughout the trial. The subjective feeling of MF was significantly different between both conditions and confirmed that the MF condition induced the mentally fatigue state of participants (p < 0.001), though no behavioral indicators (i.e., decrease in performance on Stroop and flanker task) of MF. MF worsened reaction time on the visuomotor task, while other secondary measurements remained largely ambiguous. Spectral power (i.e., decreases in upper alpha band and theta band) was influenced by MF, while ERPs measured during the visuomotor task remained unaltered. The present study confirms that MF negatively impacts table tennis performance, specifically inhibitory stimuli during the visuomotor task. These findings also further augment our understanding of the effects of MF on human performance.

However, the magnitude of the effect appears to be attenuated in first-episode populations. Furthermore, how mismatch negativity amplitudes are related to brain connectivity in this population is unclear. In this study, we used high-density EEG to record duration-deviant MMN from 22 patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) and 23 age-matched controls (HC). Consistent with past work, we found decreased MMN amplitude in FEP over a large area of the frontal scalp. We also found decreased latency over the occipital scalp. MMN amplitude was negatively correlated with antipsychotic dose. We used Granger causality to investigate directional connectivity between frontal, midline, left, and right scalp during MMN and found reduced connectivity in FEP compared to HC and following deviant stimuli compared to standard stimuli. FEP participants with smaller decreases in connectivity from standard to deviant stimuli had worse disorganization symptoms. On the other hand, connectivity from the front of the scalp following deviant stimuli was relatively preserved in FEP compared to controls. Our results suggest that a relative imbalance of bottom-up and top-down perceptual processing is present in the early stages of psychotic disorders.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of electrophysiological correlates of performance monitoring (error-related negativity, ERN; error positivity, Pe; feedback-related negativity, FRN; feedback-P3) in individuals with OCD, GTS, ADHD or autism compared to control participants, or associations between correlates and symptoms/traits of these con-ditions. Meta-analyses on 97 studies (5890 participants) showed increased ERN in OCD (Hedge's g = 0.54 [CIs:0.44,0.65]) and GTS (g = 0.99[CIs:0.05,1.93]). OCD also showed increased Pe (g = 0.51[CIs:0.21,0.81]) and FRN (g = 0.50[CIs:0.26,0.73]). ADHD and autism showed reduced ERN (ADHD: g=-0.47[CIs:-0.67,-0.26]; autism: g=-0.61[CIs:-1.10,-0.13]). ADHD also showed reduced Pe (g=-0.50[CIs:-0.69,-0.32]). These findings suggest overlap in electrophysiological markers of performance monitoring alterations in four common neuro-developmental conditions, with increased amplitudes of the markers in OCD and GTS and decreased amplitudes in ADHD and autism. Implications of these findings in terms of shared and distinct performance monitoring alterations across these neurodevelopmental conditions are discussed.

J	Wolz, I; Biehl, S; Svaldi, J				Wolz, Ines; Biehl, Stefanie; Svaldi, Jennifer			Emotional reactivity, suppression of emotions and response inhibition in emotional eaters: A multi-method pilot study	APPETITE			English	Article						Emotional eating; Emotional reactivity; Emotion regulation; Response inhibition; Event-related potentials	EXPRESSIVE SUPPRESSION; MENSTRUAL-CYCLE; FOOD; MODEL; QUESTIONNAIRE; IMPULSIVITY; ATTENTION; SMOKERS; TASKS; SCALE	Objective: Emotional eating has been associated with high emotional reactivity, suppression of negative emotions and inhibitory control difficulties. The current study aimed to address the association of these factors and their combined effect on emotional eating. Method: Twenty-eight participants conducted an emotional Go/Nogo task including pictures of neutral, negative and positive scenes and an additional emotion suppression condition. Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded continuously. Emotional eating and habitual emotion suppression were assessed through questionnaires. Emotional reactivity to affective pictures was measured through a visual analogue scale and the amplitude of the electrophysiological late positive potential (LPP). Inhibition parameters were assessed behaviorally (i.e., commission errors) and through event-related potentials of the EEG (i.e., N2/P3-amplitudes). Results: The trait questionnaire data revealed that emotional eating was not correlated with habitual emotion suppression. During the emotional Go/Nogo paradigm, higher emotional eating scores were positively related to higher LPP amplitudes in response to negative affective scenes. Inhibitory control capacities were not related to emotional eating while watching neutral or negative pictures, but higher emotional eating scores were associated with more commission errors when negative emotions were suppressed. Discussion: Emotional eating tendencies seem to be related to higher reactivity when confronted with negative affective information and inhibitory control deficits may arise especially when an effort is made to suppress these negative emotions. Therefore, a focus on adaptive emotion regulation in treatments of emotional eating seems to be important; solely targeting inhibitory control capacities may not be sufficient in order to help people with emotional eating to regulate their food intake.

Predicting subclinical psychotic-like experiences on a continuum using machine learning	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Schizotypy; Schizophrenia; Psychosis; Mismatch negativity; Regularity learning	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; HIGH-RISK; SCHIZOPHRENIA; BRAIN; SCHIZOTYPY; N100; VALIDATION; REGRESSION; PATTERNS; MODEL	Previous studies applying machine learning methods to psychosis have primarily been concerned with the binary classification of chronic schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. The aim of this study was to use elec-troencephalographic (EEG) data and pattern recognition to predict subclinical psychotic-like experiences on a continuum between these two extremes in otherwise healthy people. We applied two different approaches to an auditory oddball regularity learning task obtained from N = 73 participants: A feature extraction and selection routine incorporating behavioural measures, event-related potential compo-nents and effective connectivity parameters; Regularisation of spatiotemporal maps of event-related potentials. Using the latter approach, optimal performance was achieved using the response to frequent, predictable sounds. Features within the P50 and P200 time windows had the greatest contribution toward lower Prodromal Ques-tionnaire (PQ) scores and the N100 time window contributed most to higher PQ scores. As a proof-of-concept, these findings demonstrate that EEG data alone are predictive of individual psychotic-like experiences in healthy people. Our findings are in keeping with the mounting evidence for altered sensory responses in schizophrenia, as well as the notion that psychosis may exist on a continuum expanding into the non-clinical population.

WF effect has also been reported in the domain of written production; however, how WF affects written production is a controversial issue. The present study attempts to investigate the time course of and neural oscillation underlying the WF effect in handwritten production. Participants were asked to handwrite pictures names of high versus low WF, while concurrently recording EEG. EEG trials were extracted time-locked to picture onsets and then submitted to event-related potential analysis and time-frequency analysis. WF affected ERPs in the time windows of around 98-160 and 282-360 ms after picture onsets. More importantly, WF modulated the evoked and induced theta-band (4-8 Hz) neural oscillations in the time window of around 36-240 and 244-472 ms, respectively. Considering the time course of language production and the role of theta-band oscillation in long-term memory retrieval, we suggest that the two stages of the WF effect, respectively, reflect conceptual preparation and retrieval of orthographic word-forms in written production.

Electroencephalographic evidence of unconscious and conscious attentional bias in people with functional gastrointestinal disorders: A pilot study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Functional gastrointestinal disorders; Attentional bias; Conscious awareness; Event-related potentials; Psychosocial adjustment	IRRITABLE-BOWEL-SYNDROME; PAIN-RELATED INFORMATION; ALPHA-ACTIVITY; TIME-COURSE; EMOTION; ANXIETY; THREAT; WORDS; BRAIN; EPIDEMIOLOGY	Debate continues as to whether an attentional bias towards threat displayed by sufferers of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) is conscious and, thus, more amenable to change through psychological therapy. We compared the amplitudes of early (unconscious) and later (conscious) electroencephalographic (EEG) event related potentials following silent reading of symptom-related, emotionally neutral, and emotionally negative nouns across two participant groups: 30 female FGID-sufferers who met diagnostic criteria for irritable bowel syndrome or functional dyspepsia, and 30 female healthy controls. Analogous indices based on alpha desynchronization were also examined, as were correlations between the EEG-based indices and a range of psychosocial variables. FGID-sufferers displayed marginally significantly higher occipital EPN amplitudes for all nouns, indicating marginally higher levels of unconscious attention in the task. FGID-sufferers also displayed, for negative as compared to neutral nouns, significantly lower central N400 amplitudes indicative of higher conscious attention. The result was only apparent in post-hoc pairwise comparisons, however. Uniquely among FGID-sufferers, central N400 was strongly negatively correlated with a range of negative psychosocial traits and states. The findings provide preliminary evidence of hypervigilance to general (as opposed to symptom-specific) threat among FGID-sufferers. Amidst concerns over Type I error, recommendations are made for fine-tuning the operationalisation of unconscious and conscious attentional bias in this population.

Role of the Ipsilateral Primary Motor Cortex in the Visuo-Motor Network During Fine Contractions and Accurate Performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Functional source separation (FSS); semi-blind source separation (sBSS); electroencephalography (EEG); sensory-motor; contralateral primary motor (cM1); ipsilateral Primary Motor (iM1); visual feedback	FUNCTIONAL SOURCE SEPARATION; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; NEGATIVE BOLD RESPONSES; FINGER MOVEMENTS; NEURAL ACTIVITY; ACTIVATION; POTENTIALS; VARIABILITY; DYNAMICS; SIGNAL	It is widely recognized that continuous sensory feedback plays a crucial role in accurate motor control in everyday life. Feedback information is used to adapt force output and to correct errors. While primary motor cortex contralateral to the movement (cM1) plays a dominant role in this control, converging evidence supports the idea that ipsilateral primary motor cortex (iM1) also directly contributes to hand and finger movements. Similarly, when visual feedback is available, primary visual cortex (V1) and its interactions with the motor network also become important for accurate motor performance. To elucidate this issue, we performed and integrated behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) measurements during isometric compression of a compliant rubber bulb, at 10% and 30% of maximum voluntary contraction, both with and without visual feedback. We used a semi-blind approach (functional source separation (FSS)) to identify separate functional sources of mu-frequency (8-13Hz) EEG responses in cM1, iM1 and V1. Here for the first time, we have used orthogonal FSS to extract multiple sources, by using the same functional constraint, providing the ability to extract different sources that oscillate in the same frequency range but that have different topographic distributions. We analyzed the single-trial timecourses of mu power event-related desynchronization (ERD) in these sources and linked them with force measurements to understand which aspects are most important for good task performance. Whilst the amplitude of mu power was not related to contraction force in any of the sources, it was able to provide information on performance quality. We observed stronger ERDs in both contralateral and ipsilateral motor sources during trials where contraction force was most consistently maintained. This effect was most prominent in the ipsilateral source, suggesting the importance of iM1 to accurate performance. This ERD effect was sustained throughout the duration of visual feedback trials, but only present at the start of no feedback trials, consistent with more variable performance in the absence of feedback. Overall, we found that the behavior of the ERD in iM1 was the most informative aspect concerning the accuracy of the contraction performance, and the ability to maintain a steady level of contraction. This new approach of using FSS to extract multiple orthogonal sources provides the ability to investigate both contralateral and ipsilateral nodes of the motor network without the need for additional information (e.g. electromyography). The enhanced signal-to-noise ratio provided by FSS opens the possibility of extracting complex EEG features on an individual trial basis, which is crucial for a more nuanced understanding of fine motor performance, as well as for applications in brain-computer interfacing.

The present study recorded scalp auditory evoked potentials (AEP) in non-sedated common marmoset monkeys ( n = 4) using a noninvasive method similar to that used in humans, and aimed to identify nonhuman primate correlates of the human AEP components. A pure tone stimulus was presented while electroencephalograms were recorded using up to 16 disk electrodes placed on the scalp and earlobes. Candidate homologues of two categories of the human AEP, namely, the middle latency responses (MLR; Na, Pa, Nb, and Pb) and the cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEP; P1, N1, P2, N2, and the sustained potential, SP) were identified in the marmoset. These waves were labeled as CjNa, CjPa, CjNb, CjPb, CjP1, CjN1, CjP2, CjN2, and CjSP, where Cj stands for Callithrix jacchus. The last MLR component, CjPb, was identical to the first CAEP component, CjP1, similar to the relationship between Pb and P1 in humans. The peak latencies of the marmoset MLR and CAEP were generally shorter than in humans, which suggests a shorter integration time in neural processing. To our knowledge, the present study represents the first scalp recorded MLR and CAEP in the alert common marmoset. Further use of these recording methods would enable valid species comparisons of homologous brain indices between humans and animals. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Despite a wealth of studies at high anatomic resolution, the exact neural signals for the timing of pain remain little known. Identifying the onset of pain signals from distributed cortical circuits may reveal the temporal dynamics of pain responses and subsequently provide important feedback for closed-loop neuromodulation for pain. New method: Here we developed an unsupervised learning method for sequential detection of acute pain signals based on multichannel human EEG recordings. Following EEG source localization, we used a state-space model (SSM) to detect the onset of acute pain signals based on the localized regions of interest (ROIs). Results: We validated the SSM-based detection strategy using two human EEG datasets, including one public EEG recordings of 50 subjects. We found that the detection accuracy varied across tested subjects and detection methods. We also demonstrated the feasibility for cross-subject and cross-modality prediction of detecting the acute pain signals. Comparison with existing methods: In contrast to the batch supervised learning analysis based on a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, the unsupervised learning method requires fewer number of training trials in the online experiment, and shows comparable or improved performance than the supervised method. Conclusions: Our unsupervised SSM-based method combined with EEG source localization showed robust performance in detecting the onset of acute pain signals.

Unexpected Sounds Nonselectively Inhibit Active Visual Stimulus Representations	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						attention; distraction; inhibitory control; steady-state visual evoked potential; stop-signal task	SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; BRAIN; ATTENTION; EEG; NETWORK; NOVELTY; SYSTEM; CORTEX	The brain's capacity to process unexpected events is key to cognitive flexibility. The most well-known effect of unexpected events is the interruption of attentional engagement (distraction). We tested whether unexpected events interrupt attentional representations by activating a neural mechanism for inhibitory control. This mechanism is most well characterized within the motor system. However, recent work showed that it is automatically activated by unexpected events and can explain some of their nonmotor effects (e.g., on working memory representations). Here, human participants attended to lateralized flickering visual stimuli, producing steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) in the scalp electroencephalogram. After unexpected sounds, the SSVEP was rapidly suppressed. Using a functional localizer (stop-signal) task and independent component analysis, we then identified a fronto-central EEG source whose activity indexes inhibitory motor control. Unexpected sounds in the SSVEP task also activated this source. Using single-trial analyses, we found that subcomponents of this source differentially relate to sound-induced SSVEP changes: While its N2 component predicted the subsequent suppression of the attended-stimulus SSVEP, the P3 component predicted the suppression of the SSVEP to the unattended stimulus.

Auditory Oddball Responses Across the Schizophrenia-Bipolar Spectrum and Their Relationship to Cognitive and Clinical Features	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PAIRED STIMULI; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL ENDOPHENOTYPES; DIAGNOSTIC SPECIFICITY; PSYCHIATRIC-ILLNESS; DRUG DEVELOPMENT; TIME-FREQUENCY; P300; PSYCHOSIS; DISORDER	Objective: Neural activations during auditory oddball tasks may be endophenotypes for psychosis and bipolar disorder. The authors investigated oddball neural deviations that discriminate multiple diagnostic groups across the schizophrenia-bipolar spectrum (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, psychotic bipolar disorder, and nonpsychotic bipolar disorder) and clarified their relationship to clinical and cognitive features. Methods: Auditory oddball responses to standard and target tones from 64 sensor EEG recordings were compared across patients with psychosis (total N=597; schizophrenia, N=225; schizoaffective disorder, N=201; bipolar disorder with psychosis, N=171), patients with bipolar disorder without psychosis (N=66), and healthy comparison subjects (N=415) from the second iteration of the Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network for Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP2) study. EEG activity was analyzed in voltage and in the time-frequency domain (low, beta, and gamma bands). Event-related potentials (ERPs) were compared with those from an independent sample collected during the first iteration of B-SNIP (B-SNIP1; healthy subjects, N=211; psychosis group, N=526) to establish the repeatability of complex oddball ERPs across multiple psychosis syndromes (r values > 0.94 between B-SNIP1 and B-SNIP2). Results: Twenty-six EEG features differentiated the groups; they were used in discriminant and correlational analyses. EEG variables from the N100, P300, and low-frequency ranges separated the groups along a diagnostic continuum from healthy to bipolar disorder with psychosis/bipolar disorder without psychosis to schizoaffective disorder/schizophrenia and were strongly related to general cognitive function (r=0.91). P50 responses to standard trials and early beta/gamma frequency responses separated the bipolar disorder without psychosis group from the bipolar disorder with psychosis group. P200, N200, and late beta/gamma frequency responses separated the two bipolar disorder groups from the other groups. Conclusions: Neural deviations during auditory processing are related to psychosis history and bipolar disorder. There is a powerful transdiagnostic relationship between severity of these neural deviations and general cognitive performance. These results have implications for understanding the neurobiology of clinical syndromes across the schizophrenia-bipolar spectrum that may have an impact on future biomarker research.

The present study aimed to fill this gap by examining the persistence of mental fatigue on behavior and electrophysiological mechanisms. Fifteen participants performed an arm-pointing task consisting of reaching a target as fast as possible, before carrying out a 32-min cognitively demanding task [Time Load Dual Back (TLDB) task], and immediately, 10 and 20 min after completion of the TLDB task. During the experiment, electroencephalography was continuously recorded. The significant increase in mental fatigue feeling after the TLDB task was followed by a decrease during the 20 min of recovery without returning to premeasurement values. Brain oscillations recorded at rest during the recovery period showed an increase in both theta and alpha power over time, suggesting a persistence of mental fatigue. Arm-pointing movement duration increased gradually over time during the recovery period, indicating that behavioral performance remained impaired 20 min after the end of the cognitively demanding task. To conclude, subjective measurements indicated a partial recovery of mental fatigue following a cognitively demanding task, whereas electrophysiological and behavioral markers suggested that the effects of mental fatigue persisted for at least 20 min. While the subjective evaluation of mental fatigue is a very practical way to attest the presence of mental fatigue, electrophysiological and behavioral measures seem more relevant to evaluate the time course of mental fatigue effects.

Previous studies suggest that bilateral somatosensory inputs interact differently depending on stimulus characteristics, including their noxious nature. The aim of this study was to clarify how bilateral inputs evoked by noxious laser stimuli, noxious shocks, and innocuous shocks interact in terms of perception and brain responses. The experiment comprised two conditions (right-hand stimulation and concurrent stimulation of both hands) in which painful laser stimuli, painful shocks and non-painful shocks were delivered. Perception, somatosensory-evoked potentials (P45, N100, P260), laser-evoked potentials (N1, N2 and P2) and event-related spectral perturbations (delta to gamma oscillation power) were compared between conditions and stimulus modalities. The amplitude of negative vertex potentials (N2 or N100) and the power of delta/theta oscillations were increased in the bilateral compared with unilateral condition, regardless of the stimulus type (P < 0.01). However, gamma oscillation power increased for painful and non-painful shocks (P < 0.01), but not for painful laser stimuli (P = 0.08). Despite the similarities in terms of brain activity, bilateral inputs interacted differently for painful stimuli, for which perception remained unchanged, and non-painful stimuli, for which perception increased. This may reflect a ceiling effect for the attentional capture by noxious stimuli and warrants further investigations to examine the regulation of such interactions by bottom-up and top-down processes.

More recently, transient burst-like events termed beta bursts have been identified as another potential biomarker of motor function. Previous studies have reported decreased MRBD magnitude induced by exercise. However, little is known in terms of the effects of high-intensity exercise on beta burst patterns. In the present work, we investigated the modulatory effects of exercise on different beta burst features prior to, during and post motor task execution. We found that exercise mainly affected burst duration and burst rate within the left motor cortex area (M1) that is contralateral to the moving hand. Meanwhile, burst amplitude in the contralateral M1 area was affected differently by exercise, with smaller burst amplitude values observed during the movement preparation phase and larger magnitude during as well as post motor task execution. Since MRBD and beta burst patterns are closely associated with motor task performance, results from the present study can promote understanding about the association between exercise induced neural plasticity changes and motor performance, which can be further used for designing a subject-specific training therapy for improving motor function.

While the psychological work has investigated this impact of interest theoretically, the physiological studies have focused more on the modulatory effects. However, some studies have addressed both sides of the effects. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive review of physiological studies on interest detection, from different perspectives carried out between 2003 and 2019. A lack of connection between the psychological and physiological studies was identified. Therefore, this paper aims to integrate the unique psychological and physiological aspects and characteristics of interest to form a base for future research by considering the pros and cons of the included studies. For example, considering the two types of interest (situational and individual) the detected interest in learning, gaming, and advertisement's physiological experiments could be referring specifically to situational interest. Hence, bridging the gap between both physiological and psychological studies is essential for improving the research on interest. Furthermore, we propose several suggestions for future work direction.

Here, we investigated brain phenotyping in patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) by using electroencephalography (EEG) and conducted machine-learning-based classification of the two diseases by using EEG components. Materials and Methods: We enrolled healthy controls (HCs) (n = 30) and patients with SZ (n = 34) and MDD (n = 33). An auditory P300 (AP300) task was performed, and the N1 and P3 components were extracted. Two-group classification was conducted using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Positive and negative symptoms and depression and/or anxiety symptoms were evaluated. Results: Considering both the results of statistical comparisons and machine learning-based classifications, patients and HCs showed significant differences in AP300, with SZ and MDD showing lower N1 and P3 than HCs. In the sum of amplitudes and cortical sources, the findings for LDA with classification accuracy (SZ vs. HCs: 71.31%, MDD vs. HCs: 74.55%), sensitivity (SZ vs. HCs: 77.67%, MDD vs. HCs: 79.00%), and specificity (SZ vs. HCs: 64.00%, MDD vs. HCs: 69.67%) supported these results. The SVM classifier showed reasonable scores between SZ and HCs and/or MDD and HCs. The comparison between SZ and MDD showed low classification accuracy (59.71%), sensitivity (65.08%), and specificity (54.83%). Conclusions: Patients with SZ and MDD showed deficiencies in N1 and P3 components in the sum of amplitudes and cortical sources, indicating attentional dysfunction in both early and late sensory/cognitive gating input. The LDA and SVM classifiers in the AP300 are useful to distinguish patients with SZ and HCs and/or MDD and HCs.

J	Parashiva, PK; Vinod, AP				Parashiva, Praveen K.; Vinod, A. P.			Single-trial detection of EEG error-related potentials using modified power-law transformation	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Cognitive state; Error-related potential; Power-law; Single-trial detection	BCI; NEGATIVITY	Error processing in the human brain is characterized by a distinct neural response that is elicited when the outcome of an event is not the same as expected. This response is known as error-related potential (ErrP). Detection of error-related potentials from a single-trial data can lead the existing Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems one step closer to autonomous system. The non-stationarity of the Electroencephalograph (EEG) signal along with poor spatial resolution and low signal-to-noise ratio make the task of detecting ErrP on a single-trial basis challenging. The objective of this work is to propose a novel ErrP detection method based on temporal domain features of ErrP, particularly, the standard deviation measure. The difference in the standard deviation between the correct and the erroneous trials is verified using a statistical test and this information is subsequently used for ErrP detection. In the proposed method, the EEG electrodes from the frontocentral region of the brain are ranked using standard deviation based ranking criterion and a few top-ranked electrodes will be considered for single-trial detection of ErrP. Then, a modified power-law based transformation is proposed to enhance the discriminability between the correct and error trials. The discriminability is enhanced by transforming the samples lying outside a predefined amplitude range according to power-law equation and the samples within the selected amplitude range are transformed linearly. The modified power-law transformation has two parameters K and.. The parameter K defines the pre-defined amplitude range and. is the power in the standard power-law equation. The proposed ErrP detection method is tested on a publicly available EEG database of 10 subjects. The proposed transformation increases the discriminability between the erroneous and correct trials and achieves the best trade-off between the sensitivity and the specificity for detecting ErrP on single-trial basis compared to existing methods. The average sensitivity and specificity achieved is 86.17 +/- 9.05% and 92.05 +/- 3.69% respectively. The higher sensitivity of detection erroneous trials can be used to faithfully correct the wrongly decoded signal in the EEG based BCI system.	[Parashiva, Praveen K.; Vinod, A.

However, patterns of interference in early and late somatosensory processing stages due to the stimulation of different body parts have not been explored. Here, we explore functional similarities and differences between attention modulation of the somatosensory N140 and P300 elicited at the fingers vs. cheeks. In an active oddball paradigm, 22 participants received vibrotactile intensity deviant stimulation either ipsilateral (within-hemisphere) or contralateral (between-hemisphere) at the fingers or cheeks. The ipsilateral deviant always covered a larger area of skin than the contralateral deviant. Overall, both N140 and P300 amplitudes were higher following stimulation at the cheek and N140 topographies differed between fingers and cheek stimulation. For the N140, results showed higher deviant ERP amplitudes following contralateral than ipsilateral stimulation, regardless of the stimulated body part. N140 peak latency differed between stimulated body parts with shorter latencies for the stimulation at the fingers. Regarding P300 amplitudes, contralateral deviant stimulation at the fingers replicated the N140 pattern, showing higher responses and shorter latencies than ipsilateral stimulation at the fingers. For the stimulation at the cheeks, ipsilateral deviants elicited higher P300 amplitudes and longer latencies than contralateral ones. These findings indicate that at the fingers ipsilateral deviant stimulation leads to intra-hemispheric interference, with significantly smaller ERP amplitudes than in contralateral stimulation, both at early and late processing stages. By contrast, at the cheeks, intra-hemispheric interference is selective for early processing stages. Therefore, the mechanisms of intra-hemispheric processing differ from inter-hemispheric ones and the pattern of intra-hemispheric interference in early and late processing stages is body-part specific.

J	Islam, MK; Ghorbanzadeh, P; Rastegarnia, A				Islam, Md Kafiul; Ghorbanzadeh, Parviz; Rastegarnia, Amir			Probability mapping based artifact detection and removal from single-channel EEG signals for brain-computer interface applications	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Artifact removal; BCI; EEG; Wavelet transform	SUPPRESSION; FEATURES; EMG	Background: Different types of artifacts in the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can considerably reduce the performance of the later-stage EEG analysis algorithms for making decisions, such as those for brain-computer interfacing (BCI) classification. In this paper, we address the problem of artifact detection and removal from single-channel EEG signals. New method: We propose a novel approach that maps the probability of an EEG epoch to be artifactual based on four different statistical measures: entropy (a measure of uncertainty), kurtosis (a measure of peakedness), skewness (a measure of asymmetry), and periodic waveform index (a measure of periodicity). Then, a stationary wavelet transform based artifact removal is proposed that employs a particular probability threshold provided by the user. Results: We have executed our experiments with both synthetic and real EEG data. It is observed that the proposed method exhibits a superior performance for suppressing the artifact contaminated from EEG with minimum distortion. Moreover, evaluation of the algorithm using EEG dataset for BCI experiments reveals that artifact removal can considerably improve the BCI output in both event-related potential and motor-imagery based BCI applications. Comparison with existing methods: The proposed algorithm has been applied to both real and synthesized data testing and compared with other state-of-the-art automated artifact removal methods. Its superior performance is verified in terms of various performance metrics including computational complexity for justifying its use in BCIlike real-time applications. Conclusion: Our work is expected to be useful for future research EEG signal processing and eventually to develop more accurate real-time EEG-based BCI applications.

Perinatal maternal anxiety interferes with a core facet of adaptive caregiving: mothers' sensitive responsiveness to infant affective communicative 'cues.' This review summarizes the current research on the neural correlates of maternal processing of infant cues in the presence of perinatal anxiety, outlines its limitations, and offers next steps to advance future research. Functional neuro-imaging studies examining the neural circuitry involved in, and electrophysiological studies examining the temporal dynamics of, processing infant cues during pregnancy and postpartum are reviewed. Studies have generally indicated mixed findings, although emerging themes suggest that anxiety may be implicated in several stages of processing infant cues- detection, interpretation, and reaction- contingent upon cue valence. Limi-tations include inconsistent designs, lack of differentiation between anxiety and depression symptoms, and limited consideration of parenting-specific (versus domain-general) anxiety. Future studies should incorporate longitudinal investigation of multiple levels of analysis spanning neural, cognitive, and observed aspects of sensitive caregiving.

However, in contrast with the large number of studies reporting neuroanatomical differences in activation relative to young adults, changes of temporal dynamics of neural activity during normal and pathological aging have been grossly understudied and are still poorly known. Here, we synthesize the current state of knowledge from MEG and EEG studies that aimed at specifying the effects of healthy and pathological aging on local and network dynamics, and discuss the clinical and theoretical implications of these findings. We argue that considering the temporal dynamics of brain activations and networks could provide a better understanding of changes associated with healthy aging, and the progression of neurodegenerative disease. Recent research has also begun to shed light on the association of these dynamics with other imaging modalities and with individual differences in cognitive performance. These insights hold great potential for driving new theoretical frameworks and development of biomarkers to aid in identifying and treating age-related cognitive changes.	[Courtney, S.

For this purpose, we focused on two of the most notable neurophysiological effects of MI - the event-related desynchronization (ERD) level and the increase in cortical excitability assessed with navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS). For TMS navigation, we used individual high-resolution 3D brain MRIs. Ten BCI-naive and healthy adults participated in this study. The MI (rest or left/right hand imagery using Graz-BCI paradigm) tasks were performed separately in the presence and absence of feedback. To investigate how much the presence/absence of vibrotactile feedback in MI BCI-based training could contribute to the sensorimotor cortical activations, we compared the MEPs amplitude during MI after training with and without feedback. In addition, the ERD levels during MI BCI-based training were investigated. Our findings provide evidence that applying vibrotactile feedback during MI training leads to (i) an enhancement of the desynchronization level of mu-rhythm EEG patterns over the contralateral motor cortex area corresponding to the MI of the non-dominant hand; (ii) an increase in motor cortical excitability in hand muscle representation corresponding to a muscle engaged by the MI.

Previous studies have suggested that the prefrontal cortex plays an important role in decision-making and that the dopamine system underlies processes of motivation, motor preparation, and reinforcement learning. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying how the prefrontal cortex and the dopaminergic system are involved in decision-making remain largely unclear. The present study aimed to determine how decision strategies influence event-related potentials (ERPs). We also tested the effect of levodopa, a dopamine precursor, on decision-making and ERPs in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled investigation. The subjects performed a matching-pennies task against an opposing virtual computer player by choosing between right and left targets while their ERPs were recorded. According to the rules of the matching-pennies task, the subject won the trial when they chose the same side as the opponent, and lost otherwise. We set three different task rules: (1) with the alternation (ALT) rule, the computer opponent made alternating choices of right and left in sequential trials; (2) with the random (RAND) rule, the opponent randomly chose between right and left; and (3) with the GAME rule, the opponent analyzed the subject's past choices to predict the subject's next choice, and then chose the opposite side. A sustained medial ERP became more negative toward the time of the subject's target choice. A biphasic potential appeared when the opponent's choice was revealed after the subject's response. The ERPs around the subject's choice were greater in RAND and GAME than in ALT, and the negative peak was enhanced by levodopa. In addition to these medial ERPs, we observed lateral frontal ERPs tuned to the choice direction. The signals emerged around the choice period selectively in RAND and GAME when levodopa was administered. These results suggest that decision processes are modulated by the dopamine system when a complex and strategic decision is required, which may reflect decision updating with dopaminergic prediction error signals.

We aimed to study its effects on cortical excitability, oscillatory patterns, and motor function, the main aim being to identify potentially beneficial neurophysiological effects.Materials and Methods: We applied randomized real or placebo stimulation over the unaffected primary motor cortex of 10 subacute (7 +/- 3 days) post-stroke patients. Neurophysiological measurements were performed using electroencephalography and electromyography. Motor function was assessed with the Wolf Motor Function Test. We performed a repeated measure study with the recordings taken pre-, post-cTBS, and at 3 months' follow-up.Results: We investigated changes in motor rhythms during arm elevation and thumb opposition tasks and found significant changes in beta power of the affected thumb's opposition, specifically after real cTBS. Our results are consistent with an excitatory response (increase in event-related desynchronization) in the sensorimotor cortical areas of the affected hemisphere, after stimulation. Neither peak-to-peak amplitude of motor-evoked potentials nor motor performance were significantly altered.Conclusions: Consistently with the theoretical prediction, this contralateral inhibitory stimulation paradigm changes neurophysiology, leading to a significant excitatory impact on the cortical oscillatory patterns of the contralateral hemisphere. These proof-of-concept results provide evidence for the potential role of continuous TBS in the neurorehabilitation of post-stroke patients. We suggest that these changes in ERS/ERD patterns should be further explored in future phase IIb/phase III clinical trials, in larger samples of poststroke patients.

Remote and Long-Term Self-Monitoring of Electroencephalographic and Noninvasive Measurable Variables at Home in Patients With Epilepsy (EEG@HOME): Protocol for an Observational Study	JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS			English	Article						epilepsy; EEG; electroencephalography; brain ictogenicity; wearables; seizure prediction; brain; seizures; mobile technology	SEIZURE-DETECTION; WRIST ACCELEROMETER; PREDICTION; PRECIPITANTS; TECHNOLOGY; SYSTEMS; IMPACT; APPS	Background: Epileptic seizures are spontaneous events that severely affect the lives of patients due to their recurrence and unpredictability. The integration of new wearable and mobile technologies to collect electroencephalographic (EEG) and extracerebral signals in a portable system might be the solution to prospectively identify times of seizure occurrence or propensity. The performances of several seizure detection devices have been assessed by validated studies, and patient perspectives on wearables have been explored to better match their needs. Despite this, there is a major gap in the literature on long-term, real-life acceptability and performance of mobile technology essential to managing chronic disorders such as epilepsy. Objective: EEG@HOME is an observational, nonrandomized, noninterventional study that aims to develop a new feasible procedure that allows people with epilepsy to independently, continuously, and safely acquire noninvasive variables at home. The data collected will be analyzed to develop a general model to predict periods of increased seizure risk. Methods: A total of 12 adults with a diagnosis of pharmaco-resistant epilepsy and at least 20 seizures per year will be recruited at King's College Hospital, London. Participants will be asked to self-apply an easy and portable EEG recording system (ANT Neuro) to record scalp EEG at home twice daily. From each serial EEG recording, brain network ictogenicity (BNI), a new biomarker of the propensity of the brain to develop seizures, will be extracted. A noninvasive wrist-worn device (Fitbit Charge 3; Fitbit Inc) will be used to collect non-EEG biosignals (heart rate, sleep quality index, and steps), and a smartphone app (Seer app; Seer Medical) will be used to collect data related to seizure occurrence, medication taken, sleep quality, stress, and mood. All data will be collected continuously for 6 months. Standardized questionnaires (the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire and System Usability Scale) will be completed to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the procedure. BNI, continuous wrist-worn sensor biosignals, and electronic survey data will be correlated with seizure occurrence as reported in the diary to investigate their potential values as biomarkers of seizure risk. Results: The EEG@HOME project received funding from Epilepsy Research UK in 2018 and was approved by the Bromley Research Ethics Committee in March 2020. The first participants were enrolled in October 2020, and we expect to publish the first results by the end of 2022. Conclusions: With the EEG@HOME study, we aim to take advantage of new advances in remote monitoring technology, including self-applied EEG, to investigate the feasibility of long-term disease self-monitoring. Further, we hope our study will bring new insights into noninvasively collected personalized risk factors of seizure occurrence and seizure propensity that may help to mitigate one of the most difficult aspects of refractory epilepsy: the unpredictability of seizure occurrence.

J	Rui, ZP; Gu, ZY				Rui, Zhepeng; Gu, Zhenyu			A Review of EEG and fMRI Measuring Aesthetic Processing in Visual User Experience Research	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; PERCEPTION; APPRECIATION; STIMULI; DESIGN; MODEL; COLOR; COMPONENT; DYNAMICS	In human-computer interaction, the visual interaction of user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) plays an important role in enriching the quality of daily life. The purpose of our study analyzes the use of brain-computer interface (BCI), wearable technology, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the aesthetic processing of visual neural response to UI and UX designs. Specifically, this review aims to understand neuroaesthetic processing knowledge, aesthetic appreciation models, and the ways in which visual brain studies can improve the quality of current and future UI and UX designs. Recent research has found that subjective evaluations of aesthetic appreciation produce different results for objective evaluations of brain research analysis. We applied SWOT analysis and examined the advantages and disadvantages of both evaluation methods. Furthermore, we conducted a traditional literature review on topics pertaining to the use of aesthetic processing knowledge in the visual interaction field in terms of art therapy, information visualization, website or mobile applications, and other interactive platforms. Our main research findings from current studies have helped and motivated researchers and designers to use convincing scientific knowledge of brain event-related potential, electroencephalography, and fMRI to understand aesthetic judgment. The key trend finds that many designers, artists, and engineers use artistic BCI technology in the visual interaction experience. Herein, the scientific methods applied in the aesthetic appreciation to human-computer interface are summarized, and the influence of the latest wearable brain technology on visual interaction design is discussed. Furthermore, current possible research entry points for aesthetics, usability, and creativity in UI and UX designs are explicated. The study results have implications for the visual user experience research domain as well as for interaction industries, which produce interactive projects to improve people's daily lives.

From a frequentist perspective of the classic oddball paradigm, deviant stimuli are unexpected because of their low probability. However, the amount of PE elicited by a stimulus can be dissociated from its probability of occurrence: when the observer cannot make confident predictions, any event holds little surprise value, no matter how improbable. Here we tested the hypothesis that the magnitude of the neural response elicited to an improbable sound (D) would scale with the precision of the prediction derived from the repetition of another sound (S), by manipulating repetition stability. We recorded the Electroencephalogram (EEG) from 20 participants while passively listening to 4 types of isochronous pure tone sequences differing in the probability of the S tone (880 Hz) while holding constant the probability of the D tone [1,046 Hz; p(D) = 1/11]: Oddball [p(S) = 10/11]; High confidence (7/11); Low confidence (4/11); and Random (1/11). Tones of 9 different frequencies were equiprobably presented as fillers [p(S) + p(D) + p(F) = 1]. Using a mass-univariate non-parametric, cluster-based correlation analysis controlling for multiple comparisons, we found that the amplitude of the deviant-elicited ERP became more negative with increasing S probability, in a time-electrode window consistent with the MMN (ca. 120-200 ms; frontal), suggesting that the strength of a PE elicited to an improbable event indeed increases with the precision of the predictive model.

Quantitative Multimodal Assessment of Concussion Recovery in Youth Athletes	CLINICAL JOURNAL OF SPORT MEDICINE			English	Article						mild traumatic brain injury; pediatric; gait; EEG; vision	DUAL-TASK GAIT; SINGLE-TASK; ADOLESCENTS; SYMPTOMS; UTILITY; RETURN; TIME	Objective: To evaluate recovery trajectories among youth athletes with a concussion and healthy controls across different domains using a quantitative and multifaceted protocol. Study Design: Prospective repeated measures. Participants: Youth athletes diagnosed with a concussion between the ages of 8 and 18 years were evaluated (1) within 10 days after injury, (2) approximately 3 weeks after injury, and (3) after return-to-play clearance. Control participants completed the same protocol. Setting: Sport concussion clinic. Interventions: N/A. Main Outcome Measures: Participants underwent a multifaceted protocol that assessed symptoms (postconcussion symptom scale [PCSS]), dual-task gait, event-related potentials (ERPs), and eye tracking. Results: Sixty-seven athletes participated: 36 after concussion (age = 14.0 +/- 2.6 years; 44% female) and 31 controls (age = 14.6 +/- 2.2 years; 39% female). Concussion symptoms were higher for the concussion group compared with controls at the first (PCSS = 31.7 +/- 18.8 vs 1.9 +/- 2.9; P < 0.001) and second time points (PCSS = 10.8 +/- 11.2 vs 1.8 +/- 3.6; P = 0.001) but resolved by the final assessment (PCSS = 1.7 +/- 3.6 vs 2.0 +/- 3.8; P = 0.46). The concussion group walked slower during dual-task gait than controls at all 3 tests including after return-to-play clearance (0.83 +/- 0.19 vs 0.95 +/- 0.15 m/s; P = 0.049). There were no between-group differences for ERP connectivity or eye tracking. Those with concussions had a decrease in ERP connectivity recovery over the 3 time points, whereas control participants' scores increased (concussion Delta = -8.7 +/- 28.0; control Delta = 13.9 +/- 32.2; chi(2) = 14.1, P = 0.001). Conclusions: Concussion is associated with altered dual-task gait speeds after resolution of concussion symptoms, but ERP and eye tracking measures did not demonstrate between-group differences across time. Some objective approaches to concussion monitoring may support with identifying deficits after concussion, but further work is required to delineate the role of gait, electrophysiological, and eye tracking methods for clinical decision-making.

J	Hervault, M; Zanone, PG; Buisson, JC; Huys, R				Hervault, Mario; Zanone, Pier-Giorgio; Buisson, Jean-Christophe; Huys, Raoul			Cortical sensorimotor activity in the execution and suppression of discrete and rhythmic movements	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; INHIBITORY MOTOR CONTROL; BOUNDARY-ELEMENT METHOD; STOP-SIGNAL; BETA-SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATORY CHANGES; MU-RHYTHMS; EEG; ACTIVATION; ALPHA	Although the engagement of sensorimotor cortices in movement is well documented, the functional relevance of brain activity patterns remains ambiguous. Especially, the cortical engagement specific to the pre-, within-, and post-movement periods is poorly understood. The present study addressed this issue by examining sensorimotor EEG activity during the performance as well as STOP-signal cued suppression of movements pertaining to two distinct classes, namely, discrete vs. ongoing rhythmic movements. Our findings indicate that the lateralized readiness potential (LRP), which is classically used as a marker of pre-movement processing, indexes multiple pre- and in- movement-related brain dynamics in a movement-class dependent fashion. In- and post-movement event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) observed in the Mu (8-13 Hz) and Beta (15-30 Hz) frequency ranges were associated with estimated brain sources in both motor and somatosensory cortical areas. Notwithstanding, Beta ERS occurred earlier following cancelled than actually performed movements. In contrast, Mu power did not vary. Whereas Beta power may reflect the evaluation of the sensory predicted outcome, Mu power might engage in linking perception to action. Additionally, the rhythmic movement forced stop (only) showed a post-movement Mu/Beta rebound, which might reflect an active "clearing-out" of the motor plan and its feedback-based online control. Overall, the present study supports the notion that sensorimotor EEG modulations are key markers to investigate control or executive processes, here initiation and inhibition, which are exerted when performing distinct movement classes.

J	Kern, L; Niedeggen, M				Kern, Lea; Niedeggen, Michael			Distractor-induced deafness: The effect of multiple auditory distractors on conscious target processing	CORTEX			English	Article						EEG; Conscious access; Inhibition; Auditory processing; Distractor-induced blindness	CENTRAL INHIBITION SYSTEM; NEGATIVE ATTENTIONAL SET; TOP-DOWN; INDUCED BLINDNESS; PERCEPTUAL LOAD; MISMATCH-NEGATIVITY; DELAYED MASKING; WORKING-MEMORY; BLINK; MOTION	Conscious access to a target stimulus embedded in a rapid serial visual presentation can be impaired by the preceding presentation of multiple task-irrelevant distractors. While this phenomenon - labeled distractor-induced blindness (DIB) - is established in vision, it is unknown whether a similar effect can be observed in the auditory modality. Considering the differences in the processing of visual and auditory stimuli, modality-specific effects in the inhibitory mechanisms triggered by distractors can be expected. First, we aimed to find evidence for a distractor-induced deafness (DID) for auditory targets in a behavioral experiment. The target was defined by a transient increase in amplitude in a continuous sinusoidal tone, which was to be detected if accompanied or preceded by a deviant tone (cue). Both events were embedded in separate streams in a binaural rapid serial auditory presentation. Distractors preceded the cue and shared the targets features. As previously observed for DIB, a failure to detect the auditory target critically relied on the presentation of multiple distractor episodes. This DID effect was followed up in a subsequent event-related brain potentials (ERP) study to identify the signature of target detection. In contrast to missed targets, hits were characterized by a larger frontal negativity and by a more pronounced centro-parietal P3b wave. Whereas the latter process was also observed in the visual domain, indicating a post-perceptual updating process, the frontal negativity was exclusively observed for auditory DID. This modality-specific process might signal that early attentional control processes support conscious access to relevant auditory events. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using the MoBI motion capture system to rapidly and accurately localize EEG electrodes in anatomic space	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; electrode locations; motion capture		During mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) experiments, electroencephalography and motion capture systems are used in concert to record high temporal resolution neural activity and movement kinematics while participants perform demanding perceptual and cognitive tasks in a naturalistic environment. A typical MoBI setup involves positioning multi-channel electrode caps based on anatomical fiducials as well as experimenter and participant intuition regarding the scalp midpoint location (i.e., Cz). Researchers often use the "template" electrode locations provided by the manufacturer, however, the "actual" electrode locations can vary based on each participant's head morphology. Accounting for differences in head morphologies could provide more accurate clinical diagnostic information when using MoBI to identify neurological deficits in patients with motor, sensory, or cognitive impairments. Here, we asked whether the existing motion capture system used in a MoBI setup could be easily adapted to improve spatial localization of electrodes across participants without requiring additional or specialized equipment that might impede clinical adoption. Using standard electrode configurations, infrared markers were placed on a subset of electrodes and anatomical fiducials, and the remaining electrode locations were estimated using spherical or ellipsoid models. We identified differences in event-related potentials between "template" and "actual" electrode locations during a Go/No-Go task (p < 9.8e-5) and an object-manipulation task (p < 9.8e-5). Thus, the motion capture system already used in MoBI experiments can be effectively deployed to accurately register and quantify the neural activity. Improving the spatial localization without needing specialized hardware or additional setup time to the workflow has important real-world implications for translating MoBI to clinical environments.

J	Duma, GM; Di Bono, MG; Mento, G				Duma, Gian Marco; Di Bono, Maria Grazia; Mento, Giovanni			Grounding Adaptive Cognitive Control in the Intrinsic, Functional Brain Organization: An HD-EEG Resting State Investigation	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						cognitive control; functional connectivity; high-density EEG; machine learning; resting-state	TEMPORAL PREPARATION; SPHERICAL SPLINES; CONNECTIVITY; ATTENTION; INFORMATION; NETWORKS; DRIVEN; CORTEX; THETA; OSCILLATIONS	In a recent study, we used the dynamic temporal prediction (DTP) task to demonstrate that the capability to implicitly adapt motor control as a function of task demand is grounded in at least three dissociable neurofunctional mechanisms: expectancy implementation, expectancy violation and response implementation, which are supported by as many distinct cortical networks. In this study, we further investigated if this ability can be predicted by the individual brain's functional organization at rest. To this purpose, we recorded resting-state, high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG) in healthy volunteers before performing the DTP task. This allowed us to obtain source-reconstructed cortical activity and compute whole-brain resting state functional connectivity at the source level. We then extracted phase locking values from the parceled cortex based on the Destrieux atlas to estimate individual functional connectivity at rest in the three task-related networks. Furthermore, we applied a machine-learning approach (i.e., support vector regression) and were able to predict both behavioral (response speed and accuracy adaptation) and neural (ERP modulation) task-dependent outcome. Finally, by exploiting graph theory nodal measures (i.e., degree, strength, local efficiency and clustering coefficient), we characterized the contribution of each node to the task-related neural and behavioral effects. These results show that the brain's intrinsic functional organization can be potentially used as a predictor of the system capability to adjust motor control in a flexible and implicit way. Additionally, our findings support the theoretical framework in which cognitive control is conceived as an emergent property rooted in bottom-up associative learning processes.

However, it remains unclear how these two processes are linked in the context of behavioral change. This is important to investigate, as behavioral change is associated with distinct neural correlates that reflect specific aspects of processing, such as information integration and rule updating. To clarify whether these processes characterize both direct learning and conformity, we elicited the two within the same task, using a role-swapping version of the Ultimatum Game-a fairness paradigm where subjects decide how to share a pot of money with other players-while electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded. Behavioral results showed that subjects decided how to divide the pot based on both direct feedback (seeing whether their past proposals were accepted or rejected) and social observation (copying the splits that others just proposed). Converging EEG evidence revealed that increased centroparietal positivity (P2, P3b, and late positivity) indexed behavioral changes motivated by direct feedback and those motivated by drives to conform. However, exploratory analyses also suggest that these two motivating factors may also be dissociable, and that frontal midline theta oscillations may predict behavioral changes linked to direct feedback but not conformity. Overall, this study provides novel electrophysiological evidence regarding the different forms of behavioral change. These findings are also relevant for understanding the mechanisms of social information processing that underlie successful cooperation.

Inspired by recent efforts from the psychological sciences, and with the desire to examine some of the foundational findings using electroencephalog-raphy (EEG), we have launched #EEGManyLabs, a large-scale international collaborative replication effort. Since its discovery in the early 20th century, EEG has had a profound in-fluence on our understanding of human cognition, but there is limited evidence on the replicability of some of the most highly cited discoveries. After a systematic search and se-lection process, we have identified 27 of the most influential and continually cited studies in the field. We plan to directly test the replicability of key findings from 20 of these studies in teams of at least three independent laboratories. The design and protocol of each replication effort will be submitted as a Registered Report and peer-reviewed prior to data collection. Prediction markets, open to all EEG researchers, will be used as a forecasting tool to examine which findings the community expects to replicate. This project will update our confidence in some of the most influential EEG findings and generate a large open access database that can be used to inform future research practices. Finally, through this international effort, we hope to create a cultural shift towards inclusive, high-powered multi-laboratory collaborations. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Neural differences in the temporal cascade of reactive and proactive control for bilinguals and monolinguals	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						bilingual; cognitive Control; color&#8208; Word Stroop Task; conflict SP; ERPs; N450		This study explored differences in sustained top-down attentional control (i.e., proactive control) and spontaneous types of control (i.e., reactive control) in bilingual and monolingual speakers. We modified a Color-Word Stroop task to varying levels of conflict and included switching trials in addition to more "traditional" inhibition Stroop conditions. The task was administered during scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate the temporal course of cognitive control during trials. The behavioral Stroop effect was observed across the whole sample; however, there were no differences in accuracy or response time between the bilingual and monolingual groups. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were calculated for the N200, N450, and conflict Sustained Potential (SP). On the pure-blocked incongruent trials, the bilingual group displayed reduced signal during interference suppression (N450) and increased later signal, as indexed by the conflict SP. On the mixed-block incongruent trials, both the bilinguals and monolinguals displayed increased later signal at the conflict SP. This suggests that proactive control may be a default mode for bilinguals on tasks requiring inhibition. In the switching trials, that place high demands on the executive control component of shifting, the language groups did not differ. Overall, these results suggest processing differences between bilinguals and monolinguals extend beyond early response inhibition processes. Greater integration of proactive and reactive control may be needed to sort conflicting language environments for bilinguals, which may be transferring to domain-general mechanisms.

Sexual dimorphism in hemispheric processing of faces in humans: A meta-analysis of 817 cases	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						sex differences; EEG/ERPs; face processing; FFA; N170; gender; social cognition	ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; CORTICAL RESPONSE; PERCEPTION; GENDER; BRAIN; WOMEN; CORTEX; LATERALIZATION; SPECIALIZATION	A well-established neuroimaging literature predicts a right-sided asymmetry in the activation of face-devoted areas such as the fusiform gyrus (FG) and its resulting M/N170 response during face processing. However, the face-related response sometimes appears to be bihemispheric. A few studies have argued that bilaterality depended on the sex composition of the sample. To shed light on this matter, two meta-analyses were conducted starting from a large initial database of 250 ERP (Event-related potentials)/MEG (Magnetoencephalography) peer-reviewed scientific articles. Paper coverage was from 1985 to 2020. Thirty-four articles met the inclusion criteria of a sufficiently large and balanced sample size with strictly right-handed and healthy participants aged 18-35 years and N170 measurements in response to neutral front view faces at left and right occipito/temporal sites. The data of 817 male (n = 414) and female (n = 403) healthy adults were subjected to repeated-measures analyses of variance. The results of statistical analyses from the data of 17 independent studies (from Asia, Europe and America) seem to robustly indicate the presence of a sex difference in the way the two cerebral hemispheres process facial information in humans, with a marked right-sided asymmetry of the bioelectrical activity in males and a bilateral or left-sided activity in females.

Theta synchronization (especially over the frontal midline areas) is related to cognitive control and executive processes during WM encoding and retention. Alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) is associated with information processing and attention. Methods: Participants (35 patients and 39 matched controls) performed a modified Sternberg WM task, containing salient and non-salient distractor items in the retention period. A high-density 128 channel EEG was recorded during the task. Theta (4-7 Hz) and fast alpha (10-13 Hz) event-related spectral per-turbation (ERSP) were analyzed during the retention and encoding period. Results: Patients with schizophrenia showed worse WM performance and increased attentional dis-tractibility in terms of lower hit rates and increased distractor-related commission errors compared to healthy controls. Theta synchronization was modulated by condition (learning vs. distractor) in both groups but it was modulated by salience only in controls. Furthermore, salience of distractors modulated less the fast alpha ERD in patients. Conclusions: Our results suggest that patients with schizophrenia process salient and non-salient dis-tracting information less efficiently and show weaker cognitive control compared to controls.

Hidden wounds of violence: Abnormal motor oscillatory brain activity is related to posttraumatic stress symptoms	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						PTSD; LRP; Posttraumatic stress symptoms; Mu/alpha rhythms; Event-related potential; Brain oscillations	PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; PTSD CHECKLIST; ONSET LATENCY; VOLUNTARY; DISORDER; PICTURES; EEG; ACTIVATION; EXPOSURE; RHYTHMS	Victims of urban violence are at risk of developing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), one of the most debilitating consequences of violence. Considering that PTSD may be associated with inefficient selection of defensive responses, it is important to understand the relation between motor processing and PTSD. The present study aims to investigate the extent to which the severity of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) is related to motor preparation against visual threat cues in victims of urban violence. Participants performed a choice reaction time task while ignoring a picture that could be threating or neutral. The EEG indices extracted were the motor-related amplitude asymmetry (MRAA) in the alpha frequency range, and the lateralized readiness potential (LRP). We observed a linear relation between longer LRP latency and a slower reaction time, selectively during threat processing (compared to neutral) in low PTSS, but not in high PTSS participants. Alpha MRAA suppression and the PTSS were also linearly related: the smaller the alpha MRAA suppression in the threat condition relative to neutral, the greater the PTSS. These results provide evidence that threatening cues affect motor processing that is modulated by the severity of PTSS in victims of urban violence.

To extend this approach beyond cardiac interoception, we describe the application of a Bayesian computational model to a recently developed gastrointestinal interoception task completed by 40 healthy individuals undergoing simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) and peripheral physiological recording. We first present results that support the validity of this modelling approach. Second, we provide a test of, and confirmatory evidence supporting, the neural process theory associated with a particular Bayesian framework (active inference) that predicts specific relationships between computational parameters and event-related potentials in EEG. We also offer some exploratory evidence suggesting that computational parameters may influence the regulation of peripheral physiological states. We conclude that this computational approach offers promise as a tool for studying individual differences in gastrointestinal interoception.

Such statistical learning and prediction are crucial for acquiring language and music appreciation. Importantly, learned expectations can be implicitly derived from exposure to sensory input, without requiring explicit information regarding contingencies in the environment. Whereas many previous studies of statistical learning have demonstrated larger neuronal responses to unexpected versus expected stimuli, the neuronal bases of the expectations themselves remain poorly understood. Here we examined behavioral and neuronal signatures of learned expectancy via human scalp-recorded event-related brain potentials ( ERPs). Participants were instructed to listen to a series of sounds and press a response button as quickly as possible upon hearing a target noise burst, which was either reliably or unreliably preceded by one of three pure tones in low-, mid-, and high-frequency ranges. Participants were not informed about the statistical contingencies between the preceding tone 'cues' and the target. Over the course of a stimulus block, participants responded more rapidly to reliably cued targets. This behavioral index of learned expectancy was paralleled by a negative ERP deflection, designated as a neuronal contingency response (CR), which occurred immediately prior to the onset of the target. The amplitude and latency of the CR were systematically modulated by the strength of the predictive relationship between the cue and the target. Re-averaging ERPs with respect to the latency of behavioral responses revealed no consistent relationship between the CR and the motor response, suggesting that the CR represents a neuronal signature of learned expectancy or anticipatory attention. Our results demonstrate that statistical regularities in an auditory input stream can be implicitly learned and exploited to influence behavior. Furthermore, we uncover a potential 'prediction signal' that reflects this fundamental learning process.

Moreover, evidence on factors that can be modified by behavior and exert an influence on these deficits is lacking. The present case-control study examined the association between very preterm birth and neurophysiological indices of response inhibition (i.e. the N200-P300 complex) as well as the potential mediation of this association by aspects of physical fitness. 54 children born very preterm completed a submaximal cycling ergometer test and a motor skill test battery. Event-related potentials elicited by a Go/NoGo task were recorded using electroencephalography. Cases were then matched to full-term children (age: 11 +/- 0.7 y). A higher error rate on NoGo trials was found in children born very preterm compared to those born full-term. Path-analyses further revealed that very preterm birth was associated with decreased NoGo P300 amplitude. Motor skills, but not aerobic fitness, fully mediated this association. In early adolescence, very preterm birth is associated with less effective recruitment of attentional resources for stimulus evaluation processes. The improvement of motor skills rather than cardiorespiratory fitness appears promising for reducing this specific impairment in cognitive control.

Being a scrambled language, Turkish uses both syntactic and prosodic information to mark the focus. However, it does not allow for focus marking in post-verbal position. In this study, the neurophysiological processes of the focus in Turkish are examined by using prosodic and syntactic information. Recent psycholinguistics studies assume that there is an interaction between prosody and syntax through the focus in the online sentence comprehension process. Thirty participants (16 female and 14 male between the ages of 19 and 33), whose native language was Turkish and who spoke monolingual Turkish, and who did not have any neurological, hearing, or linguistic impairments, took part in the experiments measured with Electroencephalogram (EEG). Using an event-related potentials (ERPs) design, this study provides evidence for an interaction between prosody and syntax in Turkish. The experimental design of the study consisted of prosodic, syntactic, and prosodic-syntactic violations. Participants were asked to listen 300 auditory stimuli (100 filler sentences) including sentences with both congruent and incongruent focus. The stimuli consisted of 50 sentences for each experimental condition. All critical words occurred in the sentence-final positions. For the prosodic violation critical words were focused via incongruent focusing on post-verbal position, and for the syntactic violation critical words were manipulated with case marking manipulation (i.e., accusative case versus dative case violations). In addition, for the interaction of prosodic and syntactic violations, critical words were incongruent focused and incongruent case was marked. The results revealed that prosodic incongruity elicited a broadly distributed positivity in posterior regions (400-1200 ms) lateralized to the left hemisphere and a right anterior negativity (RAN) (300-500 ms) effect. Syntactic violations also indicated a distributed anterior negativity (300-500 ms) effect. Supportive evidence for the late interaction of prosodic and syntactic processing in the neural integration of positive 600 (P600) and Closure Positive Shift (CPS) was observed. The findings provide support for recent neurocognitive approaches for late interaction between prosody and syntax in the sentence-final position in Turkish sentences.

However, in daily life, whether the effect of emotion regulation lasts and the lasting mechanism have been examined less. The present research focused on the relationships between the immediate and lasting effect of the emotion regulation of adolescents. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 51 adolescents (31 boys and 20 girls, Mage = 12.82) during online emotion regulation using the Reactivity and Regulation-Image Task (phase 1) and re-presentation of emotional stimuli after a period of time (phase 2). Event-related potentials (ERPs) related to emotion regulation, such as N2, P3, and the late positive potential (LPP), were examined in the two phases. The results showed that: (1) In both of the two phases, in negative emotion conditions, the amplitudes of P3 and LPP 300-600 of no-regulation conditions were significantly higher than those in reappraisal conditions. However, there was no significant difference under neutral conditions; (2) The amplitudes of P3, N2, and LPP 300-600 during emotion regulation in phase 1 positively predicted the amplitudes of P3, N2, and LPP300-600 in phase 2 in different experimental conditions. Results from the regression analysis implied that the immediate effect of online emotion regulation may predict the lasting effect when adolescents face the same emotions again. In addition, our findings provide neurological evidence that the use of cognitive reappraisal could effectively help adolescents to reduce the recruitment of cognitive resources when they regulate negative emotions and when they face those negative emotions again.

In this method, HOG is modified for 2-D EEG signal and is fed to CNN as input. Due to the inputs as MHOG, the training features are chosen among a variety of gradients, and the best features are selected for training the CNN structure. This approach (MHOG-CNN) ends in a simpler structure and therefore, the whole performance is acceptable with faster rates and high accuracy. The performance of MHOG-CNN is examined by applying BCI Competition III Dataset. This dataset represents a complete record for P300 ERP with BCI2000 using a paradigm, and it has several noises including power and muscle-based noises. The objective is to predict the correct character in each of the provided character selection epochs.

When compared with the low-altitude individuals, the reaction time of mental rotation tasks was significantly slower in immigrants who had lived in high-altitude areas for 3 years. The time-frequency analysis showed that the alpha ERD and the beta ERD within the time window (400-700 ms) were decreased during the mental rotation tasks in these immigrants. The decreased ERD was observed at the parietal-occipital regions within the alpha band and at the central-parietal regions within the beta band. The decreased ERD might embody the sensorimotor-related cortical activity from hypoxia, which might be involved in cognitive control function in high-altitude immigrants, which provided insights into the neural mechanism of spatial cognition change on aspect of embodied cognition due to high-altitude exposure.

Effectiveness of an Integrated Intervention Program for Alcoholism: Electrophysiological Findings	INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						EEG; ERPs; alcoholism; flanker; alcohol No-Go; SOG	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TAI-CHI; PSYCHIATRIC INTERVIEW; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; COGNITIVE DEFICITS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; BRAIN-DAMAGE; EEG; CONFLICT; POWER	Background: Neuroelectrophysiological measures such as electroencephalograms (EEGs) in resting state and event-related potentials (ERPs) provide valuable information about the vulnerability and treatment-related changes in persons with alcoholism. This study examined the effectiveness of an Integrated Intervention Program for Alcoholism (IIPA) using electrophysiological measures. Methods: Fifty individuals with early onset of alcohol dependence participated. They were grouped randomly into two: the treatment as usual (TAU) group and the treatment group, matched on age (+/- 1 year) and education (+/- 1 year). eyes closed and resting state EEGs and ERPs on cognitive tasks (flanker task, alcohol Go/No-Go task, and single outcome gambling task) were recorded before and after treatment. The TAU group received pharmacotherapy, six days/week yoga sessions, and three sessions/week group therapy on relapse prevention while the treatment group received IIPA along with usual treatment (except yoga) for 18 days. Results: There was no significant difference between the groups pre-treatment. RM-ANOVA for pre- and post-treatment stages showed a significant difference between the two groups in the absolute power of alpha, beta, theta, and delta, during eye closure, in the resting-state EEGs. The treatment group showed significantly larger N200/N2 amplitude in congruent and incongruent conditions (flanker task), N200/N2 amplitude for alcohol No-Go, P300/P3 amplitude for neutral No-Go on alcohol Go/No-Go task, and outcome-related positivity (ORP) amplitude on single outcome gambling task. Conclusion: This exploratory study suggests that IIPA is effective for enhancing relaxation state and attentiveness, decreasing hyperarousal, and ameliorating neurocognitive dysfunctions of conflict-monitoring, response inhibition, and reward processing.

Emerging evidence suggests that disrupted reward processing may be implicated in the association between insomnia and the increased risk for depression. Reduced reward positivity (RewP) as measured by event-related potential (ERP) has been linked to depression, but has not been tested in youths with insomnia. Methods Twenty-eight participants with insomnia disorder and without any comorbid psychiatric disorders and 29 healthy sleepers aged between 15-24 completed a monetary reward task, the Cued Door task, while electroencephalographic activity was recorded. RewP (reward minus non-reward difference waves) was calculated as the mean amplitudes within 200-300 ms time window at FCz. Two analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were conducted with age as a covariate on RewP amplitude and latency, respectively. Results Participants with insomnia had a significantly lower RewP amplitude regardless of cue types (Gain, Control, and Loss) than healthy sleepers, F(1, 51) = 4.95, p = 0.031, indicating blunted reward processing. On the behavioral level, healthy sleepers were more prudential (slower reaction time) in decision making towards Loss/Gain cues than their insomnia counterparts. Trial-by-trial behavioral adjustment analyses showed that, compared with healthy sleepers, participants with insomnia were less likely to dynamically change their choices in response to Loss cues. Conclusions Dysfunctional reward processing, coupled with inflexibility of behavioral adjustment in decision-making, is associated with insomnia disorder among youth, independent of mood disorders. Future studies with long-term follow-up are needed to further delineate the developmental trajectory of insomnia-related reward dysfunctions in youth.

The system comprises a control unit, power unit, output unit, and actuator. The control unit adjusts stimulation parameters, particularly the signal intensity and frequency. The power unit produces high voltages for generating the magnetic field, whereas the output unit transmits the energy generated according to the signal from the control unit to the actuator. A spiral coil actuator generates the magnetic field. To validate the effectiveness of the system, preliminary experiments on 10 male adults without neurological disorders (23.2 +/- 3.05 years) were conducted. Magnetic field stimuli were presented to the right palm of the subjects at three different frequencies (10, 30, and 50 Hz), and corresponding electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were measured simultaneously. Event-related potential (ERP) analysis showed that N100 and P300 components were identified in somatosensory areas. Subjective evaluations revealed that feelings such as "tingling," "trembling," "tapping," and "percussing" were induced. Moreover, as the stimulus frequency changes, differences may occur in induced feeling. The system uses a time-varying magnetic field, which not only induces tactile stimulation without contact but also has trans-object characteristics that can present tactile sensations, even when there is an obstacle between an actuator and skin.

Purpose The aim of the current study was to test whether changes in neural face processing (as reflected in N170 amplitudes) would act as a mediator in the association between the Video-feedback Intervention to promote Positive Parenting and Sensitive Discipline (VIPP-SD) and maternal sensitivity. Methods A total of 66 mothers of whom a random 33% received the VIPP-SD and the others a "dummy" intervention participated in pre- and postintervention assessments. We recorded mothers' electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in response to photographs of children's neutral, happy, and angry facial expressions. Maternal sensitivity was observed while mothers interacted with their offspring in a semi-structured play situation. Results In contrast with our expectations, we did not find evidence for mediation of intervention effects on maternal sensitivity by the N170. Conclusion We discuss that parenting support programs may yield different effects on neurocognitive processes depending on the population and provide recommendations for future research. Our study underscores the importance of reporting null findings and preregistering studies in the field of neurocognitive research.

However, the functional impact of these motor processes on cognition has been questioned. The present study aims to provide new electrophysiological (EEG) evidence concerning the role of motor processes in the comprehension and memory of action language. Participants read lists of sentences including manual-action or attentional verbs, while keeping their hands either in front of them or crossing them behind their back. Results showed that posture impacted selectively the processing of manual action sentence, and not of attentional sentences, in three different ways: 1) EEG fronto-central beta rhythms, a signature of motor processes, were desynchronized while reading action sentences in the hands-in-front posture compared to the hands-behind posture. The estimated source was the posterior cingulate cortex, involved in proprioceptive regulation. 2) Recall of nouns associated with manual sentences decreased when learning occurred in the hands-behind posture. 3) ERPs analysis revealed that the initial posture at learning modulates neural processes during subsequent recall of manual sentences in the left superior frontal gyrus, which is related to motor processes. These results provide decisive evidence for the functional involvement of embodied simulations in the encoding and retrieval of action-related language (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hinrikus, H; Lass, J; Bachmann, M				Hinrikus, Hiie; Lass, Jaanus; Bachmann, Maie			Threshold of radiofrequency electromagnetic field effect on human brain	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION BIOLOGY			English	Review						Low-level RF EMF; nonthermal model; threshold; linearity; depression	MOBILE PHONE EXPOSURE; LONG-TERM EVOLUTION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SPONTANEOUS EEG ACTIVITY; MICROWAVE-RADIATION; CONTINUOUS-WAVE; SLEEP EEG; PARAMETRIC-EXCITATION; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; MAGNETIC-FIELDS	Purpose This review aims to estimate the threshold of radiofrequency electromagnetic field (RF EMF) effects on human brain based on analyses of published research results. To clarify the threshold of the RF EMF effects, two approaches have been applied: (1) the analyses of restrictions in sensitivity for different steps of the physical model of low-level RF EMF mechanism and (2) the analyses of experimental data to clarify the dependence of the RF EMF effect on exposure level based on the results of published original neurophysiological and behavioral human studies for 15 years 2007-2021. Conclusions The analyses of the physical model of nonthermal mechanisms of RF EMF effect leads to conclusion that no principal threshold of the effect can be determined. According to the review of experimental data, the rate of detected RF EMF effects is 76.7% in resting EEG studies, 41.7% in sleep EEG and 38.5% in behavioral studies. The changes in EEG probably appear earlier than alterations in behavior become evident. The lowest level of RF EMF at which the effect in EEG was detected is 2.45 V/m (SAR = 0.003 W/kg). There is a preliminary indication that the dependence of the effect on the level of exposure follows rather field strength than SAR alterations. However, no sufficient data are available for clarifying linearity-nonlinearity of the dependence of effect on the level of RF EMF. The finding that only part of people are sensitive to RF EMF exposure can be related to immunity to radiation or hypersensitivity. The changes in EEG caused by RF EMF appeared similar in the majority of analyzed studies and similar to these in depression. The possible causal relationship between RF EMF effect and depression among young people is highly important problem.

Fifteen patients with a non-affective FEP and 13 healthy controls underwent an active involuntary attention task along with an EEG acquisition. Time-frequency representations of power, phase locking, and fronto-parietal connectivity were calculated. The P3a event-related potential was extracted as well. Compared to controls, the FEP group showed reduced theta phase-locking and fronto-parietal connectivity evoked by deviant stimuli. Also, the P3a amplitude was significantly reduced. Moreover, reduced theta connectivity was associated with more severe negative symptoms within the FEP group. Reduced activity (phase-locking and connectivity) of novelty-related theta oscillations, along with P3a reduction, may represent a failure to synchronize large-scale neural populations closely related to fronto-parietal attentional networks, and might be explored as a potential biomarker of disease severity in patients with emerging psychosis, given its association with negative symptoms.

Distinct electrophysiological signatures of task-unrelated and dynamic thoughts	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						task-unrelated thoughts; freely moving thoughts; constrained thoughts; mind wandering; EEG	DEFAULT NETWORK; MIND; FLUCTUATIONS; BRAIN; FMRI; DIMENSIONS; MODE	Humans spend much of their lives engaging with their internal train of thoughts. Traditionally, research focused on whether or not these thoughts are related to ongoing tasks, and has identified reliable and distinct behavioral and neural correlates of task-unrelated and task-related thought. A recent theoretical framework highlighted a different aspect of thinking-how it dynamically moves between topics. However, the neural correlates of such thought dynamics are unknown. The current study aimed to determine the electrophysiological signatures of these dynamics by recording electroencephalogram (EEG) while participants performed an attention task and periodically answered thought-sampling questions about whether their thoughts were 1) task-unrelated, 2) freely moving, 3) deliberately constrained, and 4) automatically constrained. We examined three EEG measures across different time windows as a function of each thought type: stimulus-evoked P3 event-related potentials and non-stimulus-evoked alpha power and variability. Parietal P3 was larger for task-related relative to task-unrelated thoughts, whereas frontal P3 was increased for deliberately constrained compared with unconstrained thoughts. Frontal electrodes showed enhanced alpha power for freely moving thoughts relative to non-freely moving thoughts. Alpha-power variability was increased for task-unrelated, freely moving, and unconstrained thoughts. Our findings indicate distinct electrophysiological patterns associated with task-unrelated and dynamic thoughts, suggesting these neural measures capture the heterogeneity of our ongoing thoughts.

J	He, CY; Chikara, RK; Yeh, CL; Ko, LW				He, Congying; Chikara, Rupesh Kumar; Yeh, Chia-Lung; Ko, Li-Wei			Neural Dynamics of Target Detection via Wireless EEG in Embodied Cognition	SENSORS			English	Article						wireless EEG; brain computer interface; embodied cognition; target detection; attention	ATTENTION; AGE; POTENTIALS; P300	Embodied cognitive attention detection is important for many real-world applications, such as monitoring attention in daily driving and studying. Exploring how the brain and behavior are influenced by visual sensory inputs becomes a major challenge in the real world. The neural activity of embodied mind cognitive states can be understood through simple symbol experimental design. However, searching for a particular target in the real world is more complicated than during a simple symbol experiment in the laboratory setting. Hence, the development of realistic situations for investigating the neural dynamics of subjects during real-world environments is critical. This study designed a novel military-inspired target detection task for investigating the neural activities of performing embodied cognition tasks in the real-world setting. We adopted independent component analysis (ICA) and electroencephalogram (EEG) dipole source localization methods to study the participant's event-related potentials (ERPs), event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP), and power spectral density (PSD) during the target detection task using a wireless EEG system, which is more convenient for real-life use. Behavioral results showed that the response time in the congruent condition (582 ms) was shorter than those in the incongruent (666 ms) and nontarget (863 ms) conditions. Regarding the EEG observation, we observed N200-P300 wave activation in the middle occipital lobe and P300-N500 wave activation in the right frontal lobe and left motor cortex, which are associated with attention ERPs. Furthermore, delta (1-4 Hz) and theta (4-7 Hz) band powers in the right frontal lobe, as well as alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) band powers in the left motor cortex were suppressed, whereas the theta (4-7 Hz) band powers in the middle occipital lobe were increased considerably in the attention task. Experimental results showed that the embodied body function influences human mental states and psychological performance under cognition attention tasks. These neural markers will be also feasible to implement in the real-time brain computer interface. Novel findings in this study can be helpful for humans to further understand the interaction between the brain and behavior in multiple target detection conditions in real life.

They are now considered to be an innovative diagnostic tool in psychiatry and neuropsychology, but more broadly in all human health sciences. The aim of our study was to find the neuromarker of anxiety in a patient who had experienced a Transient IschemicAttack (TIA) of the left brain hemisphere as a result of a critical stenosis of the Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) operated on byendarterectomy (CEA). Case study: We will present the case of a 54-year-old man,an architect, who experienced a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) of the left brain hemispherecaused by a critical stenosis of theInternal Carotid Artery (ICA) and was treated successfully with surgical endarterectomy (CEA). One year after the surgery itself, the patient developed severe postoperative anxiety, headaches, difficulty in sleepingas well as the inability to continue working in his profession. Strong anxiety was notedon the adapted 100-millimeter Visual Analogue Anxiety Scale (VAAS). The patient was assessed using the Human Brain Index (HBI) methodology (Kropotov 2009; 2016; 2017; Pachalska, Kaczmarek&Kropotov 2014) which consisted of recording 19-channel EEG in resting state conditions, during the cued GO/NOGO task and comparing the parameters of EEG spectra and Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) with the normative and patient databases of the Human Brain Index(HBI). No signs of cognitive dysfunction was found, however an excessive Rolandic beta was observed. In line with the working hypothesis as to the presence of an anxiety neuromarker, the patient's studies confirmed an increased P1 time wave in the left hemisphere of the brain in ERP in response to visual stimuli, i.e. an anxiety neuromarker. Following the detection of this neuro-markera specific anodic Transcranial Direct Current Stimulations (tDCS) protocol was proposed (see: Kropotov 2016; Pachalska, Kaczmarek & Kropotov 2020). Ten tDCS sessions were performed and the postoperativeanxiety was found to be resolved. The patient returned to work. Conclusions: The use of Human Brain Index (HBI) methodologyenabling the isolation of the Event Related Potentials (ERPs) patterns revealed the presence of a distinct anxietyneuromarker. Neurotherapy with the use of tDCS allowed the reduction of anxiety symptoms and the patient's return to work. The above case study indicates the necessity to use new neurotechnologies in the diagnosis of mental diseases, with particular emphasis on postoperative anxiety.

In order to develop BCI that will assist individuals across a wide range of everyday life behaviors, it is critical to test paradigms that have been successful in highly controlled setups within the frame of real-world environments. In the present study, a visual P300 paradigm was used to elicit neural responses reflective of decision making within the frame of real-world navigation. Participants (n = 8) were equipped with a tablet and a mobile EEG system while navigating through university corridors. Upon reaching an intersection, participants were presented with left and right arrows flashing on the tablet (and additional non-directional stimuli in the distractor condition). Neural responses elicited by the presentation of such stimuli (Event-Related Potentials) were recorded along with the participant's navigational decisions. The participants completed two separate sessions to collect data for both the training and testing of an offline BCI system aimed at predicting their navigational decisions based on the extraction of event-related potentials features. Single-trial classification accuracy reached 59.6% (up to 72.3% when classifying group averages of six trials). Individual classification results were contrasted with single-trial analysis. Results are discussed in terms of their implications for the design of real-world BCI applications, and several recommendations to improve experimental protocols are proposed.

Parameters associated with REM sleep, such as REM sleep numbers, REM density, REM latency, and pre-REM negativity have been associated with the functional role of REM sleep. The temporal properties of these parameters appear to play an essential role in REM sleep, so precise knowledge of these temporal properties, particularly REM onset, can help elucidate the temporal dynamics of neural activity related to REM sleep. However, manual detection of this event is a time-consuming and subjective process that can be facilitated by an automatic detection tool. We developed an automatic REM onset detection algorithm based on features describing rapid eye movements and compared the results obtained with human detection by a sleep expert.

This study investigated early (P1) and later (P3) event related potentials of the electroencephalogram associated with visual perception in older and younger adults while sitting, standing, and walking. While sitting and standing, accurate performance in both groups was not associated with event-related potential characteristics. During walking, in contrast, prolonged latencies and reduced amplitudes of the P1 were related to slower responses and increased misses, respectively. No covariations of behavior and P3 characteristics were observed. However, prolonged P3 latencies with increasing motor task complexity were present for both age groups, and reduced amplitudes while walking were replicated in younger participants. Older participants were more affected by walking in general as reflected in slower walking speeds as well as reduced accuracy and relative P1 amplitudes. These results provide further insights into cognitive-motor interference during natural walking in younger and older adults on early attentional-perceptual processing stages, even for simple additional visual tasks.

Impaired selective attention in patients with severe primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis: An event-related potential study	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						Nocturnal enuresis; Event-related potentials; P300; Attention	DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; URINARY-TRACT FUNCTION; DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; STANDARDIZATION COMMITTEE; CHILDREN; P300; PREVALENCE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; ABNORMALITIES; TERMINOLOGY	Objectives: Primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (PMNE) is a very common problem in school age children. It is thought that PMNE represents a maturational lag in the central nervous system of those children. We did this case control study to assess the selective attention and resource allocation in those children using the P300 wave of the Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) and its relation to disease severity. Methods: Forty four patients with PMNE and twenty three healthy controls were included in this study. Patients were diagnosed according to the criteria of international children's continence society and were classified into two groups; patients with frequent wetting (>= 4 episodes/week), and patients with infrequent wetting (<4 episodes/week). ERPs were recorded at Fz, Cz, and Pz locations using odd-ball paradigm. N200 and P300 peak latencies (ms), and N200/P300 peak to peak amplitudes (mu V) were measured. Results: We found significant increase of P300 and N200/P300 interpeak latencies, and significant decrease of P300 amplitudes in frequent wetting group "severe" PMNE compared to healthy controls and infrequent wetting group. Conclusion: Abnormal selective attention and resource allocation were found in patients with severe PMNE. Measures to improve selective attention might be helpful in treatment of patients with severe PMNE. Significance: Impaired selective attention might play a role in pathogenesis of severe PMNE and the need for the various measures to improve selective attention may be further studied as a therapeutic tool for patients with severe PMNE.

After decades of effort, we now have a deeper understanding of the evolutionary value and dominant factors of IRA; however, little is known regarding the brain mechanisms related to its generation and evaluation. In this study, we combined classic event-related potential analysis with dipole-source analysis to examine electroencephalogram (EEG) signals generated while participants assessed their romantic interest in potential partners. The EEG signals were categorized into IRA-engendered and unengendered conditions based on behavioral indicators. We found that the faces elicited multiple late positivities, including P300 over the occipital-parietal regions and late positive potentials (LPPs) over the anterior regions. When compared to faces that did not engender IRA, faces that did engender IRA elicited (1) enhanced P300 over the parietal regions and heightened neural activity in the insula and cingulate cortex and (2) larger LPPs over the anterior regions and heightened neural activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, frontal eye field, visual cortex, and insula. These results suggest IRA is generated and evaluated by an extensive brain network involved in emotion processing, attention control, and social evaluations. Furthermore, these findings indicate that P300 and LPP may represent different cognitive processes during IRA.</p>	[Yuan, Guangjie; Liu, Guangyuan] Southwest Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Guangjie; Liu, Guangyuan] Chongqing Collaborat Innovat Ctr Brain Sci, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Guangjie; Liu, Guangyuan] Southwest Univ, Inst Affect Comp & Informat Proc, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Guangjie; Liu, Guangyuan] Chongqing Key Lab Nonlinear Circuits & Intelligen, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Guangyuan; Wei, Dongtao] Southwest Univ, Fac Psychol, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Guangyuan; Wei, Dongtao] Minist Educ, Key Lab Cognit & Personal, Chongqing, Peoples R China		Liu, GY (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Chongqing, Peoples R China.; Liu, GY (corresponding author), Chongqing Collaborat Innovat Ctr Brain Sci, Chongqing, Peoples R China.; Liu, GY (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Inst Affect Comp & Informat Proc, Chongqing, Peoples R China.; Liu, GY (corresponding author), Chongqing Key Lab Nonlinear Circuits & Intelligen, Chongqing, Peoples R China.; Liu, GY (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Fac Psychol, Chongqing, Peoples R China.; Liu, GY (corresponding author), Minist Educ, Key Lab Cognit & Personal, Chongqing, Peoples R China.	liugy@swu.edu.cn		Yuan, Guangjie/0000-0002-3302-8929					79	1	1	1	11	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND		1662-453X		FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ	Front.

Co-occurring tobacco and cannabis use in adolescents: Dissociable relationships with mediofrontal electrocortical activity during reward feedback processing	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Adolescents; Cigarette smoking; Cannabis and tobacco co-use; Cannabis-related problem severity; Feedback related negativity	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SUBSTANCE USE; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ATTENTIONAL BIAS; RISK-TAKING; PREDICTION ERROR; DECISION-MAKING; DRUG-USE; SMOKING; BRAIN	Differences in corticostriatal neural activity during feedback processing of rewards and losses have been separately related to cannabis and tobacco use but remain understudied relative to co-use in adolescents. Using highdensity EEG (128 electrode system, 1000 Hz sampling), we examined event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by monetary reward, neutral, and loss feedback during performance on a non-learning four-choice guessing task in a sample of non-deprived daily-cigarette-smoking adolescents (n = 36) who used tobacco and cannabis regularly (TC adolescents), and non-smoking healthy control adolescents (HCs) (n = 29). Peak amplitudes and latencies of mediofrontal ERPs indexing feedback-related negativities (FRNs) were used as outcomes in repeated-measures ANOVAs. No differences in FRNs were observed between TC and HC adolescents. Within TC adolescents, cannabis-use and tobacco-use variables had distinct relationships with the FRN, with cannabis-related problem severity being positively correlated with FRN amplitude during reward feedback and tobacco-related problem severity being negatively correlated with FRN latency during non-loss feedback (i.e., reward and neutral). These findings suggest that co-occurring cannabis and tobacco use may have dissociable relationships with feedback processing relating to each drug and support an incentive salience model of addiction severity related to cannabis use in adolescents.

We recorded electroencephalogram during food choices while participants responded naturally or regulated their choices by attending to health attributes or decreasing attention to taste attributes. Using a drift diffusion model, we predicted the time course of neural signals associated with AVC and EA. Results suggested that event-related potentials (ERPs) correlated with the time course of model-predicted taste-attribute signals, with no modulation by regulation. By contrast, suppression of frontal and occipital alpha power correlated with the time course of EA, tracked tastiness according to its goal relevance, and predicted individual variation in successful down-regulation of tastiness. Additionally, an earlier rise in frontal and occipital theta power represented food tastiness more strongly during regulation and predicted a weaker influence of food tastiness on behaviour. Our findings illuminate how regulation modifies the representation of attributes during the process of EA.

The experience of acute stress reduces fMRI correlates of reward-related neural activity; however, few studies have examined how acute stress impacts measures of reward derived from event-related potentials (ERPs). The current study examined the impact of an acute stressor on the Reward Positivity (RewP), an ERP that indexes reward sensitivity, in twenty-six college students. Participants completed a monetary reward task while they placed their left hand in cold water set at 13 degrees C (i.e. acute stress condition) and again while their hand was placed in room temperature water (i.e. control condition). These conditions were separated by one week and performed in a counter-balanced order across participants. The results revealed that the RewP amplitude was blunted in the acute stress condition compared to the control condition. Moreover, there was a trend toward this effect interacting with self-reported depressive symptoms: the RewP was reduced only among individuals who reported low depressive symptoms. The current study suggests that an acute stressor reduces the RewP, and that this effect might be moderated by current depressive symptoms. Future studies might examine the temporal association between reward processing and stress, and how they interact to predict depressive symptoms.LAY SUMMARY The current study examined the impact of acute stress on the brain's reward system. The results indicated that acute stress reduced activity within the brain's reward system, particularly among individuals with low depressive symptoms.

Dichotic listening deficits in amblyaudia are characterized by aberrant neural oscillations in auditory cortex	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Auditory processing disorders (APD); Event-related brain potentials (ERPs); Gamma/beta band response; Hemispheric asymmetries; Phase-locking; Time-frequency analysis	WHITE-MATTER MICROSTRUCTURE; PROCESSING DISORDER APD; CONDUCTIVE HEARING-LOSS; RIGHT-EAR ADVANTAGE; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; BINAURAL INTERACTION; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; INTRACEREBRAL SOURCES; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; BETA-OSCILLATIONS	Objective: Children diagnosed with auditory processing disorder (APD) show deficits in processing complex sounds that are associated with difficulties in higher-order language, learning, cognitive, and communicative functions. Amblyaudia (AMB) is a subcategory of APD characterized by abnormally large ear asymmetries in dichotic listening tasks. Methods: Here, we examined frequency-specific neural oscillations and functional connectivity via high-density electroencephalography (EEG) in children with and without AMB during passive listening of non-speech stimuli. Results: Time-frequency maps of these "brain rhythms" revealed stronger phase-locked beta-gamma (similar to 35 Hz) oscillations in AMB participants within bilateral auditory cortex for sounds presented to the right ear, suggesting a hypersynchronization and imbalance of auditory neural activity. Brain-behavior correlations revealed neural asymmetries in cortical responses predicted the larger than normal right-ear advantage seen in participants with AMB. Additionally, we found weaker functional connectivity in the AMB group from right to left auditory cortex, despite their stronger neural responses overall. Conclusion: Our results reveal abnormally large auditory sensory encoding and an imbalance in communication between cerebral hemispheres (ipsi- to -contralateral signaling) in AMB. Significance: These neurophysiological changes might lead to the functionally poorer behavioral capacity to integrate information between the two ears in children with AMB.

However, most of the studies consider major standard languages, such as English, Dutch, Spanish or Italian. This is a limitation, since these languages display relatively simple systems that are fairly stable and do not allow to address language variation and change. Here we investigated gender agreement in a dialect of Southern Italy spoken in Agnone, using Event-Related Potentials. Compared with Italian and most standard Romance languages, the Agnonese gender system is more complex (with three target genders: feminine, masculine, neuter) and, also under the pressure of standard Italian, undergoing change, with the neuter merging into the masculine. Results showed that all determiner-noun gender mismatches elicited robust P600 and moderate Left Anterior Negativity (LAN) effects. Yet not all violations involving neuter nouns were equally outright. For masculineneuter, the amplitude of the P600 was less pronounced than for feminine-neuter violations. Moreover, when looking at individual differences, the P600 for masculine-neuter was progressively reduced as participants' competence in the Agnonese conservative variety decreased. Since sociolinguistics shows that individual variation within the speech community may reflect linguistic change, the smaller P600 exhibited by less conservative speakers could be described as a brain signature of ongoing language change in the Agnonese gender system. In other words, the attenuation of ungrammaticality-driven brain responses may provide a measurable indicator of the fading of the neuter and its merging into the masculine. This work paves the way to the neurolinguistic description of non-standard varieties and also breaks ground for a "diachronic neurolinguistics", extending investigation into the neurobiology of language beyond the synchronic dimension.

However, the precise characteristics of position marking have remained largely elusive. Recent studies have shown that space is involved in marking serial position of items in verbal working memory (WM). Furthermore, it has been suggested, but not proven, that accessing these items involves horizontal shifts of spatial attention. We used continuous electroencephalography recordings to show that memory search in serial order verbal WM involves spatial attention processes that share the same electrophysiological signatures as those operating on the visuospatial WM and external space. Accessing an item from a sequence in verbal WM induced posterior "early directing attention negativity" and "anterior directing attention negativity" contralateral to the position of the item in mental space (i.e., begin items on the left; end items on the right). In the frequency domain, we observed posterior alpha suppression contralateral to the position of the item. Our results provide clear evidence for the involvement of spatial attention in retrieving serial information from verbal WM. Implications for WM models are discussed.

J	Chen, J; Wu, K; Shi, YP; Ai, XQ				Chen Jie; Wu Ke; Shi Yupeng; Ai Xiaoqing			The relationship between dispositional self-construal and empathy for ingroup and outgroup members' pain: evidence from ERPs	ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						pain empathy; dispositional self-construal; ingroup; event-related potentials; N2; P3	MODULATES NEURAL RESPONSES; OTHERS PAIN; BRAIN; BIAS; PERCEPTION; GENDER; FEEL	Empathy to others' pain is key to human social interaction and development. Previous studies suggest that pain empathy is influenced by numerous factors, including different characteristics of the observed target and the observer. Moreover, the relationship between an observer and the target also plays an important role. Self-construal, a personality trait, reflects the extent to which people consider themselves as connected to or separated from others. Recently, researchers have found temporal self-construal priming could modulate empathic neural responses to pain and change racial in-group bias measured in the neural response to pain. Unlike temporary, situational self-construal, the dispositional self-construal is a stable trait, the formation of which is influenced by long-term cultural experience. Previous ERP studies have found dispositional self-construal to modulate self-relevant processing more rapidly than temporal self-construal. Thus, the present study explores whether dispositional self-construal is related to empathic neural responses to others' pain and whether in-group bias mediates such modulation. It has been shown that the temporal processing of empathy for pain consists of an early emotional sharing stage and a late cognitive evaluation stage. Accordingly, we assumed dispositional self-construal would correlate with either automatic emotional sharing or top-down controlled processes of empathy for pain. Twenty-seven Chinese participants took part in the present study. Before the formal experiment, participants were informed that the models in the pictures were selected from their fellow-townsman WeChat groups (ingroup) and other WeChat groups (outgroup). Next, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) while participants took part in a word-priming paradigm, in which a word cue ("ingroup" or "outgroup") was presented for 500 ms, indicating the identity of the model, followed by a picture of the model's face touched either by painful or non-painful stimulation. Participants were instructed to judge whether the model in the picture was feeling pain by pressing a button using the left or right index fingers. After the EEG recording, participants rated the intensity of pain supposedly felt by the model as well as the degree of unpleasantness they felt when they saw each picture. Participants also completed the 24-item SCS on a seven-point scale to evaluate their interdependence and independence of self-construal. The ERP results showed a significant ingroup bias in the early N2 component. Painful stimuli elicited a greater negative shift relative to non-painful stimuli in response to ingroup faces. No such effect was observed on outgroup faces. The N2 component has previously been associated with automatic emotion sharing. A long latency empathic response was also observed at P3 over parietal electrodes. Painful stimuli elicited larger P3 amplitudes than the non-painful stimuli in both ingroup and outgroup face conditions. The P3 component is related to the cognitively controlled process of pain empathy. Importantly, correlation analysis revealed significant relationships between dispositional self-construal score (interdependence minus independence scores) and the amplitude difference (painful minus no-painful stimulus conditions) of P3 in both ingroup and outgroup face conditions. Furthermore, correlation coefficients were similar between ingroup and outgroup face conditions. In addition, we observed a positive relationship between the level of the interdependent self-construal and subjective rating of perceived pain and self-unpleasantness. In sum, the present study demonstrated a significant ingroup bias in the early N2 stage, but not in the late P3 stage. Moreover, dispositional self-construal correlated with both ingroup and outgroup empathy for pain, and high interdependence was associated with enhanced P3 response to other's pain regardless of group membership.

This is illustrated by the central tendency effect: When estimating a range of intervals, short intervals are overestimated, whereas long intervals are underestimated to reduce the overall estimation error. Most models of interval timing ascribe this effect to the weighting of the current interval with previous memory traces after the interval has been perceived. Alternatively, the perception of the duration could already be flexibly tuned to its temporal context. We investigated this hypothesis using an interval reproduction task in which human participants (both sexes) reproduced a shorter and longer interval range. As expected, reproductions were biased toward the subjective mean of each presented range. EEG analyses showed that temporal context indeed affected neural dynamics during the perception phase. Specifically, longer previous durations decreased contingent negative variation and P2 amplitude and increased beta power. In addition, multivariate pattern analysis showed that it is possible to decode context from the transient EEG signal quickly after both onset and offset of the perception phase. Together, these results suggest that temporal context creates dynamic expectations which actively affect the perception of duration.

J	Zhang, KL; Sjerps, MJ; Peng, G				Zhang, Kaile; Sjerps, Matthias J.; Peng, Gang			Integral perception, but separate processing: The perceptual normalization of lexical tones and vowels	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Perceptual normalization; Lexical tones; Vowels; ERPs	SPOKEN WORD RECOGNITION; ERP COMPONENTS; TIME-COURSE; STIMULUS; CHINESE; GO; COMPENSATION; LANGUAGE; TASK; P3	In tonal languages, speech variability arises in both lexical tone (i.e., suprasegmentally) and vowel quality (segmentally). Listeners can use surrounding speech context to overcome variability in both speech cues, a process known as extrinsic normalization. Although vowels are the main carriers of tones, it is still unknown whether the combined percept (lexical tone and vowel quality) is normalized integrally or in partly separate processes. Here we used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the time course of lexical tone normalization and vowel normalization to answer this question. Cantonese adults listened to synthesized three-syllable stimuli in which the identity of a target syllable ? ambiguous between high vs. mid-tone (Tone condition) or between /o/ vs. /u/ (Vowel condition) ? was dependent on either the tone range (Tone condition) or the formant range (Vowel condition) of the first two syllables. It was observed that the ambiguous tone was more often interpreted as a high-level tone when the context had a relatively low pitch than when it had a high pitch (Tone condition). Similarly, the ambiguous vowel was more often interpreted as /o/ when the context had a relatively low formant range than when it had a relatively high formant range (Vowel condition). These findings show the typical pattern of extrinsic tone and vowel normalization. Importantly, the EEG results of participants showing the contrastive normalization effect demonstrated that the effects of vowel normalization could already be observed within the N2 time window (190?350 ms), while the first reliable effect of lexical tone normalization on cortical processing was observable only from the P3 time window (220?500 ms) onwards. The ERP patterns demonstrate that the contrastive perceptual normalization of lexical tones and that of vowels occur at least in partially separate time windows. This suggests that the extrinsic normalization can operate at the level of phonemes and tonemes separately instead of operating on the whole syllable at once.

Among the BCI paradigms, motor imagery (MI)-based closed-loop BCI is still the main pattern in rehabilitation training. It can estimate a patient' motor intention and provide corresponding feedback. However, the individual difference in the ability to generate event-related desynchronization (ERD) and the low classification accuracy of the multi-class scenario restrict the application of MI-based BCI. In the current study, a novel online action observation (AO)-based BCI was proposed. The visual stimuli of four types of hand movements were designed to simultaneously induce steady-state motion visual evoked potential (SSMVEP) in the occipital region and to activate the sensorimotor region. Task-related component analysis was performed to identify the SSMVEP. Results showed that the amplitude of the induced frequency in the SSMVEP had a negative relationship with the stimulus frequency. The classification accuracy in the four-class scenario reached 72.81 +/- 13.55% within 2.5s. Importantly, the AO-based closed-loop BCI, which provided visual feedback based on the SSMVEP, could enhance ERD compared with AO-alone. The increased attentiveness might be one key factor for the enhancement of the ERD in the designed AO-based BCI. In summary, the proposed AO-based BCI provides a new insight for BCI-based rehabilitation.

There is some evidence though suggesting that the neural basis of Tourette syndrome is related to perception-action processing and binding between perception and action. However, binding processes have not been examined in the motor domain in these patients. If it is particularly perception-action binding but not binding processes within the motor system, this would further corroborate that Tourette syndrome it is not predominantly, or solely, a motor disorder. Here, we studied N = 22 Tourette patients and N = 24 healthy controls using an established action coding paradigm derived from the Theory of Event Coding framework and concomitant EEG-recording addressing binding between a planned but postponed, and an interleaved immediate reaction with different levels of overlap of action elements. Behavioral performance during interleaved action coding was normal in Tourette syndrome. Response locked lateralized readiness potentials reflecting processes related to motor execution were larger in Tourette syndrome, but only in simple conditions. However, pre-motor processes including response preparation and configuration reflected by stimulus-locked lateralized readiness potentials were normal. This was supported by a Bayesian data analysis providing evidence for the null hypothesis. The finding that processes integrating different action-related elements prior to motor execution are normal in Tourette syndrome suggests that Tourette it is not solely a motor disorder. Considering other recent evidence, the data show that changes in "binding" in Tourette syndrome are specific for perception-action integration but not for action coding.

JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						steady-state motion visual evoked potential; sensorimotor rhythm; brain&#8211; computer interface		Objective. Different visual stimuli might have different effects on the brain, e.g. the change of brightness, non-biological movement and biological movement. Approach. In this study, flicker, checkerboard and gaiting stimuli were chosen as visual stimuli to investigate whether steady-state motion visual evoked potential (SSMVEP) effect on the sensorimotor area for rehabilitation. The gaiting stimulus was designed as the gaiting sequence of a human. The hypothesis is that only observing the designed gaiting stimulus would simultaneously induce: (1) SSMVEP in the occipital area, similarly to an SSVEP stimulus; and (2) sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) in the primary sensorimotor area, because such action observation could activate the mirror neuron system. Canonical correlation analysis was used to detect SSMVEP from occipital electroencephalograms (EEG), and event-related spectral perturbation was used to identify SMR in the EEG from the sensorimotor area. Main results. The results showed that the designed gaiting stimulus-induced SSMVEP, with classification accuracies of 88.9 +/- 12.0% in a four-class scenario. More importantly, it induced clear and sustained event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS), while no ERD/ERS could be observed when the other two SSVEP stimuli were used. Further, for participants with a sufficiently clear SSMVEP pattern (classification accuracy >85%), the ERD index values in the mu-beta band induced by the proposed gaiting stimulus were statistically different from those of the other two types of stimulus. Significance. Therefore, a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) based on the designed stimulus has potential in neurorehabilitation applications because it simultaneously has the high accuracy of an SSMVEP (sim90% accuracy in a four-class setup) and the ability to activate the sensorimotor area.

Moreover, within SSTs, stopsignals are indeed infrequent events, presenting a systematic confound that hampers the interpretation of the stop-signal P3 (and other candidate neural indices of motor inhibition). Therefore, we performed two studies to test whether the stop-signal P3 is uniquely related to motor inhibition or reflects infrequency detection. In Study 1, participants completed the SST and a visually identical change-detection task requiring the detection of a taskrelevant, frequent signal (but not motor inhibition). We observed a P3 associated with motor inhibition in the SST, but no such positivity in the change-detection task. In Study 2, we modified the change-detection task. Some task-relevant events were now infrequent, matching the frequency of stop-signals in the SST. These events indeed evoked a P3, though of smaller amplitude than the P3 in the SST. Independent component analysis suggested that stop-signal P3 and infrequency-P3 ERPs were non-independent and shared a common neural generator. Further analyses suggested that this common neural process likely reflects motor inhibition in both tasks: infrequent events in the change-detection task lead to a non-instructed, incidental slowing of motor responding, the degree of which was strongly correlated with P3 amplitude. These results have wide-reaching implications for the interpretation of neural signals in both stop-signal and infrequency/oddball-tasks.

Although the lateralization of movement-related potential, the event-related desynchronization, and more complicated inter-regional information coupling have been investigated, seldom studies have focused on investigating the dynamic information exchanging among multiple brain regions during motor execution for post-stroke hemiplegic patients. With high temporal-resolution electroencephalogram (EEG), the time-varying network is able to reflect the dynamical complex network modalities corresponding to the movements at a millisecond level. In our present study, the wrist extension experiment was designed, along with related EEG datasets being collected. Thereafter, the corresponding time-varying networks underlying the wrist extension were accordingly constructed by adopting the adaptive directed transfer function and then statistically explored, to further uncover the dynamic network deficits (i.e., motor dysfunction) in post-stroke hemiplegic patients. Results of this study found the effective connectivity between the stroked motor area and other areas decreased in patients when compared to healthy controls; on the contrary, the enhanced connectivity between non-stroked motor areas and other areas, especially the frontal and parietal-occipital lobes, were further identified for patients during their accomplishing the designed wrist extension, which might dynamically compensate for the deficited patients' motor behaviors. These findings not only helped deepen our knowledge of the mechanism underlying the patients' motor behaviors, but also facilitated the real-time strategies for clinical therapy of brain stroke, as well as providing a reliable biomarker to predict the future rehabilitation.

Previous research has shown perspective-dependent cerebral responses during the observation of both ongoing actions and static images of an acting body with implied motion information, with an advantage for the egocentric viewpoint. The present high-density EEG study assessed event-related potentials triggered by the presentation of a forearm at rest before reach-to-grasp actions, shown from four different viewpoints. Through a spatiotemporal analysis of the scalp electric field and the localization of cortical generators, our study revealed overall different processing for the third-person perspective relative to other viewpoints, mainly due to a later activation of motor-premotor regions. Since observing a static body effector often precedes action observation, our results integrate previous evidence of perspective-dependent encoding, with cascade implications on the design of neurorehabilitative or motor learning interventions based on action observation.

However, the recognition of MI relies on the event-related desynchronization (ERD) feature, which has poor task specificity. Further, there is the problem of false triggering (irrelevant mental activities recognized as the MI of the target limb). In this paper, we discuss the feasibility of reducing the false triggering rate using a novel paradigm, in which the steady-state somatosensory evoked potential (SSSEP) is combined with the MI (MI-SSSEP). Data from the target (right hand MI) and nontarget task (rest) were used to establish the recognition model, and three kinds of interference tasks were used to test the false triggering performance. In the MI-SSSEP paradigm, ERD and SSSEP features modulated by MI could be used for recognition, while in the MI paradigm, only ERD features could be used. The results showed that the false triggering rate of interference tasks with SSSEP features was reduced to 29.3%, which was far lower than the 55.5% seen under the MI paradigm with ERD features. Moreover, in the MI-SSSEP paradigm, the recognition rate of the target and nontarget task was also significantly improved. Further analysis showed that the specificity of SSSEP was significantly higher than that of ERD (p < 0.05), but the sensitivity was not significantly different. These results indicated that SSSEP modulated by MI could more specifically decode the target task MI, and thereby may have potential in achieving more accurate rehabilitation training.

Expectations about dynamic visual objects facilitates early sensory processing of congruent sounds	CORTEX			English	Article						Audio-visual; Expectation; ERP; Temporal synchrony	AUDITORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; TEMPORAL BINDING WINDOW; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; SPEECH; KNOWLEDGE; COMPONENT; HUMANS	The perception of a moving object can lead to the expectation of its sound, yet little is known about how visual expectations influence auditory processing. We examined how visual perception of an object moving continuously across the visual field influences early auditory processing of a sound that occurred congruently or incongruently with the object's motion. In Experiment 1, electroencephalogram (EEG) activity was recorded from adults who passively viewed a ball that appeared either on the left or right boundary of a display and continuously traversed along the horizontal midline to make contact and elicit a bounce sound off the opposite boundary. Our main analysis focused on the auditory-evoked event-related potential. For audio-visual (AV) trials, a sound accompanied the visual input when the ball contacted the opposite boundary (AV-synchronous), or the sound occurred before contact (AV-asynchronous). We also included audio-only and visual-only trials. AV-synchronous sounds elicited an earlier and attenuated auditory response relative to AV-asynchronous or audio-only events. In Experiment 2, we examined the roles of expectancy and multisensory integration in influencing this response. In addition to the audio-only, AV-synchronous, and AV-asynchronous conditions, participants were shown a ball that became occluded prior to reaching the boundary of the display, but elicited an expected sound at the point of occluded collision. The auditory response during the AV-occluded condition resembled that of the AV-synchronous condition, suggesting that expectations induced by a moving object can influence early auditory processing. Broadly, the results suggest that dynamic visual stimuli can help generate expectations about the timing of sounds, which then facilitates the processing of auditory information that matches these expectations.

Here we used event-related potentials (ERPs) and neuropsychological testing to probe the neurocognitive basis of reading in a sample of children with a wide range of reading skills. We report data of 51 children who were measured at two time points, i.e., at the end of first grade (mean age 7.6 years) and at the end of fourth grade (mean age 10.5 years). The aim of this study was to clarify whether next to behavioral measures also basic unimodal and bimodal neural measures help explaining the variance in the later reading outcome. Specifically, we addressed the question of whether next to the so far investigated unimodal measures of N1 print tuning and mismatch negativity (MMN), a bimodal measure of audiovisual integration (AV) contributes and possibly enhances prediction of the later reading outcome. We found that the largest variance in reading was explained by the behavioral measures of rapid automatized naming (RAN), block design and vocabulary (46%). Furthermore, we demonstrated that both unimodal measures of N1 print tuning (16%) and filtered MMN (7%) predicted reading, suggesting that N1 print tuning at the early stage of reading acquisition is a particularly good predictor of the later reading outcome. Beyond the behavioral measures, the two unimodal neural measures explained 7.2% additional variance in reading, indicating that basic neural measures can improve prediction of the later reading outcome over behavioral measures alone. In this study, the AV congruency effect did not significantly predict reading. It is therefore possible that audiovisual congruency effects reflect higher levels of multisensory integration that may be less important for reading acquisition in the first year of learning to read, and that they may potentially gain on relevance later on.

First, to determine whether a previous study on creative cognition could be replicated, and second, to extend these findings by examining individual differences in creativity. Conceptual expansion, a capacity that is central to creativity, was induced via the processing of novel metaphors. Brain activity patterns in relation to these were compared to the processing of literal and nonsense phrases. The previous findings were replicated in that the N400, known for its sensitivity to semantic anomalies, indexed the originality of the phrases, while a post-N400 late component (LC), which is linked to semantic integration processes, indexed the appropriateness of the phrases. Moreover, only the LC was significantly sensitive to individual differences in creativity in the processing of these phrases. Differences at the level of semantic integration processes as well as the structure of knowledge organization are thereby implicated in individual differences in creativity.

J	Karimi, F; Niu, JS; Gouweleeuw, K; Almeida, Q; Jiang, N				Karimi, Fatemeh; Niu, Jiansheng; Gouweleeuw, Kim; Almeida, Quincy; Jiang, Ning			Movement-related EEG signatures associated with freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease: an integrative analysis	BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; freezing of gait; supplementary motor area; movement-related cortical potential; brain oscillations	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; BETA-OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; BASAL GANGLIA; FREQUENCY-MODULATION; CORTICAL POTENTIALS; L-DOPA; CORTEX; STIMULATION	Freezing of gait is the most severe gait deficit associated with Parkinson's disease and significantly affects patients' independence and consequently their quality of life. The lack of a clear understanding of its underlying neurophysiological mechanism has resulted in limited effectiveness of the current treatment options. In this study, we investigated EEG features over (pre-)supplementary motor area and primary motor cortex during a simple cue-based ankle dorsiflexion movement. These features include movement-related cortical potentials (0.05-5 Hz) and brain oscillations (1-50 Hz). Electromyogram signal from the tibialis anterior muscle of the dominant foot was used to determine the movement onset. The EEG features before, during and following the onset of the movement were compared among three groups of participants: patients with freezing (N = 14, 11 males), patients without freezing (N = 14, 13 males) and healthy age-matched controls (N = 13, 10 males) with 15 recorded trials for each individual. Additionally, Parkinson's disease patients with freezing of gait were separated into mild (N = 7) and severe cases (N = 5), so that EEG features associated with freezing severity could be investigated. The results indicated significant differences between patients with severe freezing of gait compared to healthy controls and patients without freezing of gait. In addition, patients with mild and severe freezing represented cortical activity differences. For patients with freezing, the initial component of movement-related cortical potential is significantly lower than that of the healthy controls (P = 0.002) and is affected by the severity of freezing. Furthermore, a striking absence of beta frequency band (12-35 Hz) desynchronization was observed in patients with freezing, especially low-beta frequency band over Cz, before the movement, which was also associated with the severity of the freezing of gait. Low-beta (13-20 Hz) and high-beta (21-35 Hz) frequency band activities represented unique features for each group. Beta event-related desynchronization over Cz present in healthy controls prior to movement onset, was partially replaced by the theta band (4-8 Hz) synchrony in patients with freezing. Patients with severe freezing also represented some level of theta band synchronization over contralateral supplementary motor area. This suggests the involvement of cognitive processing over the motor cortex in controlling cue-based voluntary movement as a compensatory mechanism associated with freezing of gait. The EEG features identified in this study are indicative of important freezing of gait clinical characteristics such as severity and contribute to a better understanding of the underlying neurophysiology of the mysterious phenomenon of freezing of gait. Karimi et al. report that the severity of freezing of gait is associated with features of movement-related cortical potentials over the primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area. They also report that low- and high-beta activities and the presence of theta band synchronizations before movement execution are brain oscillations affected by freezing of gait severity.

J	Bidelman, GM; Momtaz, S				Bidelman, Gavin M.; Momtaz, Sara			Subcortical rather than cortical sources of the frequency-following response (FFR) relate to speech-in-noise perception in normal-hearing listeners	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Auditory event-related potentials (ERPs); Auditory brainstem response (ABR); Cocktail party scenario; Cortical FFR; Noise-degraded speech perception		Scalp-recorded frequency-following responses (FFRs) reflect a mixture of phase-locked activity across the auditory pathway. FFRs have been widely used as a neural barometer of complex listening skills, especially speech-in noise (SIN) perception. Applying individually optimized source reconstruction to speech-FFRs recorded via EEG (FFREEG), we assessed the relative contributions of subcortical [auditory nerve (AN), brainstem/midbrain (BS)] and cortical [bilateral primary auditory cortex, PAC] source generators with the aim of identifying which source(s) drive the brain-behavior relation between FFRs and SIN listening skills. We found FFR strength declined precipitously from AN to PAC, consistent with diminishing phase-locking along the ascending auditory neumaxis. FFRs to the speech fundamental (F0) were robust to noise across sources, but were largest in subcortical sources (BS > AN > PAC). PAC FFRs were only weakly observed above the noise floor and only at the low pitch of speech (F0 approximate to 100 Hz). Brain-behavior regressions revealed (i) AN and BS FFRs were sufficient to describe listeners' QuickSIN scores and (ii) contrary to neummagnetic (MEG) FFRs, neither left nor right PAC FFR EEG related to SIN performance. Our findings suggest subcortical sources not only dominate the electrical FFR but also the link between speech-FFRs and SIN processing in normal-hearing adults as observed in previous EEG studies.

EEG theta and alpha oscillations in early versus late mild cognitive impairment during a semantic Go/NoGo task	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Early mild cognitive impairment; Late mild cognitive impairment; Cognitive control; EEG; Theta; Alpha	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; WORKING-MEMORY; FRONTAL THETA; OLDER-ADULTS; PERFORMANCE; INHIBITION; POWER; AGE; INDIVIDUALS	Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is marked by episodic memory deficits, which can be used to classify individuals into early MCI (EMCI) and late MCI (LMCI). Although mounting evidence suggests that individuals with aMCI have additional cognitive alterations including deficits in cognitive control, few have examined if EMCI and LMCI differ on processes other than episodic memory. Using a semantic Go/NoGo task, we examined differences in cognitive control between EMCI and LMCI on behavioral (accuracy and reaction time) and neural (scalp-recorded event-related oscillations in theta and alpha band) measures. Although no behavioral differences were observed between the EMCI and LMCI groups, differences in neural oscillations were observed. The LMCI group had higher theta synchronization on Go trials at central electrodes compared to the EMCI group. In addition, the EMCI group showed differences in theta power at central electrodes and alpha power at central and centm-parietal electrodes between Go and NoGo trials, while the LMCI group did not exhibit such differences. These findings suggest that while behavioral differences may not be observable, neural changes underlying cognitive control processes may differentiate EMCI and LMCI stages and may be useful to understand the trajectory of aMCI in future studies.

However, we do not have a clear understanding of the degree working memory is impaired under prolonged TSD, nor do we know the underlying neurophysiological mechanism. In this study, we recorded EEG data from 64 subjects while they performed a working memory task during resting wakefulness, after 24 h TSD, and after 30 h TSD. ANOVA was used to verify performance differences between 24 h and 30 h TSD in working memory tasks: (1) reaction time and accuracy hit rates, (2) P200, N200, and P300 amplitude and latency in measurements of event-related potential, as well as (3) effective connectivity strength between brain areas associated with working memory. Compared to 24 h TSD, 30 h TSD significantly decreased accuracy hit rates and induced a larger N200 difference waveform. The effective connectivity analysis showed that 30 h TSD also decreased beta frequency in effective connection strength from the right insular lobe to the left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Effective connection from the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex increased in the match condition of the 2-back task. In conclusion, 30 h TSD had a greater negative impact on working memory than 24 h TSD. This impairment of working memory is associated with decreased strength in the effective connection from the right insula to the left ACC.

Methods: A cohort of 37 healthy older adults and 48 with AD participated in this study and completed an auditory oddball task using electroencephalographic equipment with 21 channels (10-20 system). APOE genotyping was obtained by real-time PCR. Results: AD presented increased P300 latency and lower P300 amplitude, compared to healthy older adults. AD APOE epsilon 4 carriers presented increased P300 latency in F3 (420.7 +/- 65.8 ms), F4 (412.0 +/- 49.0 ms), C4 (413.0 +/- 41.1 ms) and P3 (420.4 +/- 55.7 ms) compared to non-carriers (F3 = 382.5 +/- 56.8 ms, p < 0.01; F4 = 372.2 +/- 56.7 ms, p < 0.01; C4 = 374.2 +/- 51.7 ms, p < 0.01; P3 = 384.4 +/- 44.4 ms, p < 0.01). Healthy older adults APOE epsilon 4 carriers presented lower Fz amplitude (2.6 +/- 1.5 mu V) compared to non-carriers (4.9 +/- 2.9 mu V; p = 0.02). Linear regression analysis showed that being a carrier of APOE epsilon 4 allele remained significantly associated with P300 latency even after adjusting for sex, age, and cognitive grouping. APOE epsilon 4 allele increases P300 latency (95% CI 0.11-0.98; p = 0.02). Conclusion: APOE epsilon 4 allele negatively impacts cortical activity in both healthy older adults and AD individuals.

Research has suggested that older adults may be unable to compute the level of salience of unattended stimulus inputs. A multi -channel EEG was recorded in 20 younger adults and 20 older adults. In different conditions, a single 80 dB SPL auditory stimulus was presented relatively rapidly, every 1.5 s or very slowly, every 12.0 s. Par-ticipants ignored the auditory stimuli while watching a silent video. When the stimuli were presented rapidly, group differences were not observed for the amplitudes of N1 and P2, which peaked at 100 and 180 ms respectively. When stimuli were presented very slowly, their amplitudes were much enhanced for younger adults, but did not increase for older adults. The failure to observe a large increase in the am-plitude of N1 and P2 in older adults for very slowly presented auditory stimuli provides strong evidence of a dysfunction of the salience network in this group.

Multivariate pattern analysis of electroencephalography data reveals information predictive of charitable giving	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Charitable donation; N2; MVPA; Emotional priming	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DECISION-MAKING; COGNITIVE CONTROL; HELPING-BEHAVIOR; NEURAL RESPONSES; ECONOMIC MAN; BRAIN; ATTENTION; COMPONENT; VALUATION	Charitable donations are an altruistic behavior whereby individuals donate money or other resources to benefit others while the recipient is normally absent from the context. Several psychological factors have been shown to influence charitable donations, including a cost-benefit analysis, the motivation to engage in altruistic behavior, and the perceived psychological benefits of donation. Recent work has identified the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) for assigning value to options in social decision making tasks, with other regions involved in empathy and emotion contributing input to the value computation (e.g. Hare et al., 2010; Hutcherson et al., 2015; Tusche et al., 2016). Most impressively, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) has been applied to fMRI data to predict donation behavior on a trial-by-trial basis from ventral MPFC activity (Hare et al., 2010) while identifying the contribution of emotional processing in other regions to the value computation (e.g. Tusche et al., 2016). MVPA of EEG data may be able to provide further insight into the timing and scalp topography of neural activity related to both value computation and emotional effects on donation behavior. We examined the effect of incidental emotional states and the perceived urgency of the charitable cause on donation behavior using support vector regression on EEG data to predict donation amount on a trial by trial basis. We used positive, negative, and neutral pictures to induce incidental emotional states in participants before they made donation decisions concerning two types of charities. One category of charity was oriented toward saving people from current suffering, and the other was to prevent future suffering. Behaviorally, subjects donated more money in a negative emotional state relative to other emotional states, and more money to alleviate current over future suffering. The data-driven multivariate pattern analysis revealed that the electrophysiological activity elicited by both emotion-priming pictures and charity cues could predict the variation in donation magnitude on a trial-by trial basis.

In this study, we developed a physiological state indicator with five parameters that reflect the subject's real-time physiological states based on online EEG signal processing. These five parameters are attention, fatigue, stress, and the brain activity shifts of the left and right hemispheres. We designed a target detection experiment modified by a cognitive attention network test for validating the effectiveness of the proposed indicator, as such conditions would better approximate a real chaotic environment. Results demonstrated that attention levels while performing the target detection task were significantly higher than during rest periods, but also exhibited a decay over time. In contrast, the fatigue level increased gradually and plateaued by the third rest period. Similar to attention levels, the stress level decreased as the experiment proceeded. These parameters are therefore shown to be highly correlated to different stages of the experiment, suggesting their usage as primary factors in passive brain-computer interfaces (BCI). In addition, the left and right brain activity indexes reveal the EEG neural modulations of the corresponding hemispheres, which set a feasible reference of activation for an active BCI control system, such as one executing motor imagery tasks. The proposed indicator is applicable to potential passive and active BCI applications for monitoring the subject's physiological state change in real-time, along with providing a means of evaluating the associated signal quality to enhance the BCI performance.

Studies showed that this activation enhances the early cortical processing of co-localized visual stimuli presented after, reflected by better detection rates, better discrimination, and sharper perceived contrast. We replicated the ACOP, using earphones, and tested whether auditory cuing can influence temporal order judgments (TOJ) for two visual stimuli (horizontal arrangement) as well as if the ACOP would predict the amplitude of this influence. A lateral salient sound was followed, after 150 or 630 ms, by the visual presentation of a pair of disks, one in left and one in right hemifield, with variable SOA. The TOJ task was to indicate which disk appeared first or which disk appeared second (controlling for response bias). We observed an ACOP at posterior electrode sites and confirmed our hypothesis that the lateral sound influenced TOJ by accelerating the perception of the disk presented on the cued side, even though the sound was irrelevant to the task. Furthermore, the ACOP amplitude was correlated to this visual perceptual change, indicating that a larger change in brain activity was associated with a faster processing of co-localized visual stimuli.

Here, we explore the hypothesis that surprise depends not only on comparing current events to past experience, but also on online evaluation of performance via internal monitoring. Specifically, we propose that people leverage insights from response-based performance monitoring - outcome predictions and confidence - to control learning from feedback. In line with predictions from a Bayesian inference model, we find that people who are better at calibrating their confidence to the precision of their outcome predictions learn more quickly. Further in line with our proposal, EEG signatures of feedback processing are sensitive to the accuracy of, and confidence in, post-response outcome predictions. Taken together, our results suggest that online predictions and confidence serve to calibrate neural error signals to improve the efficiency of learning.

To date, depression-related P300 amplitude reduction has mostly been demonstrated cross-sectionally, while its clinical implication for the course of depression remains largely unclear. Moreover, the relationship between P300 and specific clinical characteristics of depression is uncertain. To shed light on the functional significance of the P300 in depression, we examined whether initial P300 amplitude prospectively predicted changes in depressive symptoms among a community sample of 58 adults (mean age = 38.86 years old, 81% female) with a current depressive disorder. This sample was assessed at two-time points, separated by approximately nine months (range = 6.6-15.9). At the initial visit, participants completed clinical interviews, self-report measures, and a flanker task, while EEG was recorded to derive P300 amplitude. At the follow-up visit, participants again completed the same clinical interviews and self-report measures. Results indicated that a reduced P300 amplitude at the initial visit was associated with higher total depressive symptoms at follow-up, even after controlling for initial depressive symptoms. These data indicate the potential clinical utility for the P300 as a neural marker of disease course among adults with a current depressive disorder. Future research may target P300 in interventions to determine whether depression-related outcomes can be improved.	[Santopetro, Nicholas J.; Brush, C.

J	Argiris, G; Rumiati, RI; Crepaldi, D				Argiris, Georgette; Rumiati, Raffaella, I; Crepaldi, Davide			No fruits without color: Cross-modal priming and EEG reveal different roles for different features across semantic categories	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SPREADING ACTIVATION; OBJECT RECOGNITION; SURFACE DETAIL; NEURAL BASIS; BRAIN; KNOWLEDGE; SIMILARITY; PICTURES; REPRESENTATIONS; NEUROSCIENCE	Category-specific impairments witnessed in patients with semantic deficits have broadly dissociated into natural and artificial kinds. However, how the category of food (more specifically, fruits and vegetables) fits into this distinction has been difficult to interpret, given a pattern of deficit that has inconsistently mapped onto either kind, despite its intuitive membership to the natural domain. The present study explores the effects of a manipulation of a visual sensory (i.e., color) or functional (i.e., orientation) feature on the consequential semantic processing of fruits and vegetables (and tools, by comparison), first at the behavioral and then at the neural level. The categorization of natural (i.e., fruits/vegetables) and artificial (i.e., utensils) entities was investigated via cross-modal priming. Reaction time analysis indicated a reduction in priming for color-modified natural entities and orientation-modified artificial entities. Standard event-related potentials (ERP) analysis was performed, in addition to linear classification. For natural entities, a N400 effect at central channel sites was observed for the color-modified condition compared relative to normal and orientation conditions, with this difference confirmed by classification analysis. Conversely, there was no significant difference between conditions for the artificial category in either analysis. These findings provide strong evidence that color is an integral property to the categorization of fruits/vegetables, thus substantiating the claim that feature-based processing guides as a function of semantic category.

This study's objective was to analyze the difference in LDAEP between depressed patients with suicide attempts (SA) and suicidal ideation (SI). It included 130 participants (45 depressed patients with SA, 49 depressed patients with SI, and 36 healthy controls) aged>18 years who exhibited LDAEP during electroencephalography. Psychological characteristics and event-related potentials of the three groups were compared. There was no significant difference in LDAEP between major depressive disorder (MDD) patients with SA and SI (p=0.59). MDD patients with SI, who attempted suicide had significantly lower LDAEP than healthy controls (p=0.01 and p=0.01, respectively). However, the significance disappeared when psychological characteristics were controlled. Our results suggest that LDAEP might not be possible biomarkers for suicidal behaviors in patients with MDD. Further studies to assess the biological basis of suicide and identify the underlying dimensions that mediate the relationship between the biological basis and suicidal behaviors will be needed.

Although such task-unrelated thoughts (TUTs) are pervasive and detrimental to task performance, their underlying neural mechanisms are only modestly understood. To investigate TUTs with high spatial and temporal precision, we simultaneously measured fMRI, EEG, and pupillometry in healthy adults while they performed a sustained attention task with experience sampling probes. Features of interest were extracted from each modality at the single-trial level and fed to a support vector machine that was trained on the probe responses. Compared to task-focused attention, the neural signature of TUTs was characterized by weaker activity in the default mode network but elevated activity in its anticorrelated network, stronger functional coupling between these networks, widespread increase in alpha, theta, delta, but not beta, frequency power, predominantly reduced amplitudes of late, but not early, event-related potentials, and larger baseline pupil size. Particularly, information contained in dynamic interactions between large-scale cortical networks was predictive of transient changes in attentional focus above other modalities. Together, our results provide insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of TUTs and the neural markers that may facilitate their detection.

Accordingly, it would appear advantageous if the processing of self-motion direction (heading) was predictive, thereby accelerating the encoding of unexpected changes, and un-impaired by attentional load. We tested this hypothesis by recording EEG in humans and macaque monkeys with similar experimental protocols. Subjects viewed a random dot pattern simulating self-motion across a ground plane in an oddball EEG paradigm. Standard and deviant trials differed only in their simulated heading direction (forward-left vs. forward-right). Event-related potentials (ERPs) were compared in order to test for the occurrence of a visual mismatch negativity (vMMN), a component that reflects preattentive and likely also predictive processing of sensory stimuli. Analysis of the ERPs revealed signatures of a prediction mismatch for deviant stimuli in both humans and monkeys. In humans, a MMN was observed starting 110 ms after self-motion onset. In monkeys, peak response amplitudes following deviant stimuli were enhanced compared to the standard already 100 ms after self-motion onset. We consider our results strong evidence for a preattentive processing of visual self-motion information in humans and monkeys, allowing for ultrafast adjustments of their heading direction.

Limited research has investigated the effects of combining both tDCS and music listening together on cognition. The present study examined whether anodal tDCS stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (2 mA, 20 min) with concurrent listening to autobiographically-salient music amplified subsequent changes in working memory and recognition memory in older adults than either tDCS or music listening alone. In a randomized sham-controlled crossover study, 14 healthy older adults (64-81 years) participated in three neurostimulation conditions: tDCS with music listening (tDCS+Music), tDCS in silence (tDCS-only), or sham-tDCS with music listening (Sham+Music), each separated by at least a week. Working memory was assessed pre- and post-stimulation using a digit span task, and recognition memory was assessed post-stimulation using an auditory word recognition task (WRT) during which electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Performance on the backwards digit span showed improvement in tDCS+Music, but not in tDCS-only or Sham+Music conditions. Although no differences in behavioural performance were observed in the auditory WRT, changes in neural correlates underlying recognition memory were observed following tDCS+Music compared to Sham+Music. Findings suggest listening to autobiographically-salient music may amplify the effects of tDCS for working memory, and highlight the potential utility of neurostimulation combined with personalized music to improve cognitive performance in the aging population.

A new approach is proposed to assess the concealed information in the individuals utilizing their single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms based on experimental testing. EEG signals of 35 guilty and innocent participants were recorded corresponding to the pictorial and auditory stimuli with the help of a customized mock crime based protocol. Pre-processing of EEG data resulted in artifact-free average probe waveforms at Pz electrode location. Then, different time, frequency, wavelet, and empirical mode decomposition derived features corresponding to average pictorial and auditory probe waveforms were extracted. An optimal number of distinctive features were attained with the ReliefF ranking method. The proposed combination of seven auditory ranked features with a support vector machine (radial basis function) kernel was evaluated comprehensively to differentiate between the guilty and innocent subjects. The proposed combination achieved a sensitivity of 100%, the specificity of 87.50%, and the highest classification accuracy of 92.86%, using one EEG channel. The proposed arrangement performed better and exhibited low combined uncertainty than the competent feature extraction techniques in recognizing the concealed information.

Here we tracked these interference dynamics electrophysiologically to further our understanding of the underlying processes. Twenty-seven Dutch native speakers learned 70 new Italian words over two days. On a third day, EEG was recorded as they performed naming tasks on half of these words in English and, finally, as their memory for all the Italian words was tested in a picture-naming task. Replicating Mickan et al. recall was slower and tended to be less complete for Italian words that were interfered with (i.e., named in English) than for words that were not. These behavioral interference effects were accompanied by an enhanced frontal N2 and a decreased late positivity (LPC) for interfered compared to not-interfered items. Moreover, interfered items elicited more theta power. We also found an increased N2 during the interference phase for items that participants were later slower to retrieve in Italian. We interpret the N2 and theta effects as markers of interference, in line with the idea that Italian retrieval at final test is hampered by competition from recently practiced English translations. The LPC, in turn, reflects the consequences of interference: the reduced accessibility of interfered Italian labels. Finally, that retrieval ease at final test was related to the degree of interference during previous English retrieval shows that FLA is already set in motion during the interference phase, and hence can be the direct consequence of using other languages.

Psychological and Electrophysiological Correlates of Word Learning Success	PSYCHOLOGY IN RUSSIA-STATE OF THE ART			English	Article						word learning; semantics; EEG; alpha oscillations; ERP; ambiguity tolerance; BIS/BAS scales	RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; THETA OSCILLATIONS; BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION; LEXICAL CONSOLIDATION; AMBIGUITY TOLERANCE; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; SCALING BEHAVIOR; VOCABULARY; ATTENTION; MEMORY	Background. A rich vocabulary supports human achievements in socio-economic activities, education, and communication. It is therefore important to clarify the nature of language acquisition as a complex multidimensional process. However, both the psychological and neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning language learning, as well as the links between them, are still poorly understood. Objective. This study aims to explore the psychological and neurophysiological correlates of successful word acquisition in a person's native language. Design. Thirty adults read sentences with novel nouns, following which the participants' electroencephalograms were recorded during a word-reading task. Event-related potentials in response to novel words and alpha oscillation parameters (amplitude, variability, and long-range temporal correlation dynamics) were analyzed. Learning outcomes were assessed at the lexical and semantic levels. Psychological variables measured using Amthauer's test (verbal abilities), BIS/BAS scales (motivation), and the MSTAT-1 (ambiguity tolerance) and alpha oscillation parameters were factored. Results. Better recognition of novel words was related to two factors which had high factor loadings for all measured alpha oscillation parameters, indicating the role of attention networks and respective neural activity for enabling information processing. More successful learners had lower P200 amplitude, which also suggests higher attention-system involvement. Another factor predicted better acquisition of word meanings for less ambiguity-tolerant students, while the factor which pooled logical conceptual thinking ability and persistence in goal-reaching, positively correlated with acquisition of both word forms and meanings. Conclusion. The psychological factors predominantly correlated with word-learning success in semantic tasks, while neurophysiological variables were linked to performance in the recognition task.

No-report paradigms have been instrumental in this endeavor, demon-strating that the event-related potential P300, recorded from the human scalp, reflects reports rather than awareness. However, these paradigms cannot probe the degree to which stimuli are consciously processed from trial to trial and, thus, leave open the possibility that the P300 is a genuine correlate of conscious access enabling reports. Here, instead of removing report requirements, we took the opposite approach and equated postperceptual task demands across conscious and uncon-scious trials by orthogonalizing target detection and overt reports in a somatosensory detection task. We used Bayesian model selection to track the transformation from physical to perceptual processing stages in the EEG data of 24 male and female participants and show that the early P50 component scaled with physical stimulus intensity, whereas the N140 compo-nent was the first correlate of target detection. The late P300 component was elicited for both perceived and unperceived stimuli and was not substantially modulated by target detection. This was in stark contrast to a control experiment using a classical direct report task, which replicated the P50 and N140 effects but additionally showed a strong effect of target detec-tion in the P300 time range. Our results demonstrate the task dependence of the P300 in the somatosensory modality and show that late cortical potentials dissociate from perceptual awareness even when stimuli are always reported.

The first hypothesis was that anger would impair weapon identification in a biased manner by increasing attention and vigilance to, and decreasing recognition and inhibition of weapon identification errors following, task-irrelevant Black (compared to White) faces. Our competing hypothesis was that anger would facilitate weapon identification by directing attention toward task-relevant stimuli (i.e., objects) and away from task-irrelevant stimuli (i.e., race), and increasing recognition and inhibition of biased errors. Results partially supported the second hypothesis, in that anger increased early attention to faces but minimized attentional processing of race, and did not affect error recognition. Specifically, angry (vs. neutral) participants showed increased N1 to both Black and White faces, ablated P2 race effects, and topographically restricted N2 race effects. Additionally, ERN amplitude was unaffected by emotion, race, or object type. However, Pe amplitude was affected by object type (but not emotion or race), such that Pe amplitude was larger after the misidentification of harmless objects as weapons. Finally, anger slowed overall task performance, especially the correct identification of harmless objects, but did not impact task accuracy. Task performance speed and accuracy were unaffected by the race of the face prime. Implications are discussed.

It remains unknown whether or not different neurobiological markers underlying depression symptoms in BD depression and major depression disorder (MDD). Methods: 24 patients with BD depression and 20 healthy controls were included. Participants underwent evaluation with the Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale (TEPS), followed by the classical gambling paradigm, while undergoing 64-channel electroencephalography. The waveform of feedback-related negativity (FRN) was extracted from the 250-350 ms time-window after participants received feedback regarding loss or gain. Eventrelated potential datasets were obtained using time-frequency analysis. Results: (1) The TEPS scores of the patients were significantly lower than those of the controls [t (42) = 5.16, p < 0.01]. (2) The event of loss elicited a deeper FRN in patients than that in controls [t (42) = 2.19, p < 0.05], while no difference was observed in the event of gains (t (42) = 1.12, p > 0.05). (3) Theta power rooted in FRN in patients was significantly higher in loss than in gain [F (1,42) = 30.32, p < 0.01]. (4) Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) illustrated the interaction effect of theta power in gain/loss between two groups [F (1,42) = 3.59, p = 0.06]. Limitation: Our study did not analyze the effect of different drugs which might affect our results. Conclusion: The enhanced reflection of negative feedback was consistent with the negative bias, impulse control impairment, and emotional dysregulation observed in the bipolar disorder spectrum. We suggested that the extreme theta power generated from the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC) might be the main component of abnormal FRN.

Passenger-driver behavior from psychological processes can provide insight into the trust levels of the dyad dynamic during an open-road drive. Measuring passenger trust can benefit in speeding up the adoption of self-driving cars. This area has not been fully explored from the passenger's point of view and can yield results that could potentially propel the progress of driver safety systems in autonomous driving. A novel approach to correlating the passenger-driver trust levels can be elicited from brain-based indicators that are extracted from time-locked electroencephalogram (EEG) signals that capture both sensory and cognitive processes. In this paper, we propose a trust identification technique utilizing evoked response potential (ERP) events such as P300 along with beta/alpha frequency ratios from specific passengers during braking, aggressive acceleration, and lane changing scenarios. The results obtained from the decomposition of these EEG signals into the frequency bands and application of machine learning techniques on data collected from frontal and parietal electrodes during these driving events prove the feasibility of this study. By examining additional passenger-driver pairs with varying social interaction and trust profiles in the future, we can strengthen the existence of a cognitive correlation between passenger-driver behavior and thus improve the efficiency of driver safety systems.

Multimodal neuroimaging markers of variation in cognitive ability in older HIV plus men	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; BRAIN; IMPAIRMENT; INFECTION; EEG; ERP; DISORDERS; DEMENTIA; THALAMUS; STIMULUS	Objective This study used converging methods to examine the neural substrates of cognitive ability in middle-aged and older men with well-controlled HIV infection. Methods Seventy-six HIV+ men on antiretroviral treatment completed an auditory oddball task and an inhibitory control (Simon) task while time-locked high-density EEG was acquired; 66 had usable EEG data from one or both tasks; structural MRI was available for 43. We investigated relationships between task-evoked EEG responses, cognitive ability and immunocompromise. We also explored the structural correlates of these EEG markers in the sub-sample with complete EEG and MRI data (N = 27). Results EEG activity was associated with cognitive ability at later (P300) but not earlier stages of both tasks. Only the oddball task P300 was reliably associated with HIV severity (nadir CD4). Source localization confirmed that the tasks engaged partially distinct circuits. Thalamus volume correlated with oddball task P300 amplitude, while globus pallidus volume was related to the P300 in both tasks. Interpretation This is the first study to use task-evoked EEG to identify neural correlates of individual differences in cognition in men living with well-controlled HIV infection, and to explore the structural basis of the EEG markers. We found that EEG responses evoked by the oddball task are more reliably related to cognitive performance than those evoked by the Simon task. We also provide preliminary evidence for a subcortical contribution to the effects of HIV infection severity on P300 amplitudes. These results suggest brain mechanisms and candidate biomarkers for individual differences in cognition in HIV.	[Fernandez Cruz, Ana Lucia; Chen, Chien-Ming; Sanford, Ryan; Collins, D.

Inferior Auditory Time Perception in Children With Motor Difficulties	CHILD DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							DEVELOPMENTAL COORDINATION DISORDER; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; DURATION; BEAT; ATTENTION; DCD; DISCRIMINATION; DEFICITS; INFANTS	Accurate time perception is crucial for hearing (speech, music) and action (walking, catching). Motor brain regions are recruited during auditory time perception. Therefore, the hypothesis was tested that children (age 6-7) at risk for developmental coordination disorder (rDCD), a neurodevelopmental disorder involving motor difficulties, would show nonmotor auditory time perception deficits. Psychophysical tasks confirmed that children with rDCD have poorer duration and rhythm perception than typically developing children (N = 47, d = 0.95-1.01). Electroencephalography showed delayed mismatch negativity or P3a event-related potential latency in response to duration or rhythm deviants, reflecting inefficient brain processing (N = 54, d = 0.71-0.95). These findings are among the first to characterize perceptual timing deficits in DCD, suggesting important theoretical and clinical implications.

Attention is prioritised for proximate and approaching fearful faces	CORTEX			English	Article						Attention; EEG-ERP; Faces; Fear; Peripersonal space	SPATIAL ATTENTION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; SPACE; N170; RECOGNITION; ORIENTATION; INVERSION; COMPONENT; LOCATION; AMYGDALA	Attention is an important function that allows us to selectively enhance the processing of relevant stimuli in our environment. Fittingly, a number of studies have revealed that potentially threatening/fearful stimuli capture attention more efficiently. Interestingly, in separate fMRI studies, threatening stimuli situated close to viewers were found to enhance brain activity in fear-relevant areas more than stimuli that were further away. Despite these observations, few studies have examined the effect of personal distance on attentional capture by emotional stimuli. Using electroencephalography (EEG), the current investigation addressed this question by investigating attentional capture of emotional faces that were either looming/receding, or were situated at different distances from the viewer. In Experiment 1, participants carried out an incidental task while looming or receding fearful and neutral faces were presented bilaterally. A significant lateralised N170 and N2pc were found for a looming upright fearful face, however no significant components were found for a looming upright neutral face or inverted fearful and neutral faces. In Experiment 2, participants made gender judgements of emotional faces that appeared on a screen situated within or beyond peripersonal space (respectively 50 cm or 120 cm). Although response times did not differ, significantly more errors were made when faces appeared in near as opposed to far space. Importantly, ERPs revealed a significant N2pc for fearful faces presented in peripersonal distance, compared to the far distance. Our findings show that personal distance markedly affects neural responses to emotional stimuli, with increased attention towards fearful upright faces that appear in close distance.

The present study employs a simple paradigm in which event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to a single auditory stimulus that was presented rapidly or very slowly while the participant was engaged in a visual task. A multi-channel EEG was recorded in 20 healthy older adults and 20 people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In two different conditions, a single 80 dB sound pressure level (SPL) auditory stimulus was presented every 1.5 s (fast condition) or every 12.0 s (slow condition). Participants were instructed to watch a silent video and ignore the auditory stimuli. Auditory processing thus occurred passively. When the auditory stimuli were presented rapidly (every 1.5 s), N1 and P2 amplitudes did not differ between the two groups. When the stimuli were presented very slowly, the amplitude of N1 and P2 increased in both groups and their latencies were prolonged. The amplitude of N1 did not significantly differ between the two groups. However, the subsequent positivity was reduced in people with MCI compared to healthy older adults. This late positivity in the slow condition may reflect a delayed P2 or a summation of a composite P2 + P3a. In people with MCI, the priority of processing may not be switched from the visual task to the potentially much more relevant auditory input. ERPs offer promise as a means to identify the pathology underlying cognitive impairment associated with MCI.

P300 amplitude during a monetary incentive delay task predicts future therapy completion in individuals with major depressive disorder	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						P300; Depression; Treatment outcome; Behavioral therapy; Event-related potential	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; REWARD; ANTICIPATION; RESPONSES; CONFLICT; PUNISHMENT; COMPONENTS; ANXIETY	Introduction: Treatment effectiveness for major depressive disorder (MDD) is often affected by client non-adherence, dropout, and non-response. Identification of client characteristics predicting successful treatment completion and/or response (i.e., symptom reduction) may be an important tool to increase intervention effectiveness. It is unclear whether neural attenuations in reward processing associated with MDD predict behavioral treatment outcome. Methods: This study aimed to determine whether blunted neural responses to reward at baseline differentiate MDD (n = 60; 41 with comorbid anxiety) and healthy control (HC; n = 40) groups; and predict MDD completion of and response to 7-10 sessions of behavior therapy. Participants completed a monetary incentive delay (MID) task. The N200, P300, contingent negative variation (CNV) event related potentials (ERPs) and behavioral responses (reaction time [RT], correct hits) were quantified and extracted for cross-sectional group analyses. ERPs and behavioral responses demonstrating group differences were then used to predict therapy completion and response within MDD. Results: MDD exhibited faster RT and smaller P300 amplitudes than HC across conditions. Within the MDD group, treatment completers (n = 37) exhibited larger P300 amplitudes than non-completers (n = 21). Limitations: : This study comprises secondary analyses of EEG data; thus task parameters are not optimized to examine feedback ERPs from the paradigm. We did not examine heterogenous presentations of MDD; however, severity and comorbidity did not influence findings. Conclusions: Previous studies suggest that P300 is an index of motivational salience and stimulus resource allocation. In sum, individuals who deploy greater neural resources to task demands are more likely to persevere in behavioral therapy.

However, so far there has been limited research into the spatial and temporal characteristics of hf-tRNS-induced facilitatory effects. In the present study, electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of cortical activity modulated by offline hf-tRNS on performance on a motion direction discrimination task. We used EEG to measure the amplitude of motion-related VEPs over the parieto-occipital cortex, as well as oscillatory power spectral density (PSD) at rest. A time-frequency decomposition analysis was also performed to investigate the shift in event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) in response to the motion stimuli between the pre- and post-stimulation period. The results showed that the accuracy of the motion direction discrimination task was not modulated by offline hf-tRNS. Although the motion task was able to elicit motion-dependent VEP components (P1, N2, and P2), none of them showed any significant change between pre- and post-stimulation. We also found a time-dependent increase of the PSD in alpha and beta bands regardless of the stimulation protocol. Finally, time-frequency analysis showed a modulation of ERSP power in the hf-tRNS condition for gamma activity when compared to pre-stimulation periods and Sham stimulation. Overall, these results show that offline hf-tRNS may induce moderate aftereffects in brain oscillatory activity.

This study analyzes the effect of driving experience on the perception of the traffic scenes through electroencephalograms (EEGs). Primarily, we focused on visual attention during driving, the essential visual function in the visual search and human gaze, and evaluated the P300, which is involved in attention, to explore the effect of driving experience on the visual attention of traffic scenes, not for improving visual ability. In the results, the P300 response was observed in both experienced and beginner drivers when they paid visual attention to the visual target. Furthermore, the latency for the peak amplitude of the P300 response among experienced drivers was markedly faster than that in beginner drivers, suggesting that the P300 latency is a piece of crucial information for driving experience on visual attention.

Social barriers exist including the financial cost of medical services and the lack of a perceived need for treatment even if potential patients have a desire to receive mental healthcare. Self-report inventories such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) can assess the emotional valence for mental health assessment, but medical expertise may be required for interpretation of the results. Contingency plans for clinical supervision and referral sources are necessary for sufficient mental healthcare using self-report inventories. On the other hand, the laterality index at rest (LIR) has been proposed for evaluation of the mental stress level from near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data in the prefrontal cortex in the resting state. However, the potential for long-term monitoring has not been investigated with sufficient evaluation results. In this study, feature values were extracted from both NIRS and EEG signals each week for 10 weeks in four young participants with an average BDI-II score of 17.7, i.e., indicative of mild depression. Temporal changes in LIR and heart rate (HR) were compared with STAI-Y1 and BDI-II scores. We found cross-correlations between the time series of LIR and STAI-Y1 within one-week delay. In addition, the time series of LIR was also correlated with BDI-II with one-week delay. Importantly, by annotating the larger changes in LIR and HR on daily life events, the changes in LIR and HR were different depending on the type of life event that affected these moods.

J	Jenson, D				Jenson, David			Audiovisual incongruence differentially impacts left and right hemisphere sensorimotor oscillations: Potential applications to production	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MU RHYTHM DYNAMICS; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; VISUAL SPEECH; BAND OSCILLATIONS; HEARING LIPS; EEG-DATA; INTEGRATION; MOTOR; CORTEX; ALPHA	Speech production gives rise to distinct auditory and somatosensory feedback signals which are dynamically integrated to enable online monitoring and error correction, though it remains unclear how the sensorimotor system supports the integration of these multimodal signals. Capitalizing on the parity of sensorimotor processes supporting perception and production, the current study employed the McGurk paradigm to induce multimodal sensory congruence/incongruence. EEG data from a cohort of 39 typical speakers were decomposed with independent component analysis to identify bilateral mu rhythms; indices of sensorimotor activity. Subsequent time-frequency analyses revealed bilateral patterns of event related desynchronization (ERD) across alpha and beta frequency ranges over the time course of perceptual events. Right mu activity was characterized by reduced ERD during all cases of audiovisual incongruence, while left mu activity was attenuated and protracted in McGurk trials eliciting sensory fusion.

J	Versaci, L; Laje, R				Versaci, Leonardo; Laje, Rodrigo			Time-oriented attention improves accuracy in a paced finger-tapping task	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention; event&#8208; related potentials; finger tapping; sensorimotor synchronization; time processing	SENSORIMOTOR SYNCHRONIZATION; PHASE CORRECTION; ERROR-CORRECTION; TEMPO CHANGES; POTENTIALS; INTERVAL; ADAPTATION; NONLINEARITIES; PERTURBATIONS; AUTOMATICITY	Finger tapping is a task widely used in a variety of experimental paradigms, in particular to understand sensorimotor synchronization and time processing in the range of hundreds of milliseconds (millisecond timing). Normally, subjects do not receive any instruction about what to attend to and the results are seldom interpreted taking into account the possible effects of attention. In this work we show that attention can be oriented to the purely temporal aspects of a paced finger-tapping task and that it affects performance. Specifically, time-oriented attention improves the accuracy in paced finger tapping and it also increases the resynchronization efficiency after a period perturbation. We use two markers of the attention level: auditory ERPs and subjective report of the mental workload. In addition, we propose a novel algorithm to separate the auditory, stimulus-related components from the somatosensory, response-related ones, which are naturally overlapped in the recorded EEG.

Owing to the non-invasive availability of this system, its applicability has seen remarkable developments beyond medical use-cases. One such use case is brain-computer interfaces (BCI). Such systems require the usage of high resolution-based multi-channel EEG devices so that the data collection spans multiple locations of the brain like the occipital, frontal, temporal, and so on. This results in huge data (with high sampling rates) and with multiple EEG channels with inherent artifacts. Several challenges exist in analyzing data of this nature, for instance, selecting the optimal number of EEG channels or deciding what best features to rely on for achieving better performance. The selection of these variables is complicated and requires a lot of domain knowledge and non-invasive EEG monitoring, which is not feasible always. Hence, optimization serves to be an easy to access tool in deriving such parameters. Considerable efforts in formulating these issues as an optimization problem have been laid. As a result, various multi-objective and constrained optimization functions have been developed in BCI that has achieved reliable outcomes in device control like neuro-prosthetic arms, application control, gaming, and so on. This paper makes an attempt to study the usage of optimization techniques in formulating the issues in BCI. The outcomes, challenges, and major observations of these approaches are discussed in detail.

The Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Codes (SNARC) effect in highly math-anxious individuals: An ERP study	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Math anxiety; SNARC effect; ERP/EEG; P3b; Working memory; Number comparison	MATHEMATICS ANXIETY; ATTENTIONAL CONTROL; WORKING-MEMORY; PERFORMANCE; REPRESENTATION; P3; INHIBITION; SELECTION; NUMBERS; VERSION	The Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Codes (SNARC) effect was examined in highly (HMA) and low math-anxious (LMA) individuals performing a number comparison in an ERP study. The SNARC effect consists of faster latencies when the response side is congruent with number location in the mental number line (MNL). Despite the stronger SNARC effect in the HMA group, their responses in incongruent trials were slower than in congruent trials only for the largest numerical magnitudes. Moreover, HMAs showed a less positive centroparietal P3b component in incongruent trials than in congruent ones, but only for the largest magnitudes. Since the SNARC effect arises during response selection and P3b positivity decreases with the difficulty of decision, this result suggests that HMA individuals might find it more difficult than LMAs to control the conflict between the automatically activated location of numbers in the MNL and the response side, especially in more cognitively demanding trials.

Since then, the P300 has become the focus of many basic and clinical neuroscience studies. However, despite its wide applications, the underlying function of the P300 is not yet clearly understood. One line of research among the many studies that have attempted to elucidate the underlying subroutine of the P300 in the brain has suggested that the physiological function of the P300 is related to inhibition. While some intracranial, behavioral, and event-related potential studies have provided support for this theory, little is known about the inhibitory mechanism. In this study, using alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) and effective connectivity, based on the causal (one-way directed) relationship between alpha ERD and P300 sources, we demonstrated that P300's associated inhibition is implemented at a higher information processing stage in a localized brain region. We discuss how inhibition as the primary function of the P300 is not inconsistent with 'resource allocation' and 'working memory updating' theories about its cognitive function. In light of our findings regarding the scope and information processing stage of inhibition of the P300, we reconcile the inhibitory account of the P300 with working memory updating theory. Finally, based on the compensatory behavior of alpha ERD at the time of suppression of the P300, we propose two distinct yet complementary working memory mechanisms (inhibition and desynchronizing excitation) that render target perception possible.

The present study uses electroencephalogram (EEG) and subjective measures to investigate if noise-canceling technologies can fade out external distractions and free up mental resources. Therefore, participants had to solve spoken arithmetic tasks that were read out via headphones in three sound environments: a quiet environment (no noise), a noisy environment (noise), and a noisy environment but with active noise-canceling headphones (noise-canceling). Our results of brain activity partially confirm an assumed lower mental load in no noise and noise-canceling compared to noise test condition. The mean P300 activation at Cz resulted in a significant differentiation between the no noise and the other two test conditions. Subjective data indicate an improved situation for the participants when using the noise-canceling technology compared to "normal" headphones but shows no significant discrimination. The present results provide a foundation for further investigations into the relationship between noise-canceling technology and mental workload. Additionally, we give recommendations for an adaptation of the test design for future studies.

While LPP positivity shows modest malleability by emotional regulation and competing tasks, its fundamental enhancement by emotional scene perception is extremely reliable. Here we assess the impact of emotional scene frequency (67%, 50% and 17%) on the strength of LPP modulation, across 3 groups of participants, using consistent presentation and analysis methods. The results demonstrate strong consistency in the strength of emotional modulation across frequent, equiprobable, and rare emotion conditions. However, a small enhancement of LPP positivity was found during unpleasant scenes in the rare emotion condition. The LPP thus appears to be largely insensitive to contextual features such as scene frequency and predictability, suggesting that strong emotional cues persistently engage orienting and evaluation processes because this tendency was selected in phylogeny.

Faster processing of auditory information in the brain may facilitate time-critical abilities such as reaction speed however previous research was limited by generic auditory and visual stimuli that did not consider audio-visual characteristics in ecologically valid environments. This study investigated the reaction speed in response to sport-specific monosensory (visual and auditory) and multisensory (audio-visual) stimulation. Neurophysiological analyses identified the neural processes contributing to differences in reaction speed. Nineteen elite badminton players participated in this study. In a first recording phase, the sound profile and shuttle speed of smash and drop strokes were identified on a badminton court using high-speed video cameras and binaural recordings. The speed and sound characteristics were transferred into auditory and visual stimuli and presented in a lab-based experiment, where participants reacted in response to sport-specific monosensory or multisensory stimulation. Auditory signal presentation was delayed by 26 ms to account for realistic audio-visual signal interaction on the court. N1 and N2 event-related potentials as indicators of auditory and visual information perception/processing, respectively were identified using a 64-channel EEG. Despite the 26 ms delay, auditory reactions were significantly faster than visual reactions (236.6 ms vs. 287.7 ms, p < 0.001) but still slower when compared to multisensory stimulation (224.4 ms, p = 0.002). Across conditions response times to smashes were faster when compared to drops (233.2 ms, 265.9 ms, p < 0.001). Faster reactions were paralleled by a lower latency and higher amplitude of the auditory N1 and visual N2 potentials. The results emphasize the potential of auditory information to accelerate the reaction time in sport-specific multisensory situations. This highlights auditory processes as a promising target for training interventions in racquet sports.

A core debate in reward learning focuses on whether valenced and non-valenced PEs can be isolated in the human electroencephalogram (EEG). We combine behavioral modeling and single-trial EEG regression to disentangle sequential PEs in an interval timing task dissociating outcome valence, magnitude, and probability. Multiple regression across temporal, spatial, and frequency dimensions characterized a spatio-tempo-spectral cascade from early valenced RPE value to non-valenced RPE magnitude, followed by outcome probability indexed by a late frontal positivity. Separating negative and positive outcomes revealed the valenced RPE value effect is an artifact of overlap between two non-valenced RPE magnitude responses: frontal theta feedback-related negativity on losses and posterior delta reward positivity on wins. These results reconcile longstanding debates on the sequence of components representing reward and salience PEs in the human EEG. Hoy et al. combine behavioral modeling and single-trial EEG regression to disentangle sequential prediction errors in an interval timing task, which dissociated outcome valence, magnitude, and probability in human participants. Their study reconciles debates on the sequence of components representing reward and salience prediction errors in the human EEG.

Compared to self-face and self-body representations, few studies have investigated neural underpinnings specific to self-voice. Moreover, self-voice stimuli in those studies were consistently presented through air and lacking bone conduction, rendering the sound of self-voice stimuli different to the self-voice heard during natural speech. Here, we combined psychophysics, voice-morphing technology, and high-density EEG in order to identify the spatiotemporal patterns underlying self-other voice discrimination (SOVD) in a population of 26 healthy participants, both with air- and bone-conducted stimuli. We identified a self-voice-specific EEG topographic map occurring around 345 ms post-stimulus and activating a network involving insula, cingulate cortex, and medial temporal lobe structures. Occurrence of this map was modulated both with SOVD task performance and bone conduction. Specifically, the better participants performed at SOVD task, the less frequently they activated this network. In addition, the same network was recruited less frequently with bone conduction, which, accordingly, increased the SOVD task performance. This work could have an important clinical impact. Indeed, it reveals neural correlates of SOVD impairments, believed to account for auditory-verbal hallucinations, a common and highly distressing psychiatric symptom.

J	O'Reilly, JA				O'Reilly, Jamie A.			Can intensity modulation of the auditory response explain intensity-decrement mismatch negativity?	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Mismatch negativity; Predictive coding; Deviance detection; Sensory adaptation; Auditory neurophysiology	SOUND INTENSITY; MMN; LOUDNESS; REVEAL; MEMORY	Mismatch negativity (MMN) elicited by decrements in sound pressure level has been asserted as evidence for its dependence upon general deviance detection, while refuting the proposition that it is simply caused by modulating the intrinsic sensory response with different physical properties of sound. However, reports of intensity-decrement MMN are sparse compared with MMN to stimulus frequency or duration changes, and verifying the mechanisms that shape difference waveform morphology is essential for their responsible use as clinical biomarkers. In the present study, open-access EEG data from 40 healthy young adults recorded during an intensity-decrement oddball paradigm was analyzed to establish the effects of transitions between different level stimuli on the auditory evoked response. Standard stimuli were 80 dB and deviant stimuli were 70 dB. Event-related potentials were extracted from standards after standards (sS), deviants after standards (sD), and standards after deviants (dS). Mean amplitude across a recommended measurement window for MMN (125 to 225 ms) was calculated for each ERP waveform. This revealed statistically significant negative amplitude shift elicited by lower-intensity deviant stimuli, as expected, and an opposite direction, positive amplitude shift elicited by higher-intensity standard stimuli that followed lower-intensity deviants, relative to standard stimuli presented consecutively. These findings indicate that intensity-modulation of the auditory response influences cortical activity measured during the latency range of MMN. To what extent the hypothesized deviance detection mechanisms may also contribute is uncertain and remains to be elucidated.

Elderly individuals usually experience defects in the processing of VWM. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is a key structure for the top-down control of working memory processes. Many studies have shown that repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) improves VWM by modulating the excitability of neurons in the target cortical region, though the underlying neural mechanism has not been clarified. Therefore, this study sought to assess the characteristics of brain memory function post-rTMS targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The study stimulated the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in elderly individuals by performing a high-frequency rTMS protocol and evaluated behavioral performance using cognitive tasks and a VWM task. Based on the simultaneously recorded electroencephalogram signals, event-related potential and event-related spectral perturbation analysis techniques were used to investigate the variation characteristics of event-related potential components' (N2PC and CDA) amplitudes and neural oscillations in elderly individuals to elucidate the effect of high-frequency rTMS. The results found that rTMS enhanced VWM performance and significantly improved attention and executive function in elderly individuals with subjective cognitive decline. We therefore speculate that rTMS enhances VWM by increasing the N2PC and CDA amplitude, alongside increasing beta oscillation activity. This would improve the attention and allocation of resources in elderly individuals such as to improve an individual's VWM.

This study aimed at investigating whether external emotional stimuli affect the performance of a P300-based BCI, particularly built for controlling home appliances. We presented a set of emotional auditory stimuli to subjects, which had been selected for each subject based on individual valence scores evaluated a priori, while they were controlling an electric light device using a P300-based BCI. There were four conditions regarding the auditory stimuli, including high valence, low valence, noise, and no sound. As a result, subjects controlled the electric light device using the BCI in real time with a mean accuracy of 88.14%. The overall accuracy and P300 features over most EEG channels did not show a significant difference between the four auditory conditions (p > 0.05). When we measured emotional states using frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) and compared FAA across the auditory conditions, we also found no significant difference (p > 0.05). Our results suggest that there is no clear evidence to support a hypothesis that external emotional stimuli influence the P300-based BCI performance or the P300 features while people are controlling devices using the BCI in real time. This study may provide useful information for those who are concerned with the implementation of a P300-based BCI in practice.

To improve the performance of BCIs, this article examined the effect of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) on brain activity during MI. This article designed an experimental paradigm that combines tES and MI and examined the effects of tES based on the measurements of electroencephalogram (EEG) features in MI processing, including the power spectral density (PSD) and dynamic event-related desynchronization (ERD). Finally, we investigated the effect of tES on the accuracy of MI classification using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The results showed that the ERD of the mu and beta rhythms in the left-hand MI task was enhanced after electrical stimulation with a significant effect in the tDCS group. The average classification accuracy of the transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) group and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) group (88.19% and 89.93% respectively) were improved significantly compared to the pre-and pseudo stimulation groups. These findings indicated that tES can improve the performance and applicability of BCI and that tDCS was a potential approach in regulating brain activity and enhancing valid features during noninvasive MI-BCI processing.

EEG data collected from 30 native Korean speakers revealed a large N400 at the verb for the action mismatch, but an early negativity at the mismatched case-marker of the first NP as well as sustained negativity at the verb for the role mismatch. These results conform to the English-based data (i.e. Knoeferle et al., 2014.

However, cross-lingustic differences were also found in terms of comprehenders' relative sensitivity to different linguistic features in individual languages (e.g. word order in English and case-marking in Korean).

Many new BCI paradigms and algorithms have been developed in recent years. Therefore, it is necessary to review new progress in BCIs. This paper summarizes progress for EEG-based BCIs from the perspective of encoding paradigms and decoding algorithms, which are two key elements of BCI systems. Encoding paradigms are grouped by their underlying neural meachanisms, namely sensory- and motor-related, vision-related, cognition-related and hybrid paradigms. Decoding algorithms are reviewed in four categories, namely decomposition algorithms, Riemannian geometry, deep learning and transfer learning. This review will provide a comprehensive overview of both modern primary paradigms and algorithms, making it helpful for those who are developing BCI systems.

The role of cognitive control and top-down processes in object affordances	ATTENTION PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS			English	Article						Cognitive control; EEG; Object affordance; Theta power; Time-frequency; Event-related potential; VEP; Attention		A widely held though debatable claim is that the picture of an object like a frying pan automatically elicits features of a left/right-handed grasp action even in perceptual tasks that make no demands on the observer to consider the graspable properties of the depicted object. Here, we sought to further elucidate this claim by relying on a methodology that allowed us to distinguish between the influence of motor versus spatial codes on the selection of a left/right-handed response while electroencephalographic data were recorded. In our experiment, participants classified images of frying pans as upright or inverted using a left/right key press or by making a left/right-handed reach-and-grasp action towards a centrally located response element while we recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) data. In line with previous evidence (Bub, Masson, & van Noordenne, Journal of Experiment Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 47(1), 53-80, 2021), these two modes of responding generated distinct correspondence effects on performance induced by the same set of images. In terms of our EEG data, we found that neither motor (the lateralized readiness potential) nor visual (N100 and P100) potentials were sensitive to handle-response hand correspondence. However, an exploratory theta analysis revealed that changes in frontal theta power mirrored the different correspondence effects evoked by the image on key press responses versus reach and grasp actions. Importantly, our results provide a link between these disparate effects and the engagement of cognitive control, highlighting a possible role of top-down control processes in separating motor features from the task-irrelevant features of an object, and thus in claims regarding object affordances more generally.

Despite the early emergence of sensory features (< age 3) and their potential impact on development and quality of life, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying sensory reactivity in early childhood autism. Methods Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate tactile cortical processing in young children aged 3-6 years with autism and in neurotypical (NT) children. Scalp EEG was recorded from 33 children with autism, including those with low cognitive and/or verbal abilities, and 45 age- and sex-matched NT children during passive tactile fingertip stimulation. We compared properties of early and later somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) and their adaptation with repetitive stimulation between autistic and NT children and assessed whether these neural measures are linked to "real-world" parent-reported tactile reactivity. Results As expected, we found elevated tactile reactivity in children on the autism spectrum. Our findings indicated no differences in amplitude or latency of early and mid-latency somatosensory-evoked potentials (P50, N80, P100), nor adaptation between autistic and NT children. However, latency of later processing of tactile information (N140) was shorter in young children with autism compared to NT children, suggesting faster processing speed in young autistic children. Further, correlational analyses and exploratory analyses using tactile reactivity as a grouping variable found that enhanced early neural responses were associated with greater tactile reactivity in autism. Limitations The relatively small sample size and the inclusion of a broad range of autistic children (e.g., with low cognitive and/or verbal abilities) may have limited our power to detect subtle group differences and associations. Hence, replications are needed to verify these results. Conclusions Our findings suggest that electrophysiological somatosensory cortex processing measures may be indices of "real-world" tactile reactivity in early childhood autism. Together, these findings advance our understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying tactile reactivity in early childhood autism and, in the clinical context, may have therapeutic implications.

However, very few studies have investigated the development of naming skills along with the development of reading fluency and its variability in typically developing children. In this study, we used electro-encephalographic (EEG) recordings acquired during letter and picture naming tasks to investigate how naming skills develop and, possibly, interact with age and reading level variations. Ninety-three children aged 7-12 years named letters and pictures under an EEG recording, and their reading performance was assessed. ERP results on amplitudes show that age and reading level have similar effects on the entire letter naming time-course. By contrast, age and reading level have different effects on the picture naming time-course, with a specific effect of reading level on the N1 time-interval, associated with visuo-conceptual processing and an effect of both age and reading on later time-windows. On the microstate analysis, age remains the only predictor of the variance in global electric field at scalp for both letter and picture naming indicating that reading skill is not related to a modulation of the mental processes underlying naming.

PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						alpha oscillations; attention; cognitive control; error processing; pupillometry	INTEGRATIVE THEORY; ERROR; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS; THETA	This study investigated whether detection of a performance mistake is followed by adaptive or detrimental effects on subsequent attention and performance. Using a Stroop task with spatial cueing, along with simultaneous EEG and pupillary measurements, we examined evidence bearing on two alternative hypotheses: maladaptive arousal and adaptive control. Error detection, indexed by the error-related negativity ERP component, was followed by pupil dilation and suppression of EEG oscillations in the alpha band, two indices of arousal that were associated with one another on a trial-by-trial basis. On the trials following errors, there was neural evidence of enhanced spatial cueing, manifested in greater hemispheric activation contralateral to the cued visual field. However, this post-error enhancement was not followed by changes in Stroop or spatial cueing effects in performance, nor by increased attentional cueing effects in ERP responses to targets. Rather, performance tended to be slower and less accurate following errors compared to correct trials, and higher post-response arousal, indexed by larger pupils, predicted next-trial slowing and decreased P2 amplitude to targets. Results favor the maladaptive arousal account of post-error cognitive control and offer only limited support for adaptive control.

People often predict a feedback outcome with information that is based on both objective facts and uncertain subjective information, such as a mood. For example, if an action leads to good results consecutively, people performing the action overestimate the behavioral result of the next action. In electroencephalogram measurements, negative feedback evokes negative potential, called feedback negativity, and positive feedback evokes positive potential, called reward positivity. The present study investigated the relationship between the degree of the mood caused by the feedback outcome and the error-related brain potentials. We measured the electroencephalogram activity while the participants played a virtual reality shooting game. The experimental task was to shoot down a cannonball flying toward the player using a handgun. The task difficulty was determined from the size and curve of the flying cannonball. These gaming parameters affected the outcome probability of shooting the target in the game. We also implemented configurations in the game, such as the player's life points and play times. These configurations affected the outcome magnitude of shooting the target in the game. Moreover, we used the temporal accuracy of shooting in the game as the parameter of the mood. We investigated the relationship between these experimental features and the event-related potentials using the single-trial-based linear mixed-effects model analysis. The feedback negativity was observed at an error trial, and its amplitude was modulated with the outcome probability and the mood. Conversely, reward positivity was observed at hit trials, but its amplitude was modulated with the outcome probability and outcome magnitude. This result suggests that feedback negativity is enhanced according to not only the feedback probability but also the mood that was changed depending on the temporal gaming outcome.

Fearful and neutral faces predicted the location of a target, which was a digit that participants were asked to recall from a series encoded in each trial, in a modified version of the attentional cueing task. Working memory load impacted cueing irrespective of emotion and anxiety in analysis of reaction times. Lateralized EEG components then showed that effects of emotion were only apparent in high anxious individuals, with an initial hypervigilance to target locations cued by fearful faces, followed by a difficulty to disengage from these locations when targets appeared at uncued sites (P1). Enhanced amplitude following fearful faces was observed, when discriminative processes leading to response selection are implemented (N1). Conversely, all the effects of working memory load were independent of emotion in the low anxious group, where the shifting of attention directed by the gaze was only visible when enough resources were available in the working memory span. Working memory loads impacted the processing of gaze differently (P1) in low anxious participants, suggesting that top-down influence may play a role in this case.

There is ample evidence that both state and trait boredom are associated with failures of attention in both experimental and everyday settings. The neural correlates of boredom, however, remain underexplored. We recorded electroencephalographic signal from 83 participants during a resting state and while performing a go/no-go task. We found a negative correlation between trait boredom proneness and power in the alpha and theta bands during the resting state. Furthermore, higher levels of task-induced boredom were associated with reduced amplitudes for the P3 and error-related negativity event-related potentials. Increased commission error rates were also associated with higher levels of task-induced boredom. We conclude that state and trait boredom are associated with inadequate engagement of attentional resources.

The research on brain signals aims to discover the underlying neurological or physical status of the individuals by signal decoding. The emerging deep learning techniques have improved the study of brain signals significantly in recent years. In this work, we first present a taxonomy of non-invasive brain signals and the basics of deep learning algorithms. Then, we provide the frontiers of applying deep learning for non-invasive brain signals analysis, by summarizing a large number of recent publications. Moreover, upon the deep learning-powered brain signal studies, we report the potential real-world applications which benefit not only disabled people but also normal individuals. Finally, we discuss the opening challenges and future directions.

To test this, we examined the interplay between MSI and intersensory attention (IA) in healthy controls (HCs) (N=27) and in SCZ (N=27). Evoked brain potentials to unisensory-visual (V), unisensory-tactile (T), or spatiotemporally aligned bisensory VT stimuli were measured with high-density electroencephalography, while participants attended blockwise to either visual or tactile inputs. Behaviorally, IA effects in SCZ, relative to HC, were diminished for unisensory stimuli, but not for bisensory stimuli. At the neural level, we observed reduced IA effects for bisensory stimuli over mediofrontal scalp regions (230-320ms) in SCZ. The analysis of MSI, using the additive approach, revealed multiple phases of integration over occipital and frontal scalp regions (240-364ms), which did not differ between HC and SCZ. Furthermore, IA and MSI effects were both positively related to the behavioral performance in SCZ, indicating that IA and MSI mutually facilitate bisensory stimulus processing. Multisensory processing could facilitate stimulus processing and compensate for top-down attention deficits in SCZ. Differences in attentional demands, which may be differentially compensated by multisensory processing, could account for previous conflicting findings on MSI in SCZ.

The role of selective attention in the positivity offset: Evidence from event related potentials	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NEGATIVITY BIAS; WORD-FREQUENCY; TIME-COURSE; EMOTIONAL INFORMATION; VISUAL-ATTENTION; LEXICAL ACCESS; BRAIN; INHIBITION; MOOD; ADJECTIVES	Some research suggests that positive and negative valence stimuli may be processed differently. For example, negative material may capture and hold attention more readily than equally arousing positive material. This is called the negativity bias, and it has been observed as both behavioural and electroencephalographic (EEG) effects. Consequently, it has been attributed to both automatic and elaborative processes. However, at the lowest levels of arousal, faster reaction times and stronger EEG responses to positive material have been observed. This is called the positivity offset, and the underlying cognitive mechanism is less understood. To study the role of selective attention in the positivity offset, participants completed a negative affective priming (NAP) task modified to dissociate priming for positive and negative words. The task required participants to indicate the valence of a target word, while simultaneously ignoring a distractor. In experiment 1, a behavioural facilitation effect (faster response time) was observed for positive words, in stark contrast to the original NAP task. These results were congruent with a previously reported general categorization advantage for positive material. In experiment 2, participants performed the task while EEG was recorded. In additional to replicating the behavioural results from experiment 1, positive words elicited a larger Late Positive Potential (LPP) component on ignored repetition relative to control trials. Surprisingly, negative words elicited a larger LPP than positive words on control trials. These results suggest that the positivity offset may reflect a greater sensitivity to priming effects due to a more flexible attentional set.

Attention reinforces human corticofugal system to aid speech perception in noise	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; Functional connectivity; FFR; Corticofugal tuning; Hierarchical speech processing	FREQUENCY-FOLLOWING RESPONSE; AUDITORY SELECTIVE ATTENTION; BRAIN-STEM; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; MODULATION; PLASTICITY; HEARING; EEG; MUSICIANS	Perceiving speech-in-noise (SIN) demands precise neural coding between brainstem and cortical levels of the hearing system. Attentional processes can then select and prioritize task-relevant cues over competing back-ground noise for successful speech perception. In animal models, brainstem-cortical interplay is achieved via descending corticofugal projections from cortex that shape midbrain responses to behaviorally-relevant sounds. Attentional engagement of corticofugal feedback may assist SIN understanding but has never been confirmed and remains highly controversial in humans. To resolve these issues, we recorded source-level, anatomically con-strained brainstem frequency-following responses (FFRs) and cortical event-related potentials (ERPs) to speech via high-density EEG while listeners performed rapid SIN identification tasks. We varied attention with active vs. passive listening scenarios whereas task difficulty was manipulated with additive noise interference. Active listening (but not arousal-control tasks) exaggerated both ERPs and FFRs, confirming attentional gain extends to lower subcortical levels of speech processing. We used functional connectivity to measure the directed strength of coupling between levels and characterize "bottom-up " vs. "top-down " (corticofugal) signaling within the auditory brainstem-cortical pathway. While attention strengthened connectivity bidirectionally, corticofugal transmission disengaged under passive (but not active) SIN listening. Our findings (i) show attention enhances the brain's transcription of speech even prior to cortex and (ii) establish a direct role of the human corticofugal feedback system as an aid to cocktail party speech perception.

This study assesses upper limb recovery prognosis after stroke with solely physiological information, which can provide an objective estimation of recovery. Approach. Clinical recovery was forecasted using EEG-derived Event-Related Desynchronization/Synchronization and coherence, in addition to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation elicited motor-evoked potentials and upper limb grip and pinch strength. A Regression Tree Ensemble predicted clinical recovery of a stroke database (n = 10) measured after a two-month intervention with the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for the Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) and the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT). Main results. There were no significant differences between predicted and actual outcomes with FMA-UE (p = 0.29) and ARAT (p = 0.5). Median prediction error for FMA-UE and ARAT were of 0.3 (IQR = 6.2) and 3.4 (IQR = 9.4) points, respectively. Predictions with the most pronounced errors were due to an underestimation of high upper limb recovery. The best features for FMA-UE prediction included mostly beta activity over the sensorimotor cortex. Best ARAT prediction features were cortical beta activity, corticospinal tract integrity of the unaffected hemisphere, and upper limb strength. Significance. Results highlighted the importance of measuring cortical activity related to motor control processes, the unaffected hemisphere's integrity, and upper limb strength for prognosis. It was also implied that stroke upper limb recovery prediction is feasible using solely physiological variables with a Regression Tree Ensemble, which can also be used to analyze physiological relationships with recovery.

Altered neural oscillations and behavior in a genetic mouse model of NMDA receptor hypofunction	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							STEADY-STATE RESPONSE; GLUTAMATERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION; NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; PARVALBUMIN NEURONS; ARC EXPRESSION; D-SERINE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; GAMMA; KETAMINE; MICE	Abnormalities in electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers occur in patients with schizophrenia and those clinically at high risk for transition to psychosis and are associated with cognitive impairment. Converging evidence suggests N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction plays a central role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and likely contributes to biomarker impairments. Thus, characterizing these biomarkers is of significant interest for early diagnosis of schizophrenia and development of novel treatments. We utilized in vivo EEG recordings and behavioral analyses to perform a battery of electrophysiological biomarkers in an established model of chronic NMDAR hypofunction, serine racemase knockout (SRKO) mice, and their wild-type littermates. SRKO mice displayed impairments in investigation-elicited gamma power that corresponded with reduced short-term social recognition and enhanced background (pre-investigation) gamma activity. Additionally, SRKO mice exhibited sensory gating impairments in both evoked-gamma power and event-related potential amplitude. However, other biomarkers including the auditory steady-state response, sleep spindles, and state-specific power spectral density were generally neurotypical. In conclusion, SRKO mice demonstrate how chronic NMDAR hypofunction contributes to deficits in certain translationally-relevant EEG biomarkers altered in schizophrenia. Importantly, our gamma band findings suggest an aberrant signal-to-noise ratio impairing cognition that occurs with NMDAR hypofunction, potentially tied to impaired task-dependent alteration in functional connectivity.

In addition to a response time advantage of linguistic labels over non-linguistic auditory cues in judging visual objects, Boutonnet and Lupyan found that the two types of cues produced different patterns in the early perceptual ERP components P1 and P2 but not the later, semantics-relevant N4. This study thus adds an important piece of evidence supporting the claim of genuine top-down effects on perception. Given the controversy over this claim and the need for replication of key findings, we attempted to replicate Boutonnet and Lupyan (2015). We replicated their behavioral findings that response times to indicate whether an auditory cue matches a visual image of an object were faster for match than mismatch trials and faster for linguistic than non-linguistic cues. We did not replicate the main ERP effects supporting a positive effect of linguistic labels on the early perceptual ERP components P1 and P2, though we did find a congruence by cue type interaction effect on those components. Unlike Boutonnet and Lupyan, we found a main effect of cue type on the N4 in which non-linguistic cues produced more negative amplitudes. Exploratory analyses of the unpredicted N4 effect suggest that the response time advantage of linguistic labels occurred during semantic rather than early visual processing. This experiment was pre-registered at https://osf.io/cq8g4/ and conducted as part of an undergraduate cognitive science research methods class at Vassar College.

Axillary sweat was sampled with cotton pads from 10 individuals after 12 h of fasting, and after having consumed a standard breakfast. Pure cotton pads served as the control. The chemosensory stimuli were presented to 20 participants (via a constant-flow olfactometer) exclusively, and additionally as context to images of overweight and underweight avatars. EEG was recorded (61 electrodes), and chemosensory (CSERPs; P1, N1, P2, P3) and visual event-related potentials (VERPs; N1, P2, P3a, P3b) were analyzed. The amplitudes of all positive CSERP components differed more strongly from cotton in response to chemosensory satiety cues as compared to fasting cues (P1: p = 0.023, P2: p = 0.083, P3: p = 0.031), paralleled by activity within the middle frontal and temporal gyrus. Overweight compared to underweight body shapes tended to elicit larger VERP P2 amplitudes (p = 0.068), and chemosensory satiety cues amplified the VERP amplitudes in response to any body shape (P2, P3a, P3b; all p(s) <= 0.017) as compared to the cotton control. The results indicate that chemosensory satiety cues transmit complex social information, overriding the processing of analogous visual input.

In this study, we investigate the persistence of the "moving things are alive" heuristic into adulthood with 28 undergraduate students who were asked to select between two images, one of which one represented a living thing, while their electroencephalographic signals were recorded. Results show that N2 and LPP event-related potential components, often associated with tasks requiring inhibitory control, are higher in counterintuitive trials (i.e., in trials including moving things not alive or nonmoving things alive) compared with intuitive ones. To our knowledge, these findings represent the first neurocognitive evidence that the "moving things are alive" heuristic persists into adulthood and that overcoming this heuristic might require inhibitory control. Potential implications for life science education are discussed.

Neural correlates of emotional predictions: A high-density EEG investigation	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Emotion; Predictive coding; High-density EEG	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; STIMULUS-PRECEDING NEGATIVITY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SPHERICAL SPLINES; HEART-RATE; BRAIN; ANTICIPATION; EXPECTATION; UNCERTAINTY; RESPONSES	Emotions were recently reconsidered as predictions, constructed by the brain (generation stage) to prearrange action (implementation stage), and update internal models according to incoming stimuli (updating stage). However, it is unclear how emotional predictions are shaped by stimuli predictability. This study investigated the role of stimuli predictability on emotional predictions through high-density EEG. Twenty-six undergraduates underwent a S1-S2 paradigm, with emotional faces as S1s and emotional pictures as S2s. Stimuli predictability was manipulated across three blocks, in which S1 valence was predictive of S2 in the 100%, 75%, or 50% of trials. ERPs and brain sources were analyzed for each stage. During prediction generation, a larger N170/superior temporal sulcus activity emerged to fearful faces in blocks with full (100%) and medium (75%) predictive ratios. During implementation, the random block (50%) elicited a valence-independent pre-allocation of resources, reflected by a larger CNV and activation of a wide left network. In the updating stage, emotional pictures always elicited a larger LPP, while a larger P2 to neutral stimuli and a higher activity of the orbitofrontal cortex signaled early valence-dependent and late block-dependent prediction errors. These findings provide the first evidence of how stimuli predictability shape each neurocomputational stage of emotional predictions construction.

It has been characterized as a multidimensional concept, primarily comprising two dimensions: valence and arousal. Existing studies have demonstrated that emotional experience exerts a powerful impact on auditory processing in terms of valence. However, it has also been shown that while negative emotion can improve auditory perception in healthy subjects, patients with depression show deficits in auditory perception. We thus speculated that both arousal and valence jointly modulate auditory perception. To examine the emotion-driven effects on the auditory response, we induced positive, negative, and neutral emotional states in healthy subjects and collected auditory steady-state response (ASSR) evoked by a 40-Hz chirp sound. We calculated peak-to-peak amplitude (PPA) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) of evoked ASSRs and observed that the positive emotions significantly enhanced brain responses to auditory stimuli (p < 0.001), but that ASSRs in a negative state were not significantly enhanced compared with the neutral state. Subsequently, regression analysis showed a significant positive multiple linear relationship between the PPA and ratings of two emotional dimensions, indicating that arousal and valence jointly regulated the auditory cortex's synchronous oscillation, rather than the valence in isolation, offering the potential to clarify the conflicting results surrounding the role of negative emotions in auditory responses. Because depression is generally characterized by low arousal and low valence in actual life, whereas the negative emotion evoked under laboratory conditions is always with low valence but high arousal.

There has been no study on the effects of beta-lactolin on neural activity in humans. Objective: We investigated the effects of beta-lactolin on neural activity and cognitive function in healthy adults. Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 30 participants (45-64 years old) consumed beta-lactolin or placebo for 6 weeks. Neural activity during auditory and language tasks was measured through 64-channel electroencephalography. Moreover, verbal fluency tests were performed at baseline and after 6 weeks. Results: The beta-lactolin group had a significantly higher P300 amplitude at the Cp2 site (a part of the parietal lobe near the center of brain, p = 0.011), and C4 site (the area between the frontal and parietal lobe, p = 0.02) during the auditory tasks after 6 weeks than the placebo group. Thus, beta-lactolin supplementation promoted neural activity in the parietal area, which increases concentration and attention during auditory cognitive tasks. Compared with the placebo group, the beta-lactolin group also showed significant changes in the scores of verbal fluency test after 6 weeks (p = 0.033). Conclusion: Our findings provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the effects of beta-lactolin on attention in healthy adults.

Psychosis Biotypes: Replication and Validation from the B-SNIP Consortium	SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN			English	Article						psychosis; classification; Biotypes; biomarkers; EEG; cognition; saccades	BIPOLAR-SCHIZOPHRENIA NETWORK; INTERMEDIATE PHENOTYPES; DIAGNOSTIC SPECIFICITY; INHIBITORY CONTROL; COGNITIVE CONTROL; BRAIN; P300; DISORDER; DEFICITS; SCALE	Current clinical phenomenological diagnosis in psychiatry neither captures biologically homologous disease entities nor allows for individualized treatment prescriptions based on neurobiology. In this report, we studied two large samples of cases with schizophrenia, schizoaffective, and bipolar I disorder with psychosis, presentations with clinical features of hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder, affective, or negative symptoms. A biomarker approach to subtyping psychosis cases (called psychosis Biotypes) captured neurobiological homology that was missed by conventional clinical diagnoses. Two samples (called "B-SNIP1" with 711 psychosis and 274 healthy persons, and the "replication sample" with 717 psychosis and 198 healthy persons) showed that 44 individual biomarkers, drawn from general cognition (BACS), motor inhibitory (stop signal), saccadic system (pro- and anti-saccades), and auditory EEG/ERP (paired-stimuli and oddball) tasks of psychosisrelevant brain functions were replicable (r's from.96-.99) and temporally stable (r's from.76-.95). Using numerical taxonomy (k-means clustering) with nine groups of integrated biomarker characteristics (called bio-factors) yielded three Biotypes that were virtually identical between the two samples and showed highly similar case assignments to subgroups based on cross-validations (88.5%-89%). Biotypes-1 and -2 shared poor cognition. Biotype-1 was further characterized by low neural response magnitudes, while Biotype-2 was further characterized by overactive neural responses and poor sensory motor inhibition. Biotype-3 was nearly normal on all bio-factors. Construct validation of Biotype EEG/ERP neurophysiology using measures of intrinsic neural activity and auditory steady state stimulation highlighted the robustness of these outcomes. Psychosis Biotypes may yield meaningful neurobiological targets for treatments and etiological investigations.

P300s are one of the most studied event-related potentials (ERPs), which have been widely used for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Thus, fast and accurate recognition of P300s is an important issue for BCI study. Recently, there emerges a lot of novel classification algorithms for P300-speller. Among them, discriminative canonical pattern matching (DCPM) has been proven to work effectively, in which discriminative spatial pattern (DSP) filter can significantly enhance the spatial features of P300s. However, the pattern of ERPs in space varies with time, which was not taken into consideration in the traditional DCPM algorithm. Approach. In this study, we developed an advanced version of DCPM, i.e. multi-window DCPM, which contained a series of time-dependent DSP filters to fine-tune the extraction of spatial ERP features. To verify its effectiveness, 25 subjects were recruited and they were asked to conduct the typical P300-speller experiment. Main results. As a result, multi-window DCPM achieved the character recognition accuracy of 91.84% with only five training characters, which was significantly better than the traditional DCPM algorithm. Furthermore, it was also compared with eight other popular methods, including SWLDA, SKLDA, STDA, BLDA, xDAWN, HDCA, sHDCA and EEGNet. The results showed multi-window DCPM preformed the best, especially using a small calibration dataset. The proposed algorithm was applied to the BCI Controlled Robot Contest of P300 paradigm in 2019 World Robot Conference, and won the first place. Significance. These results demonstrate that multi-window DCPM is a promising method for improving the performance and enhancing the practicability of P300-speller.

We previously demonstrated with fMRI and DTI that comprehension of visual images and sentences describing human activities recruits a common extended parietaltemporal-frontal semantic system. The current research tests the hypothesis that this common semantic system will display similar ERP profiles during processing in these two modalities, providing further support for the common comprehension system. We recorded EEG from nave subjects as they saw simple narratives made up of a first visual image depicting a human event, followed by a second image that was either a sequentially coherent narrative follow-up, or not, of the first. Incoherent second stimuli depict the same agents but shifted into a different situation. In separate blocks of trials the same protocol was presented using narrative sentence stimuli. Part of the novelty is the comparison of sentence and visual narrative responses. ERPs revealed common neural profiles for narrative processing across image and sentence modalities in the form of early and late central and frontal positivities in response to narrative incoherence. There was an additional posterior positivity only for sentences in a very late window. These results are discussed in the context of ERP signatures of narrative processing and meaning, and a current model of narrative comprehension.

A passive BCI for monitoring the intentionality of the gaze-based moving object selection	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain&#8211; computer interface; gaze interaction; E-wave; contingent negative variation; stimulus preceding negativity; smooth pursuit eye movement; selection	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; FIXATION-RELATED POTENTIALS; EYE-MOVEMENTS; VISUAL-SEARCH; EEG; REWARD; CLASSIFICATION; COMPONENT; DYNAMICS; TARGET	Objective. The use of an electroencephalogram (EEG) anticipation-related component, the expectancy wave (E-wave), in brain-machine interaction was proposed more than 50 years ago. This possibility was not explored for decades, but recently it was shown that voluntary attempts to select items using eye fixations, but not spontaneous eye fixations, are accompanied by the E-wave. Thus, the use of the E-wave detection was proposed for the enhancement of gaze interaction technology, which has a strong need for a mean to decide if a gaze behavior is voluntary or not. Here, we attempted at estimating whether this approach can be used in the context of moving object selection through smooth pursuit eye movements. Approach. Eighteen participants selected, one by one, items which moved on a computer screen, by gazing at them. In separate runs, the participants performed tasks not related to voluntary selection but also provoking smooth pursuit. A low-cost consumer-grade eye tracker was used for item selection. Main results. A component resembling the E-wave was found in the averaged EEG segments time-locked to voluntary selection events of every participant. Linear discriminant analysis with shrinkage regularization classified the intentional and spontaneous smooth pursuit eye movements, using single-trial 300 ms long EEG segments, significantly above chance in eight participants. When the classifier output was averaged over ten subsequent data segments, median group ROC AUC of 0.75 was achieved. Significance. The results suggest the possible usefulness of the E-wave detection in the gaze-based selection of moving items, e.g. in video games. This technique might be more effective when trial data can be averaged, thus it could be considered for use in passive interfaces, for example, in estimating the degree of the user's involvement during gaze-based interaction.

G.; Rehbein, Maimu A.; Foecker, Manuel; Romer, Georg; Junghoefer, Markus; Wessing, Ida			Increased early motivational response to food in adolescent anorexia nervosa revealed by magnetoencephalography	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article; Early Access						Anorexia Nervosa; MEG; EEG; adolescent; food; ERP	LOW-CALORIE FOODS; EMOTIONAL FACES; BRAIN; STIMULI; SATIETY; HUNGER; WOMEN; CUES; POTENTIALS; ACTIVATION	Background It remains unclear to what extent reduced nutritional intake in anorexia nervosa (AN) is a consequence of a reduced motivational response to food. Although self-reports typically suggest AN patients have a reduced appetitive response, behavioral and neurophysiological measures have revealed evidence for both increased and reduced attentional biases towards food stimuli. The mechanisms influencing food perception in AN, might be clarified using time-sensitive magnetoencephalography (MEG) to differentiate the early (more automatic processing) stages from the late (more controlled) stages. Methods MEG was recorded in 22 partially weight-restored adolescent AN patients and 29 age- and gender-matched healthy control (HC) participants during a rapid serial visual presentation paradigm using 100 high-calorie food, 100 low-calorie food, and 100 non-food pictures. Neural sources of event-related fields were estimated using the L2-Minimum-Norm method and analyzed in early (50-300 ms) and late (350-500 ms) time intervals. Results AN patients rated high-calorie food as less palatable and reported overall less food craving than HC participants. Nevertheless, in response to food pictures AN patients showed relative increased neural activity in the left occipito-temporal and inferior frontal regions in the early time interval. No group differences occurred in the late time interval. Conclusions MEG results speak against an overall reduced motivational response to food in AN. Instead, relative increased early food processing in the visual cortex suggests greater motivated attention. A greater appetitive response to food might be an adaptive mechanism in a state of undernourishment. Yet, this relative increased food processing in AN was no longer present later, arguably reflecting rapid downregulation.

At the same time, speech reduction is known to cause problems for non-natives' speech comprehension. We investigate whether processing of full and reduced forms of cognates can help to better understand how reduced forms are represented in the mental lexicon. In an English auditory lexical decision task during which the brain response (EEG) was recorded, highly proficient Dutch learners of English listened to full and reduced forms of cognates and non-cognates. In the reduced forms, schwa was omitted. This schwa reduction occurred in either poststress or prestress position. While behavioural data (accuracy and reaction time) did not yield convincing information about the status of reduced forms, EEG data strongly suggest that form representations play an important role, in both prestress and poststress words. The results have clear implications for theories and models of spoken word recognition.

In the last decades, research has shifted to the identification of electrophysiological alterations in the prodromal and early phases of the disorder, focusing on the prediction of clinical and functional outcome. The identification of neuronal aberrations in subjects with a first episode of psychosis (FEP) and in those at ultra high-risk (UHR) or clinical high-risk (CHR) to develop a psychosis is crucial to implement adequate interventions, reduce the rate of transition to psychosis, as well as the risk of irreversible functioning impairment. The aim of the review is to provide an up-to-date synthesis of the electrophysiological findings in the at-risk mental state and early stages of schizophrenia. Methods: A systematic review of English articles using Pubmed, Scopus, and PsychINFO was undertaken in July 2020. Additional studies were identified by hand-search. Electrophysiological studies that included at least one group of FEP or subjects at risk to develop psychosis, compared to healthy controls (HCs), were considered. The heterogeneity of the studies prevented a quantitative synthesis. Results: Out of 319 records screened, 133 studies were included in a final qualitative synthesis. Included studies were mainly carried out using frequency analysis, microstates and event-related potentials. The most common findings included an increase in delta and gamma power, an impairment in sensory gating assessed through P50 and N100 and a reduction of Mismatch Negativity and P300 amplitude in at-risk mental state and early stages of schizophrenia. Progressive changes in some of these electrophysiological measures were associated with transition to psychosis and disease course. Heterogeneous data have been reported for indices evaluating synchrony, connectivity, and evoked-responses in different frequency bands. Conclusions: Multiple EEG-indices were altered during at-risk mental state and early stages of schizophrenia, supporting the hypothesis that cerebral network dysfunctions appear already before the onset of the disorder. Some of these alterations demonstrated association with transition to psychosis or poor functional outcome. However, heterogeneity in subjects' inclusion criteria, clinical measures and electrophysiological methods prevents drawing solid conclusions. Large prospective studies are needed to consolidate findings concerning electrophysiological markers of clinical and functional outcome.

The Effect of Acute Alcohol Intoxication on Alcohol Cue Salience: An Event-Related Brain Potential Study	PSYCHOLOGY OF ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS			English	Article; Early Access						cue salience; P3; alcohol administration; ERP	INCENTIVE SALIENCE; COGNITIVE BIASES; ATTENTIONAL BIAS; SOCIAL DRINKERS; REACTIVITY; HEAVY; P300; SENSITIZATION; DETERMINANTS; METAANALYSIS	Public Health Significance Statement The findings of this study offer new directions for studies using neurocognitive measures to explore alcohol cue salience and further highlight the importance of considering contextual factors in basic neurocognitive addiction science. Objective: Alcohol cue salience is considered core to the broader understanding of drinking behaviors. In the present research, we sought to build the knowledge of alcohol cue salience by exploring P3 responses to alcohol images among social drinkers within a large-scale alcohol-administration study. Method: Participants (N = 246) were randomly assigned to receive either a moderate dose of alcohol (target BAC = .08%) or a nonalcoholic control beverage. Following beverage administration, participants engaged in image-viewing tasks while EEG was recorded. We examined the impact of alcohol on the amplitude of P3 responses to pictures of alcoholic versus nonalcoholic beverages, exploring both beverage-manipulation and individual-difference moderators of these effects. Results: Results revealed a significant effect of acute alcohol intoxication on P3 responses across stimulus types, with the overall amplitude of P3 being significantly smaller among participants consuming alcohol versus a nonalcoholic beverage. In addition, results revealed a significant main effect of image type, such that P3 amplitude was larger for alcohol images compared to nonalcohol images. No interactions emerged between stimulus type and beverage condition or stimulus type and AUD risk level. Conclusions: With the aim of better understanding the potential influence of the broader context on responses to individual cues, the present study examined the perceived salience of alcohol cues within a drinking setting. Findings provide evidence for alcohol cue salience that is both robust and also widespread across drinkers. More generally, the present study's findings may offer new directions for understanding neurocognitive processes of alcohol cue salience across contexts.

No Detectable Electroencephalographic Activity After Clinical Declaration of Death Among Tibetan Buddhist Meditators in Apparent Tukdam, a Putative Postmortem Meditation State	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						brain death; postmortem; EEG; mismatch negativity; auditory brainstem response; tibetan buddhism; meditation; consciousness		Recent EEG studies on the early postmortem interval that suggest the persistence of electrophysiological coherence and connectivity in the brain of animals and humans reinforce the need for further investigation of the relationship between the brain's activity and the dying process. Neuroscience is now in a position to empirically evaluate the extended process of dying and, more specifically, to investigate the possibility of brain activity following the cessation of cardiac and respiratory function. Under the direction of the Center for Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, research was conducted in India on a postmortem meditative state cultivated by some Tibetan Buddhist practitioners in which decomposition is putatively delayed. For all healthy baseline (HB) and postmortem (PM) subjects presented here, we collected resting state electroencephalographic data, mismatch negativity (MMN), and auditory brainstem response (ABR). In this study, we present HB data to demonstrate the feasibility of a sparse electrode EEG configuration to capture well-defined ERP waveforms from living subjects under very challenging field conditions. While living subjects displayed well-defined MMN and ABR responses, no recognizable EEG waveforms were discernable in any of the tukdam cases.

CP allows people to manage their thoughts and actions by adjusting to surroundings. CP involves the formation of an internal representation of context in relation to the environment, maintenance of this information over a period of time, and the updating of mental representations to reflect changes in the environment. Each of these functions can be affected by aging and associated conditions. Here, we introduced contextual processing research and summarized the literature studying the impact of normal aging and neurodegeneration-related cognitive decline on CP. Through searching the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar databases, 23 studies were retrieved that focused on the impact of aging, mild cogniitve impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) on CP. Results indicated that CP is particularly vulnerable to aging and neurodegeneration. Older adults had a delayed onset and reduced amplitude of electrophysiological response to information detection, comparison, and execution. MCI patients demonstrated clear signs of impaired CP compared to normal aging. The only study on AD suggested a decreased proactive control in AD participants in maintaining contextual information, but seemingly intact reactive control. Studies on PD restricted to non-demented older participants, who showed limited ability to use contextual information in cognitive and motor processes, exhibiting impaired reactive control but more or less intact proactive control. These data suggest that the decline in CP with age is further impacted by accelerated aging and neurodegeneration, providing insights for improving intervention strategies. This review highlights the need for increased attention to research this important but understudied field.

This study aimed to identify natural alpha and theta frequency components during eyes-closed resting and concentrative meditation states and examined their differences within and between two testing sessions. Novice meditators had their EEG recorded during eyes-closed resting and concentrative meditation conditions, before and after engaging in a brief daily concentrative meditation practice for approximately one-month. Separate frequency Principal Components Analyses (f-PCA) yielded four spectral components of interest, congruent between both conditions and sessions: Delta-Theta-Alpha, Low Alpha, High Alpha, and Alpha-Beta. While all four components showed some increase in the meditation condition at the second session, only Low Alpha (similar to 9.5-10.0 Hz) showed similar increases while resting. These findings support the use of f-PCA as a novel method of data analysis in the investigation of psychophysiological states in meditation.

Central nervous activity during implicit processing of emotional face expressions in fibromyalgia syndrome	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Fibromyalgia; Chronic pain; Emotional processing; Attention; Facial expression; EEG		Objective: Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is characterized by chronic widespread pain accompanied by symptoms like fatigue, insomnia, depression, anxiety and cognitive impairments. In addition to central nervous pain sensitization, emotional dysregulation may be involved in FMS pathogenesis. This study investigated central nervous correlates of affective and attentional processing in FMS using an implicit task. Methods: Event-related potentials (ERPs) of the EEG were recorded in 25 FMS patients and 37 healthy controls while they had to name the frame color of pictures displaying emotional expressions (angry, painful, happy, neutral). The actual picture had to be ingored. Symptoms of pain, depression and anxiety were also assessed. Results: Patients exhibited smaller P2 and late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes, and a greater N250 amplitude, than controls. The N250 amplitude varied according to the emotional expressions displayed in patients, but not in controls. No group differences arose for the P1 or N170 amplitudes. Patients had longer reaction times and made more errors on the task; task performance was more closely related to pain severity than to other symptoms. Conclusion: The reduced P2 and LPP amplitudes indicate deficient short-term mobilization of attentional resources and sustained attention in FMS; the greater N250 amplitude may reflect greater engagement in the decoding of complex facial features, which is necessary to compensate for attentional impairments. Affective modulation of the N250 suggests that the neural mechanisms underlying complex visual processes are particularly susceptible to emotional influences in FMS. The behavioral data confirm attentional deficits in the disorder and implicate clinical pain therein.	[Fischer-Jbali, L.

Sensory attenuation in the absence of movement: Differentiating motor action from sense of agency	CORTEX			English	Article						Sensory attenuation; N1; Sense of agency; Event-related potentials (ERP)	COROLLARY DISCHARGE DYSFUNCTION; SELF-GENERATED SOUNDS; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; EVOKED-RESPONSES; INITIATED SOUNDS; BRAIN RESPONSES; AUDITORY ERPS; N1 WAVE; SUPPRESSION; COMPONENT	Sensory attenuation is the phenomenon that stimuli generated by willed motor actions elicit a smaller neurophysiological response than those generated by external sources. It has mostly been investigated in the auditory domain, by comparing ERPs evoked by self initiated (active condition) and externally-generated (passive condition) sounds. The mechanistic basis of sensory attenuation has been argued to involve a duplicate of the motor command being used to predict sensory consequences of self-generated movements. An alternative possibility is that the effect is driven by between-condition differences in participants' sense of agency over the sound. In this paper, we disambiguated the effects of motor-action and sense of agency on sensory attenuation with a novel experimental paradigm. In Experiment 1, participants watched a moving, marked tickertape while EEG was recorded. In the active condition, participants chose whether to press a button by a certain mark on the tickertape. If a button-press had not occurred by the mark, then a tone would be played 1 s later. If the button was pressed prior to the mark, the tone was not played. In the passive condition, participants passively watched the animation, and were informed about whether a tone would be played on each trial. The design for Experiment 2 was identical, except that the contingencies were reversed (i.e., a button press by the mark led to a tone). The results were consistent across the two experiments: while there were no differences in N1 amplitude between the active and passive conditions, the amplitude of the Tb component was suppressed in the active condition. The amplitude of the P2 component was enhanced in the active condition in both Experiments 1 and 2. These results suggest that motor-actions and sense of agency have differential effects on sensory attenuation to sounds and are indexed with different ERP components. (c) 2021 The Authors.

Despite the heterogeneity of the reported musical triggers, patients' emotional response to music is thought to play a crucial role in provoking seizures. Accordingly, the mesial temporal structures (especially of the non-dominant hemisphere) appear most involved in seizure generation, although a more complex fronto-temporal epileptogenic network was documented in some cases. Autoimmune encephalitis has been recently included among the many possible aetiologies of ME based on a few reports of music-induced seizures in patients with anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 antibodies. Here, we describe the case of a 25-year-old man, educated in music over a long period of time, who had suffered from drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy following seronegative limbic encephalitis related to non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Along with spontaneous events, the patient also developed musicogenic seizures later in the disease course. After detecting five music-induced episodes via 24-hour ambulatory EEG, we performed prolonged video-EEG monitoring during which the patient presented a right temporal seizure (characterized by deja-vu, piloerection and gustatory hallucinations) while listening to a hard rock song through headphones (which he had not previously heard). This observation allowed us to confirm the provoking effect of the music on our patient's seizures, despite the lack of any emotional drive, which suggests that a "cognitive" trigger was more likely in this case. Our report further highlights that autoimmune encephalitis should be investigated as a novel potential cause of musicogenic epilepsy, regardless of autoantibody status.

Musical rhythm effects on visual attention are non-rhythmical: evidence against metrical entrainment	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						entrainment; foreperiod; EEG; music; tapping; timing; frequency tagging		The idea that external rhythms synchronize attention cross-modally has attracted much interest and scientific inquiry. Yet, whether associated attentional modulations are indeed rhythmical in that they spring from and map onto an underlying meter has not been clearly established. Here we tested this idea while addressing the shortcomings of previous work associated with confounding (i) metricality and regularity, (ii) rhythmic and temporal expectations or (iii) global and local temporal effects. We designed sound sequences that varied orthogonally (high/low) in metricality and regularity and presented them as task-irrelevant auditory background in four separate blocks. The participants' task was to detect rare visual targets occurring at a silent metrically aligned or misaligned temporal position. We found that target timing was irrelevant for reaction times and visual event-related potentials. High background regularity and to a lesser extent metricality facilitated target processing across metrically aligned and misaligned positions. Additionally, high regularity modulated auditory background frequencies in the EEG recorded over occipital cortex. We conclude that external rhythms, rather than synchronizing attention cross-modally, confer general, nontemporal benefits. Their predictability conserves processing resources that then benefit stimulus representations in other modalities.

Many studies have been reported that COVID-19 can be characterized by vascular damage predominantly involving micro vessels. In this study, we proposed a method to examine whether COVID-19 effects on brain computer interface (BCI) performance or not. We collected P300 based electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from six subjects before and after the COVID-19 infection. For classifying the P300 and non-P300 EEG signals, single output and two-layer artificial neural network was utilized. Based on the t-test analysis, it was observed that there was a significant difference between the before and after COVID-19 infection test groups especially on Oz channel in occipital region for alpha=0.05 percent while that of for alpha=0.01 percent shows no statistical difference for P300 classification results. The latency values, on the other hand, before and after COVID-19 infection did not represent any difference for both significance levels. It is clearly understood from the literature that COVID-19 negatively effects to the microvascular bed. Therefore, it might be expected that it could cause to reduce the P300 based BCI performance. This was the first study to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on P300-based BCI performance, taking into account the EEG signals of the COVID-19 infection. The obtained results showed that although the COVID-19 infection did not generally effected P300 based BCI application performance and latency values, the performance of the occipital region electrodes slightly effected.

SPD shares similar but attenuated phenomenological, genetic, and neurobiological abnormalities with Schizophrenia (SCZ) and is described as part of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Objective: The aim of this work was to identify major neural correlates of SPD. Methods: This is a systematic review conducted according to PRISMA statement. The protocol was prospectively registered in PROSPERO -International prospective register of systematic reviews. The review was performed to summarise the most comprehensive and updated evidence on functional neuroimaging and neurophysiology findings obtained through different techniques (DW-MRI, DTI, PET, SPECT, fMRI, MRS, EEG) in individuals with SPD. Results: Of the 52 studies included in this review, 9 were on DW-MRI and DTI, 11 were on PET and SPECT, 11 were on fMRI and MRS, and 21 were on EEG. It was complex to synthesise all the functional abnormalities found in a single, unified, pathogenetic pathway, but a common theme emerged: the dysfunction of brain circuits including striatal, frontal, temporal, limbic regions (and their networks) together with a dysregulation along the dopaminergic pathways. Conclusion: Brain abnormalities in SPD are similar, but less marked, than those found in SCZ. Furthermore, different patterns of functional abnormalities in SPD and SCZ have been found, confirming the previous literature on the 'presence' of possible compensatory factors, protecting individuals with SPD from frank psychosis and providing diagnostic specificity.

The impact of conflict arising from competing feedback responses	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Feedback evaluation; Reward positivity; P300; Cognitive load; Stroop effect; Cognitive control	REWARD PREDICTION; STROOP PHENOMENON; COGNITIVE LOAD; ERROR; NEGATIVITY; TASK; POTENTIALS; CORTEX; POSITIVITY; SYSTEM	Humans often rely on feedback to learn. Indeed, in learning the difference between feedback and an expected outcome is computed to inform future actions. Further, recent work has found that reward and feedback have a unique role in modulating conflict processing and cognitive control. However, it is still not clear how conflict, especially concerning the processing and evaluation of feedback, impacts learning. To address this, we examined the effects of feedback competition on feedback evaluation in a reinforcement learning task. Specifically, we had participants play a simple two-choice gambling game while electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded. On half of the experiment blocks, we reversed the meaning of performance feedback for each trial from its prepotent meaning to induce response conflict akin to the Stroop effect (e.g., '(sic)' meant incorrect). Behaviourally, we found that participants' accuracy was reduced as a result of incongruent feedback. Paralleling this, an analysis of our EEG revealed that incongruent feedback resulted in a reduction in amplitude of the reward positivity and the P300, components of the human event-related brain potential implicated in reward processing. Our results demonstrate the negative impact of conflict on feedback evaluation and the impact of this on subsequent performance.

Although posterior temporal cortex (PTC) and Broca's areas play important roles in storage and selection, respectively, of lexical representations, there has been no direct evidence for physiological interactions between these areas on time scales typical of lexical selection. Using intracranial recordings of cortical population activity indexed by high-gamma power (70-150 Hz) modulations, we studied the causal dynamics of cortical language networks while epilepsy surgery patients performed a sentence completion task in which the number of potential lexical responses was systematically varied. Prior to completion of sentences with more response possibilities, Broca's area was not only more active, but also exhibited more local network interactions with and greater top-down influences on PTC, consistent with activation of, and competition between, more lexical representations. These findings provide the most direct experimental support yet for network dynamics playing a role in lexical selection among competing alternatives during speech production.

Gaining increasing popularity, emoji is now widely used to express emotional states during digital communication. Yet, it remains unclear whether emoji expression of pain can be processed as effectively as facial expression. This eventrelated brain potential (ERP) study investigates whether perception of pain expressions in emoji shares similarity with faces. Participants judged pain or neutral expressions in emoji and faces in a classic empathy paradigm. A dynamic convergent-divergent-convergent process was found during the observation of pain expressions. While the recognition for pain is better for faces than for emoji (both in accuracy and reaction time), we found similar P2 amplitudes during the early stage of processing and similar LPP amplitudes during later stage. Interestingly, the neural response diverges during P3 and N2 between faces and emoji: P3 respond more strongly to pain expression (relative to neutral) in faces, whereas N2 respond more strongly to pain expression (relative to neutral) in emoji. Our findings point to the commonality of perceiving pain in faces and in emoji, as well as the distinct salience of detecting pain in faces.

We used an EEG-compatible version of the online ball-tossing game Cyberball to induce an increase in the frequency of social interaction. In the first condition, each player received the ball equally often (inclusion: 33% ball reception). In the following condition, the frequency of the ball reception was increased (overinclusion: 45% ball reception). The main outcome variable was the event-related potential P2, an indicator for social reward processing. Moreover, positive emotions were assessed. Twenty-eight patients with SAD, 29 patients with BPD and 28 healthy controls (HCs) participated. As expected, HCs and patients with BPD, but not patients with SAD, showed an increase in the P2 amplitude from the inclusion to the overinclusion condition. Contrary to our expectations, positive emotions did not change from the inclusion to the overinclusion condition. EEG results provide preliminary evidence that patients with BPD and HCs, but not patients with SAD, process an increase in the frequency of social interaction as rewarding.

Musicians show improved speech-in-noise abilities and reduced age-related auditory decline, yet it is unclear whether short term music engagement has similar effects. In this randomized control trial we used a pre-post design to investigate whether a 12-week music intervention in adults aged 50-65 without prior music training and with subjective hearing loss improves well-being, speech-in-noise abilities, and auditory encoding and voluntary attention as indexed by auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) in a syllable-in-noise task, and later AEPs in an oddball task. Age and gender-matched adults were randomized to a choir or control group. Choir participants sang in a 2-hr ensemble with 1-hr home vocal training weekly; controls listened to a 3-hr playlist weekly, attended concerts, and socialized online with fellow participants. From pre- to post-intervention, no differences between groups were observed on quantitative measures of well-being or behavioral speech-in-noise abilities. In the choir group, but not the control group, changes in the N1 component were observed for the syllable-in-noise task, with increased N1 amplitude in the passive condition and decreased N1 latency in the active condition. During the oddball task, larger N1 amplitudes to the frequent standard stimuli were also observed in the choir but not control group from pre to post intervention. Findings have implications for the potential role of music training to improve sound encoding in individuals who are in the vulnerable age range and at risk of auditory decline.

Attentive brain states in infants with and without later autism	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SOCIAL ATTENTION; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; 6-MONTH-OLD INFANTS; ENDOPHENOTYPE CONCEPT; EYE GAZE; FACE; ASD; PREVALENCE; CHILDREN	Early difficulties in engaging attentive brain states in social settings could affect learning and have cascading effects on social development. We investigated this possibility using multichannel electroencephalography during a face/non-face paradigm in 8-month-old infants with (FH, n = 91) and without (noFH, n = 40) a family history of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). An event-related potential component reflecting attention engagement, the Nc, was compared between FH infants who received a diagnosis of ASD at 3 years of age (FH-ASD; n = 19), FH infants who did not (FH-noASD; n = 72) and noFH infants (who also did not, hereafter noFH-noASD; n = 40). 'Prototypical' microstates during social attention were extracted from the noFH-noASD group and examined in relation to later categorical and dimensional outcome. Machine-learning was used to identify the microstate features that best predicted ASD and social adaptive skills at three years. Results suggested that whilst measures of brain state timing were related to categorical ASD outcome, brain state strength was related to dimensional measures of social functioning. Specifically, the FH-ASD group showed shorter Nc latency relative to other groups, and duration of the attentive microstate responses to faces was informative for categorical outcome prediction. Reduced Nc amplitude difference between faces with direct gaze and a non-social control stimulus and strength of the attentive microstate to faces contributed to the prediction of dimensional variation in social skills. Taken together, this provides consistent evidence that atypical attention engagement precedes the emergence of difficulties in socialization and indicates that using the spatio-temporal characteristics of whole-brain activation to define brain states in infancy provides an important new approach to understanding of the neurodevelopmental mechanisms that lead to ASD.

We start by reviewing different definitions of attrition as well as associated inconsistencies. We then discuss the underlying mechanisms of first language attrition and review available evidence supporting different background hypotheses. Finally, we attempt to provide the groundwork to build a unified theoretical framework allowing for generalizable results. To this end, we suggest the deployment of a rigorous neuroscientific approach, in search of neural markers of first language attrition in different linguistic domains, putting forward hypothetical experimental ways to identify attrition's neural traces and formulating predictions for each of the proposed experimental paradigms.

Despite its clinical relevance, the brain signatures of the perceptual processing supporting command following have been elusive. This multimodal study investigates the temporal spectral pattern of electrical brain activity to identify features that differentiated healthy controls from patients both able and unable to follow commands. We combined evidence from behavioural assessment, functional neuroimaging during mental imagery and high-density electroencephalography collected during auditory prediction, from 21 patients and 10 controls. We used a penalised regression model to identify command following using features from electroencephalography. We identified seven well-defined spatiotemporal signatures in the delta, theta and alpha bands that together contribute to identify DoC subjects with and without the ability to follow command, and further distinguished these groups of patients from controls. A fine-grained analysis of these seven signatures enabled us to determine that increased delta modulation at the frontal sensors was the main feature in command following patients. In contrast, higher frequency theta and alpha modulations differentiated controls from both groups of patients. Our findings highlight a key role of spatiotemporally specific delta modulation in supporting cortically mediated behaviour including the ability to follow command. However, patients able to follow commands nevertheless have marked differences in brain activity in comparison with healthy volunteers.

We propose a general-purpose fuzzy software system shell for developing a custom EEG BCI system. It relies on the bursts of the ongoing EEG frequency power synchronization/desynchronization at scalp level and supports quick BCI setup by linguistic features, ad hoc fuzzy membership construction, explainable IF-THEN rules, and the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT), which makes the BCI system device and service independent. It has a potential for designing both passive and event-related BCIs with options for visual representation at scalp-source level in response to time. The feasibility of the proposed system has been proven by real experiments and bursts for beta and gamma frequency power have been detected in real time in response to evoked visuospatial selective attention. The presence of the proposed new brain state decoding can be used as a feasible metric for interpretation of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the passive or evoked neural oscillations.

In two pre-registered EEG studies employing an adverse life event probability estimation task, we investigated the neurocognitive processes that support the formation and the change of optimism biases in immediate and 24 h delayed tests. We found that optimistic belief updating biases not only emerged immediately but also became significantly larger after 24 h, suggesting an active role of valence-dependent offline consolidation processes in the change of optimism biases. Participants also showed optimistic memory biases: they were less accurate in remembering undesirable than desirable feedback probabilities, with inferior memories of undesirable feedback associated with lower belief updating in the delayed test. Examining event-related brain potentials (ERPs) revealed that desirability of feedback biased initial encoding: desirable feedback elicited larger P300s than undesirable feedback, with larger P300 amplitudes predicting both higher belief updating and memory accuracies. These results suggest that desirability of feedback could bias both online and offline memory-related processes such as encoding and consolidation, with both processes contributing to the formation and change of optimism biases.

Sentences could either violate (Incongruent condition), non-violate (Congruent condition) or be neutral (Neutral condition) with regard to stereotypical concepts concerning non-Caucasian ethnic groups (e.g. Asians, Africans, Arabs). No awareness or judgment about stereotypes was required. Participants were engaged in a fictitious task, ignoring the overall study?s purpose. The results showed that Incongruent terminal words elicited a greater anterior N400 response (300?500 ms) compared to Congruent and Neutral words, reflecting a difficulty in integrating the information incongruent with pre-existing stereotypical knowledge. The participant?s individual amplitude values of the N400-Difference Wave (Incongruent ? Congruent), showed a direct correlation with the individual racism scores obtained at the Subtle and Blatant Prejudice Scale, administered at the end of the experimental session. Intra-cortical sources explaining the N400 involved areas of the social cognition network such as the medial frontal cortex (BA10) and the inferior temporal gyrus (BA20) which are known to support processing of information about other people and impression formation. Moreover, Congruent terminal words evoked a greater P300 response (500?600 ms) compared to the other conditions, possibly reflecting the merging of incoming inputs with anticipated semantic information. A late post-N400 frontal positivity (650?800 ms) was found to be larger to sentences concerning other-race characters (ether congruent or incongruent) compared to sentences involving own-race characters (neutral). The study corroborated the effectiveness of neurophysiological measures to assess implicit complex semantic representations and circumventing social desirability-related problems.

However, this has been tested mainly in well-controlled environments and based on temporal features, such as the amplitude of event-related potentials. In this study, we propose a classification algorithm combining frequency features and a weighted SVM to detect the neuronal signatures of errors committed in a complex saccadic go/no-go task. We follow the hypothesis that frequency features yield better discrimination performance in complex tasks, generalize better, and require fewer pre-processing steps. When combining temporal and frequency features, we achieved a balanced classification accuracy of 75% - almost the same as using only frequency features. On the other hand, when using only temporal features, the balanced accuracy decreased to 66% These findings show that subjects' performance can be automatically detected based on frequency features of error-related neuronal signatures. Additionally, our results revealed that features computed in the pre-response time contribute to the discrimination between correct and erroneous responses, which suggests the existence of error-related patterns even before response execution.

However, working memory performance in patients with restless legs syndrome remains uncertain. The present study aimed to examine working memory performance in patients with restless legs syndrome by investigating electroencephalography theta-band oscillations within task-relevant brain regions and the synchronization among oscillations during a working memory task. Twelve female idiopathic patients with restless legs syndrome and 12 female healthy controls participated in this study. Nineteen-channel electroencephalography data were recorded while participants performed a Sternberg working memory task. We analysed event-related theta-band activity and interregional theta-band phase synchrony during the memory retrieval phase. The spatial pattern of theta-band phase synchrony was quantified using graph theory measures, including the clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, and small-world propensity. Considerable increases in theta-band activity and theta-band phase synchrony were observed at 600-700 ms in controls and at 650-750 ms in restless legs syndrome subjects after the probe item was presented. During this period, induced theta-band activity showed lower with borderline significance in the restless legs syndrome subjects than in the controls regardless of channel location (F-4,F-88 = 3.92, p = .06). Theta-band phase synchrony between the frontal and posterior regions was significantly reduced in the restless legs syndrome subjects. Inefficiency in both global and local networks in the restless legs syndrome subjects was revealed by the decreased small-world propensity (t(22) = 2.26, p = .03). Small-world propensity was negatively correlated with restless legs syndrome severity (r = -.65, p = .02). Our findings suggest that patients with restless legs syndrome have multiple deficits in cognitive processes, including attentional allocation, evaluation of incoming stimuli, and memory manipulation of encoded information during a working memory task. Abnormal local theta-band neural synchrony and global theta-band neural synchrony may underlie the neurophysiological mechanism of the working memory dysfunction associated with restless legs syndrome.

We used both psychological and physiological responses for evaluation. The former was based on NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX, NASA), and the latter was based on the electroencephalogram (EEG) P3b analysis of event-related potentials using the "oddball" paradigm experimental task. The results show that as illuminance increases, and the response time becomes longer with a colour temperature of 3000 K (P<0.01). However, when the colour temperature is set at 6500 K, the response time becomes shorter as the illuminance increases (P<0.01). P3b amplitudes were significantly affected by colour temperature (P=0.009) and illuminance (P=0.038) levels. The highest amplitudes occurred at 3000 K and 750 lx, which is consistent with the trend shown by the subjective scale. The data analysis of error rates is not significant. These results suggest that an office environment with a colour temperature of 3000 K and illumination of 750 lx, which exerts the lowest mental workload, is the most suitable for working. However, the interaction between colour temperature and illuminance in affecting the mental workload of participants is not clear. This work provides more appropriate lighting choices with colour temperature and illuminance to reduce people's mental workload in office settings.

After awakening this state can last from several minutes to several hours. Despite a rather long history of studying this phenomenon, there are still no studies aimed at assessing its effect on auditory recognition. In this study, we investigated the effect of daytime sleep inertia on recognition of difficult to discriminate sounds and evaluate its effect on the event-related potentials in response to recognized sounds. 45 healthy volunteers distinguished sim-ilar sounds before and after one-hour afternoon nap. We found that light daytime sleep improved sound recognition. At the same time, the sleep inertia was caused not just by the presence of deep sleep (slow-wave sleep), but by the awakening from this stage awakened volunteers from slow wave sleep recognized sounds worse than before sleep. This deterioration was accompanied by an increase in the latency of the late cognitive components P3a and P3b; the latency of the early components did not change, but the amplitude of P1 component increased after sleep. The obtained results allow us to conclude that sleep inertia does not adversely affect the early stages of signal processing, at which the sensory characteristics of stimuli are evaluated, but it violates the later stages, which are mostly associated with decision making.

It was assumed that the set of functional systems that are updated to solve various problems differs which is manifested in brain activity and these differences are mediated by whether an analytical or holistic individual solves a task of "his" type or not. A study of brain support for the process of analytical and holistic task' solving by representatives of the analytical and holistic subpopulations of Russian culture was conducted (N = 52). It was shown that holistic problems are solved faster and more correctly than analytical ones which is consistent with the idea of the holistic nature of Russian culture. At the same time, as learning progressed, there was an improvement in performance in tasks of the "non-own" type, i.e., holistic tasks in analytical individuals, and vice versa, in comparison with tasks specific to the mentality of individuals. The differences between the components of event-related potentials that arise when solving problems of different types by analytical and holistic individuals are obtained including the P300 sub-peaks when solving an analytical problem by analytical individuals. The obtained differences in event-related potentials are compared with the criteria of analytical and holistic problems that we identified earlier. The directions of further research of the learning process in individuals with different mentalities are discussed.	[Apanovich, V. V.; Aramyan, E. A.; Dol'nikova, M.

Interestingly, PPS can widen if a tool is employed to interact with objects in the far space. However, electrophysiological evidence of such tool-use dependent plasticity in the human brain is scarce. Here, in a series of three experiments, participants were asked to respond to tactile stimuli, delivered to their right hand, either in isolation (unimodal condition) or combined with auditory stimulation, which could occur near (bimodal-near) or far from the stimulated hand (bimodal-far). According to multi sensory integration spatial rule, when bimodal stimuli are presented at the same location, we expected a response enhancement (response time RT facilitation and event-related potential ERP super-additivity). In Experiment 1, we verified that RT facilitation was driven by bimodal input spatial congruency, independently from auditory stimulus intensity. In Experiment 2, we showed that our bimodal task was effective in eliciting the magnification of ERPs in bimodal conditions, with significantly larger responses in the near as compared to far condition. In Experiment 3 (main experiment), we explored tool-use driven PPS plasticity. Our audio tactile task was performed either following tool-use (a 20-min reaching task, performed using a 145 cm-long rake) or after a control cognitive training (a 20-min visual discrimination task) performed in the far space. Following the control training, faster RTs and greater super-additive ERPs were found in bimodal-near as compared to bimodal-far condition (replicating Experiment 2 results). Crucially, this far-near differential response was significantly reduced after tool-use. Altogether our results indicate a selective effect of tool-use remapping in extending the boundaries of PPS. The present finding might be considered as an electrophysiological evidence of tool-use dependent plasticity in the human brain. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, little is known about the influence of cognitive interventions on children's brain functioning and how individual variability modulates the impact of those interventions. In the present study, we examined the impact of two individualized cognitive training interventions on cognitive performance and neural activity in preschoolers from poor homes. Participants were classified based on their basal performance (i.e., high and low performers) in an inhibitory control task and then separated into intervention and control groups within each performance level. The control groups completed an intervention with three activities without cognitive control demands. The intervention groups performed three training activities with increased cognitive demands adjusted according to their cognitive baseline performance. Children were trained weekly for 12 weeks and tested before and after the intervention, at kindergarten, using EEG recordings during a Go/NoGo task performance. Results revealed significant training effects on midfrontal neural activity associated with conflict processing in both intervention groups. Low performers exhibited changes on preresponse conflict processing (i.e., N2). However, the high-performing group had larger training effects on both conflict-related activity (i.e., N2, ERN, and theta power) and fluid intelligence. These results suggest that the consideration of individual differences in the design of interventions could contribute to the adaptation of training demands and that the use of mobile EEG technology could be useful to assess eventual neural markers in more ecological contexts.

The emotional response to olfactory stimuli implies the activation of a complex cascade of events triggered by structures lying in the limbic system. However, little is known about how this activation is projected up to cerebral cortex and how different cortical areas dynamically interact each other. Approach. In this study, we acquired EEG from human participants performing a passive odor-perception task with odorants conveying positive, neutral and negative valence. A novel methodological pipeline integrating global field power (GFP), independent component analysis (ICA), dipole source localization was applied to estimate effective connectivity in the challenging scenario of single-trial low-synchronized stimulation. Main results. We identified the brain network and the neural paths, elicited at different frequency bands, i.e. theta(4 - 7Hz), alpha(8 - 12Hz) beta(13 - 30Hz), involved in odor valence processing. This brain network includes the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the cingulate gyrus (CgG), the superior temporal gyrus (STG), the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCu) and the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG). It was analyzed using a time-varying multivariate autoregressive model to resolve time-frequency causal interactions. Specifically, the OFC acts as the main node for odor perception and evaluation of pleasant and unpleasant stimuli, whereas no specific path was observed for a neutral stimulus. Significance. The results introduce new evidences on the role of the OFC during hedonic perception and underpin its specificity during the odor valence assessment. Our findings suggest that, after the odor onset different, bidirectional interactions occur between the OFC and other brain regions associated with emotion recognition/categorization and memory according to the stimulus valence. This outcome unveils how the hedonic olfactory network dynamically changes based on odor valence.

Cochlear implants in single-sided deaf recipients: Near normal higher-order processing	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cochlear implant; Single-sided deafness; Auditory event related potentials; Oddball task; N2; P3b		Objective: Single-sided deafness (SSD) is a condition where an individual has a severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss in one ear and normal hearing on the contralateral side. The use of cochlear implants in individuals with SSD leads to functional improvements in hearing. However, it is relatively unclear how sounds incoming via the cochlear implant (independent of the hearing ear) are processed and interpreted by higher-order processes in the brain. Methods: Scalp electroencephalography and auditory event-related potentials were recorded monaurally from nine experienced single sided cochlear implant users. Speech-in-noise and localisation tests were used to measure functional changes in hearing. Results: cochlear implant use was associated with improvement in speech-in-noise and localisation tests (compared to cochlear implant off). Significant N2 and P3b effects were observed in both cochlear implant and normal hearing ear conditions, with similar waveform morphology and scalp distribution across conditions. Delayed response times and a reduced N2 (but not P3b) effect was measured in the CI condition. Conclusion: The brain is capable of using processes similar to those in normal hearing to discriminate sounds presented to the cochlear implant. There was evidence of processing difficulty in the cochlear implant condition which could be due to the relatively degraded signals produced by the cochlear implant compared to the normal hearing ear. Significance: Understanding how the brain processes sound provided by a cochlear implant highlights how cortical responses can be used to guide implantation candidacy guidelines and influence rehabilitation recommendations.

It is characterized by the integration of massive digital information through the interconnection of machines and processes in order to make decisions in real-time. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is having and will have a great impact on different aspects, such as business, governments, and people. The impact on education is our main concern in this work because global challenges are leading us to prepare our students for jobs that have yet to be invented. For this purpose, several competencies are required to be developed in our students. One of them is critical thinking (CT). The development of this competency has been present in the educational agenda of many countries. In this paper, we proposed that CT as a construct can be measured using brainwaves from a portable electroencephalograph (EEG) during a problem-based learning (PBL) exercise. In this work, a method was designed to acquire, process, and analyze EEG brain waves in order to identify CT occurrence. Some results are shown from these analyses, and a discussion is provided about significant differences within the critical thinking of undergraduate students taking a course in Integral Calculus.

In this study we presented an improved tactile BCI for binary communication that reduces the wrong answers by adding a threshold to the decision value to achieve a valid answer, otherwise, the BCI gives an indecisive answer to the question. The threshold is calculated using a statistical test on the EEG, data recorded during the question to the patient. In total 7 tactile stimulators were placed on different parts of the subject's body. We tried the new BCI with 4 healthy subjects and using the statistical test they were able to get no wrong answers after 10 questions asked to each participant. The spelling accuracy and information transfer rate with and without statistical test are presented as well as examples of event related potentials.

EEG was recorded for three patterns of sound motion produced by changes in interaural time differences. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITC) were computed from the time-frequency decomposition of EEG signals. The participants either read books of their choice (passive listening) or indicated the sound trajectories perceived using a graphic tablet (active listening). Our goal was to find out whether the lateralization of the motion-onset response (MOR) and oscillatory responses to sound motion were more consistent with the right-hemispheric dominance, contralateral or neglect model of interhemispheric asymmetry. Apparent dominance of the right hemisphere was found only in the ERSP responses. Stronger contralaterality of the left hemisphere corresponding to the neglect model of asymmetry was shown by the MOR components and by the phase coherence of the delta-alpha oscillations. Velocity and attention did not change consistently the interhemispheric asymmetry of both the MOR and the oscillatory responses.

However, the neural mechanism of such benefit is still unclear. Therefore, we analyzed the electroencephalogram (EEG) and behavioral indicators of auditory function remodeling in patients with CI. Both indicators were sampled at multiple time points after implantation (1, 90, and 180 days). Methods First, the speech perception ability was evaluated with the recording of a list of Chinese words and sentences in 15 healthy controls (HC group) and 10 patients with CI (CI group). EEG data were collected using an oddball paradigm. Then, the characteristics of event-related potentials (ERPs) and mismatch negative (MMN) were compared between the CI group and the HC group. In addition, we analyzed the phase lag indices (PLI) in the CI group and the HC group and calculated the difference in functional connectivity between the two groups at different stages after implantation. Results The behavioral indicator, speech recognition ability, in CI patients improved as the implantation time increased. The MMN analysis showed that CI patients could recognize the difference between standard and deviation stimuli just like the HCs 90 days after cochlear implantation. Comparing the latencies of N1/P2/MMN between the CI group and the HC group, we found that the latency of N1/P2 in CI patients was longer, while the latency of MMN in CI users was shorter. In addition, PLI-based whole-brain functional connectivity (PLI-FC) showed that the difference between the CI group and the HC group mainly exists in electrode pairs between the bilateral auditory area and the frontal area. Furthermore, all those differences gradually decreased with the increase in implantation time. Conclusion The N1 amplitude, N1/P2/MMN latency, and PLI-FC in the alpha band may reflect the process of auditory function remodeling and could be an objective index for the assessment of speech perception ability and the effect of cochlear implantation.

Modern CNN architectures are often composed of many convolutional and some fully connected layers, and have thousands or millions of parameters. CNNs have shown to be effective in the detection of Event-Related Potentials from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, notably the P300 component which is frequently employed in Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs). However, for this task, the increase in detection rates compared to approaches based on human-engineered features has not been as impressive as in other areas and might not justify such a large number of parameters. In this paper, we study the performance of existing CNN architectures with diverse complexities for single-trial within-subject and cross-subject P300 detection on four different datasets. We also proposed SepConv1D, a very simple CNN architecture consisting of a single depthwise separable 1D convolutional layer followed by a fully connected Sigmoid classification neuron. We found that with as few as four filters in its convolutional layer and an overall small number of parameters, SepConv1D obtained competitive performances in the four datasets. We believe these results may represent an important step towards building simpler, cheaper, faster, and more portable BCIs. ? 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An Event-Related Potentials Study	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						information overload; purchase decision; P2; P3; LPC; time-varying analysis	GENDER-DIFFERENCES; BRAIN POTENTIALS; PARIETAL CORTEX; NEGATIVITY BIAS; CHOICE; ATTENTION; P300; EEG; CATEGORIZATION; RESPONSES	One of the advantages of e-retailers is their capability to provide a large amount of information to consumers. However, when the amount of information exceeds consumers' information processing capacities, it will lead to worse decision quality and experience, causing the information overload effect. In this study, the event-related potentials (ERPs) were applied to examine the hidden neural mechanism of the impact of information overload on consumers' decision processes. Behavioral data showed that people would spend more time making decisions when faced with information overload. Neurophysiologically, consumers would invest less attentional resources in the high amount of information (HAI) condition than those in the low amount of information (LAI) condition and lead to less positive P2 amplitudes. The HAI condition would increase decision difficulty than would the LAI condition and result in smaller P3 amplitudes. In addition, an increased late positive component (LPC) was observed for the HAI condition in contrast to the LAI condition, indicating that consumers were more inclined to have decision process regret when consumers were overloaded. We further investigated the dynamic information processing when consumers got over information overload by mining the brain's time-varying networks. The results revealed that during the decision process and the neural response stage, the central area controlled other brain regions' activities for the HAI condition, suggesting that people may still consider and compare other important information after the decision process when faced with information overload. In general, this study may provide neural evidence of how information overload affects consumers' decision processes and ultimately damages decision quality.

Exploring the relationship between social power and the ERP components of empathy for pain	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Social Power; empathy; empathy for Pain; ERP components; ERPs; EEG	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; OTHERS; RESPONSES; ACCURACY; DYNAMICS; MOOD; SAD	Social power (the ability to control or influence another's thoughts, feelings, or behaviors) and empathy (the ability to both share and understand the thoughts and feelings of others) are fundamental to social life. Here, we explore the relationship between social power and the ERP components associated with empathy for pain. Participants were induced into states of high and low social power via a double blind version of the episodic recall task (e.g., "recall a time you felt powerful"). Afterward, they completed a pain categorization task, viewing pictures of hands that were in pain or not in pain, from a first-person or third-person visual perspective. Whereas both high and low social power states were associated with enhanced N2 amplitudes when observing another in pain, only the high social power state was associated with an enhancement of the P3. Based on this pattern of data, we tentatively suggest that, whereas social power does not seem to impact the initial emotional response to observing another's pain (as indexed by the N2), low social power might induce changes in the cognitive evaluation of another's pain relative to high social power (as indexed by the P3). We discuss our findings in relation to the broader literature on power and empathy.

This study explores the prospect of using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a novel family of generative models, to perform data augmentation for generating artificial training data that are used in the classification of P300 event-related potentials in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In this regard, we consider two popular GANs, namely, Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) and Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP), and explore their efficacy in generating artificial EEG data in both subject-specific and subject-independent contexts. The results show that data augmentation using both DCGAN and WGAN-GP could lead to improved classification performance. However, the operating conditions that an improvement is observed differ between the subject-specific and subject-independent classification schemes. In particular, we observe that a transition from a relatively small to large training sample size per subject would generally lead to a better classification performance in training subject-specific classifiers; however, when a limited number of subjects is available, this transition could potentially result in an opposite effect in case of subject-independent classification.

Although the electrophysiological correlates of attentional processing have been extensively studied in the laboratory, relatively little is known about the way they unfold under more variable, ecologically-valid conditions. Accordingly, this study employed a 'real-world' EEG design to investigate how attentional processing varies under increasing cognitive, motor, and environmental demands. Forty-four participants were exposed to an auditory oddball task while (1) sitting in a quiet room inside the lab, (2) walking around a sports field, and (3) wayfinding across a university campus. In each condition, participants were instructed to either count or ignore oddball stimuli. While behavioral performance was similar across the lab and field conditions, oddball count accuracy was significantly reduced in the campus condition. Moreover, event-related potential components (mismatch negativity and P3) elicited in both 'real-world' settings differed significantly from those obtained under laboratory conditions. These findings demonstrate the impact of environmental factors on attentional processing during simultaneously-performed motor and cognitive tasks, highlighting the value of incorporating dynamic and unpredictable contexts within naturalistic designs.

The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the validity of a recently developed method, hidden semi-Markov model multivariate pattern analysis (HsMM-MVPA), for discovering stages directly from EEG data, in contrast to classical reaction-time-based methods. To test the validity of stages discovered with the HsMM-MVPA method, we applied it to two relatively simple tasks where the interpretation of processing stages is straightforward. In these visual discrimination EEG data experiments, perceptual processing and decision difficulty were manipulated. The HsMM-MVPA revealed that participants progressed through five cognitive processing stages while performing these tasks. The brain activation of one of those stages was dependent on perceptual processing, whereas the brain activation and the duration of two other stages were dependent on decision difficulty. In addition, evidence accumulation models (EAMs) were used to assess to what extent the results of HsMM-MVPA are comparable to standard reaction-time-based methods. Consistent with the HsMM-MVPA results, EAMs showed that nondecision time varied with perceptual difficulty and drift rate varied with decision difficulty. Moreover, nondecision and decision time of the EAMs correlated highly with the first two and last three stages of the HsMM-MVPA, respectively, indicating that the HsMM-MVPA gives a more detailed description of stages discovered with this more classical method. The results demonstrate that cognitive stages can be robustly inferred with the HsMM-MVPA.

Active and repetitive physical rehabilitation centered on the stroke-affected side is essential for effective and rapid neurological recovery of upper extremity dysfunction due to hemiplegia. A symmetric upper extremity trainer is utilized to assist the patient body, depending upon the degree of hemiplegia. In this study, we developed a novel balance handle as a symmetric upper extremity trainer capable of extension, flexion, pronation, and supination of the upper extremity. We collected the surface electromyogram (sEMG) signal data while the subjects were playing a serious game and recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal data while the subjects were performing basic movements with the balance handle, to analyze the effectiveness of the device as an assistive tool for rehabilitation. The triceps brachii were activated during the extension movements, whereas the biceps brachii and deltoid muscles were activated during the flexion movements. With the balance handle, the peak event-related desynchronization (ERD) values were relatively lower while showing higher peak event-related synchronization (ERS) values compared to other types of operating methods, such as hand gripping and gamepad operation. Movement intention of tilting the balance handle for the alpha and beta waves was clearly distinguished from the other tasks. These data demonstrated the potential of various applications using the developed proof-of-concept upper extremity trainer to bring out an excellent rehabilitative effect not only through muscle growth but also via identification of large movement intentions inducing brain activation exercise.

Similar EEG Activity Patterns During Experimentally-Induced Auditory Illusions and Veridical Perceptions	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory perception; auditory illusions; auditory awareness negativity; CPP; late positivity; P300; SCP; signal detection		Hallucinations and illusions are two instances of perceptual experiences illustrating how perception might diverge from external sensory stimulations and be generated or altered based on internal brain states. The occurrence of these phenomena is not constrained to patient populations. Similar experiences can be elicited in healthy subjects by means of suitable experimental procedures. Studying the neural mechanisms underlying these experiences not only has the potential to expand our understanding of the brain's perceptual machinery but also of how it might get impaired. In the current study, we employed an auditory signal detection task to induce auditory illusions by presenting speech snippets at near detection threshold intensity embedded in noise. We investigated the neural correlates of auditory false perceptions by examining the EEG activity preceding the responses in speech absent (false alarm, FA) trials and comparing them to speech present (hit) trials. The results of the comparison of event-related potentials (ERPs) in the activation period vs. baseline revealed the presence of an early negativity (EN) and a late positivity (LP) similar in both hits and FAs, which were absent in misses, correct rejections (CR) and control button presses (BPs). We postulate that the EN and the LP might represent the auditory awareness negativity (AAN) and centro-parietal positivity (CPP) or P300, respectively. The event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs) exhibited a common power enhancement in low frequencies (<4 Hz) in hits and FAs. The low-frequency power enhancement has been frequently shown to be accompanied with P300 as well as separately being a marker of perceptual awareness, referred to as slow cortical potentials (SCP). Furthermore, the comparison of hits vs. FAs showed a significantly higher LP amplitude and low frequency power in hits compared to FAs. Generally, the observed patterns in the present results resembled some of the major neural correlates associated with perceptual awareness in previous studies. Our findings provide evidence that the neural correlates associated with conscious perception, can be elicited in similar ways in both presence and absence of externally presented sensory stimuli. The present findings did not reveal any pre-stimulus alpha and beta modulations distinguishing conscious vs. unconscious perceptions.

Null effects of levodopa on reward- and error-based motor adaptation, saving and anterograde interference	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						dopamine; FRN; motor adaptation; reward; reward positivity	FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LOCALIZING P300 GENERATORS; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; WORKING-MEMORY; DOPAMINERGIC MEDICATION; SENSORY PREDICTION; EXPLICIT STRATEGY; COMT VAL158MET	Dopamine signaling is thought to mediate reward-based learning. We tested for a role of dopamine in motor adaptation by administering the dopamine precursor levodopa to healthy participants in two experiments involving reaching movements. Levodopa has been shown to impair reward-based learning in cognitive tasks. Thus, we hypothesized that levodopa would selectively impair aspects of motor adaptation that depend on the reinforcement of rewarding actions. In the first experiment, participants performed two separate tasks in which adaptation was driven either by visual error-based feedback of the hand position or binary reward feedback. We used EEG to measure event-related potentials evoked by task feedback. We hypothesized that levodopa would specifically diminish adaptation and the neural responses to feedback in the reward learning task. However, levodopa did not affect motor adaptation in either task nor did it diminish event-related potentials elicited by reward outcomes. In the second experiment, participants learned to compensate for mechanical force field perturbations applied to the hand during reaching. Previous exposure to a particular force field can result in savings during subsequent adaptation to the same force field or interference during adaptation to an opposite force field. We hypothesized that levodopa would diminish savings and anterograde interference, as previous work suggests that these phenomena result from a reinforcement learning process. However, we found no reliable effects of levodopa. These results suggest that reward-based motor adaptation, savings, and interference may not depend on the same dopaminergic mechanisms that have been shown to be disrupted by levodopa during various cognitive tasks. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Motor adaptation relies on multiple processes including reinforcement of successful actions. Cognitive reinforcement learning is impaired by levodopa-induced disruption of dopamine function. We administered levodopa to healthy adults who participated in multiple motor adaptation tasks. We found no effects of levodopa on any component of motor adaptation. This suggests that motor adaptation may not depend on the same dopaminergic mechanisms as cognitive forms or reinforcement learning that have been shown to be impaired by levodopa.

Technology supported mindfulness for obsessive compulsive disorder: Self-reported mindfulness and EEG correlates of mind wandering	BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH AND THERAPY			English	Article						Obsessive compulsive disorder; Mindfulness; Technology supported mindfulness; Mind wandering; EEG; Meditation	INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS; COGNITIVE THERAPY; METAANALYSIS; ANXIETY; FACETS; INTERVENTION; INDIVIDUALS; DEPRESSION; INTERVIEW; SYMPTOMS	Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) incorporating Exposure with Response Prevention (ERP) is the most efficacious treatment intervention for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD); however, there is a growing literature indicating that mindfulness based approaches can be beneficial in terms of managing OCD symptoms. The current study examined the potential benefits of using a consumer grade EEG-based biofeedback device (called "Muse") that permits individuals to engage in mindfulness meditation practices while at home. In this randomized controlled study, participants with a principal DSM-5 diagnosis of OCD (N = 71) were randomly assigned to eight weeks of: 1) a meditation program involving daily use of the "Muse" device, or 2) waitlist control. At weeks 1, 4, and 8, participants completed a five minute "open monitoring" practice while EEG data was recorded, and they completed self-report measures of mindfulness (FFMQ: Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire) and OCD symptoms (YBOCS: Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale). Latent Difference Score (LDS) models demonstrated that the FFMQ "Non Reactivity" facet and EEG-derived correlates of "Mind Wandering" (i.e., alpha, beta, but not delta or theta band power) were temporally associated with subsequent changes in YBOCS symptom scores. Participants in the Muse group (in comparison to the control group) experienced increased FFMQ "Non-Reactivity" and decreased mind wandering (increased alpha and beta band power), and in each case, these variables were associated with subsequent OCD symptom improvement. These results suggest that technology supported mindfulness training for OCD is associated with improvements in OCD symptoms, mindfulness and decreased mind wandering.

BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						motor imagery; sensorimotor; EEG rhythm; brain-computer interface; desynchronization; neurorehabilitation; vividness; linear mixed effects; generalized eigendecomposition; open loop	CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY; MENTAL PRACTICE; STROKE; RECOVERY	Background. Motor imagery engages much of the same neural circuits as an overt movement. Therefore, the mental rehearsal of movements is often used to supplement physical training and might aid motor neurorehabilitation after stroke. One attempt to capture the brain's involvement in imagery involves the use, as a marker, of the depression or event-related desynchronization (ERD) of thalamocortical sensorimotor rhythms found in a human electroencephalogram (EEG). Using fast real-time processing, it is possible to make the subject aware of their own brain reactions or-even better-to turn them into actions through a technology called the brain-computer interface (BCI). However, it remains unclear whether BCI-enabled imagery facilitates a stronger or qualitatively different brain response compared to the open-loop training. Methods. Seven healthy volunteers who were experienced in both closed and open-loop motor imagery took part in six experimental sessions over a period of 4.5 months, in which they performed kinesthetic imagery of a previously known set of finger and arm movements with simultaneous 30-channel EEG acquisition. The first and the last session mostly consisted of feedback trials in which the subjects were presented with the classification results of the EEG patterns in real time; during the other sessions, no feedback was provided. Spatiotemporal and amplitude features of the ERD patterns concomitant with imagery were compared across experimental days and between feedback conditions using linear mixed-effects modeling. Results. The main spatial sources of ERD appeared to be highly stable across the six experimental days, remaining nearly identical in five of seven subjects (Pearson's rho > 0.94). Only in one subject did the spatial pattern of activation statistically significantly differ (p = 0.009) between the feedback and no-feedback conditions. Real-time visual feedback delivered through the BCI did not significantly increase the ERD strength. Conclusion. The results imply that the potential benefits of MI could be yielded by well-habituated subjects with a simplified open-loop setup, e.g., through at-home self-practice.

J	Hubbard, RJ; Sahakyan, L				Hubbard, Ryan J.; Sahakyan, Lili			Separable neural mechanisms support intentional forgetting and thought substitution	CORTEX			English	Article						Memory; Forgetting; EEG	CONTEXT-CHANGE ACCOUNT; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; THETA OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ERP; INHIBITION; FMRI; TRANSFORMATION; INSTRUCTIONS	Psychological and neuroscientific experiments have established that people can intentionally forget information via different strategies: direct suppression and thought substitution. However, few studies have directly compared the effectiveness of these strategies in forgetting specific items, and it remains an open question if the neural mechanisms supporting these strategies differ. Here, we developed a novel item-method directed forgetting paradigm with Remember, Forget, and Imagine cues, and recorded EEG to directly compare these strategies. Behaviorally, Forget and Imagine cues produced similar forgetting compared to Remember cues, but through separable neural processes; Forget cues elicited frontal oscillatory power changes that were predictive of future forgetting, whereas item-cue representational similarity was predictive of later accuracy for Imagine cues. These results suggest that both strategies can lead to intentional forgetting, but directed forgetting may rely on frontally-mediated suppression, while thought substitution may lead to contextual shifting, impairing successful retrieval.

It has been reported that humans also respond to olfactory signals related to the human MHC-equivalent, the Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA)-System, and exhibit an olfactory-mediated preference for potential mating partners with a dissimilar, disassortative, HLA-type compared to their own. The aim of this study was to investigate whether HLA-associated peptides, presented as volatile cues, elicit neuronal responses at the receptors in the human olfactory epithelium and can be consciously perceived. To this end the discrimination ability for peptides was tested in a 3-alternative forced choice model. Furthermore electro-olfactograms of the olfactory epithelium and EEG-derived chemosensory event related potentials were recorded using precisely controlled olfactometric stimulation with peptides and control odors. Based on responses from 52 young, healthy participants the peptides could not be discriminated and the electrophysiological signals provided no evidence for a specific response to the peptides which was in contrast to the control odors. In conclusion, within the current setup the results suggest that HLA-associated peptides do not produce specific olfactory activation in humans. (C) 2021 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Twelve patients had mesial TLE (mTLE) without a magnetic resonance imaging-visible mass lesion. The remaining seven had a mass lesion in the temporal lobe neocortex. We identified the leading and lagging sites, defined as those initially and subsequently (but within <= 50 ms) showing spike-related augmentation of broadband iEEG activity. In each patient, we estimated the sources of 100 spike discharges using the latencies at given electrode sites and diffusion-weighted imaging-based streamline length measures. We determined whether the spatial relationship between the estimated spike sources and resection was associated with postoperative seizure outcomes. We generated videos presenting the spatiotemporal change of spike-related fiber activation sites by estimating the propagation velocity using the streamline length and spike latency measures. Results The spike propagation velocity from the source was 1.03 mm/ms on average (95% confidence interval = .91-1.15) across 133 tracts noted in the 19 patients. The estimated spike sources in mTLE patients with International League Against Epilepsy Class 1 outcome were more likely to be in the resected area (83.9% vs. 72.3%, phi = .137, p < .001) and in the medial temporal lobe region (80.5% vs. 72.5%, phi = .090, p = .002) than those associated with the Class >= 2 outcomes. The resulting video successfully animated spike propagations, which were confined within the temporal lobe in mTLE but involved extratemporal lobe areas in lesional TLE. Significance We have, for the first time, provided dynamic tractography visualizing the spatiotemporal profiles of rapid propagations of interictal spikes through the white matter. Dynamic tractography has the potential to serve as a unique epilepsy biomarker.

All unbalanced bilinguals were more proficient in English than Spanish. Participants rated the valence of negative, neutral, and positive words in both languages while EEG was being recorded. ERP latencies and amplitudes were analyzed for two components. The language effect was significant on the late positive component (LPC) amplitude, which was larger for emotion than for neutral words for both groups in English. The unbalanced group presented larger LPC amplitudes for positive than for neutral and for neutral than for negative words in Spanish, suggesting emotion processing differences in these participants' less proficient language. Valence effects were consistent across languages for the balanced group, but not for the unbalanced group, perhaps reflecting differences in reactivity to emotion words in the less proficient language.

Previous research has found that when participants switch attention either between two perception-based tasks (within-domain switches) or between a memory- and a perception-based task (between-domain switches), a substantial and similar processing cost was observed compared to the repetition of the same task (Verschooren, Schindler, De Raedt, & Pourtois, 2019). Here, we recorded 64-channel EEG while participants carried out within- versus between-domain switches of attention. ERP results showed that during early sensory processing, a marked P1 attenuation was associated with both switch types, suggesting that switching was associated with an early bottleneck during information processing. This early gating effect was stronger when switching from an internal to an external task, compared to switching between external tasks, suggesting different top-down requirements for them. These findings are in line with earlier proposals in the literature.

However, whether this anxiety is mediated by adolescent-specific differences in perceptual responses to learned threat is not known. To investigate this, we used EEG to examine reinforcement-dependent changes in early visual event-related potentials in adolescents (N = 28, 13-14 years) and adults (N = 23, 25-26 years old) during a differential Pavlovian fear conditioning task, with one conditioned stimulus (CS+) paired with an aversive sound (unconditioned stimulus [US]) on 50% of trials, and another (CS-) never paired with the US. An immediate extinction phase followed, where both CSs were presented alone. We found age-dependent dissociations between explicit and implicit measures of fear learning. Specifically, both adolescents and adults demonstrated successful fear conditioning and extinction according to their explicit awareness of changes in CS contingencies and their evaluative CS ratings, and their differential skin conductance responses. However, for the first time we show age differences at the neural level in perceptual areas. Only adolescents showed greater visual P1 and N1 responses to the CS+ compared to the CS- during acquisition, a dissociation that for the N1 was maintained during extinction. We suggest that the adolescent perceptual hyper-responsivity to learned threat and blunted extinction reported here could be an adaptive mechanism to protect adolescents from harm. However, this hyper-responsivity may also confer greater vulnerability to experience pathological levels of anxiety at this developmental stage.

J	Stein, J				Stein, John			Reduced Visual Magnocellular Event-Related Potentials in Developmental Dyslexia	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						dyslexia; visual; magnocellular; parvocellular; timing; VERPs; spectral analysis; biomarker; hemifield; handedness		(1) Background-the magnocellular hypothesis proposes that impaired development of the visual timing systems in the brain that are mediated by magnocellular (M-) neurons is a major cause of dyslexia. Their function can now be assessed quite easily by analysing averaged visually evoked event-related potentials (VERPs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Such analysis might provide a useful, objective biomarker for diagnosing developmental dyslexia. (2) Methods-in adult dyslexics and normally reading controls, we recorded steady state VERPs, and their frequency content was computed using the fast Fourier transform. The visual stimulus was a black and white checker board whose checks reversed contrast every 100 ms. M- cells respond to this stimulus mainly at 10 Hz, whereas parvocells (P-) do so at 5 Hz. Left and right visual hemifields were stimulated separately in some subjects to see if there were latency differences between the M- inputs to the right vs. left hemispheres, and these were compared with the subjects' handedness. (3) Results-Controls demonstrated a larger 10 Hz than 5 Hz fundamental peak in the spectra, whereas the dyslexics showed the reverse pattern. The ratio of subjects' 10/5 Hz amplitudes predicted their reading ability. The latency of the 10 Hz peak was shorter during left than during right hemifield stimulation, and shorter in controls than in dyslexics. The latter correlated weakly with their handedness. (4) Conclusion-Steady state visual ERPs may conveniently be used to identify developmental dyslexia. However, due to the limited numbers of subjects in each sub-study, these results need confirmation.

Positing a causal role for sensory processing differences requires observing atypical sensory reactivity prior to the emergence of other symptoms, which can be achieved through prospective studies. Methods In this longitudinal study, we examined auditory repetition suppression and change detection at 5 and 10 months in infants with and without Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), a condition associated with higher likelihood of developing ASD. Results In typically developing infants, suppression to vowel repetition and enhanced responses to vowel/pitch change decreased with age over posterior regions, becoming more frontally specific; age-related change was diminished in the NF1 group. Whilst both groups detected changes in vowel and pitch, the NF1 group were largely slower to show a differentiated neural response. Auditory responses did not relate to later language, but were related to later ASD traits. Conclusions These findings represent the first demonstration of atypical brain responses to sounds in infants with NF1 and suggest they may relate to the likelihood of later ASD.

However, no research has yet demonstrated an influence of negative emotions on inference formation during analogical reasoning. For this reason, we used evoked response potentials to investigate how negatively valenced content affects inference formation during analogical reasoning. Participants generated inferences about the missing term of 256 four-term analogies consisting of a first pair (A is to B), a second incomplete pair (as C is to?), and a probe term (D). We manipulated the affective valence of the terms (negative/neutral) forming the first two pairs and the soundness of the analogies. In Experiment 1, the terms were words and the relations were semantic in nature. We recorded the N400 event-related component time-locked to the probe term. The effect of analogy soundness on N400 amplitude was weaker when both pairs of terms were negative than when one or both pairs were neutral. In Experiment 2, we used analogies with negatively or neutrally conditioned symbols as terms, and visuospatial transformations as relations. We recorded the P3b event-related component time-locked to the final term of the analogy. The effect of analogy soundness on P3b amplitude was weaker when the first pair of terms was negatively conditioned than when they were neutrally conditioned. Results of both experiments suggested that negatively valenced content impairs the formation of inferences during analogical reasoning, as indicated by reduced effects of analogy soundness on N400 and P3b in the presence of negatively valenced content.

It is known that tension is affected by prediction in music listening as music unfolds. Combining behavioral and neural responses, the current research investigated how musical predictions influence tension in the process of prediction build-up based on musical context (anticipatory stage) and its integration with upcoming stimuli (integration stage). The results showed that, at the anticipatory stage, compared with high-prediction conditions, in low-prediction conditions tension curve changed faster and unstable, and a larger N5 in ERP response was elicited. Furthermore, at the integration stage, compared with congruent conditions, in incongruent conditions the behavioral rating of tension were higher regardless of the predictability of the final chord; a right negativity and P600 were elicited, and the amplitude of P600 was modulated by the predictability of the final chord. These results indicated that the effect of prediction on tension was modulated by contextual predictability. The findings provide a more comprehensive view on how musical prediction affects musical tension.

The present study aims to verify the embodiment theory by investigating the spatiotemporal brain dynamics of processing disgust-related words in Mandarin. These words were chosen because disgust is a basic emotion (e.g., it recruits neural resources in the insula) that has received little attention in neurolinguistics. The participants were required to read disgust-related and neutral words, with instructions to perform a semantic categorization task while their EEG data were recorded. The results revealed that disgust-related words elicited larger amplitudes in the P2 and LPC components of the ERP and reduced the N400 amplitudes compared to neutral words.

J	Hsu, CH; Wu, YN; Lee, CY				Hsu, Chun-Hsien; Wu, Ya-Ning; Lee, Chia-Ying			Effects of Phonological Consistency and Semantic Radical Combinability on N170 and P200 in the Reading of Chinese Phonograms	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						event-related potentials; N170; P200; visual word recognition; Chinese characters	VISUAL WORD RECOGNITION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; TIME-COURSE; ACTIVATION; COMPONENT; DYNAMICS; ERP	Studies have suggested that visually presented words are obligatorily decomposed into constituents that could be mapped to language representations. The present study aims to elucidate how orthographic processing of one constituent affects the other and vice versa during a word recognition task. Chinese orthographic system has characters representing syllables and meanings instead of suffixation roles, and the majority of Chinese characters are phonograms that can be further decomposed into phonetic radical and semantic radical. We propose that semantic radical combinability indexed by semantic radicals and the effect of phonological consistency indexed by phonetic radicals would interact with each other during the reading of Chinese phonograms. Twenty-six right-handed native Chinese speakers were recruited to the study. Participants were presented with phonograms divided into four conditions following their semantic radical combinability (large vs. small) and phonological consistency (high vs. low). EEG signals were recorded throughout the covert naming task. Our results show that there is an interaction effect between phonological consistency and semantic radical combinability on the right hemisphere N170 activity while reading phonograms. Semantic radical combinability influenced the right hemisphere N170 during the process of low-consistency character reading but not high-consistency character reading. On the other hand, the left hemisphere N170 revealed a more significant activity during reading high-consistency characters and was not affected by radical combinability. In addition, while low-consistency characters revealed a larger P200 than high-consistency characters, the semantic radical combinability effect on P200 was only significant when participants were reading high-consistency characters but not low-consistency characters. These results provide new information about how ERPs are involved in word recognition within the context of interaction among orthographic and phonological dimensions.

However, differences in experimental design and EEG recording methods haven't been fully explored. We investigated 56 participants under three different situational paradigms (virtual T-maze, mental imagery, movies), varying the stimulus and type of measurement concerning frontal asymmetry. We predicted that "strong" situational manipulations (virtual T-maze, frontal asymmetry measured as event-related desynchronization) would eclipse relationships between frontal asymmetry and relevant traits, whereas "weaker" task manipulations, measured during longer time periods, would enhance relationships to relevant traits compared to frontal asymmetry at rest. The results confirmed these expectations, stressing the importance of stimulus characteristics, trait measures and recording methods with respect to the capability model. Additionally, a revision of the capability model to an inverse U-shaped quadratic relationship might be appropriate.

This research aimed to deepen our understanding of the underlying mechanisms while also exploring the timeline of the mentalization process. Two studies were conducted in which participants' electrophysiological activity was measured while elaborating Black and White (Study 1), or Italian (ingroup) and Romanian (outgroup), human and doll-like faces (Study 2). Moreover, in Study 2 the presented faces differed in their Facial Width-to-Height Ratio. Subsequently, an Implicit Mind Attribution Test (IMAT) measured the strength of the association of the same ingroup and outgroup human stimuli with mind and body-related words. Two different phases in the time course of the mentalization process emerged. An early ERP component (N170) indicated a first difference between doll-like, mindless and human, mindful targets, while a later ERP component (P300) represented the second stage of mentalization. In this stage, outgroup doll-like faces were elaborated more similarly to the outgroup human faces compared to the same stimuli of the ingroup. Moreover, only a positive correlation between the P300 and the IMAT emerged indicating that the differences in this later ERP component were related with an implicit behavioral measure of mind attribution. These results stipulate the timeline of the mentalization process that is defined by an initial moment of mind detection, in which mindful and mindless stimuli are differentiated for the first time, and a second phase of mind attribution, where the interplay of perceptual and contextual information determine the extraction of a mind from a face.

Representational Pattern Similarity of Electrical Brain Activity Reveals Rapid and Specific Prediction during Language Comprehension	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						comprehension; EEG; language; prediction; RSA	SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; WRITTEN SENTENCE; UPCOMING WORDS; PRE-ACTIVATION; N400; ERP; CONTEXT; TIME; PERCEPTION; EEG	Predicting upcoming events is a critical function of the brain, and language provides a fertile testing ground for studying prediction, as comprehenders use context to predict features of upcoming words. Many aspects of the mechanisms of prediction remain elusive, partly due to a lack of methodological tools to probe prediction formation in the moment. To elucidate what features are neurally preactivated and when, we used representational similarity analysis on previously collected sentence reading data. We compared EEG activity patterns elicited by expected and unexpected sentence final words to patterns from the preceding words of the sentence, in both strongly and weakly constraining sentences. Pattern similarity with the final word was increased in an early time window following the presentation of the pre-final word, and this increase was modulated by both expectancy and constraint. This was not seen at earlier words, suggesting that predictions were precisely timed. Additionally, pre-final word activity-the predicted representation-had negative similarity with later final word activity, but only for strongly expected words. These findings shed light on the mechanisms of prediction in the brain: rapid preactivation occurs following certain cues, but the predicted features may receive reduced processing upon confirmation.

We report that dentate spike type 2 (DSM) events initiated by medial entorhinal cortex II (MECII)-> dentate gyrus (DG) inputs promote SG(dom) and change excitation-inhibition coordinated discharge in DG, CA3, and CA1, whereas type 1 (DSL) events initiated by lateral entorhinal cortex II (LECII)-> DG inputs do not. Just before SG(dom), LECII-originating SG oscillations in DG and CA3-originating SG oscillations in CA1 phase and frequency synchronize at the DSM peak when discharge within DG and CA3 increases to promote excitation-inhibition cofiring within and across the DG -> CA3 -> CA1 pathway. This optimizes discharge for the 5-10 ms DG-to-CA1 neuro-transmission that SG(dom) initiates. DSM properties identify extrahippocampal control of SG(dom) and a cortico-hippocampal mechanism that switches between memory-related modes of information processing.

Previous studies have mainly focused on high homeostatic sleep pressure (long-term sleep deprivation); thus, there is still little related neuro-psycho-physiological evidence based on low homeostatic sleep pressure (12 h of continuous wakefulness) that affects executive function. This study aimed to investigate the impact of lower homeostatic sleep pressure on executive function. Our study included 14 healthy young male participants tested using the Go/NoGo task in normal resting wakefulness (10:00 am) and after low homeostatic sleep pressure (10:00 pm). Behavioral data (response time and accuracy) were collected, and electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded simultaneously, using repeated measures analysis of variance for data analysis. Compared with resting wakefulness, the participants' response time to the Go stimulus was shortened after low homeostatic sleep pressure, and the correct response rate was reduced. Furthermore, the peak amplitude of Go-P2 decreased significantly, and the peak latency did not change significantly. For NoGo stimulation, the peak amplitude of NoGo-P2 decreased significantly (p < 0.05), and the peak latency was significantly extended (p < 0.05). Thus, the P2 wave is likely related to the attention and visual processing and reflects the early judgment of the perceptual process. Therefore, the peak amplitude of Go-P2 and NoGo-P2 decreased, whereas the peak latency of NoGo-P2 increased, indicating that executive function is impaired after low homeostatic sleep pressure. This study has shown that the P2 wave is a sensitive indicator that reflects the effects of low homeostatic sleep pressure on executive function, and that it is also an important window to observe the effect of homeostatic sleep pressure and circadian rhythm on cognitive function.

Its impact on neural function appears mild relative to its effects on other organs, but therapeutic advances have led to substantially increased life expectancy, necessitating deeper understanding of its impact on neurocognitive function in adulthood. We previously demonstrated intact auditory sensory processing, accompanied by mild sensory memory difficulties, in children and adolescents with cystinosis.MethodsWe investigated whether further progressive decrements in these processes would be observed in adults with cystinosis, comparing high-density auditory-evoked potential (AEP) recordings from adults with cystinosis (N=15; ages: 19-38 years) to those of age-matched controls (N=17). We employed a duration oddball paradigm with different stimulation rates, in which participants passively listened to regularly occurring standard tones interspersed with infrequently occurring deviant tones. Analyses focused on AEP components reflecting auditory sensory-perceptual processing (N1 and P2), sensory memory (mismatch negativity, MMN), and attentional orienting (P3a).ResultsOverall, adults with cystinosis produced highly similar sensory-perceptual AEP responses to those observed in controls suggesting intact early auditory cortical processing. However, significantly increased P2 and P3a amplitudes and reduced MMN at slower stimulation rates were observed, suggesting mild-to-moderate changes in auditory sensory memory and attentional processing. While cognitive testing revealed lower scores on verbal IQ and perceptual reasoning in cystinosis, these did not correlate with the AEP measures.ConclusionsThese neurophysiological data point to the emergence of subtle auditory processing deficits in early adulthood in cystinosis, warranting further investigation of memory and attentional processes in this population, and of their consequences for perceptual and cognitive function.

However, the major challenge that remained was the lack of assessment standards for pediatric CI users, especially prelingually deaf children, to eval-uate hearing rehabilitation effectiveness. In the present study, we conducted an oddball paradigm with stimuli varying in pure-tone, syllable, and tonal sounds. After implantation, we utilized cortical auditory evoked potential (CAEP) and mismatch negativity (MMN) to obtain time-domain analysis; meanwhile, the source localization was investigated to obtain spatial accuracy of the plasticity in the auditory cortex. P1 started to emerge at the third month after implantation, but its peak level was not significant until the sixth month. The temporal lobe was activated between the third and sixth months after implantation. The MMN waveform was basically normal approximately after 12 months. These results suggest that the auditory system goes through a critical period of rapid development between three and six months and enters a maturation period after 12 months. This work indicates that CAEPs are more suitable for as-sessing the early auditory system reconstruction, while MMN performs better in evaluating the advanced auditory function. Furthermore, source localization has proven to be an efficient tool in exploring auditory cortex plasticity, especially for pediatric CI users. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We manipulated semantic similarity by controlling feature overlap within taxonomical hierarchies. In a blocked-cyclic naming task, participants named pictures in repeated cycles, blocked in semantically close, distant, or unrelated conditions. Only closely related items, but not distantly related items, induced semantic blocking effects. In the first presentation cycle, naming was facilitated, and amplitude modulations in the N1 component around 140-180 ms post-stimulus onset predicted this behavioral facilitation. In contrast, in later cycles, naming was delayed, and a negative-going posterior amplitude modulation around 250-350 ms post-stimulus onset predicted this interference. These findings indicate easier object recognition or identification underlying initial facilitation and increased difficulties during lexical selection. The N1 modulation was reduced but persisted in later cycles in which interference dominated, and the posterior negativity was also present in cycle 1 in which facilitation dominated, demonstrating concurrent effects of conceptual priming and lexical interference in all naming cycles. Our assumptions about the functional role these two opposing forces play in producing semantic context effects are further supported by the finding that the joint modulation of these two ERPs on naming latency exclusively emerged when naming closely related, but not unrelated items. The current findings demonstrate that close relations, but not distant taxonomic relations, induce stronger semantic blocking effects, and that temporally overlapping electrophysiological signatures reflect a trade-off between facilitatory priming and interfering lexical competition.

J	Kaya, U; Kafaligonul, H				Kaya, Utku; Kafaligonul, Hulusi			Audiovisual interactions in speeded discrimination of a visual event	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						audiovisual interactions; EEG; multisensory; reaction time; visual timing	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; APPARENT MOTION; INTERSENSORY ATTENTION; REACTION-TIMES; PHASE RESET; PERCEPTION; MECHANISMS; HUMANS; ADAPTATION	The integration of information from different senses is central to our perception of the external world. Audiovisual interactions have been particularly well studied in this context and various illusions have been developed to demonstrate strong influences of these interactions on the final percept. Using audiovisual paradigms, previous studies have shown that even task-irrelevant information provided by a secondary modality can change the detection and discrimination of a primary target. These modulations have been found to be significantly dependent on the relative timing between auditory and visual stimuli. Although these interactions in time have been commonly reported, we have still limited understanding of the relationship between the modulations of event-related potentials (ERPs) and final behavioral performance. Here, we aimed to shed light on this important issue by using a speeded discrimination paradigm combined with electroencephalogram (EEG). During the experimental sessions, the timing between an auditory click and a visual flash was varied over a wide range of stimulus onset asynchronies and observers were engaged in speeded discrimination of flash location. Behavioral reaction times were significantly changed by click timing. Furthermore, the modulations of evoked activities over medial parietal/parieto-occipital electrodes were associated with this effect. These modulations were within the 126-176 ms time range and more importantly, they were also correlated with the changes in reaction times. These results provide an important functional link between audiovisual interactions at early stages of sensory processing and reaction times. Together with previous research, they further suggest that early crossmodal interactions play a critical role in perceptual performance.

Observing changes in human functioning during induced sleep deficiency and recovery periods	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NEUROCOGNITIVE CONSEQUENCES; DRIVING PERFORMANCE; SUBSEQUENT RECOVERY; DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; RESTRICTION; DEPRIVATION; EEG; P300; DYNAMICS; VULNERABILITY	Prolonged periods of sleep restriction seem to be common in the contemporary world. Sleep loss causes perturbations of circadian rhythmicity and degradation of waking alertness as reflected in attention, cognitive efficiency and memory. Understanding whether and how the human brain recovers from chronic sleep loss is important not only from a scientific but also from a public health perspective. In this work we report on behavioral, motor, and neurophysiological correlates of sleep loss in healthy adults in an unprecedented study conducted in natural conditions and comprising 21 consecutive days divided into periods of 4 days of regular life (a baseline), 10 days of chronic partial sleep restriction (30% reduction relative to individual sleep need) and 7 days of recovery. Throughout the whole experiment we continuously measured the spontaneous locomotor activity by means of actigraphy with 1-minute resolution. On a daily basis the subjects were undergoing EEG measurements (64-electrodes with 500 Hz sampling frequency): resting state with eyes open and closed (8 minutes long each) followed by Stroop task lasting 22 minutes. Altogether we analyzed actigraphy (distributions of rest and activity durations), behavioral measures (reaction times and accuracy from Stroop task) and EEG (amplitudes, latencies and scalp maps of event-related potentials from Stroop task and power spectra from resting states). We observed unanimous deterioration in all the measures during sleep restriction. Further results indicate that a week of recovery subsequent to prolonged periods of sleep restriction is insufficient to recover fully. Only one measure (mean reaction time in Stroop task) reverted to baseline values, while the others did not.

J	Caharel, S; Rossion, B				Caharel, Stephanie; Rossion, Bruno			The N170 is Sensitive to Long-term (Personal) Familiarity of a Face Identity	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						event-related potential; N170; face familiarity; face identity; EEG		The N170 is a large deflection of the human electroencephalogram (EEG), peaking at about 170 milliseconds over the occipito-temporal cortex after the sudden onset of a face stimulus. The N170 reflects perceptual awareness of a face and its onset corresponds to the emergence of reliable face-selectivity in the human brain. However, whether sensitivity to the long-term familiarity of a face identity emerges already at this early time point remains debated. Here we provide a brief survey of the 45 published studies comparing the N170 response to unfamiliar and familiar (famous, experimentally familiarized, personally familiar and own) faces. Even though effects of familiarity on the N170 are relatively small and inconsistent across studies, this overview indicates that face familiarity significantly increases the N170 amplitude. This effect is especially present for personally familiar faces, learned in natural conditions. In the human brain, effects linked to familiarity with specific facial identities therefore appear to emerge between 150 and 200 ms in occipito-temporal brain regions, i.e., shortly after the onset of face-selectivity but at the same time as the earliest high-level effects of immediate unfamiliar face identity repetition. This observation challenges standard neurocognitive models with a clear-cut distinction between perceptual and memory stages in human face recognition. (c) 2021 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In the present EEG study, we addressed this question by examining neural responses to variations in pitch accent (linguistic) and affective (paralinguistic) prosody in Swedish words, using a passive auditory oddball paradigm. The results indicated that changes in pitch accent and affective prosody elicited mismatch negativity (MMN) responses at around 200 ms, confirming the brain's pre-attentive response to any prosodic modulation. The MMN amplitude was, however, statistically larger to the deviation in affective prosody in comparison to the deviation in pitch accent and affective prosody combined, which is in line with previous research indicating not only a larger MMN response to affective prosody in comparison to neutral prosody but also a smaller MMN response to multidimensional deviants than unidimensional ones. The results, further, showed a significant P3a response to the affective prosody change in comparison to the pitch accent change at around 300 ms, in accordance with previous findings showing an enhanced positive response to emotional stimuli. The present findings provide evidence for distinct neural processing of different prosodic cues, and statistically confirm the intrinsic perceptual and motivational salience of paralinguistic information in spoken communication.

Associations of Hyperactivity and Inattention Scores with Theta and Beta Oscillatory Dynamics of EEG in Stop-Signal Task in Healthy Children 7-10 Years Old	BIOLOGY-BASEL			English	Article						Stop-Signal task; theta oscillations; beta oscillations; ADHD; hyperactivity; inattention; children	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; QUANTITATIVE EEG; EXECUTION; ADHD; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY; ADOLESCENTS; VIGILANCE; ANXIETY; DRIVE	Most studies on ADHD have been focused on the comparisons between healthy subjects and clinical patients. The dimensional approaches propose that the main pathological behavioral domains are distributed in the normal population and not only in individual categories of people (as assumed in traditional schemes of comparisons between patients and controls). In the current study, we used a similar approach to identify potential markers of ADHD by studying the EEG dynamics of healthy children with a natural variability in hyperactivity and inattention scores during performance of the Stop-Signal task. We found that hyperactivity/inattention scores were positively associated with RT variability. Hyperactivity/inattention scores were negatively associated with an increase in beta spectral power in the first 200 ms and positively associated with an increase in theta rhythm at about 300 ms after presentation of the Go stimulus. It has been hypothesized that such results imply insufficient vigilance in the early stages of perception and subsequent compensatory enhancing of attention to the stimulus in children with higher hyperactivity and inattention scores. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the associations between the natural variability in hyperactivity and inattention scores, as well as their combination with EEG oscillatory responses in the Stop-Signal task in a sample of healthy children. During performance, the Stop-Signal task EEGs were recorded in 94 Caucasian children (40 girls) from 7 to 10 years. Hyperactivity/inattention and inattention scores positively correlated with RT variability. Hyperactivity/inattention and inattention scores negatively correlated with an increase in beta spectral power in the first 200 ms after presentation of the Go stimulus. Such results are in line with the lack of arousal model in ADHD children and can be associated with less sensory arousal in the early stages of perception in children with symptoms of inattention. The subsequent greater increase in theta rhythm at about 300 ms after presentation of the Go stimulus in children with higher inattention scores may be associated with increased attention processes and compensation for insufficient vigilance in the early stages of perception.

Behavioral response bias and event-related brain potentials implicate elevated incentive salience attribution to alcohol cues in emerging adults with lower sensitivity to alcohol	ADDICTION			English	Article						Alcohol sensitivity; approach-bias; conflict-monitoring; cue-reactivity; event-related potentials; incentive salience; sign-tracking	ADDICTIONS NEUROCLINICAL ASSESSMENT; AUTOMATIC ACTION-TENDENCIES; RECEPTOR GENE OPRM1; SUBJECTIVE RESPONSE; LOW-LEVEL; SENSITIZATION THEORY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; COGNITIVE CONTROL; ATTENTIONAL BIAS; SOCIAL DRINKERS	Aims This study used a behavioral approach-avoidance task including images of alcoholic beverages to test whether low sensitivity to alcohol (LS) is a phenotypical marker of a dispositional propensity to attribute bottom-up incentive value to naturally conditioned alcohol cues. Design, setting and participants Experimental study with a measured individual difference variable at a university psychology laboratory in Missouri, MO, USA. Participants were 178 emerging adults (aged 18-20 years) varying in self-reported sensitivity to alcohol's acute effects. Measurements Participants completed the alcohol approach-avoidance task while behavior (response time; RT) and the electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded. Stimulus-locked event-related potentials (ERPs) provided indices of integrated (top-down and bottom-up) stimulus incentive value (P3 amplitude) and conflict between top-down task demands and bottom-up response propensities (N450 amplitude). Findings Linear mixed models showed faster RT for 'alcohol-approach' relative to 'alcohol-avoid' trials for lower-sensitivity (LS) [mean(D) +/- standard error(D) (M-D +/- SED) = 29.51 +/- 9.74 ms, t((328)) = 3.03, P = 0.003] but not higher-sensitivity (HS) individuals (M-D +/- SED = 2.27 +/- 9.33 ms, t((328)) = 0.243, P = 0.808). There was enhanced N450 amplitude (response conflict) for alcohol-avoid relative to alcohol-approach trials for LS participants (M-D +/- SED = 0.811 +/- 0.198 mu V, Z = 4.108, P < 0.001) and enhanced N450 amplitude for alcohol-approach relative to alcohol-avoid for HS participants (M-D +/- SED = 0.419 +/- 0.188 mu V, Z = 2.235, P = 0.025). There was also enhanced P3 amplitude for alcohol-approach relative to alcohol-avoid for LS (M-D +/- SED = 0.825 +/- 0.204 mu V, Z = 4.045, P < 0.001) but not HS (M-D +/- SED = 0.013 +/- 0.194 mu V, Z = 0.068, P = 0.946). Conclusions Findings from a human laboratory study appear to support the notion that low sensitivity to alcohol indexes a propensity to attribute bottom-up incentive value to naturally conditioned alcohol cues.

The aim of our study was to characterize the functional neuromarkers, including a new neuromarker, that is high rolandic beta, in Parkinson's disease (PD). Case study: A 76-year-old male patient, a university professor, a widower, in an intimate relationship with a beloved partner, was tested in the Reintegration and Training Center of the Polish Society of Neuropsychology. Results: Five years earlier (when he was 71 years old), following long-term stress, he had had a transient ischemic attack (TIA). In the following years he experienced two neurological episodes, and was diagnosed, on the basis of MRI findings and clinical symptoms, with vascular (multi-infarct) Parkinsonism. A sudden deterioration in his functioning, including hand tremors at rest, bradykinesia (motor slowdown), asymmetrical gait difficulties, postural instability, and falls typical for PD, as well as MRI finding (the appearance of 'a swallow tail' on the left side, and the lack on the right of the substantia nigra within the midbrain) was the cause of further differential diagnosis. He was assessed using the HBI methodology (Kropotov 2016; Pachalska, Kaczmarek, Kropotov 2014). EEG was recorded from 19 scalp sites, in resting state conditions, with eyes open and eyes closed, and during the cued GO/NOGO tasks with animal/plants as GO/NOGO stimuli. The electrodes were applied according to the International 10-20 system. The EEG was recorded referentially to linked ears, allowing for a computational rereferencing of the data (remontaging). Event related potentials (ERPs) were used to assess the functional changes manifested by the patient. To compare our patient with healthy controls we used the normative Human Brain Index (HBI), a database obtained through joint research by Swiss, Norwegian, Polish and Russian neuroscientists (Kropotov 2018). This database included behavioral parameters and ERP measures in 6 different neuropsychological tasks for 1000 healthy subjects. What is striking, no signs of cognitive dysfunction was found; however observed were an asymmetrical frontal lobe alpha (a neuromarker of depression) and excessive Rolandic beta (a neuromarker of Parkinson's disease). We will discuss the results on the basis of recent subject literature findings, including the personal factors that might influenced the process of the diagnosis and treatment of this patient, ones which should be also taken into account in any differential diagnosis. Conclusions: The obtained results show the importance of using HBI methodology in clinical practice. Physicians involved in the diagnosis and treatment of those with progressive ambulatory impairment and an abnormal white matter (WM) signal on neuroimaging, should when formulating any differential diagnosis consider the use of this approach.

Studies in humans investigating the neural foundations of spatial navigation traditionally use stationary, desk-top protocols revealing the hippocampus, parahippocampal place area (PPA), and retrosplenial complex to be involved in navigation. However, brain dynamics, while freely navigating the real world remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we developed a novel paradigm, the AudioMaze, in which participants freely explore a room-sized virtual maze, while EEG is recorded synchronized to motion capture. Participants (n = 16) were blindfolded and explored different mazes, each in three successive trials, using their right hand as a probe to "feel" for virtual maze walls. When their hand "neared" a virtual wall, they received directional noise feedback. Evidence for spatial learning include shortening of time spent and an increase of movement velocity as the same maze was repeatedly explored. Theta-band EEG power in or near the right lingual gyrus, the posterior portion of the PPA, decreased across trials, potentially reflecting the spatial learning. Effective connectivity analysis revealed directed information flow from the lingual gyrus to the midcingulate cortex, which may indicate an updating process that integrates spatial information with future action. To conclude, we found behavioral evidence of navigational learning in a sparse-AR environment, and a neural correlate of navigational learning was found near the lingual gyrus.

Listening difficulties can occur because of an inability to perceive or recognize sounds while listening to speech, whereas successful listening can boost understanding and improve speaking when learning a foreign language. Previous studies in our laboratory revealed that EEG-neurofeedback (NF) using mismatch negativity event-related brain potential successfully induced unconscious learning in terms of auditory discrimination of speech sounds. Here, we conducted a feasibility study with a small participant group (NF group and control group; six participants each) to examine the practical effects of mismatch negativity NF for improving the perception of speech sounds in a foreign language. Native Japanese speakers completed a task in which they learned to perceive and recognize spoken English words containing the consonants "l" or "r". Participants received neurofeedback training while not explicitly attending to auditory stimuli. The results revealed that NF training significantly improved the proportion of correct in discrimination and recognition trials, even though the training time for each word pair was reduced to 20% of the training time reported in our previous study. The learning effect was not affected by training with three pairs of words with different vowels. The current results indicate that NF resulted in long-term learning that persisted for at least 2 months.

Although many Drosophila mutants of epilepsy-related genes display clear behavioral spasms and motor unit hyperexcitability, field potential measurements of aberrant hypersynchronous activity across brain regions during seizures have yet to be described. Here, we report a straightforward method to observe local field potentials (LFPs) from the Drosophila brain to monitor ensemble neural activity during seizures in behaving tethered flies. High frequency stimulation across the brain reliably triggers a stereotypic sequence of electroconvulsive seizure (ECS) spike discharges readily detectable in the dorsal longitudinal muscle (DLM) and coupled with behavioral spasms. During seizure episodes, the LFP signal displayed characteristic large-amplitude oscillations with a stereotypic temporal correlation to DLM flight muscle spiking. ECS-related LFP events were clearly distinct from rest- and flight-associated LFP patterns. We further characterized the LFP activity during different types of seizures originating from genetic and pharmacological manipulations. In the 'bang-sensitive' sodium channel mutant bangsenseless (bss), the LFP pattern was prolonged, and the temporal correlation between LFP oscillations and DLM discharges was altered. Following administration of the pro-convulsant GABA(A) blocker picrotoxin, we uncovered a qualitatively different LFP activity pattern, which consisted of a slow (1-Hz), repetitive, waveform, closely coupled with DLM bursting and behavioral spasms. Our approach to record brain LFPs presents an initial framework for electrophysiological analysis of the complex brain-wide activity patterns in the large collection of Drosophila excitability mutants.

To study the neural mechanisms of such emotion-driven attention by means of event-related brain potentials (ERPs), tasks that employ covert shifts of attention are commonly used, in which participants need to inhibit natural eye movements towards stimuli. It remains, however, unclear how shifts of attention to emotional faces with and without eye movements differ from each other. The current preregistered study aimed to investigate neural differences between covert and overt emotion-driven attention. We combined eye tracking with measurements of ERPs to compare shifts of attention to faces with happy, angry, or neutral expressions when eye movements were either executed (go conditions) or withheld (no-go conditions). Happy and angry faces led to larger EPN amplitudes, shorter latencies of the P1 component, and faster saccades, suggesting that emotional expressions significantly affected shifts of attention. Several ERPs (N170, EPN, LPC) were augmented in amplitude when attention was shifted with an eye movement, indicating an enhanced neural processing of faces if eye movements had to be executed together with a reallocation of attention. However, the modulation of ERPs by facial expressions did not differ between the go and no-go conditions, suggesting that emotional content enhances both covert and overt shifts of attention. In summary, our results indicate that overt and covert attention shifts differ but are comparably affected by emotional content.

However, studies investigating this topic within the semantic domain remain conflicting. The current study examined the effects of mispronunciations leading to semantic abnormality in foreign-accented speech. While their EEG was recorded, native speakers of Spanish listened to semantically correct and incorrect sentences produced by another native speaker and a native speaker of Chinese. The anomaly in the incorrect sentences was caused by a subtle mispronunciation (typical or atypical in Chinese-accented Spanish) during a critical word production. While initial-stage semantic processing yielded no accent-specific differences, late processing revealed a persistent N400-effect in the foreign-accent but not in the native-accent. These findings suggest that foreign-accented mispronunciations are more difficult to integrate than native-accented errors, regardless of their relative typicality. The distinction between syntactic and semantic processing of foreign-accented speech is discussed.

Human participants of both sexes were either familiarized perceptually, via media exposure, or by personal interaction. We observed significant cross-experiment familiarity decoding involving all three experiments, predominantly over posterior and central regions of the right hemisphere in the 270-630 ms time window. This shared face familiarity effect was most prominent across the Media and the Personal, as well as between the Perceptual and Personal experiments. Cross-experiment decodability makes this signal a strong candidate for a general neural indicator of face familiarity, independent of familiarization methods, participants, and stimuli. Furthermore, the sustained pattern of temporal generalization suggests that it reflects a single automatic processing cascade that is maintained over time.

The purpose of this study was to examine the cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) to the change within a stimulus, the acoustic change complex (ACC), in frequency (F) and location (L) of the sound in normal hearing listeners. Fifteen right-handed young normal hearing listeners participated in the electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. The acoustic stimuli were pure tones (base frequency at 250 Hz) of 1 s, with a perceivable change either in location (L, 180 degrees), frequency (F, 5% and 50%), or both location and frequency (L+F) in the middle of the tone. Additionally, the 250 Hz tone of 1 sec without any change was used as a reference. The participants were asked to listen passively to the stimuli and not to move their heads during the testing. Compared to the reference tone, by which only the onset-CAEP was elicited, the tones containing changes (L, F, or L+F) elicited both onset-CAEP and the ACC. The waveform analysis of ACCs from the vertex electrode (electrode Cz) showed that, larger sound changes evoked larger peak amplitudes [e.g., (L+50%F)- > L-change; (L+50%F)- > 5%F-change] and shorter the peak latencies ([(L+5%F)- < 5%F-change; 50%F- < 5%F-change; (L+50%F)- < 5%F-change] . The current density patterns for the ACC NI' peak displayed some differences between L-change vs. F-change, supporting different cortical processing for "where" and "what" information of the sound; regardless of the nature of the sound change, larger changes evoked a stronger activation than smaller changes [e.g., L- > 5%F-change; (L+5%F)- > 5%Fchange; 50%F- > 5%F-change] in frontal lobe regions including the cingulate gyrus, medial frontal gyrus (MFG), superior frontal gyrus (SFG), the limbic lobe cingulate gyrus, and the parietal lobe postcentral gyrus. The results suggested that sound change-detection involves memory-based acoustic comparison (the neural encoding for the sound change vs. neural encoding for the pre-change stimulus stored in memory) and involuntary attention switch.

BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Flanker task; ERP; Language context; Multilingualism; Executive control	COGNITIVE CONTROL; 2ND-LANGUAGE LEARNERS; BILINGUAL ADVANTAGES; ATTENTIONAL CONTROL; POTENTIALS REVEAL; RESPONSE CONFLICT; BRAIN POTENTIALS; MODEL; ERP; EXPERIENCES	Some previous studies have shown that creating a language context in which words from both languages are interspersed into a flanker task improves executive control performance for bilinguals, but these studies have produced inconsistent results. The studies have used different versions of the task and not included monolinguals, limiting generalization. Here, English-Chinese multilinguals and English monolinguals performed a flanker task while EEG was recorded. There were three language context blocks - English, Chinese, or both - and participants were instructed to ignore the interspersed words. Multilinguals displayed faster flanker RTs and earlier P2 and N2 waveforms than monolinguals. There was also a significant correlation between the P2/N2 latency and reaction times, connecting these waveforms to behavior. Finally, P2 amplitude differed between groups in the mixed context, and language context impacted P3 amplitude for monolinguals but not multilinguals. These results are interpreted in terms of language context effects on monolingual executive function processing and possible difference in bilingual experience between current participants and those in previous studies.

So far, however, this assumption remains largely untested. Here, we drew on evidence that resting state alpha power (RSAP) reflects mental processes constituting the personal self, and tested whether RSAP is positively correlated with independent (vs. interdependent) SC. Study 1 tested European Americans and Taiwanese, whereas Study 2 tested European Americans and Japanese (total N = 164). A meta-analysis performed on the combined data confirmed a reliable association between independent (vs. interdependent) SC and RSAP. However, this association was only reliable when participants had their eyes closed. Even though European Americans were consistently more independent than East Asians, RSAP was no greater for European Americans than for East Asians. Our data helps explore a missing link in the theorizing of contemporary cultural psychology.

The ability to read, indispensable to perform in today's society, necessitates a reorganization of visual cortex for fast letter recognition, but the developmental course of this process has not yet been characterized. Here, we show the emergence of visual sensitivity to letters across five electroencephalography measurements from kindergarten and throughout elementary school and relate this development to emerging reading skills. We examined the visual N1, the electrophysiological correlate of ventral occipito-temporal cortex activation in 65 children at varying familial risk for dyslexia. N1 letter sensitivity emerged in first grade, when letter sound knowledge gains were most pronounced and decayed shortly after when letter knowledge is consolidated, showing an inverted Ushaped development. This trajectory can be interpreted within an interactive framework that underscores the influence of top-down predictions. While the N1 amplitudes to letters correlated with letter sound knowledge at the beginning of learning, no association between the early N1 letter response and later reading skills was found. In summary, the current findings provide an important reference point for our neuroscientific understanding of learning trajectories and the process of visual specialization during skill learning.

J	Hulsdunker, T; Mierau, A				Huelsduenker, Thorben; Mierau, Andreas			Visual Perception and Visuomotor Reaction Speed Are Independent of the Individual Alpha Frequency	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						sport; brain; reaction time; athlete; EEG; event-related potential; behavior; performance		While the resting-state individual alpha frequency (IAF) is related to the cognitive performance and temporal resolution of visual perception, it remains unclear how it affects the neural correlates of visual perception and reaction processes. This study aimed to unravel the relation between IAF, visual perception, and visuomotor reaction time. One hundred forty-eight (148) participants (28 non-athletes, 39 table tennis players, and 81 badminton players) investigated in three previous studies were considered. During a visuomotor reaction task, the visuomotor reaction time (VMRT) and EMG onset were determined. In addition, a 64-channel EEG system identified the N2, N2-r, and BA6 negativity potentials representing the visual and motor processes related to visuomotor reactions. Resting-state individual alpha frequency (IAF) in visual and motor regions was compared based on sport experience (athletes vs. non-athletes), discipline (badminton vs. table tennis), and reaction performance (fast vs. medium vs. slow reaction time). Further, the differences in the IAF were determined in relation to the speed of neural visual (high vs. medium vs. low N2/N2-r latency) and motor (high vs. medium vs. low BA6 negativity latency). Group comparisons did not reveal any difference in the IAF between athletes and non-athletes (p = 0.352, eta(2)(p) = 0.02) or badminton and table tennis players (p = 0.221, eta(2)(p) = 0.02). Similarly, classification based on the behavioral or neural performance indicators did not reveal any effects on the IAF (p >= 0.158, eta(2)(p) <= 0.027). IAF was not correlated to any of the behavioral or neural parameters (r <= 0.10, p >= 0.221). In contrast to behavioral results on cognitive performance and visual temporal resolution, the resting state IAF seemed unrelated to the visual perception and visuomotor reaction speed in simple reaction tasks. Considering the previous results on the correlations between the IAF, cognitive abilities, and temporal sampling of visual information, the results suggest that a higher IAF may facilitate the amount and frequency but not the speed of information transfer.

A behavioural and ERP investigation of the wearable camera photo review in autobiographical memory	MEMORY			English	Article						Autobiographical memory; episodic memory; old-new EPR; wearable camera; SenseCam		Wearable camera photo review has successfully been used to enhance memory, yet very little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Here, the sequential presentation of wearable camera photos - a key feature of wearable camera photo review - is examined using behavioural and EEG measures. Twelve female participants were taken on a walking tour, stopping at a series of predefined targets, while wearing a camera that captured photographs automatically. A sequence of four photos leading to these targets was selected (similar to 200 trials) and together with control photos, these were used in a recognition task one week later. Participants' recognition performance improved with the sequence of photos (measured in hit rates, correct rejections, & sensitivity), revealing for the first time, a positive effect of sequence of photos in wearable camera photo review. This has important implications for understanding the sequential and cumulative effects of cues on episodic remembering. An old-new ERP effect was also observed over visual regions for hits vs. correct rejections, highlighting the importance of visual processing not only for perception but also for the location of activated memory representations.

Using EEG, we investigated the sensitivity of human auditory cortex to the content of past stimulation in unattended sequences of equiprobable tones. In 3 experiments including 82 participants overall, we found that neural responses measured at different latencies after stimulus onset were sensitive to frequency intervals computed over distinct timescales. Importantly, early responses were sensitive to a longer history of stimulation than later responses. To account for these results, we tested a model consisting of neural populations with frequency-specific but broad tuning that undergo adaptation with exponential recovery. We found that the coexistence of neural populations with distinct recovery rates can explain our results. Furthermore, the adaptation bandwidth of these populations depended on spectral context-it was wider when the stimulation sequence had a wider frequency range. Our results provide electrophysiological evidence as well as a possible mechanistic explanation for dynamic and multiscale context-dependent auditory processing in the human cortex.

In this study we ask whether phonological coding is a necessary part of the reading process by examining prelingually deaf individuals who are skilled readers of Spanish. We conducted two EEG experiments exploiting the pseudohomophone effect, in which nonwords that sound like words elicit phonological encoding during reading. The first, a semantic categorization task with masked priming, resulted in modulation of the N250 by pseudohomophone primes in hearing but not in deaf readers. The second, a lexical decision task, confirmed the pattern: hearing readers had increased errors and an attenuated N400 response for pseudohomophones compared to control pseudowords, whereas deaf readers did not treat pseudohomophones any differently from pseudowords, either behaviourally or in the ERP response. These results offer converging evidence that skilled deaf readers do not rely on phonological coding during visual word recognition. Furthermore, the finding demonstrates that reading can take place in the absence of phonological activation, and we speculate about the alternative mechanisms that allow these deaf individuals to read competently.

As they wait: Anticipatory neural response to evaluative peer feedback varies by pubertal status and social anxiety	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Adolescence; Social anxiety; Puberty; Anticipation; SPN; Social evaluation	STIMULUS-PRECEDING NEGATIVITY; DSM-IV DISORDERS; EVALUATION-SCALE; BRIEF-FEAR; ADOLESCENT; REWARD; MODEL; UNCERTAINTY; CORTEX; PERIOD	Adolescence is a developmental period characterized by substantial biological, neural, behavioral, and social changes. Learning to navigate the complex social world requires adaptive skills. Although anticipation of social situations can serve an adaptive function, providing opportunity to adjust behavior, socially anxious individuals may engage in maladaptive anticipatory processing. Importantly, elevated social anxiety often coincides with adolescence. This study investigated cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) responses during anticipation of evaluative feedback in 106 healthy adolescents aged 12-17 years. We examined differences in anticipatory event-related potentials (i.e., stimulus preceding negativity [SPN]) in relation to social anxiety levels and pubertal maturation. As expected, the right frontal SPN was more negative during feedback anticipation, particularly for adolescents with higher social anxiety and adolescents who were at a more advanced pubertal stage. Effects for the left posterior SPN were the opposite of those for the right frontal SPN consistent with a dipole. Anticipatory reactivity in adolescence was related to social anxiety symptom severity, especially in females, and pubertal maturation in a social evaluative situation. This study provides evidence for the development of social anticipatory processes in adolescence and potential mechanisms underlying maladaptive anticipation in social anxiety.

In Experiment 1, the word sequence consisted of either a grammatically correct sentence (e.g., she can sing now) or an ungrammatical scrambled sequence (e.g., sing can now she). A reduced N400 effect was obtained in the grammatically correct sequences compared to the ungrammatical sequences. In Experiment 2, the critical comparison was between 2 types of ungrammatical sequences: transposed-word sequences (e.g., you that read wrong, transposing 2 adjacent central words can form a grammatical sequence) and control sequences (e.g., you that read worry, transposing any 2 adjacent central words still forms an ungrammatical sequence). An N400 reduction was observed in the transposed-word sequences relative to the control sequences. We interpret these N400 effects as evidence that an elementary syntactic representation can be rapidly constructed on the basis of parallel processing of word identities and their parts-of-speech.

Theta Phase Synchrony Is Sensitive to Corollary Discharge Abnormalities in Early Illness Schizophrenia but Not in the Psychosis Risk Syndrome	SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN			English	Article						oscillations; N1; delusions; phase resetting; power; psychosis risk syndrome		Background: Prior studies have shown that the auditory N1 event-related potential component elicited by self-generated vocalizations is reduced relative to played back vocalizations, putatively reflecting a corollary discharge mechanism. Schizophrenia patients and psychosis risk syndrome (PRS) youth show deficient N1 suppression during vocalization, consistent with corollary discharge dysfunction. Because N1 is an admixture of theta (4-7 Hz) power and phase synchrony, we examined their contributions to N1 suppression during vocalization, as well as their sensitivity, relative to N1, to corollary discharge dysfunction in schizophrenia and PRS individuals.Methods. Theta phase and power values were extracted from electroencephalography data acquired from PRS youth (n = 71), early illness schizophrenia patients (ESZ; n = 84), and healthy controls (HCs; n = 103) as they said "ah" (Talk) and then listened to the playback of their vocalizations (Listen). A principal component analysis extracted theta intertrial coherence (ITC; phase consistency) and event-related spectral power, peaking in the N1 latency range. Talk-Listen suppression scores were analyzed.Resufts: Talk-Listen suppression was greater for theta ITC (Cohen's d = 1.46) than for N1 in HC (d = 0.63). Both were deficient in ESZ, but only N1 suppression was deficient in PRS. When deprived of variance shared with theta ITC suppression, N1 suppression no longer differentiated ESZ and PRS individuals from HC. Deficits in theta ITC suppression were correlated with delusions (P = .007) in ESZ. Theta power suppression did not differentiate groups.Conclusions. Theta ITC-suppression during vocalization is a more sensitive index of corollary discharge-mediated auditory cortical suppression than N1 suppression and is more sensitive to corollary discharge dysfunction in ESZ than in PRS individuals.

Foreign-accented sentence comprehension is challenging for older adults: ERP evidence from semantic and grammar processing	JOURNAL OF NEUROLINGUISTICS			English	Article						Language comprehension; Aging; ERPs; Foreign-accent; Grammar; Semantics	AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; WORKING-MEMORY; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; AGING BRAIN; ADAPTATION; IMPLICIT; ENGLISH; YOUNGER	Research has shown that older adults have increased difficulty comprehending foreign-accented speech. As these studies have only used behavioral measures, we exploited the fine-grained temporal resolution of EEG/ERPs to examine neural signatures of foreign- and native-accented sentence comprehension in older adults. Older adults, all normal-hearing monolingual English speakers, listened to foreign Chinese-accented and native English-accented sentences while ERPs were recorded. Foreign- and native-accented sentences contained semantic or pronoun errors, or were semantically and grammatically correct. We also gathered behavioral measures of sentence comprehension, and examined how neural activity during sentence processing relates to individual differences in listeners' attitudes towards accented speakers, linguistic and cognitive skills, and hearing acuity. Older adults showed high comprehension accuracy of both foreign-accented and native-accented sentences. In contrast, ERP data showed different neural responses to foreign- and native-accented sentences: Semantic errors elicited an N400 effect in native-accented sentences, but not in foreign-accented sentences. Grammatical errors elicited a P600, not further qualified by accent type. Hearing acuity and individual differences in language attitudes, cognitive and linguistic variables did not systematically correlate with ERP patterns. These findings suggest that older adults are ultimately engaging in foreign-accented sentence comprehension, but non-native pre-lexical speech signals do not attain activation needed for strong lexical activation during online processing, resulting in strained and more effortful higher-level processing of semantics downstream the sentence.

Champ versus Chump: Viewing an Opponent's Face Engages Attention but Not Reward Systems	GAMES			English	Article						rock-paper-scissors; reward processing; attention control; event-related potentials; opponent processing	PREDICTION ERROR; COGNITIVE CONTROL; TASK; ERPS; P3A; NEGATIVITY; POTENTIALS; POSITIVITY; NETWORK; WORSE	When we play competitive games, the opponents that we face act as predictors of the outcome of the game. For instance, if you are an average chess player and you face a Grandmaster, you anticipate a loss. Framed in a reinforcement learning perspective, our opponents can be thought of as predictors of rewards and punishments. The present study investigates whether facing an opponent would be processed as a reward or punishment depending on the level of difficulty the opponent poses. Participants played Rock, Paper, Scissors against three computer opponents while electroencephalographic (EEG) data was recorded. In a key manipulation, one opponent (HARD) was programmed to win most often, another (EASY) was made to lose most often, and the third (AVERAGE) had equiprobable outcomes of wins, losses, and ties. Through practice, participants learned to anticipate the relative challenge of a game based on the opponent they were facing that round. An analysis of our EEG data revealed that winning outcomes elicited a reward positivity relative to losing outcomes. Interestingly, our analysis of the predictive cues (i.e., the opponents' faces) demonstrated that attentional engagement (P3a) was contextually sensitive to anticipated game difficulty. As such, our results for the predictive cue are contrary to what one might expect for a reinforcement model associated with predicted reward, but rather demonstrate that the neural response to the predictive cue was encoding the level of engagement with the opponent as opposed to value relative to the anticipated outcome.

Migraine aura and seizures account for the most extensive stroke mimics population. A large number of patients with a definite stroke mimics diagnosis (most commonly those with psychiatric disorders or seizures) had been treated with IV alteplase without adverse related events. We report a case of a man aged 70 years admitted to the emergency room because of acute onset of delirium and a loss of strength in the left arm (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale {NIHSS}: 10), severe hyponatremia (127 mEq/L), and no evidence of intracranial arterial occlusion at CT scan. He was eligible for intravenous thrombolysis and, after treatment, neurological symptoms improved (NIHSS: 2). The subsequent appearance of "clonus" in the left lower limb, the persistence of hyponatremia, and the presence of electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities led to the clinical suspicion of focal motor-onset seizure with impaired awareness. The patient was treated successfully with anti-seizure medications (ASMs): lacosamide 200 mg IV during the acute setting care, followed by oral lacosamide 200 mg bis in die (BID). Since two other focal seizures occurred, brivaracetam 25 mg BID has been added in therapy with subsequent clinical discontinuance and EEG normalization. Two consecutive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations showed several cortical lesions restricted in high signal in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) which corresponding to T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensities, but without lesions evidence in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map. These radiological changes disappeared at a follow-up MRI performed 20 days after the symptoms' onset. The patient fully recovered was discharged home without developing pharmacological adverse events. In this case, MRI provided an opportunity for early identification of seizure related alterations. Hence, we discuss how prospective MRI studies during seizures and interictal period would contribute to defining the relationship between the electroclinical characteristics and MRI alteration patterns, and therefore, the potential role of MRI in the differential diagnosis between seizures and stroke mimic.

Although acoustic startle reflexes are usually used for PPI examinations, recent studies have observed similar phenomena with event-related cortical potentials. In the present study, test-retest reliability of PPI measured using auditory change-related cortical responses was assessed in 35 healthy adults. Four sound stimuli were randomly presented at an even probability; Standard, Test alone, Prepulse alone, and Test + Prepulse. The Standard stimulus was a train of 25-ms tone pulses at 70 dB for 650 ms, while for Test alone and Prepulse alone, the sound pressure was increased to 80 dB at 350 ms and 73 dB at 300 ms, respectively. Measurements were performed twice with at least 7 days separation, and validity was evaluated using intra-class correlation (ICC) for latency, amplitude, and suppression rate of the P50, N100, and P200 components. The results showed high ICC values for the latency and amplitude of nearly all components, except for response to Prepulse alone (0.3-0.6). Furthermore, ICC for suppression rate was greater than 0.5 for the peak-to-peak amplitude. Good reproducibility for N100 and P200 components was obtained with this method. The present results support the PPI paradigm as a reliable tool for clinical measurements of inhibitory functions. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. and Japan Neuroscience Society. All rights reserved.

The need to use novel approaches relying on (i) patient clustering based on neurobiology irrespective to symptomatology and (ii) quantitative biomarkers focusing on evolutionarily preserved neurobiological systems allowing back-translation from clinical to nonclinical research has been highlighted. Here we sought to evaluate the mismatch negativity (MMN) response in schizophrenic (SZ) patients, Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and age-matched healthy controls. To evaluate back-translation of the MMN response, we developed EEG-based procedures allowing the measurement of MMN-like responses in a rat model of schizophrenia and a mouse model of AD. Our results indicate a significant MMN attenuation in SZ but not in AD patients. Consistently with the clinical findings, we observed a significant attenuation of deviance detection (104.7%) in rats subchronically exposed to phencyclidine, while no change was observed in APP/PS1 transgenic mice when compared to wild type. This study provides new insight into the cross-disease evaluation of the MMN response. Our findings suggest further investigations to support the identification of neurobehavioral subtypes that may help patients clustering for precision medicine intervention. Furthermore, we provide evidence that MMN could be used as a quantitative/objective efficacy biomarker during both preclinical and clinical stages of SZ drug development.

Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) interpret human intent into machine reactions, and the visual stimulation (VS) paradigm is one of the most widely used of these approaches. Although VS-based BMIs have a relatively high information transfer rate (ITR), it is still difficult for BMIs to control machines in dynamic environments (for example, grabbing a dynamic object or targeting a walking person). Approach. In this study, we utilized a BMI based on augmented reality (AR) VS (AR-VS). The proposed VS was dynamically generated based on machine vision, and human intent was interpreted by a dynamic decision time interval approach. A robot based on the coordination of a task and self-motion system was controlled by the proposed paradigm in a fast and flexible state. Methods. Objects in scenes were first recognized by machine vision and tracked by optical flow. AR-VS was generated based on the objects' parameters. The number and distribution of VS was confirmed by the recognized objects. Electroencephalogram (EEG) features corresponding to VS and human intent were collected by a dry-electrode EEG cap and determined by the filter bank canonical correlation analysis method. Key parameters in the AR-VS, including the effect of VS size, frequency, dynamic object moving speed, ITR and the performance of the BMI-controlled robot, were analyzed. Conclusion and significance. The ITR of the proposed AR-VS paradigm for nine healthy subjects was 36.3 +/- 20.1 bits min(-1). In the online robot control experiment, brain-controlled hybrid tasks including self-moving and grabbing objects were 64% faster than when using the traditional steady-state visual evoked potential paradigm. The proposed paradigm based on AR-VS could be optimized and adopted in other kinds of VS-based BMIs, such as P300, omitted stimulus potential, and miniature event-related potential paradigms, for better results in dynamic environments.

Neurophysiological correlates of conflict monitoring (i.e. the N2 ERP) likely represent a mixture of different cognitive processes. Based on theoretical considerations, we hypothesized that effects of anodal tDCS (atDCS) in superior frontal areas affect specific subprocesses in neurophysiological activity during conflict monitoring. To investigate this, young healthy adults performed a Simon task while EEG was recorded. atDCS and sham tDCS were applied in a single-blind, cross-over study design. Using temporal signal decomposition in combination with source localization analyses, we demonstrated that atDCS effects on cognitive control are very specific: the detrimental effect of atDCS on response speed was largest in case of response conflicts. This however only showed in aspects of the decomposed N2 component, reflecting stimulus-response translation processes. In contrast to this, stimulus-related aspects of the N2 as well as purely response-related processes were not modulated by atDCS. EEG source localization analyses revealed that the effect was likely driven by activity modulations in the superior frontal areas, including the supplementary motor cortex (BA6), as well as middle frontal (BA9) and medial frontal areas (BA32). atDCS did not modulate effects of proprioceptive information on hand position, even though this aspect is known to be processed within the same brain areas. Physiological effects of atDCS likely modulate specific aspects of information processing during cognitive control.

We investigated when adult-like mechanisms controlling one?s attentional selection of visual and multisensory objects emerge across childhood. Five-, 7-, and 9-year-olds were compared with adults in their performance on a computer game-like multisensory spatial cueing task, while 129-channel EEG was simultaneously recorded. Markers of attentional control were behavioural spatial cueing effects and the N2pc ERP component (analysed traditionally and using a multivariate electrical neuroimaging framework). In behaviour, adult-like visual attentional control was present from age 7 onwards, whereas multisensory control was absent in all children groups. In EEG, multivariate analyses of the activity over the N2pc time-window revealed stable brain activity patterns in children. Adult-like visual-attentional control EEG patterns were present age 7 onwards, while multisensory control activity patterns were found in 9-year-olds (albeit behavioural measures showed no effects). By combining rigorous yet naturalistic paradigms with multivariate signal analyses, we demonstrated that visual attentional control seems to reach an adult-like state at -7 years, before adult-like multisensory control, emerging at -9 years. These results enrich our understanding of how attention in naturalistic settings develops.

P3b is considered an optimal electrophysiological candidate biomarker of neurocognitive impairment for its association with the allocation of attentional resources to task-relevant stimuli, an important factor for efficient decision-making, as well as for motivation-related processes. Furthermore, associations between P3b deficits and NS have been reported. The current research aims to fill the lack of studies investigating, in the same subjects, the associations of P3b with multiple cognitive domains and the expressive and motivation-related domains of NS, evaluated with state-of-the-art instruments. One hundred and fourteen SCZ and 63 healthy controls (HCs) were included in the study. P3b amplitude was significantly reduced and P3b latency prolonged in SCZ as compared to HCs. In SCZ, a positive correlation was found between P3b latency and age and between P3b amplitude and the Attention-vigilance domain, while no significant correlations were found between P3b and the two NS domains. Our results indicate that the effortful allocation of attention to task-relevant stimuli, an important component of decision-making, is compromised in SCZ, independently of motivation deficits or other NS.

Early alpha/beta oscillations reflect the formation of face-related expectations in the brain	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; SEX-DIFFERENCES; TOP-DOWN; IDENTITY; MODULATION; DYNAMICS; BETA	Although statistical regularities in the environment often go explicitly unnoticed, traces of implicit learning are evident in our neural activity. Recent perspectives have offered evidence that both pre-stimulus oscillations and peri-stimulus event-related potentials are reliable biomarkers of implicit expectations arising from statistical learning. What remains ambiguous, however, is the origination and development of these implicit expectations. To address this lack of knowledge and determine the temporal constraints of expectation formation, pre-stimulus increases in alpha/beta power were investigated alongside a reduction in the N170 and a suppression in peri-/post-stimulus gamma power. Electroencephalography was acquired from naive participants who engaged in a gender classification task. Participants were uninformed, that eight face images were sorted into four reoccurring pairs which were pseudorandomly hidden amongst randomly occurring face images. We found a reduced N170 for statistically expected images at left parietal and temporo-parietal electrodes. Furthermore, enhanced gamma power following the presentation of random images emphasized the bottom-up processing of these arbitrary occurrences. In contrast, enhanced alpha/beta power was evident pre-stimulus for expected relative to random faces. A particularly interesting finding was the early onset of alpha/beta power enhancement which peaked immediately after the depiction of the predictive face. Hence, our findings propose an approximate timeframe throughout which consistent traces of enhanced alpha/beta power illustrate the early prioritisation of top-down processes to facilitate the development of implicitly cued face-related expectations.

At enrolment, we collected demographic (age, sex), anamnestic (aetiology, time postinjury), clinical (Coma Recovery Scale-Revised [CRS-R], Disability Rating Scale, Nociception Coma Scale-Revised), and neurophysiologic (electroencephalogram [EEG], somatosensory evoked and event-related potentials) data. Patients were followed up to gather data on mortality up to 24 months postinjury. Results Among 143 traumatic (n = 55) and nontraumatic (n = 88) patients (VS/UWS, n = 68, 19 females; MCS, n = 75, 22 females), 41 (28.7%) died within 24 months postinjury. Mortality rate was higher in VS/UWS (42.6%) than in MCS (16%; p < 0.001). Multivariate regression in VS/UWS showed that significant predictors of mortality were older age and lower CRS-R total score, whereas in MCS female sex and absence of alpha rhythm on EEG at study entry were significant predictors. Conclusions This study demonstrated that a feasible multimodal assessment in the postacute phase can help clinicians to identify patients with pDoC at higher risk of mortality within 24 months after brain injury. This evidence can help clinicians and patients' families to navigate the complex clinical decision-making process and promote an international standardization of prognostic procedures for patients with pDoC.

Recent studies have also reported that cortical responses track linguistic representations of speech. However, tracking of these representations is often described without controlling for acoustic properties. Therefore, the response to these linguistic representations might reflect unaccounted acoustic processing rather than language processing. Here, we evaluated the potential of several recently proposed linguistic representations as neural markers of speech comprehension. To do so, we investigated EEG responses to audiobook speech of 29 participants (22 females). We examined whether these representations contribute unique information over and beyond acoustic neural tracking and each other. Indeed, not all of these linguistic representations were significantly tracked after controlling for acoustic properties. However, phoneme surprisal, cohort entropy, word surprisal, and word frequency were all significantly tracked over and beyond acoustic properties. We also tested the generality of the associated responses by training on one story and testing on another. In general, the linguistic representations are tracked similarly across different stories spoken by different readers. These results suggests that these representations characterize the processing of the linguistic content of speech.

Many studies report even emotional modulations of very early sensory processing at about 80 and 100 ms after stimulus presentation, indexed by the P1. These early effects are often interpreted to index differential responses to biologically relevant expressions. Since specific spatial frequencies differ between fearful and neutral expressions, it has recently been suggested that these early modulations are substantially driven by such low-level visual differences. However, it remains unclear whether similar P1 effects are also observed in experiments in which no recognizable face information is presented at all. This study investigated this question and explored also whether any effects depend on colour information and attentional conditions. Participants (N = 20) performed a continuous perceptual task of low or high difficultly and were presented with task-irrelevant black/white and colour images of fearful and neutral faces, rendered unrecognizable by doing Fourier phase transformation. ERP findings revealed increased P1 amplitudes for fearful scrambles regardless of experimental conditions. Taken together, our findings show early emotional effects in the absence of any facial expression. Specific low-level frequency information seems to increase P1 amplitudes which thus might have implications for the interpretation of very early sensory emotional expression effects.

However, recent work, using a visual analogue scaling (VAS) task, suggests that some listeners show more categorical performance, leading to less flexible cue integration and poorer recovery from misperceptions (Kapnoula et al., 2017, 2021). We asked how individual differences in speech gradiency can be reconciled with the well-established gradiency in the modal listener, showing how VAS performance relates to both Visual World Paradigm and EEG measures of gradiency. We also investigated three potential sources of these individual differences: inhibitory control; lexical inhibition; and early cue encoding. We used the N1 ERP component to track pre-categorical encoding of Voice Onset Time (VOT). The N1 linearly tracked VOT, reflecting a fundamentally gradient speech perception; however, for less gradient listeners, this linearity was disrupted near the boundary. Thus, while all listeners are gradient, they may show idiosyncratic encoding of specific cues, affecting downstream processing.

Not only do such signals enable detailed investigations of the neural implementation of the decision-making process but they also can expose key elements of the brain's decision algorithms. For a long time, such signals were only accessible through direct animal brain recordings, and progress in human neuroscience was hampered by the limitations of noninvasive recording techniques. However, recent methodological advances are increasingly enabling the study of human brain signals that finely trace the dynamics of the unfolding decision process. In this review, we highlight how human neurophysiological data are now being leveraged to furnish new insights into the multiple processing levels involved in forming decisions, to inform the construction and evaluation of mathematical models that can explain intra- and interindividual differences, and to examine how key ancillary processes interact with core decision circuits.

The current research examined the hypothesis that residential mobility plays a crucial role in racial in-group bias in empathy (RIBE) with three studies. By manipulating the residential mobility/stability mindset and measuring subjective pain intensity ratings (Study 1) and event-related potentials (ERPs, Study 2) of Chinese adults on painful and neutral expressions of Asian and Caucasian faces, we found that the RIBE in subjective ratings and N1 amplitudes increased and P3 amplitudes decreased in the stability group. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) manipulation in Study 3 further found that anodal stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) increased the RIBE of participants with residential stability experience but had no effect on those with residential mobility experience. As residential mobility continues to increase worldwide, we may observe concomitant changes in racial intergroup relationships.

It is used to convey feelings and thoughts and aids in forming and maintaining social bonds throughout life. When we view others giving or receiving social touch, we automatically convert the sight of touch between others into an internal representation of touch and thus recognize, to some extent, what the other person is feeling. Nevertheless, the mechanisms through which this process occurs are just beginning to be elucidated. Here, we review the neural correlates that underpin observed touch perception, we discuss deficits in this ability in several psychopathologies and we review developmental studies that tackle this ability in the very early stages of infancy.

Effect of Handwriting on Visual Word Recognition in Chinese Bilingual Children and Adults	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						handwriting; embodied cognition; N170; laterality; plasticity	EARLY ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE; TIME-COURSE; BRAIN ACTIVITY; EXPERTISE; ERP; PERCEPTION; EXPERIENCE; N170; ACTIVATION; CHARACTERS	In a digital era that neglects handwriting, the current study is significant because it examines the mechanisms underlying this process. We recruited 9- to 10-year-old Chinese children (n = 24), who were at an important period of handwriting development, and adult college students (n = 24), for both behavioral and electroencephalogram (EEG) experiments. We designed four learning conditions: handwriting Chinese (HC), viewing Chinese (VC), drawing shapes followed by Chinese recognition (DC), and drawing shapes followed by English recognition (DE). Both behavioral and EEG results showed that HC facilitated visual word recognition compared to VC, and behavioral results showed that HC facilitated visual word recognition compared to drawing shapes. HC and VC resulted in a lateralization of the N170 in adults, but not in children. Taken together, the results of the study suggest benefits of handwriting on the neural processing and behavioral performance in response to Chinese characters. The study results argue for maintaining handwriting practices to promote the perception of visual word forms in the digital age.

In this study, we investigated a novel functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based frontoparietal functional connectivity (FC) neurofeedback training paradigm related to working memory, involving healthy adults. Compared with conventional cognitive training studies, we chose the frontoparietal network, a key brain region for cognitive function modulation, as neurofeedback, yielding a strong targeting effect. In the experiment, 10 participants (test group) received three cognitive training sessions of 15 min using fNIRS-based frontoparietal FC as neurofeedback, and another 10 participants served as the control group. Frontoparietal FC was significantly increased in the test group (p =0.03), and the cognitive functions (memory and attention) were significantly promoted compared with the control group (accuracy of 3-back test: p =0.0005, reaction time of 3-back test: p =0.0009). After additional validations on long-term training effect and on different patient populations, the proposed method exhibited considerable potential to be developed as a fast, effective, and widespread training approach for cognitive function enhancement.

The relation between depression and cognitive impairment is complex. The objective of this article is to review recent literature on cognitive impairment in older adults with depression and provide clinicians an update. Methods: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Psych Info for the articles published in the English language related to late-life depression (LLD)/geriatric depression and cognitive impairment. We considered original research articles, relevant systematic reviews, chapters, and important conceptual articles published in the last 9 years (2011-2019). We selected relevant articles for this narrative review. Conclusion: The concept pseudodementia, indicating depression with cognitive impairment mimicking dementia, is now seen only as a historical concept. The current literature strongly agrees with fact that cognitive deficits often exist in LLD. The cognitive deficits in depression were initially seen as trait marker; however, some recent studies suggest that cognitive deficits persist even in the remission phase. There is heterogeneity among the studies in terms of the nature of the cognitive deficits, but higher number of studies reported impairment in attention and executive function. LLD with cognitive deficits is at a higher risk of progression to dementia. In older adults, depression with cognitive impairments requires a comprehensive evaluation. Electroencephalography, event-related potentials, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography, amyloid positron emission tomography, and CSF amyloid will supplement clinical evaluation in differentiating functional depressive disorder with cognitive impairment from depression with an underlying degenerative condition.

However, functional mapping of brain functions has been limited because the implantations have sparse coverage and differ greatly across individuals. Here, we developed a distributed, anatomically realistic sEEG source-modeling approach for within- and between-subject analyses. In addition to intracranial event-related potentials (iERP), we estimated the sources of high broadband gamma activity (HBBG), a putative correlate of local neural firing. Our novel approach accounted for a significant portion of the variance of the sEEG measurements in leave-one-out cross-validation. After logarithmic transformations, the sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio were linearly inversely related to the minimal distance between the brain location and electrode contacts (slope approximate to-3.6). The signa-to-noise ratio and sensitivity in the thalamus and brain stem were comparable to those locations at the vicinity of electrode contact implantation. The HGGB source estimates were remarkably consistent with analyses of intracranial-contact data. In conclusion, distributed sEEG source modeling provides a powerful neuroimaging tool, which facilitates anatomically-normalized functional mapping of human brain using both iERP and HBBG data.

The key distinguishing features of this work are: (1) our cBCIs combine behavioural, physiological and neural data in such a way as to be able to provide a group decision at any time after the quickest team member casts their vote, but the quality of a cBCI-assisted decision improves monotonically the longer the group decision can wait; (2) we apply our cBCIs to two realistic scenarios of military relevance (patrolling a dark corridor and manning an outpost at night where users need to identify any unidentified characters that appear) in which decisions are based on information conveyed through video feeds; and (3) our cBCIs exploit Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) elicited in brain activity by the appearance of potential threats but, uniquely, the appearance time is estimated automatically by the system (rather than being unrealistically provided to it). As a result of these elements, in the two test environments, groups assisted by our cBCIs make both more accurate and faster decisions than when individual decisions are integrated in more traditional manners.

Here, we examined the temporal brain dynamics of explicit verbal associative learning between unfamiliar items. In the first experiment, 25 adults learned object-pseudoword associations during a 5-day training program allowing us to track the N400 dynamics across learning blocks within and across days. Successful learning was accompanied by an initial frontal N400 that decreased in amplitude across blocks during the first day and shifted to parietal sites during the last training day. In Experiment 2, we replicated our findings with 38 new participants randomly assigned to a consistent learning or an inconsistent learning group. The N400 amplitude modulations that we found, both within and between learning sessions, are taken to reflect the emergence of novel lexical traces even when learning concerns items for which no semantic information is provided. The shift in N400 topography suggests that different N400 neural generators may contribute to specific word learning steps through a balance between domain-general and language-specific mechanisms.

The cortico-caudate-thalamic circuit involving the pre-Supplementary Motor Area (pre-SMA) has been proposed to underlie verbal retrieval functions. We hypothesized that High Definition-transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (HD-tDCS) targeting the pre-SMA would selectively modulate this circuit to remediate verbal retrieval deficits. After the patient underwent 10 sessions of 20 min of 1 mA HD-tDCS targeting the pre-SMA, we documented significant improvements for verbal fluency and naming, and for working memory and executive function tasks that involve the frontal lobes. The effects persisted for up to 14 weeks after completion of HD-tDCS treatment. We also demonstrated normalization of the event-related potentials suggesting modulation of the underlying neural circuit. Our study implicates that region-specific non-invasive brain stimulation, such as HD-tDCS, serves as a potential individualized therapeutic tool to treat cognitive deficits by inducing longer-lasting neuroplasticity even in the chronic phase of TBI.

However, how we retrieve real-life routine episodes and how the retrieval of these episodes changes with the passage of time remain unclear. Here, we asked participants to use a wearable camera that auto-matically captured pictures to record instances during a week of their routine life and implemented a deep neural network-based algorithm to identify picture sequences that represented episodic events. We then asked each participant to return to the lab to retrieve AMs for single episodes cued by the selected pictures 1 week, 2 weeks and 6-14 months after encoding while scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded. We found that participants were more accurate in recognizing pictured scenes depicting their own past than pictured scenes encoded in the lab, and that memory recollection of personally experienced events rapidly decreased with the passing of time. We also found that the retrieval of real-life picture cues elicited a strong and positive 'ERP old/new effect' over frontal regions and that the magnitude of this ERP effect was similar throughout memory tests over time. However, we observed that recognition memory induced a frontal theta power decrease and that this effect was mostly seen when memories were tested after 1 and 2 weeks but not after 6-14 months from encoding. Altogether, we discuss the implications for neuroscientific accounts of episodic retrieval and the potential benefits of developing individual-based AM exploration strategies at the clinical level.

The underlying neurophysiology is often studied by having observers view pictures varying in affective content. It has been shown that viewing emotionally engaging, compared with neutral, pictures (1) heightens blood flow in limbic, frontoparietal, and anterior visual structures and (2) enhances the late positive event-related potential (LPP). The role of retinotopic visual cortex in this process has, however, been contentious, with competing theories predicting the presence versus absence of emotion-specific signals in retinotopic visual areas. Recording simultaneous electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging while observers viewed pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral affective pictures, and applying multivariate pattern analysis, we found that (1) unpleasant versus neutral and pleasant versus neutral decoding accuracy were well above chance level in retinotopic visual areas, (2) decoding accuracy in ventral visual cortex (VVC), but not in early or dorsal visual cortex, was correlated with LPP, and (3) effective connectivity from amygdala to VVC predicted unpleasant versus neutral decoding accuracy, whereas effective connectivity from ventral frontal cortex to VVC predicted pleasant versus neutral decoding accuracy. These results suggest that affective scenes evoke valence-specific neural representations in retinotopic visual cortex and that these representations are influenced by reentry signals from anterior brain regions.

Sensing and seeing associated with overlapping occipitoparietal activation in simultaneous EEG-fMRI	NEUROSCIENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS			English	Article						EEG-fMRI; change blindness; sensing; conscious awareness	POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; PREDICTS INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; CHANGE BLINDNESS; VISUAL-ATTENTION; COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; CONSCIOUS PERCEPTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; NEURAL ACTIVITY	The presence of a change in a visual scene can influence brain activity and behavior, even in the absence of full conscious report. It may be possible for us to sense that such a change has occurred, even if we cannot specify exactly where or what it was. Despite existing evidence from electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye-tracking data, it is still unclear how this partial level of awareness relates to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activation. Using EEG, fMRI, and a change blindness paradigm, we found multi-modal evidence to suggest that sensing a change is distinguishable from being blind to it. Specifically, trials during which participants could detect the presence of a colour change but not identify the location of the change (sense trials), were compared to those where participants could both detect and localise the change (localise or see trials), as well as change blind trials. In EEG, late parietal positivity and N2 amplitudes were larger for localised changes only, when compared to change blindness. However, ERP-informed fMRI analysis found no voxels with activation that significantly co-varied with fluctuations in single-trial late positivity amplitudes. In fMRI, a range of visual (BA17,18), parietal (BA7,40), and mid-brain (anterior cingulate, BA24) areas showed increased fMRI BOLD activation when a change was sensed, compared to change blindness. These visual and parietal areas are commonly implicated as the storage sites of visual working memory, and we therefore argue that sensing may not be explained by a lack of stored representation of the visual display. Both seeing and sensing a change were associated with an overlapping occipitoparietal network of activation when compared to blind trials, suggesting that the quality of the visual representation, rather than the lack of one, may result in partial awareness during the change blindness paradigm.

Deficiency in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; an omega-3 fatty acid) is implicated in aggression and callous-unemotional (CU) traits, however, its relationship to the VIM remains unknown. Two studies tested relationships between EPA intake, personality (aggression, CU traits), and electrophysiological indices of the VIM. In study one (N = 98), participants completed omega-3 intake (FFQ), CU traits (ICU), and aggression (BPAQ) measures. Physical aggression correlated positively with callousness and negatively with EPA intake. CU traits were unrelated to EPA. In study two (N = 47), participants completed the same measures and an electroencephalography assessment of VIM. Stop-P300 amplitude (motor inhibition success) in response to facial expressions of distress mediated the relationship between EPA intake and physical aggression. This is the first demonstration of an association between EPA intake and electroencephalographic indices of the VIM. Findings support a role of EPA in regulating aggression through networks involved in distress-cued executive control over behavior; and provide supporting data to direct future trial designs for nutritional supplementation in non-clinical, clinical and forensic arenas.

However, if extensive L2 experience leads to neuroplastic changes in the phonological system, then the capacity to discriminate non-native phonemic contrasts should progressively improve. Such perceptual changes should be attested by modifications at the neurophysiological level. We designed an EEG experiment in which the listeners? perceptual capacities to discriminate second language phonemic contrasts influence the processing of lexical-semantic violations. Semantic congruency of critical words in a sentence context was driven by a phonemic contrast that was unique to the L2, English (e.g.,/?/-/i:/, ship ? sheep). Twenty-eight young adult native speakers of French with intermediate proficiency in English listened to sentences that contained either a semantically congruent or incongruent critical word (e.g., The anchor of the ship/*sheep was let down) while EEG was recorded. Three ERP effects were found to relate to increasing L2 proficiency: (1) a left frontal auditory N100 effect, (2) a smaller fronto-central phonological mismatch negativity (PMN) effect and (3) a semantic N400 effect. No effect of proficiency was found on oscillatory markers. The current findings suggest that neuronal plasticity in the human brain allows for the late acquisition of even hard-wired linguistic features such as the discrimination of phonemic contrasts in a second language. This is the first time that behavioral and neurophysiological evidence for the critical role of neural plasticity underlying L2 phonological processing and its interdependence with semantic processing has been provided. Our data strongly support the idea that pieces of information from different levels of linguistic processing (e.g., phonological, semantic) strongly interact and influence each other during online language processing.

Does feedback based on FES-evoked nociceptive withdrawal reflex condition event-related desynchronization? An exploratory study with brain-computer interfaces	BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS & ENGINEERING EXPRESS			English	Article						brain computer interface; nociceptive stimuli; functional electrical stimulation; event related desynchronization; nociceptive withdrawal reflex	FUNCTIONAL ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; MOTOR IMAGERY; STROKE REHABILITATION; MACHINE INTERFACE; LOWER-LIMB; BCI; MODULATION; ALGORITHMS; RHYTHMS; PROOF	Introduction. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) is used in brain-computer interfaces (BCI) to detect the user's motor intention (MI) and convert it into a command for an actuator to provide sensory feedback or mobility, for example by means of functional electrical stimulation (FES). Recent studies have proposed to evoke the nociceptive withdrawal reflex (NWR) using FES, in order to evoke synergistic movements of the lower limb and to facilitate the gait rehabilitation of stroke patients. The use of NWR to provide sensorimotor feedback in ERD-based BCI is novel; thererfore, the conditioning effect that nociceptive stimuli might have on MI is still unknown. Objetive. To assess the ERD produced during the MI after FES-evoked NWR, in order to evaluate if nociceptive stimuli condition subsequent ERDs. Methods. Data from 528 electroencephalography trials of 8 healthy volunteers were recorded and analyzed. Volunteers used an ERD-based BCI, which provided two types of feedback: intrisic by the FES-evoked NWR and extrinsic by virtual reality. The electromyogram of the tibialis anterior muscle was also recorded. The main outcome variables were the normalized root mean square of the evoked electromyogram (RMS (norm) ), the average electroencephalogram amplitude at the ERD frequency during MI ((A) over bar (MI)) and the percentage decrease of (A) over bar (MI) relative to rest (ERD% <i ) at the first MI subsequent to the activation of the BCI. Results. No evidence of changes of the RMS (norm) on both the <(A)over bar>(MI) (p = 0.663) and the ERD% <i (p = 0.252) of the subsequent MI was detected. A main effect of the type of feedback was found in the subsequent <(A)over bar>(MI) (p < 0.001), with intrinsic feedback resulting in a larger A over bar MI. Conclusions. No evidence of ERD conditioning was observed using BCI feedback based on FES-evoked NWR . Significance. FES-evoked NWR could constitute a potential feedback modality in an ERD-based BCI to facilitate motor recovery of stroke people.	[Tabernig, Carolina B.; Carrere, L.

J	Pegg, S; Arfer, KB; Kujawa, A				Pegg, Samantha; Arfer, Kodi B.; Kujawa, Autumn			Altered reward responsiveness and depressive symptoms: An examination of social and monetary reward domains and interactions with rejection sensitivity	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						Reward; Event-related potentials; Neurophysiology; Depression; Rejection sensitivity		Background: Alterations in positive valence systems and social processes, including low reward responsiveness and high rejection sensitivity, have been observed in depression. Most reward research focuses on the monetary domain, but social reward responsiveness may be particularly relevant to understanding the etiology of depression, especially in combination with other social processes. Pathways to depression are complex, and research testing interactions between multiple factors is needed. The present study examined the interactive effects of reward responsiveness and rejection sensitivity on depressive symptoms using both social and monetary reward electroencephalogram (EEG) tasks. Methods: Emerging adults (N = 120) completed peer interaction and monetary incentive delay tasks while EEG data were recorded, as well as self-report measures of rejection sensitivity and depressive symptoms. Results: The interaction between social reward responsiveness and self-reported rejection sensitivity was significantly associated with depressive symptoms, such that rejection sensitivity was associated with greater depressive symptoms for those with a relatively reduced response to social reward. The interaction between monetary reward responsiveness and rejection sensitivity was not significant. Limitations: The study was cross-sectional and used a non-clinical sample. Conclusions: Results suggest a possible pathway for depressive symptoms characterized by the combination of high rejection sensitivity and low social reward responsiveness. Findings highlight the need for consideration of multiple domains of reward responsiveness in clinical neuroscience research. With extension to longitudinal studies and clinical samples, the present findings may inform understanding of targets for intervention.

S.; Quirk, Colin; Vogel, Edward K.; Awh, Edward			Estimating the statistical power to detect set-size effects in contralateral delay activity	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						contralateral delay activity; EEG; ERPs; statistical power; visual working memory		The contralateral delay activity (CDA) is an event-related potential component commonly used to examine the online processes of visual working memory. Here, we provide a robust analysis of the statistical power that is needed to achieve reliable and reproducible results with the CDA. Using two very large EEG datasets that examined the contrast between CDA amplitude with set sizes 2 and 6 items and set sizes 2 and 4 items, we present a subsampling analysis that estimates the statistical power achieved with varying numbers of subjects and trials based on the proportion of significant tests in 10,000 iterations. We also generated simulated data using Bayesian multilevel modeling to estimate power beyond the bounds of the original datasets. The number of trials and subjects required depends critically on the effect size. Detecting the presence of the CDA-a reliable difference between contralateral and ipsilateral electrodes during the memory period-required only 30-50 clean trials with a sample of 25 subjects to achieve approximately 80% statistical power. However, for detecting a difference in CDA amplitude between two set sizes, a substantially larger number of trials and subjects were required; approximately 400 clean trials with 25 subjects to achieve 80% power. Thus, to achieve robust tests of how CDA activity differs across conditions, it is essential to be mindful of the estimated effect size. We recommend researchers designing experiments to detect set-size differences in the CDA collect substantially more trials per subject.	[Ngiam, William X.

Specifically, we presented stimuli of two tasks (primary and background task) in each trial, but participants were instructed to perform the background task only if the primary task required no response. As expected, task performance was substantially influenced by a task probability manipulation: Background task responses were faster, psychological refractory period effects were smaller, and interference from the second task (i.e., backward compatibility effects) was larger when there was a larger probability that this task required a response. Critically, stimulus-locked and response-locked LRP analyses indicate that these behavioral effects of parallel processing were not driven by background task motor processing (e.g., motoric response activation) taking place during primary task processing. Instead, the LRP results suggest that these effects were exclusively localized during premotor stages of processing (e.g., response selection). Thus, the present results generally provide evidence for multitasking accounts allowing parallel task processing during response selection, whereas the task-specific motor responses are activated in a serial manner. One plausible account is that multiple task information sources can be processed in parallel, with sharing of limited cognitive resources depending on task relevance, but a primary and still active task goal prevents motor activation related to the goals of other tasks in order to avoid outcome conflict.

The challenges in scoring hypopneas in children: is pulse wave amplitude drop the answer?	SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						Arousals; Subcortical; Autonomic; Pulse wave amplitude; Pediatric polysomnogram; Obstructive sleep apnea	SLEEP-APNEA SYNDROME; RESPIRATORY EVENTS; AROUSAL RESPONSES; TRANSIT-TIME; SURROGATE; MARKERS; MICROAROUSALS; REDUCTION	Background: Identifying electroencephalogram (EEG) cortical arousals are crucial in scoring hypopneas and respiratory efforts related arousals (RERAs) during a polysomnogram. As children have high arousal threshold, many of the flow limited breaths or hypopneas may not be associated with visual EEG arousals, hence this may lead to potential underestimation of the degree of sleep disordered breathing. Pulse wave amplitude (PWA) is a signal obtained from finger photoplethysmography which correlates directly to finger blood flow. The drop in PWA has been shown to be a sensitive marker for subcortical/autonomic and cortical arousals. Our aim was to use the drop in PWA as a surrogate for arousals to guide scoring of respiratory events in pediatric patients. Methods: Ten polysomnograms for patients between the ages of 5-15 years who had obstructive apneahypopnea indices between 1 and 5 events/hour were identified. Patients with syndromes were excluded. A drop in PWA signal of at least 30% that lasted for 3 s was needed to identify subcortical/autonomic arousals. Arousals were rescored based on this criteria and subsequently respiratory events were rescored. Paired t-tests were employed to compare PSG indices scored with or without PWA incorporation. Results: The sample of 10 children included 2 females, and the average age was 9.8 +/- 3.1 years. Overall, polysomnography revealed an average total sleep time of 464.1 +/- 25 min, sleep efficiency of 92% +/-4.2, sleep latency of 19.6 +/- 17.0 min, rapid eye movement (REM) latency 143 +/- 66 min, N1 3.9% +/-2.0, N2 50.3% +/-12.0, N3 28.2% +/-9.1, REM 16.7% +/-4.0, and wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO) 18.1 +/- 7.5 min. Including arousals from PWA changes, respiratory indices significantly increased including total AHI (2.3 +/- 0.7 vs 5.7 +/- 2.1, p < 0.001), obstructive AHI (1.45 +/- 0.7 vs 4.8 +/- 1.8, p < 0.001), and RDI (2.36 +/- 0.7 vs 7.6 +/- 2.0, p < 0.001). Likewise, total arousal index was significantly higher (8.7 +/- 2.3 vs 29.4 +/- 6.5, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The drop in pulse wave amplitude signal is a useful marker to guide scoring arousals that are not otherwise easily identified in pediatric polysomnography and subsequently helped in scoring respiratory events that otherwise would not be scored. Further studies are needed to delineate if such methodology would affect clinical outcome. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ensemble Statistics Can Be Available before Individual Item Properties: Electroencephalography Evidence Using the Oddball Paradigm	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							VISUAL WORKING-MEMORY; MEAN EMOTION; ATTENTION; REPRESENTATION; FEATURES; P300; PERCEPTION; DYNAMICS; TOOLBOX; LATENCY	Behavioral studies have shown that statistical properties of object groups are perceived accurately with brief exposure durations. This finding motivated the hypothesis that ensemble perception occurs rapidly in vision. However, the precise timing of ensemble perception remains unclear. Here, we used the superior temporal resolution of electroencephalography to directly compare the timing of ensemble processing to that of individual object processing. The P3b was chosen as a particular component of interest, as it is thought to measure the latency of stimulus evaluation. Participants performed a simple "oddball" task in which sets of 51 lines with varied orientations sequentially flashed briefly on the display. In these sequences, there was a 20% chance of an individual oddball, wherein one marked object tilted clockwise, and a 20% chance of an ensemble oddball, wherein the average orientation of the set tilted clockwise. In counterbalanced blocks, participants were instructed to respond to either individual or ensemble oddballs. ERP analysis was performed to test the timing of this processing. At parietal electrodes, P3b components were found for both individual and ensemble oddballs. Ensemble P3b components were found to occur significantly earlier than individual P3b components, as measured with both 50% area latency and 50% onset latency. Using multivariate pattern analysis, ensemble oddball trials were classifiable from standard trials significantly earlier in their timecourse than individual oddball trials. Altogether, these results provide compelling evidence that ensemble perception occurs rapidly and that ensemble properties can be available earlier than individual object properties.

The time course of speaker-specific language processing	CORTEX			English	Article						Speaker identity; Language use; Syntax; Prediction; ERP	COMPREHENSION; REVEAL; PREDICTION; GENDER; ERROR; STYLE; P600	Listeners are sensitive to a speaker's individual language use and generate expectations for particular speakers. It is unclear, however, how such expectations affect online language processing. In the present EEG study, we presented thirty-two participants with auditory sentence stimuli of two speakers. Speakers differed in their use of two particular syntactic structures, easy subject-initial SOV structures and more difficult object-initial OSV structures. One speaker, the SOV-Speaker, had a high proportion of SOV sentences (75%) and a low proportion of OSV sentences (25%), and vice-versa for the OSV-Speaker. Participants were exposed to the speakers' individual language use in a training session followed by a test session on the consecutive day. ERP-results show that early stages of sentence processing are driven by syntactic processing only and are unaffected by speaker-specific expectations. In a late stage, however, an interaction between speaker and syntax information was observed. For the SOV-Speaker condition, the classical P600-effect reflected the effort of processing difficult and unexpected sentence structures. For the OSV-Speaker condition, both structures elicited different responses on frontal electrodes, possibly indexing effort to switch from a local speaker model to a global model of language use. Overall, the study identifies distinct neural mechanisms related to speaker-specific expectations. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Kroczek, Leon O.

On the other hand, mammalian sleep is also characterized by the interplay between periods of increased sleep depth and environmental alertness. Whereas the heterogeneity of microstates during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep was extensively studied in the last decades, transient microstates during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep received less attention. REM sleep features two distinct microstates: phasic and tonic. Previous studies indicate that sensory processing is largely diminished during phasic REM periods, whereas environmental alertness is partially reinstated when the brain switches into tonic REM sleep. Here, we investigated interoceptive processing as quantified by the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP) during REM microstates. We contrasted the HEPs of phasic and tonic REM periods using two separate databases that included the nighttime polysomnographic recordings of healthy young individuals (N = 20 and N = 19). We find a differential HEP modulation of a late HEP component (after 500 ms post-R-peak) between tonic and phasic REM. Moreover, the late tonic HEP component resembled the HEP found in resting wakefulness. Our results indicate that interoception with respect to cardiac signals is not uniform across REM microstates, and suggest that interoceptive processing is partially reinstated during tonic REM periods. The analyses of the HEP during REM sleep may shed new light on the organization and putative function of REM microstates.

The aim of the present study was to characterize a sample of HIP children (n: 16; M/F: 14/2; median age: 10 years) in comparison to those with HFA (n: 17; M/F: 16/1; median age: 13 years) and to neurotypically developed (NTD) children (n: 10; M/F: 4/6; median age: 11 years) from a clinical and neurophysiological perspective. Specifically, a standardized clinical assessment of cognitive and adaptive skills, autistic symptoms, executive functions and behavioral features was performed. Moreover, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded, referring specifically to the mismatch negativity (MMN) and P300 paradigm. Our data highlighted the presence of similarities between the intellectually gifted individuals and the ones with autism (i.e., a nonhomogeneous intellective profile, an adaptive skills impairment, subthreshold autistic symptoms and increased perfectionism). Interestingly, a distinct neurophysiological characterization between groups came out, with evidence of a reduced MMN amplitude only in the HFA group. Furthermore, no differences within groups in the P300 component emerged. Therefore, our results start to provide a more informative characterization of the HIP phenotype in comparison to those of HFA and NTD, highlighting the potential role of the MMN amplitude index in helping clinicians and researchers to distinguish between HIP and HFA. Nevertheless, further research on the topic is strongly needed.

Dividing attention influences contextual facilitation and revision during language comprehension	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Language; Attention; Prediction; EEG	VISUAL WORD RECOGNITION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; SENTENCE CONTEXT; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; PROCESSING EVIDENCE; IMPAIRED CHILDREN; N400 COMPONENT; PREDICTION; BRAIN	Although we often seem to successfully comprehend language in the face of distraction, few studies have examined the role of sustained attention in critical components of sentence processing, such as integrating information over a sentence and revising predictions when unexpected information is encountered. The current study investigated the impact of attention on sentence processing using a novel dual-task paradigm. Participants read weakly and strongly constraining sentences with expected or unexpected endings while also tracking the motion of dots in the background, and their EEG was recorded. Under full attention, the amplitude of the N400 component of the ERP, a measure of semantic access, was reduced (facilitated) in a graded fashion by contextual strength and fit. This context-based facilitation was attenuated when attention was divided, suggesting that sustained attention is important for building up message-level representations. In contrast, the post-N400 frontal positivity that has been observed to prediction violations and associated with revision processes was unaffected by dividing attention. However, under divided attention, participants also elicited posteriorly-distributed effects to these violations. Thus, predictive processes seem to be engaged even when attention is divided, but additional resources may then be required to process unexpected information.

However, there is a growing interest in its temporal sensitivity. This is despite the temporal blurring of neuronal events by the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal, the peak of which lags neuronal firing by 4-6 seconds. Given this, the goal of this review is to answer a seemingly simple question - "What are the benefits of increased temporal sampling for fMRI?". To answer this, we have combined fMRI data collected at multiple temporal scales, from 323 to 1000 milliseconds, with a review of both historical and contemporary temporal literature. After a brief discussion of technological developments that have rekindled interest in temporal research, we next consider the potential statistical and methodological benefits. Most importantly, we explore how fast fMRI can uncover previously unobserved neuro-temporal dynamics - effects that are entirely missed when sampling at conventional 1 to 2 second rates. With the intrinsic link between space and time in fMRI, this temporal renaissance also delivers improvements in spatial precision. Far from producing only statistical gains, the array of benefits suggest that the continued temporal work is worth the effort.

Thirty-six 18-30 years adults were recruited to perform a 20-min bout of HIIT, MICE, and rest on separate days in counterbalanced order. Following interventions, frontal alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) was measured during a modified Sternberg task requiring varying amounts of working memory (3-, 5-, 7-letter tasks). Behavioral analyses showed a condition effect, indicating shorter response times following HIIT compared to rest. Analysis of frontal alpha ERD showed an interaction of condition and task, indicating no differences across tasks following rest but a task effect following HIIT and MICE, with frontal alpha ERD increasing in the 7-letter task compared with the 3-letter task. Following HIIT, this task-related contrast of frontal alpha ERD extended to the time period when memory retrieval occurred. Although both HIIT and MICE resulted in alterations in neuroelectric underpinnings of memory encoding and retention in response to increased memory load, only HIIT enhanced the processing speed and brain activation during memory retrieval. These findings provide evidence for potential applications of exercise to enhance working memory and the role of exercise type to such effect.

We addressed this question with a randomized controlled trial investigating the changes in behavior and electrical neuroimaging activity induced by a 3-week adaptive gamified Go/NoGo inhibitory control training (ICT). Performance improvements were accompanied by the development of more impulsive response strategies, but did not generalize to impulsivity traits nor quality of life. As compared with a 2-back working-memory training, the ICT in the older adults resulted in a purely quantitative reduction in the strength of the activity in a medial and ventrolateral prefrontal network over the 400 ms P3 inhibition-related event-related potentials component. However, as compared with young adults, the ICT induced distinct configurational modifications in older adults' 200 ms N2 conflict monitoring medial-frontal functional network. Hence, while older populations show preserved capacities for training-induced plasticity in executive control, aging interacts with the underlying plastic brain mechanisms. Training improves the efficiency of the inhibition process in older adults, but its effects differ from those in young adults at the level of the coping with inhibition demands.

However, individuals with schizophrenia suffer from impairments in MSI, which could explain typical symptoms like hallucination and reality distortion. Because the neural correlates of aberrant MSI in schizophrenia help us understand the physiognomy of this psychiatric disorder, we performed a systematic review of the current research on this subject. The literature search concerned investigated MSI in diagnosed schizophrenia patients compared to healthy controls using brain imaging. Seventeen of 317 identified studies were finally included. To assess risk of bias, the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment was used, and the review was written according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA). The results indicated that multisensory processes in schizophrenia are associated with aberrant, mainly reduced, neural activity in several brain regions, as measured by event-related potentials, oscillations, activity and connectivity. The conclusion is that a fronto-temporal region, comprising the frontal inferior gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus/sulcus, along with the fusiform gyrus and dorsal visual stream in the occipital-parietal lobe are possible key regions of deficient MSI in schizophrenia.

We measured bottom-up and top-down attentional performance and their cerebral correlates in 18 HR (11 women, age = 22.7 years, dream recall frequency = 5.3 days with a dream recall per week) and 19 LR (10 women, age = 22.3, DRF = 0.2) using EEG and the Competitive Attention Task. Between-group differences were found in ERPs but not in behavior. The results show that HR present larger ERPs to distracting sounds than LR even during active listening, arguing for enhanced bottom-up processing of irrelevant sounds. HR also presented larger contingent negative variation during target expectancy and P3b to target sounds than LR, speaking for an enhanced recruitment of top-down attention. The attentional balance seems preserved in HR since their performances are not altered, but possibly at a higher resource cost. In HR, increased bottom-up processes would favor dream recall through awakening facilitation during sleep and enhanced top-down processes may foster dream recall through increased awareness and/or short-term memory stability of dream content.

However, little is known about the stability over time of early neural specialization for speech and its influence on the formation of novel language representations. Here, we provide evidence that early international adoptees, who lose contact with their native language environment after adoption, retain enhanced sensitivity to a native lexical tone contrast more than 15 years after being adopted to Sweden from China, in the absence of any pretest familiarization with the stimuli. Changes in oscillatory brain activity showed how adoptees resort to inhibiting the processing of defunct phonological representations, rather than forgetting or replacing them with new ones. Furthermore, neurophysiological responses to native and nonnative contrasts were not negatively correlated, suggesting that native language retention does not interfere with the acquisition of adoptive phonology acquisition. These results suggest that early language experience provides strikingly resilient specialization for speech which is compensated for through inhibitory control mechanisms as learning conditions change later in life.

A Case-Study in Neuromarketing Field	SENSORS			English	Article						applied neurosciences; EEG; HR; GSR; sample size; signal processing	EEG ALPHA; RECOMMENDATIONS; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; WORKLOAD; DYNAMICS; POWER; ERP	The sample size is a crucial concern in scientific research and even more in behavioural neurosciences, where besides the best practice it is not always possible to reach large experimental samples. In this study we investigated how the outcomes of research change in response to sample size reduction. Three indices computed during a task involving the observations of four videos were considered in the analysis, two related to the brain electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and one to autonomic physiological measures, i.e., heart rate and skin conductance. The modifications of these indices were investigated considering five subgroups of sample size (32, 28, 24, 20, 16), each subgroup consisting of 630 different combinations made by bootstrapping n (n = sample size) out of 36 subjects, with respect to the total population (i.e., 36 subjects). The correlation analysis, the mean squared error (MSE), and the standard deviation (STD) of the indexes were studied at the participant reduction and three factors of influence were considered in the analysis: the type of index, the task, and its duration (time length). The findings showed a significant decrease of the correlation associated to the participant reduction as well as a significant increase of MSE and STD (p < 0.05). A threshold of subjects for which the outcomes remained significant and comparable was pointed out. The effects were to some extents sensitive to all the investigated variables, but the main effect was due to the task length. Therefore, the minimum threshold of subjects for which the outcomes were comparable increased at the reduction of the spot duration.

Correct response negativity may reflect subjective value of reaction time under regulatory fit in a speed-rewarded task	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; ERPs; Error Processing; Individual Differences; Motivation	MEDIAL FRONTAL NEGATIVITY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ERROR NEGATIVITY; ERP COMPONENTS; PERFORMANCE; INFORMATION; GAMIFICATION; RELIABILITY; PREVENTION	Error-related negativity (ERN), an electroencephalogram (EEG) component following an erroneous response, has been associated with the subjective motivational relevance of error commission. A smaller EEG event, the correct response negativity (CRN), occurs after a correct response. It is unclear why correct behavior evokes a neural response similar to error commission. CRN might reflect suboptimal performance: in tasks where speed is motivationally relevant (i.e., incentivized), a correct but slow response may be experienced as a minor error. The literature is mixed on the relationship between CRN and response time (RT), possibly due to different motivational structures, tasks, or individual traits. We examined ERN and CRN in a go/no-go task where correctness and speed were encouraged using a points-based feedback system. A key individual trait, regulatory focus, describes a person's tendency to seek gains (promotion focus) and avoid losses (prevention focus). Trait regulatory focus was measured, and participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: points gain, points loss, and informative-only feedback. Participants committed too few errors to reliably model ERN effects. CRN amplitude related to RT in all feedback conditions, with slower responses having larger CRN. Participants with stronger promotion focus had a more exaggerated RT/CRN relationship in the point gain condition, suggesting that regulatory fit influences the motivational relevance of speed and thus the negative subjective experience and CRN for slower responses. These findings are consistent with the claim that CRN reflects RT when RT is motivationally relevant and that the CRN/RT relationship reflects the degree of subjective motivational relevance.

The purpose of the current study was to evaluate whether the discrimination of Same (matched) and Different (unmatched) syllable pairs elicit different patterns of sensorimotor activity as stimuli are processed in working memory. Raw EEG data recorded from 42 participants were decomposed with independent component analysis to identify bilateral sensorimotor mu rhythms from 36 subjects. Time frequency decomposition of mu rhythms revealed concurrent event related desynchronization (ERD) in alpha and beta frequency bands across the peri- and post-stimulus time periods, which were interpreted as evidence of sensorimotor contributions to working memory encoding and maintenance. Left hemisphere alpha/beta ERD was stronger in Different trials than Same trials during the post-stimulus period, while right hemisphere alpha/beta ERD was stronger in Same trials than Different trials. A between-hemispheres contrast revealed no differences during Same trials, while post-stimulus alpha/beta ERD was stronger in the left hemisphere than the right during Different trials. Results were interpreted to suggest that predictive coding mechanisms lead to repetition suppression effects in Same trials. Mismatches arising from predictive coding mechanisms in Different trials shift subsequent working memory processing to the speech-dominant left hemisphere. Findings clarify how sensorimotor activity differentially supports working memory encoding and maintenance stages during speech discrimination tasks and have potential to inform sensorimotor models of speech perception and working memory.

This paper extends the theory and practice of SBL in three important ways. First, we reformulate three existing SBL algorithms under the majorization-minimization (MM) framework. This unification perspective not only provides a useful theoretical framework for comparing different algorithms in terms of their convergence behavior, but also provides a principled recipe for constructing novel algorithms with specific properties by designing appropriate bounds of the Bayesian marginal likelihood function. Second, building on the MM principle, we propose a novel method called LowSNR-BSI that achieves favorable source reconstruction performance in low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) settings. Third, precise knowledge of the noise level is a crucial requirement for accurate source reconstruction. Here we present a novel principled technique to accurately learn the noise variance from the data either jointly within the source reconstruction procedure or using one of two proposed cross-validation strategies. Empirically, we could show that the monotonous convergence behavior predicted from MM theory is confirmed in numerical experiments. Using simulations, we further demonstrate the advantage of LowSNR-BSI over conventional SBL in low-SNR regimes, and the advantage of learned noise levels over estimates derived from baseline data. To demonstrate the usefulness of our novel approach, we show neurophysiologically plausible source reconstructions on averaged auditory evoked potential data.

Chronic intermittent ethanol during adolescence and adulthood alters dendritic spines in the primary motor and visual cortex in rats	ALCOHOL			English	Article						Adolescence; Alcohol; Dendrites; Motor cortex; Sleep; Spines; Visual cortex	EVENT-RELATED OSCILLATIONS; ALCOHOL EXPOSURE; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; SLEEP QUALITY; EEG POWER; THETA EEG; PLASTICITY; NEURONS; BRAIN; DENSITY	Prolonged adolescent binge drinking can disrupt sleep quality and increase the likelihood of alcohol induced sleep disruptions in young adulthood in rodents and in humans. Striking changes in spine density and morphology have been seen in many cortical and subcortical regions after adolescent alcohol exposure in rats. However, there is little known about the impact of alcohol exposure on dendritic spines in the same motor and sensory cortices that EEG sleep is typically recorded from in rats. The aim of this study is to investigate whether an established model of chronic intermittent ethanol vapor in rats that has been demonstrated to disrupt sleep during adolescence or adulthood, also significantly alters cortical dendritic spine density and morphology. To this end, adolescent and adult Wistar rats were exposed to 5 weeks of ethanol vapor or control air exposure. After a 13-day withdrawal, primary motor cortex (M1) and primary/secondary visual cortex (V1/V2) layer V dendrites were analyzed for differences in spine density and morphology. Spines were classified into four categories (stubby, long, filopodia, and mushroom) based on the spine length and the width of the spine head and neck. The main results indicate an age-specific effect of adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure decreasing spine density in the M1 cortex compared to age-matched controls. Reductions in the density of M1 long-shaped spine subclassifications were seen in adolescent ethanol-exposed rats, but not adult-exposed rats, compared to their air-controls. Irrespective of age, there was an overall reduction produced by ethanol exposure on the density of filopodia and the length of long-shaped spines in V1/V2 cortex as compared to their air exposed controls. Together, these data add to growing evidence that some cortical circuits are vulnerable to the effects of alcohol during adolescence and begin to elucidate potential mechanisms that may influence brain plasticity following early alcohol use.

Developmental changes in auditory-evoked neural activity underlie infants' links between language and cognition	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						conceptual development; developmental tuning; infant cognition; infant EEG; infant ERP; language acquisition	ALPHA DESYNCHRONIZATION; 4-MONTH-OLD INFANTS; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; EEG ALPHA; ATTENTION; WORDS; CATEGORIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; RHYTHMS; POWER	The power and precision with which humans link language to cognition is unique to our species. By 3-4 months of age, infants have already established this link: simply listening to human language facilitates infants' success in fundamental cognitive processes. Initially, this link to cognition is also engaged by a broader set of acoustic stimuli, including non-human primate vocalizations (but not other sounds, like backwards speech). But by 6 months, non-human primate vocalizations no longer confer this cognitive advantage that persists for speech. What remains unknown is the mechanism by which these sounds influence infant cognition, and how this initially broader set of privileged sounds narrows to only human speech between 4 and 6 months. Here, we recorded 4- and 6-month-olds' EEG responses to acoustic stimuli whose behavioral effects on infant object categorization have been previously established: infant-directed speech, backwards speech, and non-human primate vocalizations. We document that by 6 months, infants' 4-9 Hz neural activity is modulated in response to infant-directed speech and non-human primate vocalizations (the two stimuli that initially support categorization), but that 4-9 Hz neural activity is not modulated at either age by backward speech (an acoustic stimulus that doesn't support categorization at either age). These results advance the prior behavioral evidence to suggest that by 6 months, speech and non-human primate vocalizations elicit distinct changes in infants' cognitive state, influencing performance on foundational cognitive tasks such as object categorization.

One established framework is the "Theory of Event Coding" (TEC). However, only rarely, this framework has been used in the context of response inhibition and how stimulus-response association or binding processes modulate response inhibition performance. Particularly the neural dynamics of stimulus-response representations during inhibitory control are elusive. To address this, we examined n = 40 healthy controls and combined temporal EEG signal decomposition with source localization and temporal generalization multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). We show that overlaps in features of stimuli used to trigger either response execution or inhibition compromised task performance. According to TEC, this indicates that binding processes in event file representations impact response inhibition through partial repetition costs. In the EEG data, reconfiguration of event files modulated processes in time windows well-known to reflect distinct response inhibition mechanisms. Crucially, event file coding processes were only evident in a specific fraction of neurophysiological activity associated with the inferior parietal cortex (BA40). Within that specific fraction of neurophysiological activity, the decoding of the dynamics of event file representations using temporal generalization MVPA suggested that event file representations are stable across several hundred milliseconds, and that event file coding during inhibitory control is reflected by a sustained activation pattern of neural dynamics. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The "mental representation" of how stimulus input translate into the appropriate response is central for goal-directed behavior. However, little is known about the dynamics of such representations on the neurophysiological level when it comes to the inhibition of motor processes. This dynamic is shown in the current study.

However, access processing to visual awareness (APVA) immediately before conscious perception still remains at the earlier stage of visual sensory processing, though there is little known regarding this subject. The present study hypothesized that visual mismatch negativity (vMMN), which reflects automatic change detection at a latency of 130-250 ms, might be involved in the APVA. In a previous study, vMMN was reported to be evoked by the deviant stimulus that is not consciously perceived in binocular rivalry. To clarify whether the visual change detection affects APVA, we conducted a modified experiment of oddball paradigm on binocular rivalry. The results showed a significant correlation between enhancement of vMMN amplitude and facilitation of perceptual alternation when the unconscious deviant was presented. This implies that vMMN is relevant to the APVA, which is a novel role of vMMN. In early visual processing, the attentional mechanism associated with vMMN is suggested to play an important role in unconscious neural processing at an earlier stage of visual awareness.

Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems decode electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to establish a channel for direct interaction between the human brain and the external world without the need for muscle or nerve control. The P300 speller, one of the most widely used BCI applications, presents a selection of characters to the user and performs character recognition by identifying P300 event-related potentials from the EEG. Such P300-based BCI systems can reach good levels of accuracy but are difficult to use in day-to-day life due to redundancy and noisy signal. A room for improvement should be considered. We propose a novel hybrid feature selection method for the P300-based BCI system to address the problem of feature redundancy, which combines the Menger curvature and linear discriminant analysis. Approach. First, selected strategies are applied separately to a given dataset to estimate the gain for application to each feature. Then, each generated value set is ranked in descending order and judged by a predefined criterion to be suitable in classification models. The intersection of the two approaches is then evaluated to identify an optimal feature subset. Main results. The proposed method is evaluated using three public datasets, i.e. BCI Competition III dataset II, brain/neural computer interaction Horizon dataset, and Lausanne Federal Institute of Technology dataset. Experimental results indicate that compared with other typical feature selection and classification methods, our proposed method has better or comparable performance. Significance. Additionally, our proposed method can achieve the best classification accuracy after all epochs in three datasets. In summary, our proposed method provides a new way to enhance the performance of the P300-based BCI speller.

Neural response to monetary and social feedback demonstrates differential associations with depression and social anxiety	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						anxiety; depression; event-related potentials; reward; social	ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; VENTRAL STRIATUM; SELF-REPORT; REWARD; DISORDERS; SYMPTOMS; ANTICIPATION; NEGATIVITY; REACTIVITY	An aberrant neural response to rewards has been linked to both depression and social anxiety. Most studies have focused on the neural response to monetary rewards, and few have tested different modalities of reward (e.g. social) that are more salient to particular forms of psychopathology. In addition, most studies contain critical confounds, including contrasting positive and negative feedback and failing to disentangle being correct from obtaining positive feedback. In the present study, 204 participants underwent electroencephalography during monetary and social feedback tasks that were matched in trial structure, timing and feedback stimuli. The reward positivity (RewP) was measured in response to correctly identifying stimuli that resulted in monetary win, monetary loss, social like or social dislike feedback. All monetary and social tasks elicited a RewP, which were positively correlated. Across all tasks, the RewP was negatively associated with depression and positively associated with social anxiety. The RewP to social dislike feedback, independent of monetary and social like feedback, was also associated with social anxiety. The present study suggests that a domain-general neural response to correct feedback demonstrates a differential association with depression and social anxiety, but a domain-specific neural response to social dislike feedback is uniquely associated with social anxiety.

Previous behavioral studies have shown that handwriting on paper is more effective for learning than typing on a keyboard. However, the impact of writing with a digital pen on a tablet remains to be clarified. In the present study, we compared learning by handwriting with an ink pen on paper, handwriting with a digital pen on a tablet, and typing on a keyboard. Behavioral and electroencephalographic indices were measured immediately after learning with each writing tool. The moods of the subjects during the training were also assessed. The participants were divided according to their use of digital pen in their everyday lives, allowing us to take into account the effect of the familiarity with the digital pen on the learning process (familiar group vs. unfamiliar group). We performed an EEG experiment applying a repetition priming paradigm. In each trial, a learned foreign language word (prime word) and a mother tongue word (target word) were consecutively presented. The target word was either semantically identical to the prime word (repetitive condition) or different (non-repetitive condition). We assumed that a larger priming effect on N400 reflects larger learning progress. The familiar group showed a greater N400 priming effect for words learned with the digital or ink pen than those learned with the keyboard. The unfamiliar group showed the greater N400 priming effect for words learned with the ink pen compared with words learned by typing. In addition, positive mood during learning was significantly higher during handwriting than during typing, regardless of the groups. On the other hand, the behavioral indices were not influenced by the writing tool. These results suggest that the movements involved in handwriting allow a greater memorization of new words. The advantage of handwriting over typing might also be caused by a more positive mood during learning. Finally, our results show that handwriting with a digital pen and tablet can increase the ability to learn compared with keyboard typing once the individuals are accustomed to it.

Neurologists and sleep medicine clinicians largely rely on clinical history when evaluating nocturnal spells. When the diagnosis is in question, referral for video electroencephalogram monitoring is the standard. However, there are no guidelines as to when this evaluation is needed. The Frontal Lobe Epilepsy Parasomnia (FLEP) scale was developed to assist clinicians in differentiating the two among adults. The aim of this study was to provide a preliminary evaluation of the FLEP for use with children. METHODS: This was a retrospective pilot instrument validation study with a convenience sample of 17 children seen in neurology or sleep medicine clinics. To determine concurrent validity, FLEP scores were compared with clinical diagnoses by neurology providers confirmed by electroencephalography. RESULTS: With a cutoff score of 2, the modified FLEP distinguished between children with and without SHE. The FLEP tool had a specificity of 0.58, implying that 7 of the 12 children without SHE would have been accurately recommended to follow up for parasomnia management rather than more urgent evaluation of potential frontal lobe epilepsy. CONCLUSIONS: With some minor adaptations for children, the FLEP satisfactorily distinguished between SHE and non-SHE patients.

However, its application to brain-computer interface development can significantly improve the usability of these systems. This paper presents a comparison of baseline linear discriminant analysis (LDA) with convolutional (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) for the P300 classification. The experiments were based on a large multi-subject publicly available dataset of school-age children. Several hyperparameter choices were experimentally investigated and discussed. The presented CNN slightly outperformed both RNN and baseline LDA classifier (the accuracy of 63.2 % vs. 61.3 % and 62.8 %). The differences were most pronounced in precision and recall. Implications of the results and proposals for future work, e.g., stacked CNN-LSTM, are discussed.

A visual P300 BCI designed for controlling home appliances was used in the experiment. Participants used the BCI in two conditions: 1) being presented with visual stimuli on top of a background video including various motions and changes of scenery; and 2) being presented only with visual stimuli. The visual distraction in P300 BCI resulted in the reduction of P2, N2 and P3 absolute peak amplitudes (p<0.05), It also lowered average target detection accuracy (70.37%) compared to the no distraction condition (78.52%), which was more prominent in several participants. This study suggests that a visual P300 BCI can be used under visual distraction without a significant decrease of performance, while individual influences may vary.

Several studies based on subjective behavioral responses suggest that taVNS modulates nociception differently with either pro-nociceptive or anti-nociceptive effects. Objective This study aimed to characterize how taVNS alters pain perception, by investigating its effects on event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by different types of spinothalamic and lemniscal somatosensory stimuli, combined with quantitative sensory testing (detection threshold and intensity ratings). Methods We performed 3 experiments designed to study the time-dependent effects of taVNS and compare with standard cervical VNS (cVNS). In Experiment 1, we assessed the effects of taVNS after 3 hours of stimulation. In Experiment 2, we focused on the immediate effects of the duty cycle (OFF vs. ON phases). Experiments 1 and 2 included 22 and 15 healthy participants respectively. Both experiments consisted of a 2-day cross-over protocol, in which subjects received taVNS and sham stimulation sequentially. In addition, subjects received a set of nociceptive (thermonociceptive CO2 laser, mechanical pinprick) and non-nociceptive (vibrotactile, cool) stimuli, for which we recorded detection thresholds, intensity of perception and ERPs. Finally, in Experiment 3, we tested 13 epileptic patients with an implanted cVNS by comparing OFF vs. ON cycles, using a similar experimental procedure. Results Neither taVNS nor cVNS appeared to modulate the cerebral and behavioral aspects of somatosensory perception. Conclusion The potential effect of taVNS on nociception requires a cautious interpretation, as we found no objective change in behavioral and cerebral responses to spinothalamic and lemniscal somatosensory stimulations.

Although the main electrophysiological markers of word learning have already been described, little is known about the performance-dependent neural machinery underlying this exceptional human faculty. Furthermore, it is currently unknown how word learning abilities are related to verbal memory capacity, auditory attention functions, phonetic discrimination skills, and musicality. Accordingly, we used EEG and examined 40 individuals, who were assigned to two groups (low [LPs] and high performers [HPs]) based on a median split of word learning performance, while they completed a phonetic-based word learning task. Furthermore, we collected behavioral data during an attentive listening and a phonetic discrimination task with the same stimuli to address relationships between auditory attention and phonetic discrimination skills, word learning performance, and musicality. The phonetic-based word learning task, which also included a nonlearning control condition, was sensitive enough to segregate learning-specific and unspecific N200/N400 manifestations along the anterior-posterior topographical axis. Notably, HPs exhibited enhanced verbal memory capacity and we also revealed a performance-dependent spatial N400 pattern, with maximal amplitudes at posterior electrodes in HPs and central maxima in LPs. Furthermore, phonetic-based word learning performance correlated with verbal memory capacity and phonetic discrimination skills, whereas the latter was related to musicality. This experimental approach clearly highlights the multifaceted dimensions of phonetic-based word learning and is helpful to disentangle learning-specific and unspecific ERPs.

In this study, we found that, as assessed by magnetoencephalography, electromagnetic cortical neuronal activity while performing cognitive tasks was associated with a decrease in motivation caused by the tasks in healthy participants, suggesting the possibility that the brain utilizes information that reflects the invested amount of neural activity to suppress performance. To our knowledge, this is the first report to provide clues for the missing link between neural investments and the resulting activation of the biological alarms that suppress performance.

The theoretical underpinnings of the CIT in the context of law enforcement usage are sound. The CTP is said to effectively discriminate individuals who recognize novel and meaningful stimuli and to be countermeasure resistant. Forty-five undergraduate students were assigned to three groups and instructed to perform a computer task using autobiographical data in connection to a mock burglary script. P300 peak-to-peak amplitude differences between probe (surname) and irrelevant (patronymic foils) items accurately identified 100% (14/14) of Innocent Controls (IC), 94% (15/16) of Simply Guilty (SG) participants, and 93% (14/15) of Guilty Countermeasure (GCM) subjects who were asked to counter all stimuli by mentally counting backwards continuously during their test presentation. Increased number of mistakes during the test, from combined cognitive erroneous responses to pop quizzes and behavioral errors with button presses, significantly discriminated GCM from IC and SG individuals. GCM participants committed more errors than IC and SG which did not differ from one another. Reaction Time (RT) was only significant between GCM and IC groups. Implications for forensic issues are discussed.

Functional Connectivity and Frequency Power Alterations during P300 Task as a Result of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis	SENSORS			English	Article						ALS; EEG; classifier; neural; connectivity; frequency-specific; BCI	OSCILLATIONS	Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is one of the most aggressive neurodegenerative diseases and is now recognized as a multisystem network disorder with impaired connectivity. Further research for the understanding of the nature of its cognitive affections is necessary to monitor and detect the disease, so this work provides insight into the neural alterations occurring in ALS patients during a cognitive task (P300 oddball paradigm) by measuring connectivity and the power and latency of the frequency-specific EEG activity of 12 ALS patients and 16 healthy subjects recorded during the use of a P300-based BCI to command a robotic arm. For ALS patients, in comparison to Controls, the results (p < 0.05) were: an increment in latency of the peak ERP in the Delta range (OZ) and Alpha range (PO7), and a decreased power in the Beta band among most electrodes; connectivity alterations among all bands, especially in the Alpha band between PO7 and the channels above the motor cortex. The evolution observed over months of an advanced-state patient backs up these findings. These results were used to compute connectivity- and power-based features to discriminate between ALS and Control groups using Support Vector Machine (SVM). Cross-validation achieved a 100% in specificity and 75% in sensitivity, with an overall 89% success.</p>	[Perez-Ortiz, Claudia X.; Gordillo, Jose L.; Mendoza-Montoya, Omar; Antelis, Javier M.] Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias, Monterrey 64849, Mexico; [Caraza, Ricardo; Martinez, Hector R.] Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Med & Ciencias Salud, Monterrey 64849, Mexico		Mendoza-Montoya, O (corresponding author), Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias, Monterrey 64849, Mexico.	c.xochitl96@gmail.com; JLGordillo@Tec.mx; omendoza83@tec.mx; mauricio.antelis@tec.mx; rcaraza@tec.mx; hector.ramon@tec.mx		Mendoza Montoya, Omar/0000-0002-4355-886X; Antelis, Javier M./0000-0003-3377-0813	National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACyT) [PN2015-873]; UIC-TEC Seed Funding Program 2021-2022	National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACyT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); UIC-TEC Seed Funding Program 2021-2022	This research has been funded by the National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACyT) through grant PN2015-873, and the UIC-TEC Seed Funding Program 2021-2022.		31	2	2	0	0	MDPI	BASEL	ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND		1424-8220		SENSORS-BASEL	Sensors	OCT	2021	21	20							6801	10.3390/s21206801	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21206801			20	Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation	WS6NU	34696014	gold, Green Published			2022-08-02	WOS:000715296400001

Mismatch negativity as an index of target engagement for excitation/inhibition-based treatment development: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, single-dose cross-over study of the serotonin type-3 receptor antagonist CVN058	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; 5-HT3 RECEPTORS; GABAERGIC INTERNEURONS; DRUG DEVELOPMENT; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL BIOMARKERS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DEFICITS; ONDANSETRON; DYSFUNCTION; KETAMINE	Serotonin type-3 receptor (5-HT3R) antagonists show potential as a treatment for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. CVN058, a brain-penetrant, potent and selective 5-HT3R antagonist, shows efficacy in rodent models of cognition and was well-tolerated in Phase-1 studies. We evaluated the target engagement of CVN058 using mismatch negativity (MMN) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Subjects were stable outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder treated with antipsychotics. Subjects were not permitted to use other 5-HT3R modulators or serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Each subject received a high (150 mg) and low (15 mg or 75 mg) oral dose of CVN058 and placebo in a randomized order across 3 single-day treatment visits separated by at least 1 week. The primary pre-registered outcome was amplitude of duration MMN. Amplitude of other MMN deviants (frequency, intensity, frequency modulation, and location), P50, P300 and auditory steady-state response (ASSR) were exploratory endpoints. 19 of 22 randomized subjects (86.4%) completed the study. Baseline PANSS scores indicated moderate impairment. CVN058 150 mg led to significant improvement vs. placebo on the primary outcome of duration MMN (p = 0.02, Cohen's d = 0.48). A significant treatment effect was also seen in a combined analysis across all MMN deviants (p < 0.001, d = 0.57). Effects on location MMN were independently significant (p < 0.007, d = 0.46). No other significant effects were seen for other deviants, doses or EEG measures. There were no clinically significant treatment related adverse effects. These results show MMN to be a sensitive target engagement biomarker for 5-HT3R, and support the potential utility of CVN058 in correcting the excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in schizophrenia.

J	Wei, X; Ni, XL; Zhao, SG; Chi, AP				Wei, Xin; Ni, Xiaoli; Zhao, Shanguang; Chi, Aiping			Influence of Exposure at Different Altitudes on the Executive Function of Plateau Soldiers-Evidence From ERPs and Neural Oscillations	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						high altitude; hypobaric hypoxia; SpO(2); response inhibition; military personnel	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; HYPOXIA; EEG; INHIBITION; CONFLICT; EXERCISE; GO/NOGO; TASK; P3	This study investigates the changes in soldiers' brain executive function at different altitude environments and their relationship with blood oxygen saturation. Stratified sampling was conducted in different altitude 133 active-duty soldiers who were stationed in Weinan (347 m, n = 34), Nyingchi (2,950 m, n = 32), Lhasa (3,860 m, n = 33), and Nagqu (4,890 m, n = 34) for 2 years. The Go/NoGo paradigm with event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related oscillations (EROs) was used to explore the time and neural oscillation courses of response inhibition. Behavioral results revealed that at the 4,890-m altitude area, the soldiers had the highest false alarm rate, the longest reaction time, and the slowest information transmission rate. The electrophysiological results revealed that NoGo-N2 and N2d decreased with increasing altitude, with significant changes at 3,860 m; the amplitudes of NoGo-P3 and P3d in plateau groups were significantly more negative than the plain and changed significantly at 2,950 m. The results of correlation analysis showed that NoGo-P3 was negatively correlated with altitude (r = -0.358, p = 0.000), positively correlated with SpO(2) (r = 0.197, p = 0.041) and information translation rate (ITR) (r = 0.202, p = 0.036). P3d was negatively correlated with altitude (r = -0.276, p = 0.004) and positively correlated with ITR (r = 0.228, p = 0.018). N2d was negatively correlated with ITR (r = 0.204, p = 0.034). The power spectrum analysis of NoGo-N2 and NoGo-P3 showed that the power of delta and theta bands at the plateau area was significantly lower than the plain area and showed a significant step-by-step decrease; the alpha-band power increases significantly only in the area of 4,890 m. The effect of chronic hypoxia exposure at different altitudes of the plateau on the response inhibition of soldiers was manifested: 3,860 m was the altitude at which the brain response inhibition function decreased during the conflict monitoring stage, and 2,950 m was the altitude at which it dropped during the response inhibition stage. In addition, the soldier's brain's executive function was closely related to SpO(2), and a reduction in SpO(2) may lead to a decline in response inhibition.

Cortical Engagement Metrics During Reactive Balance Are Associated With Distinct Aspects of Balance Behavior in Older Adults	FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						aging- old age - seniors; dual task (DT); sensorimotor system; prefrontal cortex (PFC); functional connectivity; beta activity; response inhibition; posture	AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; INTRACORTICAL INHIBITION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; POSTURAL STABILITY; MOTOR-PERFORMANCE; BRAIN; PERTURBATION; RECOVERY; DYNAMICS	Heightened reliance on the cerebral cortex for postural stability with aging is well-known, yet the cortical mechanisms for balance control, particularly in relation to balance function, remain unclear. Here we aimed to investigate motor cortical activity in relation to the level of balance challenge presented during reactive balance recovery and identify circuit-specific interactions between motor cortex and prefrontal or somatosensory regions in relation to metrics of balance function that predict fall risk. Using electroencephalography, we assessed motor cortical beta power, and beta coherence during balance reactions to perturbations in older adults. We found that individuals with greater motor cortical beta power evoked following standing balance perturbations demonstrated lower general clinical balance function. Individual older adults demonstrated a wide range of cortical responses during balance reactions at the same perturbation magnitude, showing no group-level change in prefrontal- or somatosensory-motor coherence in response to perturbations. However, older adults with the highest prefrontal-motor coherence during the post-perturbation, but not pre-perturbation, period showed greater cognitive dual-task interference (DTI) and elicited stepping reactions at lower perturbation magnitudes. Our results support motor cortical beta activity as a potential biomarker for individual level of balance challenge and implicate prefrontal-motor cortical networks in distinct aspects of balance control involving response inhibition of reactive stepping in older adults. Cortical network activity during balance may provide a neural target for precision-medicine efforts aimed at fall prevention with aging.

In this study, material emotion and participant emotion were introduced into Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm experiment at the same time, which made the experiment process closer to real life. Different music was used to induce the emotion of 28 participants, and they were divided into positive group and negative group. Then, we analyzed the difference between the two groups from the behavior data, source location and cortex functional network of event related potential. The results of difference analysis show that the false memory rate of positive group (85 +/- 8.6%) is significantly higher than that of negative group (72 +/- 9.7%), and the activation degree and voxel number of the positive group are significantly higher than those of the negative group in the brain regions related to semantic coding (BA24 and BA45), and the compactness, the speed of information transmission and the small-world property of the brain network in positive group are significantly higher than those in negative group. The above results show that in the positive group, more brain resources are used for semantic association when they judge keywords, which confuse the keywords and learning words, and result in more false memories.

A comparison of GABA-ergic (propofol) and non-GABA-ergic (dexmedetomidine) sedation on visual and motor cortical oscillations, using magnetoencephalography	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography; Oscillations; Neurophysiology; Propofol; Dexmedetomidine; Conscious sedation	EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; GAMMA FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; ALPHA-RHYTHMS; EEG; ANESTHESIA; MOVEMENTS; RESPONSES; CORTEX; MODEL	Studying changes in cortical oscillations can help elucidate the mechanistic link between receptor physiology and the clinical effects of anaesthetic drugs. Propofol, a GABA-ergic drug produces divergent effects on visual cortical activity: increasing induced gamma-band responses (GBR) while decreasing evoked responses. Dexmedetomidine, an alpha 2- adrenergic agonist, differs from GABA-ergic sedatives both mechanistically and clinically as it allows easy arousability from deep sedation with less cognitive side-effects. Here we use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to characterize and compare the effects of GABA-ergic (propofol) and non-GABA-ergic (dexmedetomidine) sedation, on visual and motor cortical oscillations. Sixteen male participants received target-controlled infusions of propofol and dexmedetomidine, producing mild-sedation, in a placebo-controlled, cross-over study. MEG data was collected during a combined visuomotor task. The key findings were that propofol significantly enhanced visual stimulus induced GBR (44% increase in amplitude) while dexmedetomidine decreased it (40%). Propofol also decreased the amplitudes of the Mv100 (visual M100) (27%) and Mv150 (52%) visual evoked fields (VEF), whilst dexmedetomidine had no effect on these. During the motor task, neither drug had any significant effect on movement related gamma synchrony (MRGS), movement related beta de-synchronisation (MRBD) or Mm100 (movement-related M100) movement-related evoked fields (MEF), although dexmedetomidine slowed the Mm300. Dexmedetomidine increased (92%) post-movement beta synchronisation/rebound (PMBR) power while propofol reduced it (70%, statistically non-significant). Overall, dexmedetomidine and propofol, at equisedative doses, produce contrasting effects on visual induced GBR, VEF, PMBR and MEF. These findings provide a mechanistic link between the known receptor physiology of these sedative drugs with their known clinical effects and may be used to explore mechanisms of other anaesthetic drugs on human consciousness.

Here, we performed an electroencephalography study to portray this brain dynamics of speech perception in CI children. We presented a Mandarin Chinese monosyllable or four-syllable idiom to CI and NH children, and infrequently varied its lexical tone to form a novel monosyllable or pseudo idiom in an oddball paradigm. The tone contrast embedded in the monosyllables evoked similar mismatch negativities (MMNs) in CI and NH children at an early stage (similar to 200 ms). However, the amplitude of the MMN evoked by the tone contrast in the idiom context was significantly lower in CI children than in NH children. Furthermore, robust late discriminative negativity (LDN) at a late stage (500 ms) was found only in NH children, but not in CI children. The MMN and LDN findings indicate deficits of low-level acoustic encoding in a complex context (such as an idiom) and higher-level cognitive processing in CI children, respectively. Both deficient sensory and cognitive processing may contribute to the speech perception difficulties in CI children. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Rawls, E; Wolkowicz, NR; Ham, LS; Lamm, C				Rawls, Eric; Wolkowicz, Noah R.; Ham, Lindsay S.; Lamm, Connie			Negative urgency as a risk factor for hazardous alcohol use: Dual influences of cognitive control and reinforcement processing	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Negative urgency; Dual model; Reinforcement processing; Cognitive control; Alcohol; Event-related potential	ATTENTIONAL BIAS MODIFICATION; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DRINKING MOTIVES; EARLY-CHILDHOOD; DRUG-ADDICTION; USE DISORDERS; RASH ACTION; DOPAMINE; IMPULSIVITY	Negative Urgency (NU) is a prominent risk factor for hazardous alcohol use. While research has helped elucidate how NU relates to neurobiological functioning with respect to alcohol use, no known work has contextualized such functioning within existing neurobiological theories in addiction. Therefore, we elucidated mechanisms contributing to the NU-hazardous alcohol use relationship by combining NU theories with neurobiological dual models of addiction, which posit addiction is related to cognitive control and reinforcement processing. Fifty-five undergraduates self-reported NU and hazardous alcohol use. We recorded EEG while participants performed a reinforced flanker task. We measured cognitive control using N2 activation time-locked to the incongruent flanker stimulus, and we measured reinforcement processing using the feedback-related negativity (FRN) time locked to better-than-expected negative reinforcement feedback. We modeled hazardous drinking using hierarchical regression, with NU, N2, and FRN plus their interactions as predictors. The regression model significantly predicted hazardous alcohol use, and the three-way interaction (NU x N2 x FRN) significantly improved model fit. In the context of inefficient processing (i.e., larger N2s and FRNs), NU demonstrated a strong relationship with hazardous alcohol use. In the context of efficient processing (i.e., smaller N2s and FRNs), NU was unrelated to hazardous alcohol use. Control analyses ruled out the potential impact of other impulsivity sub scales, individual differences in dimensional negative affect or anxiety, and use of substances other than alcohol, and post hoc specificity analyses showed that this effect was driven primarily by heavy drinking, rather than frequency of drinking. This analysis provides preliminary evidence that brain mechanisms of cognitive control and reinforcement processing influence the relationship between NU and hazardous alcohol use, and confirms a specific influence of negative reinforcement processing. Future clinical research could leverage these neurobiological moderators for substance misuse treatment.

Careful control of stimulus properties and manipulation of both stimulus valence and salience could facilitate interpretation of the RewP. RewP interpretation could further be improved by investigating functional outcomes of a blunted RewP in depression, such as reduced memory for rewarding outcomes. This study sought to advance RewP interpretation first by advancing task design through use of neutral (i.e., draw) control trials and counterbalanced feedback stimuli. Second, we examined the RewP's association with memory and the impact of depression. Undergraduates completed self-report measures of depression and anhedonia prior to a modified doors task in which words were displayed in colored fonts that indicated win, loss, or draw feedback. Memory of the feedback associated with each word (i.e., source memory) was tested. Results showed that RewP response to wins was more positive than to losses, which was more positive than to draws. The RewP was not associated with depression or anhedonia. The low depression group showed a source memory advantage for win words, but the high depression group did not. Source memory showed small relations to the RewP, but these did not survive Bonferroni correction. Results suggest the RewP is sensitive to salience and highlight challenges in detecting an association between the RewP and depression in modified doors tasks. Findings indicate that depression is related to dysfunctional source memory for reward but not loss and that future research should probe the possible associations between the RewP and memory in depression.

Moreover, a possible relationship has been suggested between altered auditory intensity processing and the hypophonic speech characteristics in PD. Nonetheless, further insight into the neurophysiological correlates of auditory intensity processing in patients with PD is needed primarily. In the present study, high-density EEG recordings were used to investigate intensity dependence of auditory evoked potentials (IDAEPs) in 14 patients with PD and 14 age- and gender-matched healthy control participants (HCs). Patients with PD were evaluated in both the on- and off-medication states. HCs were also evaluated twice. Significantly increased IDAEP of the N1/P2 was demonstrated in patients with PD evaluated in the on-medication state compared to HCs. Distinctive results were found for the N1 and P2 component. Regarding the N1 component, no differences in latency or amplitude were shown between patients with PD and HCs regardless of the medication state. In contrast, increased P2 amplitude was demonstrated in patients with PD evaluated in the on-medication state compared to the off-medication state and HCs. In addition to a dopaminergic deficiency, deficits in serotonergic neurotransmission in PD were shown based on increased IDAEP. Due to specific alterations of the N1-P2 complex, the current results suggest deficiencies in early-attentive inhibitory processing of auditory input in PD. This interpretation is consistent with the involvement of the basal ganglia and the role of dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission in auditory gating.

There are several factors that may help differentiate youth with anxiety (e.g., threat sensitivity and emotion dysregulation) and youth who take risks (e.g., impulsivity and emotion dysregulation). We conducted a latent class analysis to identify groups of youth who differ in these processes, and then investigated group differences on the error-related negativity, an ERP that has been differentially associated with threat sensitivity and impulsivity. Method: Youth (N = 1313, M-age = 11, range = 8-15 years) completed a survey assessing their emotion dysregulation, sensitivity to threat, and impulsivity. A subsample (N = 424) also completed a go/no-go task while EEG was recorded. Results and conclusions: Four groups were identified with differential levels of emotion dysregulation, sensitivity to threat, and impulsivity. Adolescents had greater odds than children of being in the High_Dysregulation/ThreatSensitivity or ModerateDysregulation/HighImpulsivity Groups in comparison to two other groups with lower scores. The High_Dysregulation/ThreatSensitivity Group had the largest ERN, while the ModerateDysregulation/HighImpulsivity Group had the smallest ERN. The ERN may be a potential biomarker to help distinguish between different profiles of adolescents who may be at risk for either anxiety or risk taking.

However, it remains unclear whether emotionally charged knowledge acquired through interactive social learning also modulates face processing and attentional control. Thus, the aim of this study was to test whether affective knowledge induced through social interactions in a naturalistic exchange game can influence early stages of face processing and attentional shifts in a subsequent gaze-cueing task. As indicated by self-reported ratings, the game was successful in inducing valenced affective knowledge towards positive and negative players. In the subsequent task, in which the locations of future targets were cued by the gaze of the game players, we observed enhanced early neural activity (larger amplitude of the P1 component) in response to a photograph of the negative player. This indicates that negative affective knowledge about an individual indeed modulates very early stages of the processing of this individual's face. Our study contributes to the existing literature by providing further evidence for the saliency of interactive social exchange paradigms that are used to induce affective knowledge. Moreover, it extends the previous research by presenting a very early modulation of perception by socially learned affective knowledge. Importantly, it also offers increased ecological validity of the findings due to the use of naturalistic social exchange in the study design.

This neuroscience-informed approach affords the opportunity to unpack potential neurobiological mechanisms that may underscore challenges in maternal caregiving behavior among mothers with addictions and provide new directions for parenting interventions. Recent Findings Consistent with theoretical models of parenting and addictions, five studies evidence both hypo- and hyper-reactivity to infant affective cues across neuroimaging methods and tasks that incorporate both infant face and cry stimuli. Three structural and resting-state brain studies as a function of maternal substance use are also reported. While human neuroimaging research converges in showing that maternal substance use is associated with differential reactivity to infant affective cues, further multi-level/multi-modal, longitudinal, and dimensional research is critically needed to advance this area of investigation.

To capture the millisecond-resolved neural activations associated with fine visual-motor skills, we devised a co-registration system to simultaneously record electroencephalogram and handwriting kinematics while participants were performing four handwriting tasks (writing in Chinese/English scripts with their dominant/non-dominant hand). The neural activation associated with each stroke was clearly identified with a well-structured and reliable pattern. The functional significance of this pattern was validated by its significant associations with language, hand and the cognitive stages and kinematics of handwriting. Furthermore, the handwriting rhythmicity was found to be synchronised to the brain's ongoing theta oscillation, and the synchronisation was associated with the factor of language and hand. These major findings imply an implication between motor skill formation and the interplay between the rhythms in the brain and the peripheral systems.

Methodology: The study employs an EEG method with a semantic decision task to novel nominal metaphors, novel similes, as well as literal and anomalous sentences presented in participants' L1 and L2. Data and analysis: In total, 29 native speakers of Polish (L1) who were highly proficient in English (L2) took part in the study. The collected EEG signal was analyzed in terms of an event-related potential analysis. The statistical analyses were based on behavioral data (reaction times and accuracy rates) as well as mean amplitudes for the four conditions in the two languages within the N400 and LPC time windows. Findings: The results revealed the N400 effect of utterance type modulated by language nativeness, where the brainwaves for anomalous sentences, novel nominal metaphors, and novel similes converged in L2, while in L1 a graded effect was observed from anomalous sentences to novel nominal metaphors, novel similes and literal sentences. In contrast, within the late time window, a more pronounced sustained negativity to novel nominal metaphors than novel similes was observed in both languages, thus indicating that meaning integration mechanisms might be of similar automaticity in L1 and L2 when bilingual speakers are highly proficient in their L2. Altogether, the present results point to a more taxing mechanisms involved in lexico-semantic access in L2 than L1, yet such an increased effort seems to be resolved within the meaning integration phase. Originality: The findings present novel insights into how bilinguals construct new unfamiliar meanings and show how and when cognitive mechanisms engaged in this process are modulated by language nativeness. Significance: The study might provide crucial implications for further research on bilingual semantic processing as well as human creativity.

Hence learning to self-regulate one's amygdala activity may facilitate recovery. PTSD is further characterized by abnormal contextual processing related to the traumatic memory. Therefore, provoking the personal traumatic narrative while training amygdala down-regulation could enhance clinical efficacy. We report the results of a randomized controlled trial (NCT02544971) of a novel self-neuromodulation procedure (i.e. NeuroFeedback) for PTSD, aimed at down-regulating limbic activity while receiving feedback from an auditory script of a personal traumatic narrative. To scale-up applicability, neural activity was probed by an fMRI-informed EEG model of amygdala activity, termed Amygdala Electrical Finger-Print (AmygEFP). Methods: Fifty-nine adults meeting DSM-5 criteria for PTSD were randomized between three groups: Trauma script feedback interface (Trauma-NF) or Neutral feedback interface (Neutral-NF), and a control group of No NF (to control for spontaneous recovery). Before and immediately after 15 NF training sessions patients were blindly assessed for PTSD symptoms and underwent one session of amygdala fMRI-NF for transferability testing. Follow-up clinical assessment was performed at 3-and 6-months following NF treatment. Results: Patients in both NF groups learned to volitionally down-regulate AmygEFP signal and demonstrated a greater reduction in PTSD symptoms and improved down-regulation of the amygdala during fMRI-NF, compared to the No-NF group. The Trauma-NF group presented the largest immediate clinical improvement. Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study indicates the feasibility of the AmygEFP-NF process-driven as a scalable intervention for PTSD and illustrates its clinical potential. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the contribution of AmygEFP-NF beyond exposure and placebo effects.

J	Rothenberger, A; Heinrich, H				Rothenberger, Aribert; Heinrich, Hartmut			Electrophysiology Echoes Brain Dynamics in Children and Adolescents With Tourette Syndrome-A Developmental Perspective	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Review						electrophysiology; brain maturation; Tourette syndrome; tics; development; treatment; children; ADHD		The development of the complex clinical picture of motor and vocal tics in children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome (TS) must be paralleled by changes in the underlying pathophysiology. Electrophysiological methods such as EEG and event-related potentials (ERPs) are non-invasive, safe and easy to apply and thus seem to provide an adequate means to investigate brain dynamics during this brain maturational period. Also, electrophysiology is characterized by a high time resolution and can reflect motor, sensory and cognitive aspects as well as sleep behavior. Hence, this narrative review focuses on how electrophysiology echoes brain dynamics during development of youngsters with TS and might be useful for the treatment of tics. A comprehensive picture of developmental brain dynamics could be revealed showing that electrophysiological parameters evolve concurrently with clinical characteristics of TS. Specifically, evidence for a maturational delay of motor inhibition related to cortico-spinal hyper-excitability and brain mechanisms for its cognitive compensation could be shown. Moreover, deviant sleep parameters and probably a stronger perception-action binding were reported. For neuromodulatory treatments (e.g., neurofeedback; repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, rTMS/transcranial direct current stimulation, tDCS) targeting neuronal deficits and/or strengthening compensatory brain mechanisms, pilot studies support the possibility of positive effects regarding tic reduction. Finally, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as a highly frequent co-existing disorder with TS, has to be considered when using and interpreting electrophysiological measures in TS. In conclusion, application of electrophysiology seems to be promising regarding clinical and research aspects in youngsters with TS.

Here, we aim to explore the effect of acute stress on the interaction between the objective level of risk and subjective risk preference (i.e. risk-taking propensity). Eighty-three healthy males participated in the study. We adopted the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) to induce acute psychological stress and categorized participants into the high or low risk-taking propensity (HRP/LRP) group according to their traits in daily life. The Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) was applied to measure their feedback processing in a risky decision task, while behavioral indexes and EEG signals were recorded. The results showed that stressful participants pumped fewer times than the controls, especially for the LRP under stress, indicating that they were more willing to avoid taking risks. Compared with the stressed HRP group, the stressed LRP showed higher salivary cortisol responses and a more positive FRN following positive feedback in higher risk levels. It implies that acute psychological stress leads the LRP to overestimate the risk probability and become more cautious in the sequential processing of risk. These findings highlight the role of the feedback process and individual traits in risky decision-making under stress.

The Brain Tracks Multiple Predictions About the Auditory Scene	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory attention; task switching; pattern detection; mismatch negativity (MMN); event-related potentials (ERPs); neural entrainment	MISMATCH-NEGATIVITY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; ENTRAINMENT; PATTERNS; TIME; REGULARITIES; MECHANISM; CORTEX; MMN	The predictable rhythmic structure is important to most ecologically relevant sounds for humans, such as is found in the rhythm of speech or music. This study addressed the question of how rhythmic predictions are maintained in the auditory system when there are multiple perceptual interpretations occurring simultaneously and emanating from the same sound source. We recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) while presenting participants with a tone sequence that had two different tone feature patterns, one based on the sequential rhythmic variation in tone duration and the other on sequential rhythmic variation in tone intensity. Participants were presented with the same sound sequences and were instructed to listen for the intensity pattern (ignore fluctuations in duration) and press a response key to detected pattern deviants (attend intensity pattern task); to listen to the duration pattern (ignore fluctuations in intensity) and make a button press to duration pattern deviants (attend duration pattern task), and to watch a movie and ignore the sounds presented to their ears (attend visual task). Both intensity and duration patterns occurred predictably 85% of the time, thus the key question involved evaluating how the brain treated the irrelevant feature patterns (standards and deviants) while performing an auditory or visual task. We expected that task-based feature patterns would have a more robust brain response to attended standards and deviants than the unattended feature patterns. Instead, we found that the neural entrainment to the rhythm of the standard attended patterns had similar power to the standard of the unattended feature patterns. In addition, the infrequent pattern deviants elicited the event-related brain potential called the mismatch negativity component (MMN). The MMN elicited by task-based feature pattern deviants had a similar amplitude to MMNs elicited by unattended pattern deviants that were unattended because they were not the target pattern or because the participant ignored the sounds and watched a movie. Thus, these results demonstrate that the brain tracks multiple predictions about the complexities in sound streams and can automatically track and detect deviations with respect to these predictions. This capability would be useful for switching attention rapidly among multiple objects in a busy auditory scene.

The existence of this type of memory reconsolidation offers the potential for clinical interventions of maladaptive memory. However, such potential cannot be fully exploited until the internal mechanisms of memory changes via reconsolidation are better understood. In the current study, we used a threeday AB-AC paradigm that included self-referential simulation processing and employed electroencephalogram (EEG) techniques to explore how post-retrieval updates of episodic memory come about. Behaviorally, we found that reactivation alongside interference learning (ReI-L, AB-AC, n = 52) can produce much more false memories compared to no reactivation new learning (New-L, AB-DC, n = 31) and reactivation repetitive learning (Rep-L, AB-AB. n = 30). More importantly, ERP results revealed that trials from ReI-L in which memory distortions subsequently occurred showed an observable (compared to the new-learning without memory reactivation) but attenuated (compared to trials associating with later intact memory) amplitude of frontal N400, indicating a moderate level of early conflict reactivation is necessary to trigger crucial memory instability. In addition, to promote optimal distortion of the original memory, a sufficient later constructional processing is also required, reflecting in these intrusive/later false trials showed a larger amplitude of late posterior negativity (LPN). A linear classifier employing neuro features of FN400 and LPN during the reconsolidation phase could predict the original memory retention with 72% accuracy. The present findings indicate that nuance in post-retrieval interference, moderate conflict with protracted construction can lead to optimal alterations of episodic memories.

A Social Neuroscience Examination	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Political orientation; EEG; ERP; P3; Negativity bias	REACTIVE APPROACH MOTIVATION; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; ANXIOUS UNCERTAINTY; MORTALITY SALIENCE; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; THREAT; BRAIN; ATTITUDES; SYSTEM	Psychological views on political orientation generally agree that conservatism is associated with negativity bias but disagree on the form of that association. Some view conservatism as a psychological defense that insulates from negative stimuli and events. Others view conservatism as a consequence of increased dispositional sensitivity to negative stimuli and events. Further complicating matters, research shows that conservatives are sometimes more and sometimes less sensitive to negative stimuli and events. The current research integrates these opposing views and results. We reasoned that conservatives should typically be less sensitive to negative stimuli if conservative beliefs act as a psychological defense. However, when core components of conservative beliefs are threatened, the psychological defense may fall, and conservatives may show heightened sensitivity to negative stimuli. In two ERP studies, participants were randomly assigned to either an ostensibly real economic threat or a nonthreatening control condition. To measure reactivity to negative stimuli, we indexed the P3 component to aversive white noise bursts in an auditory oddball paradigm. In both studies, the relationship between increased conservatism and P3 mean amplitude was negative in the control condition but positive in threat condition (this relationship was stronger in Study 2). In Study 2, source localization of the P3 component revealed that, after threat, conservatism was associated with increased activity in the anterior cingulate cortex and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, regions associated with conflict-related processes. These results demonstrate that the link between conservatism and negativity bias is context-dependent, i.e., dependent on threat experiences.

Even in healthy individuals, taste perceptions often drive dietary decisions more strongly than healthiness. This study tested whether health and taste representations can be directly decoded from brain activity, both when explicitly considered, and when implicitly processed for decision-making. We used multivariate support vector regression for event-related potentials (as measured by the electroencephalogram) to estimate a regression model predicting ratings of tastiness and healthiness for each participant, based on their neural activity occurring in the first second of food cue processing. In Experiment 1, 37 healthy participants viewed images of various foods and explicitly rated their tastiness and healthiness. In Experiment 2, 89 healthy participants completed a similar rating task, followed by an additional experimental phase, in which they indicated their desire to consume snack foods with no explicit instruction to consider tastiness or healthiness. In Experiment 1 both attributes could be decoded, with taste information being available earlier than health. In Experiment 2, both dimensions were also decodable, and their significant decoding preceded the decoding of decisions (i.e., desire to consume the food). However, in Experiment 2, health representations were decodable earlier than taste representations. These results suggest that health information is activated in the brain during the early stages of dietary decisions, which is promising for designing obesity interventions aimed at quickly activating health awareness.

Attentional bias during emotional processing: Behavioral and electrophysiological evidence from an Emotional Flanker Task	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Threatening stimuli seem to capture attention more swiftly than neutral stimuli. This attention bias has been observed under different experimental conditions and with different types of stimuli. It remains unclear whether this adaptive behaviour reflects the function of automatic or controlled attention mechanisms. Additionally, the spatiotemporal dynamics of its neural correlates are largely unknown. The present study investigates these issues using an Emotional Flanker Task synchronized with EEG recordings. A group of 32 healthy participants saw response-relevant images (emotional scenes from IAPS or line drawings of objects) flanked by response-irrelevant distracters (i.e., emotional scenes flanked by line drawings or vice versa). We assessed behavioural and ERP responses drawn from four task conditions (Threat-Central, Neutral-Central, Threat-Peripheral, and Neutral-Peripheral) and subjected these responses to repeated-measures ANOVA models. When presented as response-relevant targets, threatening images attracted faster and more accurate responses. They did not affect response accuracy to targets when presented as response-irrelevant flankers. However, response times were significantly slower when threatening images flanked objects than when neutral images were shown as flankers. This result replicated the well-known Emotional Flanker Effect. Behavioural responses to response-relevant threatening targets were accompanied by significant modulations of ERP activity across all time-windows and regions of interest and displayed some meaningful correlations. The Emotional Flanker Effect was accompanied by a modulation over parietal and central-parietal regions within a time-window between 550-690ms. Such a modulation suggests that the attentional disruption to targets caused by response-irrelevant threatening flankers appears to reflect less neural resources available, which are seemingly drawn away by distracting threatening flankers. The observed spatiotemporal dynamics seem to concur with understanding of the important adaptive role attributed to threat-related attention bias.

Five constructs are included in this dimension: anhedonia, asociality, avolition, blunted affect, and alogia. Factor analyses revealed that these symptoms cluster in two domains: experiential domain (avolition, asociality, and anhedonia) and the expressive deficit (alogia and blunted affect), that might be linked to different neurobiological alterations. Few studies investigated associations between N100, an electrophysiological index of early sensory processing, and negative symptoms, reporting controversial results. However, none of these studies investigated electrophysiological correlates of the two negative symptom domains.Objectives: The aim of our study was to evaluate, within the multicenter study of the Italian Network for Research on Psychoses, the relationships between N100 and negative symptom domains in SCZ.Methods: Auditory N100 was analyzed in 114 chronic stabilized SCZ and 63 healthy controls (HCs). Negative symptoms were assessed with the Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS). Repeated measures ANOVA and correlation analyses were performed to evaluate differences between SCZ and HCs and association of N100 features with negative symptoms.Results: Our findings demonstrated a significant N100 amplitude reduction in SCZ compared with HCs. In SCZ, N100 amplitude for standard stimuli was associated with negative symptoms, in particular with the expressive deficit domain. Within the expressive deficit, blunted affect and alogia had the same pattern of correlation with N100.Conclusion: Our findings revealed an association between expressive deficit and N100, suggesting that these negative symptoms might be related to deficits in early auditory processing in SCZ.

To gain a clearer picture of how listening effort impacts context use, we conducted a pre-registered study to simultaneously examine electrophysiological, pupillometric, and behavioral responses when listening to sentences varying in contextual constraint and acoustic challenge in the same sample. Participants (N = 44) listened to sentences that were highly constraining and completed with expected or unexpected sentence-final words ("The prisoners were planning their escape/party") or were low constraint sentences with unexpected sentence-final words ("All day she thought about the party"). Sentences were presented either in quiet or with thorn 3 dB SNR background noise. Pupillometry and EEG were simultaneously recorded and subsequent sentence recognition and word recall were measured. While the N400 expectancy effect was diminished by noise, suggesting impaired real-time context use, we simultaneously observed a beneficial effect of constraint on subsequent recognition memory for degraded speech. Importantly, analyses of trial-to-trial coupling between pupil dilation and N400 amplitude showed that when participants' showed increased listening effort (i.e., greater pupil dilation), there was a subsequent recovery of the N400 effect, but at the same time, higher effort was related to poorer subsequent sentence recognition and word recall. Collectively, these findings suggest divergent effects of acoustic challenge and listening effort on context use: while noise impairs the rapid use of context to facilitate lexical semantic processing in general, this negative effect is attenuated when listeners show increased effort in response to noise. However, this effort-induced reliance on context for online word processing comes at the cost of poorer subsequent memory. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mismatch negativity (MMN) is an event-related potential component representing pre-attentive auditory processing, which is closely associated with cognitive status. We investigated MMN features as biomarkers to classify drug-naive adult patients with ADHD and healthy controls (HCs). Sensor-level features (amplitude and latency) and source-level features (source activation) of MMN were investigated and compared between the electroencephalograms of 34 patients with ADHD and 45 HCs using a passive auditory oddball paradigm. Correlations between MMN features and ADHD symptoms were analyzed. Finally, we applied machine learning to differentiate the two groups using sensor- and source-level features of MMN. Adult patients with ADHD showed significantly lower MMN amplitudes at the frontocentral electrodes and reduced MMN source activation in the frontal, temporal, and limbic lobes, which were closely associated with MMN generators and ADHD pathophysiology. Source activities were significantly correlated with ADHD symptoms. The best classification performance for adult ADHD patients and HCs showed an 81.01% accuracy, 82.35% sensitivity, and 80.00% specificity based on MMN source activity features. Our results suggest that abnormal MMN reflects the adult ADHD patients' pathophysiological characteristics and might serve clinically as a neuromarker of adult ADHD.

The primary aim of this study was to investigate auditory deviance detection of multiple auditory features in patients with PD by means of objective and reliable electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements. Twelve patients with early-stage PD and twelve age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) were included in this study. Patients with PD participated without their regular dopaminergic medication. All subjects underwent an audiometric screening and performed a passive multi-feature mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated no significant differences between patients with PD and HCs regarding MMN mean amplitude and latency for frequency, duration and gap deviants. Nevertheless, a trend towards increased MMN mean amplitude and latency was found in response to intensity deviants in patients with PD compared to HCs. Increased intensity MMN amplitude may indicate that more neural resources are allocated to the processing of intensity deviances in patients with PD compared to HCs. The interpretation of this intensity-specific MMN alteration is further discussed in the context of a compensatory mechanism for auditory intensity processing and involuntary attention switching in PD.

Understanding the pattern of preterm infants' noxious-evoked responses is vital to improve pain assessment in this group. This study investigated the discriminability and development of multimodal noxious-evoked responses in infants aged 28-40 weeks postmenstrual age. A classifier was trained to discriminate responses to a noxious heel lance from a nonnoxious control in 47 infants, using measures of facial expression, brain activity, heart rate, and limb withdrawal, and tested in two independent cohorts with a total of 97 infants. The model discriminates responses to the noxious from the nonnoxious procedure with an overall accuracy of 0.76-0.84 and an accuracy of 0.78-0.79 in the 28-31-week group. Noxious-evoked responses have distinct developmental patterns. Heart rate responses increase in magnitude with age, while noxious-evoked brain activity undergoes three distinct developmental stages, including a previously unreported transitory stage consisting of a negative event-related potential between 30 and 33 weeks postmenstrual age. These findings demonstrate that while noxious-evoked responses change across early development, infant responses to noxious and nonnoxious stimuli are discriminable in prematurity.

J	Sauve, SA; Cho, A; Zendel, BR				Sauve, Sarah A.; Cho, Alex; Zendel, Benjamin Rich			Mapping Tonal Hierarchy in the Brain	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; music perception; auditory processing; implicit learning; tonal hierarchy	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; REPRESENTATION; COMPONENTS; MUSICIANS; MEMORY; ERAN; ERP; AGE; N1	In Western tonal music, pitches are organized hierarchically based on their perceived fit in a specific tonal context. This hierarchy forms scales that are commonly used in Western tonal music. The hierarchical nature of tonal structure is well established behaviourally; however, the neural underpinnings are largely unknown. In this study, EEG data and goodness-of-fit ratings were collected from 34 participants who listened to an arpeggio followed by a probe tone, where the probe tone could be any chromatic scale degree and the context any of the major keys. Goodness-of-fit ratings corresponded to the classic tonal hierarchy. N1, P2 and the Early Right Anterior Negativity (ERAN) were significantly modulated by scale degree. Furthermore, neural marker amplitudes and latencies were significantly correlated with similar magnitude to both pitch height and goodness-of-fit ratings. This is different from the clearer divide between pitch height correlating with early neural markers (100- 200 ms) and tonal hierarchy correlating with late neural markers (200-1000 ms) reported by Sankaran et al. (2020) and Quiroga-Martinez et al. (2019). Finally, individual differences were greater than any main effects detected when pooling participants and brain-behavior correlations vary widely (i.e. r =-0.8 to 0.8). (c) 2021 The Author(s).

Modelling thalamocortical circuitry shows that visually induced LTP changes laminar connectivity in human visual cortex	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; AMPA; NMDA; TRANSMISSION; STIMULATION; MICROCIRCUIT; DEPRESSION; SYNAPSES	Neuroplasticity is essential to learning and memory in the brain; it has therefore also been implicated in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, making measuring the state of neuroplasticity of foremost importance to clinical neuroscience. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a key mechanism of neuroplasticity and has been studied extensively, and invasively in non-human animals. Translation to human application largely relies on the validation of non-invasive measures of LTP. The current study presents a generative thalamocortical computational model of visual cortex for investigating and replicating interlaminar connectivity changes using non-invasive EEG recording of humans. The model is combined with a commonly used visual sensory LTP paradigm and fit to the empirical EEG data using dynamic causal modelling. The thalamocortical model demonstrated remarkable accuracy recapitulating post-tetanus changes seen in invasive research, including increased excitatory connectivity from thalamus to layer IV and from layer IV to II/III, established major sites of LTP in visual cortex. These findings provide justification for the implementation of the presented thalamocortical model for ERP research, including to provide increased detail on the nature of changes that underlie LTP induced in visual cortex. Future applications include translating rodent findings to non-invasive research in humans concerning deficits to LTP that may underlie neurological and psychiatric disease. Author summary The brain's ability to learn and form memories is governed by neuroplasticity. One of the major mechanisms of neuroplasticity is long-term potentiation (LTP). To study LTP in detail necessitates implanting electrodes in the brain of non-human animals. However, to translate this knowledge to humans requires a non-invasive method. Neural mass models use mathematical equations to describe the brain's neural architecture and function over time. Fitting these models to real data, using methods such as dynamic causal modelling (DCM), helps to elucidate the connectivity and major channel changes that could have plausibly caused the observed effects in electroencephalography data recorded non-invasively from the scalp. The current study presents a thalamocortical model of the neural architecture of the visual system combined with a thalamic compartment. The model is able to represent the basic transfer of visual information to the cortex, mediated by major receptor types. We combined the thalamocortical model with a visual processing task that uses black and white grating images to induce and measure LTP in visual cortex. We hypothesised that the changes in the model would be consistent with what is seen in animal invasive recordings. The model demonstrated remarkable accuracy in recapitulating changes to neural architecture consistent with the induction of LTP in visual cortex. Additionally, the result demonstrated specificity to the visual input that induced LTP. Future applications include translating animal findings that are beginning to determine how disordered LTP may underlie neurological and psychiatric disease (for example depression, schizophrenia, autism, and dementia).

J	Maffei, A; Sessa, P				Maffei, Antonio; Sessa, Paola			Event-related network changes unfold the dynamics of cortical integration during face processing	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						brain modularity; dynamic networks; EEG; face processing; small-worldness; time-varying connectivity		Face perception arises from a collective activation of brain regions in the occipital, parietal and temporal cortices. Despite the wide acknowledgment that these regions act in an intertwined network, the network behavior itself is poorly understood. Here we present a study in which time-varying connectivity estimated from EEG activity elicited by facial expressions presentation was characterized using graph-theoretical measures of node centrality and global network topology. Results revealed that face perception results from a dynamic reshaping of the network architecture, characterized by the emergence of hubs located in the occipital and temporal regions of the scalp. The importance of these nodes can be observed from the early stages of visual processing and reaches a climax in the same time-window in which the face-sensitive N170 is observed. Furthermore, using Granger causality, we found that the time-evolving centrality of these nodes is associated with ERP amplitude, providing a direct link between the network state and local neural response. Additionally, investigating global network topology by means of small-worldness and modularity, we found that face processing requires a functional network with a strong small-world organization that maximizes integration, at the cost of segregated subdivisions. Interestingly, we found that this architecture is not static, but instead, it is implemented by the network from stimulus onset to similar to 200 ms. Altogether, this study reveals the event-related changes underlying face processing at the network level, suggesting that a distributed processing mechanism operates through dynamically weighting the contribution of the cortical regions involved.

In this paper, we review the physical principles of BCIs, and underlying novel approaches for registration, analysis, and control of brain activity. We analyze recent advances in BCI studies focusing on their applications for (i) controlling the movement of robots and exoskeletons, (ii) revealing and preventing brain pathologies, (iii) assessing and controlling psychophysiological states, and (iv) monitoring and controlling normal and pathological cognitive activity. We consider the BCI as a hardware/software communication system that allows interaction of humans or animals with their surroundings without the involvement of peripheral nerves and muscles, using control signals generated from brain cerebral activity. Classifying BCIs into three main types (active, reactive and passive), we describe their functional models and neuroimaging methods, as well as novel techniques for signal enhancement and artifact recognition and avoidance, to improve BCI performance in real time. We also review different BCI applications, including communications, external device control, movement control, neuroprostheses, and assessment of human psychophysiological states. Then, we describe the most common techniques for the analysis and classification of electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data. Special attention is paid to modern technology based on machine learning and reservoir computing. We discuss main results on the creation and application of BCIs based on invasive and noninvasive EEG recordings. First, we consider neurointerfaces for controlling the movement of robots and exoskeletons. Second, we describe BCIs for diagnosis and control of pathological brain activity, in particular, epilepsy. We also discuss the results on the development of invasive BCIs for predicting and mitigating absence epileptic seizures. After that, we focus on passive neurointerfaces for assessing and controlling a person's psychophysiological states and cognitive activity. Special attention is given to optogenetic brain interfaces using photostimulation to deliver intervention to specificcell types. We outline the basic principles of optogenetic neurocontrol and extracellular electrophysiology recording. We also describe the state-of-the-art of miniaturized closed-loop optogenetic devices to control normal and pathological brain activities. Further, we discuss the new emerging technological trend in the BCI development which consists in using neurointerfaces to improve the interaction between people, so-called brain-to-brain interfaces (BBIs). Such interfaces can increase the efficiency of collaborative processes when working in a group. We propose a BBI which distributes a cognitive load among all team members working on a common task. This BBI allows sharing the workload among the participants according to their current cognitive performance, estimated from their electrical brain activity. The novel results of the brain-to-brain interaction are promising for the development of a new generation of communication systems based on the neurophysiological brain activity of interacting persons, where the BBI estimates physical conditions of each partner and adapts the assigned task accordingly. Finally, we trace the main historical epochs in BCI development and applications and highlight possible future directions for this research area, including hybrid BCIs.

The time course of these processes is unknown. The present study juxtaposed encoding and recognition in a single paradigm. Twenty healthy subjects performed a continuous recognition task as brain activity was monitored with a high-density electroencephalography. The task presented New pictures thought to evoke encoding. The stimuli were then repeated up to 4 consecutive times to produce over-familiarity. These repeated stimuli served as "baseline" for comparison with the other stimuli. Stimuli later reappeared after 9-15 intervening items, presumably associated with new encoding and recognition. Encoding-related differences in evoked response potential amplitudes and in spatiotemporal analysis were observed at 145-300 ms, whereby source estimation indicated MTL and orbitofrontal activity from 145 to 205 ms. Recognition-related activity evoked by late repetitions occurred at 405-470 ms, implicating the MTL and neocortical structures. These findings indicate that encoding of information is initiated before it is recognized. The result helps to explain modifications of memories over time, including false memories, confabulation, and consolidation.

The current study investigates how effective this Fringe-P3 method is at detecting recognition of familiar name stimuli with lower salience (i.e., famous names) than own name stimuli, as well as its accuracy with multi-item stimuli (i.e., first and second name pairs presented sequentially). The results demonstrated a highly significant ERP difference between famous and non-famous names at the group level and a detectable P3 for famous names for 86% of participants at the individual level. This demonstrates that the Fringe-P3 method can be used for detecting name stimuli other than own-names and for multi-item stimuli, thus further supporting the method's potential usefulness in forensic applications such as in detecting recognition of accomplices.

The open access advantage for studies of human electrophysiology: Impact on citations and Altmetrics	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Open access; Citation advantage; Human electrophysiology (EEG); Event-related potentials (ERPs); Preprints	PUBLICATIONS	Barriers to accessing scientific findings contribute to knowledge inequalities based on financial resources and decrease the transparency and rigor of scientific research. Recent initiatives aim to improve access to research as well as methodological rigor via transparency and openness. We sought to determine the impact of such initiatives on open access publishing in the sub-area of human electrophysiology and the impact of open access on the attention articles received in the scholarly literature and other outlets. Data for 35,144 articles across 967 journals from the last 20 years were examined. Approximately 35% of articles were open access, and the rate of publication of open-access articles increased over time. Open access articles showed 9 to 21% more PubMed and CrossRef citations and 39% more Altmetric mentions than closed access articles. Green open access articles (i.e., author archived) did not differ from non-green open access articles (i.e., publisher archived) with respect to citations and were related to higher Altmetric mentions. These findings demonstrate that open-access publishing is increasing in popularity in the sub-area of human electrophysiology and that open-access articles enjoy the ?open access advantage? in citations similar to the larger scientific literature. The benefit of the open access advantage may motivate researchers to make their publications open access and pursue publication outlets that support it. In consideration of the direct connection between citations and journal impact factor, journal editors may improve the accessibility and impact of published articles by encouraging authors to self-archive manuscripts on preprint servers.

Listeners track talker-specific prosody to deal with talker-variability	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Review						Prosody; Perceptual learning; Lexical stress; Phonological prediction; N200	LEXICAL-STRESS; SPEAKING RATE; WORD; SPEECH; PREDICTION; TIME; PERCEPTION; INTONATION; HOMOPHONE; CONTEXT	One of the challenges in speech perception is that listeners must deal with considerable segmental and supra-segmental variability in the acoustic signal due to differences between talkers. Most previous studies have focused on how listeners deal with segmental variability. In this EEG experiment, we investigated whether lis-teners track talker-specific usage of suprasegmental cues to lexical stress to recognize spoken words correctly. In a three-day training phase, Dutch participants learned to map non-word minimal stress pairs onto different object referents (e.g., USklot meant "lamp"; usKLOT meant "train"). These non-words were produced by two male talkers. Critically, each talker used only one suprasegmental cue to signal stress (e.g., Talker A used only F0 and Talker B only intensity). We expected participants to learn which talker used which cue to signal stress. In the test phase, participants indicated whether spoken sentences including these non-words were correct ("The word for lamp is..."). We found that participants were slower to indicate that a stimulus was correct if the non-word was produced with the unexpected cue (e.g., Talker A using intensity). That is, if in training Talker A used F0 to signal stress, participants experienced a mismatch between predicted and perceived phonological word-forms if, at test, Talker A unexpectedly used intensity to cue stress. In contrast, the N200 amplitude, an event-related potential related to phonological prediction, was not modulated by the cue mismatch. Theoretical implications of these contrasting results are discussed. The behavioral findings illustrate talker-specific prediction of prosodic cues, picked up through perceptual learning during training.	[Severijnen, Giulio G.

Neural responses to natural visual motion are spatially selective across the visual field, with selectivity differing across brain areas and task	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						evoked neural activity; natural dynamic stimuli; spatial selective attention; stimulus-response correlation	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; COVERT SHIFTS; EEG; FMRI; MECHANISMS; NEURONS; SPEECH; RECONSTRUCTION; ORIENTATION	It is well established that neural responses to visual stimuli are enhanced at select locations in the visual field. Although spatial selectivity and the effects of spatial attention are well understood for discrete tasks (e.g. visual cueing), little is known for naturalistic experience that involves continuous dynamic visual stimuli (e.g. driving). Here, we assess the strength of neural responses across the visual space during a kart-race game. Given the varying relevance of visual location in this task, we hypothesized that the strength of neural responses to movement will vary across the visual field, and it would differ between active play and passive viewing. To test this, we measure the correlation strength of scalp-evoked potentials with optical flow magnitude at individual locations on the screen. We find that neural responses are strongly correlated at task-relevant locations in visual space, extending beyond the focus of overt attention. Although the driver's gaze is directed upon the heading direction at the centre of the screen, neural responses were robust at the peripheral areas (e.g. roads and surrounding buildings). Importantly, neural responses to visual movement are broadly distributed across the scalp, with visual spatial selectivity differing across electrode locations. Moreover, during active gameplay, neural responses are enhanced at select locations in the visual space. Conventionally, spatial selectivity of neural response has been interpreted as an attentional gain mechanism. In the present study, the data suggest that different brain areas focus attention on different portions of the visual field that are task-relevant, beyond the focus of overt attention.

The administration of the opioid buprenorphine decreases motivational error signals	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Opioids; Buprenorphine; Error processing; Pe; Delta oscillations; Motivation	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RESPONSES; NEGATIVITY; SYSTEM; THETA; DRUG; ERN; NEUROBIOLOGY; SENSITIVITY; MODULATION	While opioid addiction has reached pandemic proportions, we still lack a good understanding of how the administration of opioids interacts with cognitive functions. Error processing - the ability to detect erroneous actions and correct one's behaviour afterwards - is one such cognitive function that might be susceptible to opioidergic influences. Errors are hypothesised to induce aversive negative arousal, while opioids have been suggested to reduce aversive arousal induced by unpleasant and stressful stimuli. Thus, this study investigated whether the acute administration of an opioid would affect error processing. In a double-blind between-subject study, 42 male volunteers were recruited and received either 0.2 mg buprenorphine (a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist and kappa-opioid receptor antagonist) or a placebo pill before they performed a stimulus-response task provoking errors. Electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded while participants performed the task. We observed no group differences in terms of reaction times, error rates, and affective state ratings during the task between buprenorphine and control participants. Additional measures of adaptive control, however, showed interfering effects of buprenorphine administration. On the neural level, decreased Pe (Error Positivity) amplitudes were found in buprenorphine compared to control participants following error commission. Further, frontal delta oscillations were decreased in the buprenorphine group after all responses. Our neural results jointly demonstrate a general reduction in error processing in those participants who received an opioid before task completion, thereby suggesting that opioids might have indeed the potential to dampen motivational error signals. Importantly, the effects of the opioid were evident in more elaborate error processing stages, thereby impacting on processes of conscious error appraisal and evidence accumulation.	[Pfabigan, D.

The aim of this ERP study was to compare the automatic retrieval processes for newly learned voices vs phonemes. In a longitudinal experiment, two groups of participants were trained in learning either a new phoneme or a new voice. The MMN elicited by the presentation of the two was measured before and after the training. An enhanced MMN was elicited by the presentation of the learned phoneme, reflecting the activation of an automatic memory retrieval process. Instead, a reduced MMN was elicited by the learned voice, indicating that the voice was perceived as a typical member of the learned voice identity. This suggests that the automatic processes that retrieve linguistic and vocal information are differently affected by experience.

A theoretically important question concerns the relative time course of these two cognitive processes. The predominant view has been that semantic and phonological codes are accessed in successive stages. However, recent evidence seems difficult to reconcile with a sequential view but rather suggests that both types of codes are accessed in parallel. Here, we used ERPs combined with the "blocked cyclic naming paradigm" in which items overlapped either semantically or phonologically. Behaviorally, both semantic and phonological overlap caused interference relative to unrelated baseline conditions. Crucially, ERP data demonstrated that the semantic and phonological effects emerged at a similar latency (similar to 180 msec after picture onset) and within a similar time window (180-380 msec). These findings suggest that access to phonological information takes place at a relatively early stage during spoken planning, largely in parallel with semantic processing.

Studies investigating the error related negativity (ERN) and the error-positivity (Pe) as electrophysiological markers of error monitoring reported contradictory results for this population. To explain these discrepancies, we hypothesized that psychopathy dimensions influence electrophysiological outcomes. We predicted that individuals with impulsive antisocial features would display abnormal ERN compared to individuals with interpersonal-affective features. A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies investigating ERN and Pe components were conducted. A factorial analysis was undertaken to investigate the role of psychopathy dimensions on ERN and Pe. Compared to controls, psychopathic individuals (n = 940) showed a reduced ERN and Pe amplitude. The factorial analysis indicates a dissociation regarding the construct of psychopathy. The models reported that psychopathic individuals related specifically to the interpersonal-affective dimension displayed normal ERN component and efficient error-monitoring, while psychopathic individuals with a marked impulsive-antisocial dimension display a decreased ERN component and altered performance monitoring.

Behavioral results showed faster responses for bilinguals on interference trials in the nonverbal condition, and electrophysiological results indicated greater attentional control for bilinguals. ROI analyses showed this pattern for bilinguals mainly in the verbal condition, whereas whole brain analyses found this association in both conditions. Frequency power analysis found activity related to interference trials was associated with recruitment of different neural resources for verbal and nonverbal conditions. Nonverbal results indicated beta activity for interference trials in bilinguals and the verbal condition showed this pattern in theta and gamma frequency bands as well, revealing more extensive brain activation in the verbal domain for bilinguals. For monolinguals, frequency power in beta, gamma, and theta were related to facilitation trials. These results suggest different strategies for allocating attention by monolingual and bilingual young adults.

Methods: 27 patients with T1D were classified according to Clarke score as having impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia (IAH; n = 11) or normal awareness to hypoglycaemia (NAH; n = 16). We measured several clinical and sociodemographic variables and cognitive performance using neuropsychological tests. Electroencephalography was assessed during an auditory oddball task. We compared the groups in terms of clinical/sociodemographic variables as well as two event-related brain potentials (ERPs): The P3a which is associated with automatic orientation of attention to novelty, and the P3b which is associated with target detection and processing. Results: The IAH group performed significantly worse on the Trail Making Test part A (TMTA) (p = 0.05). Compared to the NAH group, P3a and P3b amplitudes in the frontal-central sites were significantly lower in the IAH group (p < 0.05). The P3a was strongly associated with worse performance on the TMT-A in the IAH group (r = 0.540; p < 0.005) Conclusion: IAH is accompanied by decreased neurophysiological activity in ERPs associated with information processing and with the automatic orientation of attention to novelty and environmental changes. These findings suggest a possible framework to better understand the cognitive origin of IAH in this patient population. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Maternal criticism and children's neural responses to reward and loss	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Expressed emotion; Maternal Criticism; Parent-child relationships; Event-related potentials; Reward; Children	PARENTAL EXPRESSED EMOTION; NONSUICIDAL SELF-INJURY; FAMILY ENVIRONMENT; LATE CHILDHOOD; HIGH-RISK; DEPRESSION; ANXIETY; MOTHERS; REACTIVITY; FEEDBACK	Parental criticism is linked to a number of detrimental child outcomes. One mechanism by which parental criticism may increase risk for negative outcomes in children is through children's neural responses to valenced information in the environment. The goal of the current study, therefore, was to examine the relation between maternal criticism and children's neural responses to monetary gains and losses. To represent daily environmental experiences of reward and punishment, we focused on reactivity to monetary gains versus losses in a guessing task. Participants were 202 children and their mothers recruited from the community. The average age of the children was 9.71 years (SD = 1.38, range = 7-11), with 52.0% of them male and 72.8% Caucasian. Mothers completed the Five Minute Speech Sample to assess expressed emotion-criticism, and of these dyads 51 mothers were rated as highly critical. In addition, children completed a simple guessing game during which electroencephalography was recorded. Children of critical mothers displayed less neural reactivity to both monetary gain and loss than children without critical mothers. Our results were at least partially independent of children's and mothers' current levels of internalizing psychopathology. These findings suggest that children exposed to maternal criticism may exhibit disruptions in adaptive responses to environmental experiences regardless of valence. Targeted interventions aimed at reducing expressed emo- tion-criticism may lead to changes in a child's reward responsive- ness and risk for psychopathology. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Previous neuroimaging studies have indicated that neural responses of empathy for others' pain are modulated by an early automatic emotional sharing and a late controlled cognitive evaluation process. Recent studies about pain empathy for robots found humans present similar empathy process towards humanoid robots under painful stimuli as well as to humans. However, the whole-brain functional connectivity and the spatial dynamics of neural activities underlying empathic processes are still unknown. In the present study, the functional connectivity was investigated for ERPs recorded from 18 healthy adults who were presented with pictures of human hand and robot hand under painful and non-painful situations. Functional brain networks for both early and late empathy responses were constructed and a new parameter, empathy index (EI), was proposed to represent the empathy ability of humans quantitatively. We found that the mutual dependences between early ERP components was significantly decreased, but for the late components, there were no significant changes. The mutual dependences for human hand stimuli were larger than to robot hand stimuli for early components, but not for late components. The connectivity weights for early components were larger than late components. EI value shows significant difference between painful and non-painful stimuli, indicating it is a good indicator to represent the empathy of humans. This study enriches our understanding of the neurological mechanisms implicated in human empathy, and provides evidence of functional connectivity for both early and late responses of pain empathy towards humans and robots.

Temporal instability in brain activation: a novel paradigm for evaluating the maintenance of attention among substance dependent patients	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Substance dependence; Antisocial personality disorder; Neuroimaging; P300; Electroencephalography; Intraindividual variability	REACTION-TIME VARIABILITY; INTER-TRIAL VARIABILITY; INTRAINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY; P300; ALCOHOL; NEUROPSYCHOLOGY; DISORDERS; BEHAVIOR; COCAINE; HEROIN	Rationale Prior studies have demonstrated statistically significant but subtle differences in brain function between patients with a history of substance dependence (SD) and control groups. Objectives The goal of the present study was to show that variability in brain activation over the trials of a cognitive task is more useful for revealing the putative impact of SD than analyses focusing on the amplitude of activation averaged over trials. The study also tested the additional contribution of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD)-a prevalent comorbidity that promotes both an early onset and more severe course of SD. Methods Two hundred eleven adults performed two selective attention tasks while P300 event-related electroencephalographic potentials were recorded. They were assigned to one of 3 mutually exclusive groups: no lifetime history of SD or ASPD (n = 67), a SD history but no ASPD (n = 68), or both SD and ASPD (n = 76). Results The major finding was a statistically significant elevation of P300 amplitude inter-trial variability (ITV) in the SD plus ASPD group in comparison to the group with neither attribute. The elevation was detected during both selective attention tasks and most prominent at electrodes sites located over the frontal brain. There were no group differences in P300 amplitude averaged over trials. Conclusions We conclude from these findings that the ITV of P300 amplitude is an efficient and sensitive biomarker of the maintenance of attention. It is valuable for revealing group differences associated with substance dependence and ASPD. It may ultimately be valuable for detecting improvements resulting from psychostimulant treatment or other interventions, including cognitive remediation.

Here we focused on the bottom-up mechanisms involved in word-order encoding under the hypothesis of parallel word processing. We recorded EEG while participants performed a visual same-different matching task with sequences of five words (reference sequence followed by a target sequence each presented for 400 ms). The reference sequence could be grammatically correct or an ungrammatical scrambling of the same words (e.g., he wants these green apples/green wants these he apples). Target sequences for 'different' responses were created by either transposing two words in the reference (e.g., he these wants green apples/green these wants he apples), or by changing two words (e.g., he talks their green apples/green talks their he apples). Different responses were harder to make in the transposition condition, and this transposed-word effect started to emerge around 250 ms post-target onset. The transposed-word effect was first seen on an early onsetting N400 component, with reduced amplitudes (i.e., less negative ERPs) in the transposed condition relative to a two-word replacement condition. A later transposed-word effect was seen on a more temporally widespread positive-going component. Converging behavioral and EEG results showed no effects of reference grammaticality on 'different' responses nor an interaction with transposed-word effects. Our results point to the noisy, bottom-up association of word identities to spatiotopic locations as one means of encoding word order information, and one key source of transposed-word effects.

Detection and classification of long-latency own-name auditory evoked potential from electroencephalogram	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; Audio evoked potential; Own name; Familiar name; Evoked potential; Audio stimuli; Self-referential stimuli	BRAIN RESPONSE; ATTENTION; ERP	Auditory Evoked Potential (AEP) is an electrophysiological signal elicited from the brain while an auditory stimulus is presented in a time-locked manner. Previous studies reported the occurrence of AEPs in response to different audio stimuli during the time interval up to 600 ms from the onset of the stimulus. In this paper, we report the occurrence and detection of long-latency AEPs, around 1.5 s after the onset of the stimulus, from the Electroencephalogram (EEG) acquired when the participants listen to voice clips of their own-name. The trial averaged AEPs of 24 participants who listened to audio stimuli of their own-name and familiar-names clearly showed the occurrence of a distinct negative peak around 1.5 s after the onset of the own-name stimulus in Fp1 and F7 EEG electrodes. No such long-latency AEPs were observed when the participants listened to familiar-name stimulus. We classified the own-name and familiar-name averaged AEP responses using a quadratic kernel support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The leave-one-participant-out cross-validation was performed, and the classification accuracy achieved is 80.56 % (corresponding to averaging of 8AEP responses) with a sensitivity of 68.52 % and a specificity of 92.59 %. Our study reveals the occurrence of a distinct long-latency AEP around 1.5 s for own-name stimulus and a higher discrimination ability of participants in discarding non-self-referential stimuli (familiar-name) compared to self-referential stimuli (own-name). The method can be applied for the off-line analysis of own-name AEPs to diagnose mild cognitive impairments and also developmental disorders like autism.	[Jijomon, C. M.; Vinod, A.

Although gaze communication, a well-established nonverbal social behavior, has shown its importance in inferring others' mental states, not much is known about the effects of irrelevant gaze signals on cognitive conflict markers during collaborative settings. In the present study, participants completed a categorization task where they categorized objects based on their color while observing images of a robot. On each trial, participants observed the robot iCub grasping an object from a table and offering it to them to simulate a handover. Once the robot "moved" the object forward, participants were asked to categorize the object according to its color. Before participants were allowed to respond, the robot made a lateral head/gaze shift. The gaze shifts were either congruent or incongruent with the object's color. We expected that incongruent head cues would induce more errors (Study 1), would be associated with more curvature in eye-tracking trajectories (Study 2), and induce larger amplitude in electrophysiological markers of cognitive conflict (Study 3). Results of the three studies show more oculomotor interference as measured in error rates (Study 1), larger curvatures eye-tracking trajectories (Study 2), and higher amplitudes of the N2 ERP component of the EEG signals as well as higher event-related spectral perturbation amplitudes (Study 3) for incongruent trials compared with congruent trials. Our findings reveal that behavioral, ocular, and electrophysiological markers can index the influence of irrelevant signals during goal-oriented tasks.

However, previous methods require human observer to give inputs explicitly (e.g., press buttons, voice interface), burdening the human in the loop of RL agent's learning process. Further, providing explicit human advise (feedback) continuously is not always possible or too restrictive, e.g., autonomous driving, disabled rehabilitation, etc. In this work, we investigate capturing human's intrinsic reactions as implicit (and natural) feedback through EEG in the form of error-related potentials (ErrP), providing a natural and direct way for humans to improve the RL agent learning. As such, the human intelligence can be integrated via implicit feedback with RL algorithms to accelerate the learning of RL agent. We develop three reasonably complex 2D discrete navigational games to experimentally evaluate the overall performance of the proposed work. And the motivation of using ErrPs as feedbacks is also verified by subjective experiments. Major contributions of our work are as follows, (i) we propose and experimentally validate the zero-shot learning of ErrPs, where the ErrPs can be learned for one game, and transferred to other unseen games, (ii) we propose a novel RL framework for integrating implicit human feedbacks via ErrPs with RL agent, improving the label efficiency and robustness to human mis-takes, and (iii) compared to prior works, we scale the application of ErrPs to reasonably complex environ-ments, and demonstrate the significance of our approach for accelerated learning through real user experiments.

Using ERPs and functional Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (fNIRS) we find that short-term (pre--> post-test) and long-term (day1 -> day2 -> day3) attunement to pseudowords is affected by both, learning context and phonotactic status. When real objects are used, fNIRS shows a long-term increase in response magnitude for legal PW. ERPs show a long-term decrease in negativities in response to trained legal PW. Conversely, the pseudo-objects context elicits neuronal attunement to all PW. We propose that legal PW in a real object context cause conflict, leading to difficulties in lexical integration. However, training eases lexical integration of trained legal PW through priming. Our results speak for the early relevance of phonotactics and context in language acquisition.

Electrophysiological signals were recorded in 40 Italian Caucasian participants, unaware of the overall study's purpose. They were presented with 285 sentences that could either violate, non-violate (e.g., "the Roma girl was involved in a robbery) or be neutral with regard to stereotypical concepts concerning other-race people (e.g. Asians, Africans, Arabic). ERPs were time-locked to the terminal words. Prior to the sentence reading task, participants were exposed to a 10 minutes colourful video documentary. While the experimental group was presented a video containing images picturing other-race characters involved in "prestigious" activities that violated stereotypical negative assumptions (e.g. a black neurosurgeon leading a surgery team), the control group viewed a neutral documentary about flora and fauna. EEG signals were then recorded during the sentence reading task to explore whether the previous exposure to the experimental video could modulate the detection of incongruence in the sentences violating stereotypes, as marked by the N400 response. A fictitious task was adopted, consisted in detecting rare animal names. Indeed, only the control group showed a greater N400 response (350-550 ms) to words incongruent with ethnic stereotypes compared to congruent and neutral ones, thus suggesting the presence of a racial bias. No N400 response was found for the experimental group, suggesting a lack of negative expectation for OR individuals. The swLORETA inverse solution, performed on the prejudicerelated N400 showed that the Inferior Temporal and the Superior and Middle Frontal Gyri were the strongest N400 intra-cortical sources. Regardless of the experimental manipulation, Congruent terminal words evoked a greater P300 response (500-600 ms) compared to incongruent and neutral ones and a late frontal positivity (650-800 ms) was found to be larger to sentences involving OR than own-race characters (either congruent or incongruent with the prejudice) thus possibly indicating bias-free perceptual in-group/out-group categorization processes. The data showed how it is possible to modulate a pre-existing racial prejudice (as reflected by N400 effect) through exposure to positive media-driven information about OR people. Further follow-up studies should determine the duration in time, and across contexts, of this modulatory effect.

However, a key feature of our perceptual system is the ease with which the input of a wide set of naturalistic co-occurring information is dealt with. This study investigated whether, during perception of real-world surface material, a conceptual representation is built that has the potential to interact with a linguistic description of the material directly. Short sentences were presented (e.g., This surface is smooth) followed by a matching or mismatching picture of a real-world surface material. The results showed early cross-modal integration effects during material surface perception in an N400-like potential, originating approximately 280 ms after stimulus presentation. Overall, these findings suggest a rather early influence of linguistic information on material perception, suggesting that in line with object representation, real-world materials are represented in the brain in a format that allows interaction with non-visual information.

On the other hand, mammalian sleep is also characterized by the interplay between periods of increased sleep depth and environmental alertness. Whereas the heterogeneity of microstates during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep was extensively studied in the last decades, transient microstates during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep received less attention. REM sleep features two distinct microstates: phasic and tonic. Previous studies indicate that sensory processing is largely diminished during phasic REM periods, whereas environmental alertness is partially reinstated when the brain switches into tonic REM sleep. Here, we investigated interoceptive processing as quantified by the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP) during REM microstates. We contrasted the HEPs of phasic and tonic REM periods using two separate databases that included the nighttime polysomnographic recordings of healthy young individuals (N = 20 and N = 19). We find a differential HEP modulation of a late HEP component (after 500 ms post-R-peak) between tonic and phasic REM. Moreover, the late tonic HEP component resembled the HEP found in resting wakefulness. Our results indicate that interoception with respect to cardiac signals is not uniform across REM microstates, and suggest that interoceptive processing is partially reinstated during tonic REM periods. The analyses of the HEP during REM sleep may shed new light on the organization and putative function of REM microstates. Statement of Significance Rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep is a heterogeneous sleep state characterized by transient periods with (phasic REM) and without (tonic REM) eye movements. Phasic and tonic REM periods differ in spontaneous cortical activity, awakening thresholds, and the processing of external inputs (exteroception). To date, no previous studies have explicitly investigated the processing of internal (or endogenous) signals during phasic and tonic REM microstates. In this study, we examined the heartbeat evoked potential, a cortical response to heartbeats reflecting interoceptive processing. Our findings show that interoceptive processing is differently modulated by phasic and tonic REM microstates, and indicate that interoceptive processing is partially reinstated in tonic REM periods.

J	Wang, YW; Yang, X; Yao, XQ; Fu, C				Wang, Yiwen; Yang, Xue; Yao, Xiaoqiang; Fu, Chao			Computational methods of brain-to-brain coupling during human interaction	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE			Chinese	Article						hyperscanning; brain-to-brain coupling; inter-brain synchronization; social interaction; coupling intensity	PARTIAL DIRECTED COHERENCE; SOCIAL-INTERACTION; PRISONERS-DILEMMA; GAMMA ACTIVITY; SYNCHRONY; CONNECTIVITY; DYNAMICS; OSCILLATIONS; INFORMATION; INTEGRATION	Hyperscanning-the simultaneous recording of hemodynamic or neuroelectric activity of the brain-is the new technology to directly observe the brain communication between individuals. Since the publication of the first hyperscanning study in 2002, it has developed rapidly in the past decade. Brain-to-brain coupling (BBC) technology of human interaction was widely used in the research of action coordination, cooperative game, classroom teaching and other interactive tasks, which involved the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and other neuroimaging technologies. In addition, hyperscanning research experienced a leap from pseudo-interaction to real interaction, a leap from a strictly controlled laboratory paradigm to the "field research" paradigm in nature situations. Based on the differentiation and analysis of the core concepts such as coupling and synchronization, taking the development of time and technology as the main line, this paper reviewed the common BBC indicators and their application conditions, introduced the related theories and forecasted the future research direction of BBC. In hyperscanning study, BBC refers to the interaction and influence of two or more brains, or between two or more brain regions within a single brain, while the inter-brain synchronization (IBS) refers to the consistency (relative stability) in frequency, phase, and other characteristics of signals from different brain or different regions of the brain. Thus, the similarities and differences between hyperscanning, BBC and IBS can be summarized as follows: Hyperscanning is the technique of recording the neural activity of two or more brains simultaneously. BBC refers to the interaction or interaction between two or more brains. BBC sometimes manifests as IBS, the degree of IBS can represent the strength of BBC in this case, but BBC is not the same as IBS: (1) In addition to IBS, BBC can also be manifested as functional connections and interactions between the brains; (2) due to the possibility of pseudo-synchronization, the occurrence of IBS does not mean that there must be BBC. In the field of physics and electronic engineering, the characteristics of a signal can be described by multiple indicators such as amplitude, period, frequency and phase. Accordingly, neurologic studies have found that brain activity induced by external events may take the form of phase response, frequency response, amplitude response, and production of new components. Therefore, it is not surprising that many different indicators are used to characterize the strength of BBC in existing hyperscanning studies. These indicators including the circular correlation coefficient (CCorr), wavelet transform coherence (WTC), directed coherence, phase-locking value (PLV), the coupling indexes based on the event-related potentials (ERP) such as the latency difference and the amplitude difference, the coupling indexes based on the Graph Theory such as the shortest path length, global efficiency, local efficiency, divisibility, modularity, small-word network. Through the review, we found the following three issues deserve the attention of the future hyperscanning research. Firstly, as different coupling indicators have different characteristics and applicable conditions, we suggest that the selection of indicators should be based on specific research methods, technical equipment and research problems. There are no best indicators, only the most suitable ones. Secondly, the existing theory of BBC is not complete, integrating existing theories and proposing theories with stronger explanatory power should be the focus of future hyperscanning theory research. Thirdly, there are many forms of coupling in neural processing, and the meaning of coupling is different in different forms. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account the comprehensive consideration of the specific research task type, interactive mode and other factors when discussing the significance of coupling.

However, it is not clear how and to what extent those mechanisms interact with each other. On the one hand, richer semantic context could enhance the perceptual representation of a predictable stimulus, thus improving speech entrainment. On the other hand, pre-activating an upcoming item could inhibit further bottom-up analyses to minimize processing costs, thus weakening speech entrainment. To test these competing hypotheses, we recorded EEG activity from 27 participants while they listened to a 14-min recording of text reading. The passage contained target words presented twice: once in a highly constraining and once in a minimally constraining context. First, we measured event related potentials on target words in the two conditions. In line with previous research, we showed that semantic predictability modulated the N400 amplitude: words in minimally constraining contexts elicited larger negative amplitudes than words in highly constraining contexts between 250 and 450 ms. Second, we evaluated speech entrainment effects by analyzing phase alignment between neural activity and the envelope of target words. Importantly, we found increased speech entrainment for words in minimally constraining compared to highly constraining contexts between 400 and 450 ms. Both effects were located in central electrodes and were significantly correlated. Our results indicate a trade-off between semantic pre-activation and cortical entrainment to speech and support the cost minimization hypothesis.

The ability to suppress thinking of palatable food cues is crucial to control hedonic eating; nevertheless, little research has been conducted to explore inhibitory control in cognitive processes among restrained eaters. To address this gap, this study primed restrained eaters with negative (n = 23) or neutral emotions (n = 24) and applied a Think/No-think paradigm to explore their retrieval facilitation/suppression ability for food cues, while recording Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Results indicated that the recall rate of the No-think condition (retrieval suppressing task) was higher than the Think condition (retrieval task). Negative affect did not influence the recall rate, but it did evoke smaller N2 amplitudes, larger P2 and P3 amplitudes, as well as late positive component (LPC) amplitudes. Among these components, P2 evoked by the No-think and Think conditions was larger than the perceptual control condition. Our findings suggested that in negative moods, restrained eaters need to allocate more attentional resources to suppress food cues. The findings further demonstrated that the influence of negative moods appeared at an early stage of cognitive processing and caused a resource depletion in memory suppression. This research provides a neurophysiological basis for understanding emotional influences on the process of restrained eaters' inhibition control for external food cues.

Curved vs. Straight-Line Handwriting Effects on Word Recognition in Typical and Dyslexic Readers Across Chinese and English	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						handwriting; drawing; visual word recognition; N170; laterality; Chinese; English	EARLY ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE; BRAIN ACTIVITY; TIME-COURSE; CHILDREN; PERCEPTION; EXPERTISE; N170; EXPERIENCE; MOTOR; ERP	Handwriting serves to link auditory and motor routines with visual word processing, which is a hallmark of successful reading. The current study aims to explore the effect of multisensory integration as a pathway to neural specialization for print among typical and dyslexic readers across writing systems. We identified 9-10-year-old dyslexic Chinese children (n = 24) and their typically developing counterparts (n = 24) on whom we conducted both behavioral and electroencephalogram (EEG) experiments. We designed four learning conditions: Handwriting Chinese (HC), Viewing Chinese (VC), Drawing followed by Character Recognition in Chinese (D-C), and Drawing followed by Word Recognition in English (D-E). In both handwriting and drawing conditions, we also designed curved vs. straight-line stimuli. Both behavioral and EEG results showed that handwriting straight line strokes facilitated visual word recognition in Chinese compared to handwriting curved lines. Handwriting conditions resulted in a lateralization of the N170 in typical readers, but not the dyslexic readers. Interestingly, drawing curved lines facilitate word recognition in English among dyslexic readers. Taken together, the results of the study suggest benefits of handwriting on the neural processing and behavioral performance in response to Chinese character recognition and curved-line drawing effects on English word recognition among dyslexic readers. But the lack of handwriting effects in dyslexic readers suggest that students who have deficits in reading may also be missing the link between multisensory integration and word recognition in the visual word form areas. The current study results have implications for maintaining handwriting practices to promote perception and motor integration for visual word form area development for normal readers and suggest that drawing practices might benefit Chinese dyslexic readers in reading English.

However, much remains unknown for its immediate vs. long-term influences. We employed behavioral and electrophysiological measures to investigate the short- and long-term impacts of sleep vs. sleep deprivation on emotional memory. Methods: Fifty-nine participants incidentally learned 60 negative and 60 neutral pictures in the evening and were randomly assigned to either sleep or sleep deprivation conditions. We measured memory recognition and subjective affective ratings in 12- and 60-h post-encoding tests, with EEGs in the delayed test. Results: In a 12-h post-encoding test, compared to sleep deprivation, sleep equally preserved both negative and neutral memory, and their affective tones. In the 60-h post-encoding test, negative and neutral memories declined significantly in the sleep group, with attenuated emotional responses to negative memories over time. Furthermore, two groups showed spatial-temporally distinguishable ERPs at the delayed test: while both groups showed the old-new frontal negativity (300-500 ms, FN400), sleep-deprived participants additionally showed an old-new parietal, Late Positive Component effect (600-1000 ms, LPC). Multivariate whole-brain ERPs analyses further suggested that sleep prioritized neural representation of emotion over memory processing, while they were less distinguishable in the sleep deprivation group. Conclusions: These data suggested that sleep's impact on emotional memory and affective responses is time-dependent: sleep preserved memories and affective tones in the short term, while ameliorating affective tones in the long term. Univariate and multivariate EEG analyses revealed different neurocognitive processing of remote, emotional memories between sleep and sleep deprivation groups.

This region was targeted via repetitive applications of anodal, high-definition transcranial direct current simulation (HD-tDCS) on five consecutive days in 33 ADHD patients (10-17years) and in a healthy control group (n = 13, only sham). Patients received either sham (n = 13) or verum tDCS with 0.5mA (n = 9) or 0.25mA (n = 11) depending on individual cutaneous sensitivity. During stimulation, participants performed a combined working memory and response inhibition paradigm (n-back/nogo). At baseline, post, and a 4-month follow up, electroencephalography was recorded during this task. Moreover, interference control (flanker task) and spatial working memory (spanboard task) were assessed to explore possible transfer effects. Omission errors and reaction time variability in all tasks served as measures of attention. In the 0.25mA group increased nogo commission errors indicated a detrimental tDCS effect on response inhibition. After the 5-day stimulation, attentional improvements in the 0.5mA group were indicated by reduced omission errors and reaction time variability. Variability improvements were still evident at follow up. In all groups, nogo P3 amplitudes were reduced post-stimulation, but in the 0.5mA group this reduction was smaller than in the 0.25mA group. Results of the current study suggest distinct effects of tDCS with different current intensities demonstrating the importance of a deeper understanding on the impact of stimulation parameters and repeated tDCS applications to develop effective tDCS-based therapy approaches in ADHD.

This activation generates an ERP called the Sustained Posterior Negativity (SPN). In most studies so far, the stimuli have been defined by luminance. We tested whether the SPN is present when stimuli are defined by stereoscopic disparity using random dot stereograms (RDS). In Experiment 1, we compared the SPN signal for contours specified by binocular disparity and contours specified by monocular cues. The SPN was equivalent, suggesting that the type of contour does not alter the SPN signal. In Experiment 2 we exploited the unique property of RDS to provide unambiguous figure-ground arrangements. Psychophysical work has shown that symmetry is more easily detected when it is a property of a single object (i.e., within a figure), compared to a property of a gap between two objects (i.e., the ground). Therefore, the target regions in this experiment could either be foreground or background. The SPN onset was delayed when the symmetry was in a ground region. This may be because object formation interferes with the processing of shape information in the ground region.	[Karakashevska, Elena; Rampone, Giulia; Tyson-Carr, John; Makin, Alexis D.

To test this hypothesis, the present study investigated the effects of acute stress on behavioural and electrophysiological measures of human attentional networks, and behavioural measures of working memory. Forty-five female participants (Mage = 22.1, SD = 2.4) performed the Attention Network Test (ANT) and the n-back task before and after the Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST; n = 23) or a non-stressful MAST-placebo (n = 22). Subjective distress ratings and salivary cortisol concentrations revealed a successful stress induction. Increased salivary cortisol at baseline was associated with slower reaction times across both tasks, suggesting a general detrimental effect of cortisol on cognitive functioning. Despite these findings, however, the hypothesised effects of the acute stress manipulation were not found for either task. Supplementary analyses indicated that these results were unrelated to the magnitude or duration of the stress response. Our results therefore suggest the standard version of the ANT may be insensitive to the effects of acute stress, and that higher cognitive loads may be necessary to observe stress effects on the n-back task.

Reduced influence of perceptual context in schizophrenia: behavioral and neurophysiological evidence	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Context; contour; EEG; perception; psychosis; schizophrenia	SENSORY EVIDENCE ACCUMULATION; SURROUND SUPPRESSION; VISUAL CONTEXT; CONTOUR INTEGRATION; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; TIME-COURSE; P300; CONTRAST; ORGANIZATION; METAANALYSIS	Background Accurate perception of visual contours is essential for seeing and differentiating objects in the environment. Both the ability to detect visual contours and the influence of perceptual context created by surrounding stimuli are diminished in people with schizophrenia (SCZ). The central aim of the present study was to better understand the biological underpinnings of impaired contour integration and weakened effects of perceptual context. Additionally, we sought to determine whether visual perceptual abnormalities reflect genetic factors in SCZ and are present in other severe mental disorders. Methods We examined behavioral data and event-related potentials (ERPs) collected during the perception of simple linear contours embedded in similar background stimuli in 27 patients with SCZ, 23 patients with bipolar disorder (BP), 23 first-degree relatives of SCZ, and 37 controls. Results SCZ exhibited impaired visual contour detection while BP exhibited intermediate performance. The orientation of neighboring stimuli (i.e. flankers) relative to the contour modulated perception across all groups, but SCZ exhibited weakened suppression by the perceptual context created by flankers. Late visual (occipital P2) and cognitive (centroparietal P3) neural responses showed group differences and flanker orientation effects, unlike earlier ERPs (occipital P1 and N1). Moreover, behavioral effects of flanker context on contour perception were correlated with modulation in P2 & P3 amplitudes. Conclusion In addition to replicating and extending findings of abnormal contour integration and visual context modulation in SCZ, we provide novel evidence that the abnormal use of perceptual context is associated with higher-order sensory and cognitive processes.

The extrastriate symmetry response is robust to variation in visual memory load	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; memory; sustained posterior negativity; symmetry; visual working memory	WORKING-MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL INDEXES; FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE; DELAY ACTIVITY; HUMAN BRAIN; COLOR; CORTEX; REGULARITY; CAPACITY	An Event Related Potential response to visual symmetry, known as the Sustained Posterior Negativity (SPN), is generated whether symmetry is task relevant or not, and whether symmetry is attended or not. However, no study has yet examined interference from concurrent memory tasks. To answer this fundamental question, we investigated whether the SPN is robust to variation in Visual Working Memory (VWM) load. In Experiment 1 (N = 24), each trial involved a sample display, a probe and a test display. Sample and test displays contained either four colors or four black shapes, and the probe was either a symmetrical or random pattern. We compared a memory task and a passive viewing task. In the memory task, participants held color or shape information in VWM when the probe was presented. In the passive viewing task, there were no memory demands. Contrary to our predictions, there was no evidence that VWM interfered with the symmetry response. Instead, there was a general SPN enhancement during both color and shape memory tasks compared to passive viewing. In Experiment 2 (N = 24), we used symmetrical patterns themselves as sample and test to maximize interference. Again, the SPN was enhanced in the memory task compared to passive viewing. We conclude that the visual symmetry response is not impaired by concurrent VWM tasks, even when these tasks involve remembering symmetry itself. It seems that the SPN is not only attention-proof, but also memory-proof. This adds to evidence that symmetry perception is robust and automatic.

J	Barcelo, F				Barcelo, Francisco			A Predictive Processing Account of Card Sorting: Fast Proactive and Reactive Frontoparietal Cortical Dynamics during Inference and Learning of Perceptual Categories	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review							INFORMATION-THEORETICAL APPROACH; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; COGNITIVE FLEXIBILITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; NEURAL MECHANISMS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; BRAIN; TASK; COMPONENT	For decades, a common assumption in cognitive neuroscience has been that prefrontal executive control is mainly engaged during target detection [Posner, M. I., & Petersen, S. E. The attention system of the human brain. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 13, 25-42, 1990]. More recently, predictive processing theories of frontal function under the Bayesian brain hypothesis emphasize a key role of proactive control for anticipatory action selection (i.e., planning as active inference). Here, we review evidence of fast and widespread EEG and magnetoencephalographic fronto-temporo-parietal cortical activations elicited by feedback cues and target cards in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. This evidence is best interpreted when considering negative and positive feedback as predictive cues (i.e., sensory outcomes) for proactively updating beliefs about unknown perceptual categories. Such predictive cues inform posterior beliefs about high-level hidden categories governing subsequent response selection at target onset. Quite remarkably, these new views concur with Don Stuss' early findings concerning two broad classes of P300 cortical responses evoked by feedback cues and target cards in a computerized Wisconsin Card Sorting Test analogue. Stuss' discussion of those P300 responses-in terms of the resolution of uncertainty about response (policy) selection as well as the participants' expectancies for future perceptual or motor activities and their timing-was prescient of current predictive processing and active (Bayesian) inference theories. From these new premises, a domain-general frontoparietal cortical network is rapidly engaged during two temporarily distinct stages of inference and learning of perceptual categories that underwrite goal-directed card sorting behavior, and they each engage prefrontal executive functions in fundamentally distinct ways.

There has been discussion in the scientific literature as to whether patients with FM suffer from a generalized attentional deficit or an attentional bias-preferentially selecting pain-related information. Attentional bias in FM patients has been studied as hypervigilance, which refers to early detection of pain-related information or innocuous information. Thus, the aim of this study was to test whether there is a generalized attentional deficit or attentional bias in relation to pain in patients with FM, by studying the neural activity underlying cognitive processes, specifically with evoked potentials (P300 and late positive potential-LPP). The P300 has been related to the use of attentional resources and the LPP to affective modulation. For this purpose, we studied two groups: a group of patients with FM and a healthy control group. Our hypotheses considered that FM patients, compared to healthy controls, would show an attentional bias for pain-related words (1) reflected in higher hits and shorter reaction time when detecting the target of a cognitive task (dot-probe), and (2) manifested by increased amplitudes of P300 and LPP evoked potentials while performing the task. The electrophysiological results suggest that FM patients may have a generalized attentional deficit and, despite this being the case, FM patients are more emotionally involved in the task. Introduction The present research investigates the neural correlates of attentional bias in fibromyalgia (FM) with a dot-probe task performed during an electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. Methods For this purpose, 30 female participants were recruited, divided into two groups: a group of patients with FM (FM, n = 15, M-age = 51.87) and a healthy control group (HC) (HC, n = 15, M-age = 46.13). Results The results did not show behavioral differences between groups, but the EEG results showed that healthy controls had larger P300 amplitudes than patients with FM. Regarding late positive potentials (LPP), we found that patients with FM had larger amplitudes than healthy controls in a later time window. Conclusion In summary, while the P300 results suggest that patients allocate less attentional resources to the task, the increased amplitudes of their LPP suggest augmented emotional processing of the target stimuli. Altogether, our results seem to support the thesis of generalized attentional deficits in FM.

As an alternative means, auditory BCIs have been developed, but reportedly showed relatively low performance. To elucidate the performance gap, this study investigated the feature domain between the auditory and visual BCIs, along with the audiovisual BCI as the combination of the two. Not only the online test, but also a cross-modality assessment was conducted to compare the performance of three modalities, revealing that the classification performance became significantly low when the feature of the auditory BCI was included. When comparing the features that showed significant differences between the target and nontarget stimuli of each subject in each modality, significant individual differences in selected features were more pronounced in the auditory BCI than others, meaning that the common features across subjects were scarce for the auditory BCI. Moreover, the biggest decrease was shown in the auditory modality when comparing the performance of online test and Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) cross validation, which was conducted with selected features. Our results suggest potential sources of the performance gap between auditory and visual BCIs in the context of feature domain.

Investigating Changes in Reward-Related Neural Correlates After PEERS Intervention in Adolescents With ASD: Preliminary Evidence of a "Precision Medicine" Approach	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						reward processing; PEERS intervention; autism; social motivation; precision medicine	AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER; SOCIAL-SKILLS; YOUNG-CHILDREN; BRAIN ACTIVITY; MOTIVATION; ADULTS; INDIVIDUALS; IMPAIRMENT; MECHANISMS; POSITIVITY	Background: The Social Motivation Hypothesis proposes that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience social interactions as less rewarding than their neurotypical (TD) peers, which may lead to reduced social initiation. Existing studies of the brain's reward system in individuals with ASD report varied findings for anticipation of and response to social rewards. Given discrepant findings, the anticipation of and response to social rewards should be further evaluated, particularly in the context of intervention outcome. We hypothesized that individual characteristics may help predict neural changes from pre- to post-intervention.Methods: Thirteen adolescents with ASD received the Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills (PEERS) intervention for 16 weeks; reward-related EEG was collected before and after intervention. Fourteen TD adolescents were tested at two timepoints but did not receive intervention. Event-related potentials were calculated to measure anticipation of (stimulus-preceding negativity; SPN) and response to (reward-related positivity; RewP) social and non-social rewards. Additionally, measures of social responsiveness, social skills, and intervention-engagement were collected. Group differences were analyzed as well as individual differences using prediction models.Result: Parent-reported social responsiveness and social skills improved in adolescents with ASD after participation in PEERS. ASD adolescents displayed marginally decreased anticipation of social rewards at post-intervention compared to pre-intervention. Regression models demonstrated that older adolescents and those with lower parent-reported social motivation prior to participation in PEERS displayed marginally increased social reward anticipation (more robust SPN) from pre- to post-intervention. Participants who displayed more parent-reported social motivation before intervention and were more actively engaged in the PEERS intervention evidenced increased social reward processing (more robust RewP) from pre- to post-intervention.Conclusion: Findings suggest that there may be differences in saliency between wanting/anticipating social rewards vs. liking/responding to social rewards in individuals with ASD. Our findings support the hypothesis that identification of individual differences may predict which adolescents are poised to benefit the most from particular interventions. As such, reported findings set the stage for the advancement of "precision medicine." This investigation is a critical step forward in our ability to understand and predict individual response to interventions in individuals with ASD.

An ERP study on proactive and reactive response inhibition in individuals with schizotypy	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							STOP-SIGNAL PROBABILITY; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; COGNITIVE CONTROL; N2/P3 COMPLEX; SCHIZOPHRENIA; CORTEX; DISCRIMINATION; PERSONALITY; BRAIN; P300	Schizotypy, a subclinical group at risk for schizophrenia, has been found to show impairments in response inhibition. However, it remains unclear whether this impairment is accompanied by outright stopping (reactive inhibition) or preparation for stopping (proactive inhibition). We recruited 20 schizotypy and 24 non-schizotypy individuals to perform a modified stop-signal task with electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded. This task consists of three conditions based on the probability of stop signal: 0% (no stop trials, only go trials), 17% (17% stop trials), and 33% (33% stop trials), the conditions were indicated by the colour of go stimuli. For proactive inhibition (go trials), individuals with schizotypy exhibited significantly lesser increase in go response time (RT) as the stop signal probability increasing compared to non-schizotypy individuals. Individuals with schizotypy also exhibited significantly increased N1 amplitude on all levels of stop signal probability and increased P3 amplitude in the 17% stop condition compared with non-schizotypy individuals. For reactive inhibition (stop trials), individuals with schizotypy exhibited significantly longer stop signal reaction time (SSRT) in both 17% and 33% stop conditions and smaller N2 amplitude on stop trials in the 17% stop condition than non-schizotypy individuals. These findings suggest that individuals with schizotypy were impaired in both proactive and reactive response inhibition at behavioural and neural levels.

We utilized taboo words, whose meanings are typically acquired socially, to ensure that differences in processing were based on learned social taboo, rather than proficiency. American English-speaking participants made word/non-word decisions on American taboo (native dialect), British taboo (non-native dialect), positive, neutral, and pseudo- words while EEG was recorded. Taboo words were verified as taboo by both American and British English speakers in an independent norming survey. American taboo words showed a more positive amplitude of the Late Positive Complex (LPC), a neural correlate of emotionality and social processing, compared with British taboo words and all other word categories. Moreover, in an item-wise analysis, LPC amplitudes of American taboo words were positively correlated with their taboo ratings. British taboo words did not show this effect. This indicates that American participants, who had very limited social contact with British English, did not have the same perception of social threat from British taboo words as they had from American taboo words. These results point to the importance of social context of acquisition in establishing social-affective meaning in language.

Expectations of reward and efficacy guide cognitive control allocation	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; MOTOR PREPARATION; PRIOR PROBABILITY; TASK-DIFFICULTY; ERROR; DECISION; ATTENTION; ERP; MOTIVATION	The amount of mental effort we invest in a task is influenced by the reward we can expect if we perform that task well. However, some of the rewards that have the greatest potential for driving these efforts are partly determined by factors beyond one's control. In such cases, effort has more limited efficacy for obtaining rewards. According to the Expected Value of Control theory, people integrate information about the expected reward and efficacy of task performance to determine the expected value of control, and then adjust their control allocation (i.e., mental effort) accordingly. Here we test this theory's key behavioral and neural predictions. We show that participants invest more cognitive control when this control is more rewarding and more efficacious, and that these incentive components separately modulate EEG signatures of incentive evaluation and proactive control allocation. Our findings support the prediction that people combine expectations of reward and efficacy to determine how much effort to invest. People only exert cognitive effort if they think the benefits outweigh the costs. Here, the authors show that people assess these benefits by considering expected rewards and how much their effort matters for obtaining those rewards, and then integrating these to determine how much effort to exert.

Electrophysiological and behavioral indices of cognitive conflict processing across adolescence	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Adolescence; Cognitive development; Conflict monitoring; N2; P3; Gratton effect	RESPONSE-INHIBITION; INTERFERENCE CONTROL; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; POTENTIAL ERP; FRONTAL-LOBE; MATURATION; COMPONENT; CHILDREN; NEGATIVITY; CHILDHOOD	Cognitive control enables goal-oriented adaptation to a fast-changing environment and has a protracted development spanning into young adulthood. The neurocognitive processes underlying this development are poorly understood. In a cross-sectional sample of participants 8?19 years old (n = 108), we used blind source separation of EEG data recorded in a Flanker task to derive electrophysiological measures of attention and conflict processing, including a N2-like frontal negative component and a P3-like parietal positive component. Outside the recording session, we examined multiple behavioral measures of interference control derived from the Flanker, Stroop, and Anti-saccade tasks. We found a positive association between age and P3 amplitude, but no relationship between age and N2 amplitude. A stronger N2 was age-independently related to better performance on Stroop and Anti-saccade measures of interference control. A Gratton effect was found on the Flanker task, with slower reaction times on current congruent and better accuracy on current incongruent trials when preceded by incongruent as opposed to congruent trials. The Gratton effect on accuracy was positively associated with age. Together, the findings suggest a multifaceted developmental pattern of the neurocognitive processes involved in conflict processing across adolescence, with a more protracted development of the P3 compared to the N2.

Invariability of EEG error-related potentials during continuous feedback protocols elicited by erroneous actions at predicted or unpredicted states	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						error-related potentials; continuous feedback protocols; asynchronous decoding; transfer learning	BRAIN-ACTUATED WHEELCHAIR; ERP COMPONENTS; PERFORMANCE; DYNAMICS	Objective. When humans perceive an erroneous action, an EEG error-related potential (ErrP) is elicited as a neural response. ErrPs have been largely investigated in discrete feedback protocols, where actions are executed at discrete steps, to enable seamless brain-computer interaction. However, there are only a few studies that investigate ErrPs in continuous feedback protocols. The objective of the present study is to better understand the differences between two types of ErrPs elicited during continuous feedback protocols, where errors may occur either at predicted or unpredicted states. We hypothesize that ErrPs of the unpredicted state is associated with longer latency as it requires higher cognitive workload to evaluate actions compared to the predicted states. Approach. Participants monitored the trajectory of an autonomous cursor that occasionally made erroneous actions on its way to the target in two conditions, namely, predicted or unpredicted states. After characterizing the ErrP waveform elicited by erroneous actions in the two conditions, we performed single-trial decoding of ErrPs in both synchronous (i.e. time-locked to the onset of the erroneous action) and asynchronous manner. Furthermore, we explored the possibility to transfer decoders built with data of one of the conditions to the other condition. Main results. As hypothesized, erroneous actions at unpredicted states gave rise to ErrPs with higher latency than erroneous actions at predicted states, a correlate of higher cognitive effort in the former condition. Moreover, ErrP decoders trained in a given condition successfully transferred to the other condition with a slight loss of classification performance. This was the case for synchronous as well as asynchronous ErrP decoding, showing the invariability of ErrPs across conditions. Significance. These results advance the characterization of ErrPs during continuous feedback protocols, enlarging the potential use of ErrPs during natural operation of brain-controlled devices as it is not necessary to have different decoders for each kind of erroneous conditions.

In patients with long term illness, such as Hypertrophic Pachymeningitis (HP) still under diagnosis, therefore no possible to properly cure, it might be the only outcome achievable (Netuveli et al. 2005; Trystuta 2017). The problem becomes even more serious when occurs in young person: starting a family and caring for children becomes hard or even impossible, because of his/her physical and psychical conditions. Most clinicians are aware of the importance for quality of life of this functional limitation, but there are no articles describing this problem in the literature. We aimed to fill this gap in knowledge. Case study: 29 year old patient, a car mechanic, married, with 4-year-old son, with the long history of the illnes, and especially persistent, diffuse, non-specific headaches, frequent seizures and cognitive deterioration which have been particularly troublesome recently. He was finalny diagnosed with Hypertrophic Pachymeningitis (HP) associated with Immunoglobulin G4-related (IgG4) with the use of specific diagnostic criteria for HP associated with IgG4-RD (IgG4-HP), which rely on histopathologic analysis (Lindstrom et al. 2010; Lu et al 2014). Computed tomography (CT) of the head showed massive calcifications visible along the cerebellar tentorium on the right side, along the cerebral falx, as well as on dura mater on the cranial vault of both cerebral hemispheres. The patient was diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency (D 83), thrombocytopenia, chronic EBV hepatitis and epilepsy. IgG4-HP was confirmed by CT, MRI and biopsy (IG94-RHP antibody was detected). The treatment with steroids, and immunosuppressive therapy (RTX) was introduced (as it was suggested by Levraut et al. (2019). It should be stressed that he had a significantly reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL), mainly because of long-lasting illness, diverse symptoms, often hospitalization, complex differential diagnosis, and especially biopsy which requires neurosurgical intervention, which affect his physical and mental well-being, especially cognitive control, and not possibility to take care of his family. To help the patient we introduce HBI methodology (Kropotov 2016), that is an evaluation of working brain in milliseconds. Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG), event-related potentials (ERPs) and low-resolution sLORETA tomography were performed. We did not found any paroxysm of 3 Hz rhythm in Eyes Closed (EO) and in Eyes Open (EO) conditions, however the ERPs deviations from the reference indicate deficit of cognitive control (decrease of P3 NOGO wave in comparison to 100 persons from the normative data base from the Human Brain Index in Chur, Switzerland Therefore, the patient was offered Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (atDC) combined with goal-oriented psychotherapy program. It was found that after 40 days of therapy, cognitive control returned, which was translated into a better quality of life related to the patient's health, measure in the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36). Conclusions: The patient returned to his previous job as a head of car mechanic service. Final diagnosis of IgG4-HP and subsequently, proper farrnacotherapy, and introduction of HBI methodology allowing for the selection of an adequate method of neurotherapy, for our patient the transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) combined with goaloriented psychotherapy, was helpful in the improvement of his quality of life.

J	Fu, ZA; Monahan, PJ				Fu, Zhanao; Monahan, Philip J.			Extracting Phonetic Features From Natural Classes: A Mismatch Negativity Study of Mandarin Chinese Retroflex Consonants	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mismatch negativity (MMN); retroflex; Chinese; EEG &#8211; electroencephalogram; speech perception; phonology; phonetics; phonetic features		How speech sounds are represented in the brain is not fully understood. The mismatch negativity (MMN) has proven to be a powerful tool in this regard. The MMN event-related potential is elicited by a deviant stimulus embedded within a series of repeating standard stimuli. Listeners construct auditory memory representations of these standards despite acoustic variability. In most designs that test speech sounds, however, this variation is typically intra-category: All standards belong to the same phonetic category. In the current paper, inter-category variation is presented in the standards. These standards vary in manner of articulation but share a common phonetic feature. In the standard retroflex experimental block, Mandarin Chinese speaking participants are presented with a series of "standard" consonants that share the feature [retroflex], interrupted by infrequent non-retroflex deviants. In the non-retroflex standard experimental block, non-retroflex standards are interrupted by infrequent retroflex deviants. The within-block MMN was calculated, as was the identity MMN (iMMN) to account for intrinsic differences in responses to the stimuli. We only observed a within-block MMN to the non-retroflex deviant embedded in the standard retroflex block. This suggests that listeners extract [retroflex] despite significant inter-category variation. In the non-retroflex standard block, because there is little on which to base a coherent auditory memory representation, no within-block MMN was observed. The iMMN to the retroflex was observed in a late time-window at centro-parieto-occipital electrode sites instead of fronto-central electrodes, where the MMN is typically observed, potentially reflecting the increased difficulty posed by the added variation in the standards. In short, participants can construct auditory memory representations despite significant acoustic and inter-category phonological variation so long as a shared phonetic feature binds them together.

J	Hodapp, A; Rabovsky, M				Hodapp, Alice; Rabovsky, Milena			The N400 ERP component reflects an error-based implicit learning signal during language comprehension	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						adaptation; EEG; expectancy; implicit learning; prediction error	EXPLICIT MEMORY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; PREDICTION ERROR; WORD REPETITION; ADAPTATION; NEGATIVITY; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; CHILDREN; NETWORK	The functional significance of the N400 evoked-response component is still actively debated. An increasing amount of theoretical and computational modelling work is built on the interpretation of the N400 as a prediction error. In neural network modelling work, it was proposed that the N400 component can be interpreted as the change in a probabilistic representation of meaning that drives the continuous adaptation of an internal model of the statistics of the environment. These results imply that increased N400 amplitudes should correspond to greater adaptation, which can be measured via implicit memory. To investigate this model derived hypothesis, the current study manipulated expectancy in a sentence reading task to influence N400 amplitudes and subsequently presented the previously expected vs. unexpected words in a perceptual identification task to measure implicit memory. As predicted, reaction times in the perceptual identification task were significantly faster for previously unexpected words that induced larger N400 amplitudes in the previous sentence reading task. Additionally, it could be demonstrated that this adaptation seems to specifically depend on the process underlying N400 amplitudes, as participants with larger N400 differences during sentence reading also exhibited a larger implicit memory benefit in the perceptual identification task. These findings support the interpretation of the N400 as an implicit learning signal driving adaptation in language processing.

This study focuses on typically developing infants and aims to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of music training based on active synchronization with complex musical rhythms on the linguistic outcomes and electrophysiological functioning underlying auditory processing. Fifteen infants participated in the training (RTr+) and were compared with two groups of infants not attending any structured activities during the same time frame (RTr-, N = 14). At pre- and post-training, expressive and receptive language skills were assessed using standardized tests, and auditory processing skills were characterized through an electrophysiological non-speech multi-feature paradigm. Results reveal that RTr+ infants showed significantly broader improvement in both expressive and receptive pre-language skills. Moreover, at post-training, they presented an electrophysiological pattern characterized by shorter latency of two peaks (N2* and P2), reflecting a neural change detection process: these shifts in latency go beyond those seen due to maturation alone. These results provide preliminary evidence on the efficacy of our training in improving early linguistic competences, and in modifying the neural underpinnings of auditory processing in infants.

Because pain can be conceptualized as a dangerous stimulus that generates avoidance, we evaluated how approach and avoidance personality traits modulate pain and empathy for pain responses. We induced placebo analgesia to test whether this also reduces self-pain and other pain. Amplitude measures of the N1, P2, and P3 ERPs components, elicited by electric stimulations, were obtained during a painful control, as well as during a placebo treatment expected to induce placebo analgesia. The placebo treatment produced a reduction in pain and unpleasantness perceived, whereas we observed a decrease in the empathy unpleasantness alone during the empathy pain condition. The moderator effects of the fight-flight-freeze system (FFFS) in the relationships linking P2 and P3 amplitude changes with pain reduction were both significant among low to moderate FFFS values. These observations are consistent with the idea that lower FFFS (active avoidance) scores can predict placebo-induced pain reduction. Finally, in line with the revised Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (r-RST), we can assume that phasic pain is an aversive stimulus activating the active-avoidance behavior to bring the system back to homeostasis.

Here we compared the time course of lexical access in deaf and hearing readers of similar reading ability. We also investigated whether one visual property of words, the outline-shape, modulates visual word recognition differently in both groups. We recorded the EEG signal of twenty deaf and twenty hearing readers while they performed a lexical decision task. In addition to the effect of lexicality, we assessed the impact of outline-shape by contrasting responses to pseudowords with an outline shape that was consistent (e.g., mofor) or inconsistent (e.g., mosor) with their baseword (motor). Despite hearing readers having higher phonological abilities, results showed a remarkably similar time course of the lexicality effect in deaf and hearing readers. We also found that only for deaf readers, inconsistent-shape pseudowords (e.g., mosor) elicited larger amplitude ERPs than consistent-shape pseudowords (e.g., mofor) from 150 ms after stimulus onset and extending into the N400 time window. This latter finding supports the view that deaf readers rely more on visual characteristics than typical hearing readers during visual word recognition. Altogether, our results suggest different mechanisms underlying effective word recognition in deaf and hearing readers.

In multi-tasking, a fixed order of sub-tasks can improve performance by promoting a time-structured preparation of sub-tasks. How proactive control prioritizes the pre-activation or inhibition of complex tasks in older people has received no sufficient clarification so far. Objective: To explore the effects of aging on neural proactive control mechanisms in a dual task. Methodology: To address this question, the psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm was used. Two 2-alternative-forced-choice reaction tasks with a predefined order (T1 and T2) signaled by a cue had to be executed simultaneously or consecutively by young (mean age 25.1 years, n = 36) and old subjects (mean age 70.4 years, n = 118). Performance indices of dual-task preparation were used to assess the focused preparation of T1 and T2. To compare preparatory mechanisms at the neurophysiologic level, multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded and negative slow cortical potentials (SCPs) were analyzed as objective markers of the amount and localization of cortical pre-activation before sub-task presentation. Results: Dual-task performance was significantly slower in old adults. T1 performance was facilitated in both age groups, but T2 processing in old adults was not optimized by the temporal structure as efficiently as in young adults. Also, only young adults manifested a stable pattern of focused of negative slow-wave activity increase at medial frontal and right-hemisphere posterior regions, which was associated with a coordinated preparatory T1 pre-activation and T2 deferment, while old adults manifested a broad topographic distribution of negative SCPs associated with a pre-activation of sensory and motor processes. Conclusions: These observations demonstrate that the proactive preparation for dual tasking is altered with aging. It is suggested that in young adults, attention-based pre-activation of working memory and inhibitory networks in the right hemisphere synchronizes the simultaneous preparation of the two sub-tasks, whereas in old adults, sensory and motor networks appear to be non-specifically pre-activated for subsequent deferred mode of processing.

BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						HD-tDCS; Impulsivity; dACC; Inhibitory control; Error processing; Go-NoGo	RESPONSE-INHIBITION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; NEURAL BASIS; STIMULATION; ERP; TASK; FMRI; COMPULSIVITY; COMPONENTS; CORTEX	Background: The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and its neurocircuits are central in impulsivity, and maladaptive dACC activity has been implicated in psychological disorders characterized by high trait impulsivity. High-Definition transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (HD-tDCS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation tool that, with certain electrode configurations, can be optimized for targeting deeper subcortical brain structures, such as the dACC. Objectives: Using behavioural and electrophysiological measures we investigated whether HD-tDCS targeting the dACC could modulate two key components of impulsivity, inhibitory control and error processing. Methods: Twenty-three healthy adults with high trait impulsivity participated in two experimental sessions. Participants received active or sham HD-tDCS in counterbalanced order with a wash-out period of at least 3 days, as part of a single-blind, cross-over design. EEG was recorded during the Go-NoGo task before, directly after, and 30 min after HD-tDCS. Results: HD-tDCS targeting the dACC did not affect inhibitory control performance on the Go-NoGo task, but there was evidence for a delayed change in underlying neurophysiological components of motor inhibition (NoGo P3) and error processing (error related negativity; ERN) after one session of HD-tDCS. Conclusion: HD-tDCS has potential to modulate underlying neurophysiological components of impulsivity. Future studies should further explore to what degree the dACC was affected and whether multi-session HD-tDCS has the capacity to also induce behavioural changes, particularly in clinical samples characterized by high trait impulsivity.

A pivotal function of PPS is to coordinate defensive responses to threat. We have previously shown that a centrally-presented, looming fearful face, signalling a potential threat in one?s surroundings, modulates spatial processing by promoting a redirection of sensory resources away from the face towards the periphery, where the threat may be expected ? but only when the face is presented in near, rather than far space. Here, we use electrophysiological measures to investigate the neural mechanism underlying this effect. Participants made simple responses to tactile stimuli delivered on the cheeks, while watching task-irrelevant neutral or fearful avatar faces, looming towards them either in near or far space. Simultaneously with the tactile stimulation, a ball with a checkerboard pattern (probe) appeared to the left or right of the avatar face. Crucially, this probe could either be close to the avatar face, and thus more central in the participant?s vision, or further away from the avatar face, and thus more peripheral in the participant?s vision. Electroencephalography was continuously recorded. Behavioural results confirmed that in near space only, and for fearful relative to neutral faces, tactile processing was facilitated by the peripheral compared to the central probe. This behavioural effect was accompanied by a reduction of the N1 mean amplitude elicited by the peripheral probe for fearful relative to neutral faces. Moreover, the faster the participants responded to tactile stimuli with the peripheral probe, relative to the central, the smaller was their N1. Together these results, suggest that fearful faces intruding into PPS may increase expectation of a visual event occurring in the periphery. This fear-induced effect would enhance the defensive function of PPS when it is most needed, i.e., when the source of threat is nearby, but its location remains unknown.

J	Bower, J; Magee, WL; Catroppa, C; Baker, FA				Bower, Janeen; Magee, Wendy L.; Catroppa, Cathy; Baker, Felicity Anne			The Neurophysiological Processing of Music in Children: A Systematic Review With Narrative Synthesis and Considerations for Clinical Practice in Music Therapy	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review						systematic review; music; brain imaging; child; music therapy; acquired brain injury	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH RESPONSES; NEWBORN-INFANTS; BRAIN RESPONSES; PITCH; MATURATION; MELODY; REPRESENTATION; SIMILARITIES; NEUROSCIENCE	Introduction: Evidence supporting the use of music interventions to maximize arousal and awareness in adults presenting with a disorder of consciousness continues to grow. However, the brain of a child is not simply a small adult brain, and therefore adult theories are not directly translatable to the pediatric population. The present study aims to synthesize brain imaging data about the neural processing of music in children aged 0-18 years, to form a theoretical basis for music interventions with children presenting with a disorder of consciousness following acquired brain injury. Methods: We conducted a systematic review with narrative synthesis utilizing an adaptation of the methodology developed by Popay and colleagues. Following the development of the narrative that answered the central question "what does brain imaging data reveal about the receptive processing of music in children?", discussion was centered around the clinical implications of music therapy with children following acquired brain injury. Results: The narrative synthesis included 46 studies that utilized EEG, MEG, fMRI, and fNIRS scanning techniques in children aged 0-18 years. From birth, musical stimuli elicit distinct but immature electrical responses, with components of the auditory evoked response having longer latencies and variable amplitudes compared to their adult counterparts. Hemodynamic responses are observed throughout cortical and subcortical structures however cortical immaturity impacts musical processing and the localization of function in infants and young children. The processing of complex musical stimuli continues to mature into late adolescence. Conclusion: While the ability to process fundamental musical elements is present from birth, infants and children process music more slowly and utilize different cortical areas compared to adults. Brain injury in childhood occurs in a period of rapid development and the ability to process music following brain injury will likely depend on pre-morbid musical processing. Further, a significant brain injury may disrupt the developmental trajectory of complex music processing. However, complex music processing may emerge earlier than comparative language processing, and occur throughout a more global circuitry.

Yet, categorization of facial expressions is typically measured in experimental contexts with homogenous sets of face stimuli. Here we evaluated how the 6 basic facial emotions (Fear, Disgust, Happiness, Anger, Surprise or Sadness) can be rapidly and automatically categorized with faces varying in head orientation, lighting condition, identity, gender, age, ethnic origin and background context. High-density electroenceph-alography was recorded in 17 participants viewing 50 s sequences with natural variable images of neutral-expression faces alternating at a 6 Hz rate. Every five stimuli (1.2 Hz), variable natural images of one of the six basic expressions were presented. Despite the wide physical variability across images, a significant F/5 = 1.2 Hz response and its har-monics (e.g., 2F/5 = 2.4 Hz, etc.) was observed for all expression changes at the group-level and in every individual participant. Facial categorization responses were found mainly over occipito-temporal sites, with distinct hemispheric lateralization and cortical topog-raphies according to the different expressions. Specifically, a stronger response was found to Sadness categorization, especially over the left hemisphere, as compared to Fear and Happiness, together with a right hemispheric dominance for categorization of Fearful faces. Importantly, these differences were specific to upright faces, ruling out the contribution of low-level visual cues. Overall, these observations point to robust rapid and automatic facial expression categorization processes in the human brain. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Neural Indicator of Altered Mismatch Detection Predicts Atypical Cognitive-Perceptual Experiences in Psychotic Psychopathology	SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN			English	Article						schizophrenia; psychosis; auditory processing; EEG	AUDITORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; NEGATIVITY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ERP; DYSFUNCTION; COMPONENTS; REDUCTION; P300; WAVE	Background Atypical auditory processing (AAP) in psychotic psychopathology is evident in early (N1), mid-latency (P2/N2/mismatch negativity), and late (P3) neural responses. The influence of attention on AAP, and how temporal stages of AAP are associated with phenomenology of psychotic psychopathology are not well understood. Methods We used a directed attention oddball task to characterize stages of AAP in psychosis and to examine the influence of selective attention. Ninety patients with schizophrenia (SCZ), 53 patients with bipolar disorder (BP), 90 healthy controls and 72 first-degree relatives of SCZ (SREL) were studied. We used principal components analysis to decompose average-reference 64-channel subject-level ERPs. Results Altered attentional modulation was evident in SCZ at early (N1 factor) and late (P3 factor) stages of AAP, but not at mid-latency P2 factor. Irrespective of condition, N1 and P3 were reduced in SCZ, which predicted greater psychopathology and schizotypal personality traits. Diminished mid-latency mismatch detection (P2 factor) was evident in SCZ, BP, and SREL and was associated with greater positive symptoms of psychosis as well as self-reported atypical cognitive-perceptual experiences. Conclusions Attentional modulation of early N1, and later P3 neural responses was atypical in patients, but the degree of attentional modulation did not relate to symptom severity or schizotypal traits. Our findings suggest the link between mid-latency mismatch detection and atypical cognitive/perceptual experiences is not driven by attentional deficits alone and point to the promise of mid-latency mismatch detection as a candidate endophenotype and intervention target.

Current neuroaesthetic and neurocomputational models of aesthetic appreciation postulate the existence of a correlation between aesthetic appreciation and learning. However, even though aesthetic appreciation has been associated with attentional enhancements, systematic evidence demonstrating its influence on learning processes is still lacking. Here, in two experiments, we investigated the relationship between aesthetic preferences for consonance versus dissonance and the memorisation of musical intervals and chords. In Experiment 1, 60 participants were first asked to memorise and evaluate arpeggiated triad chords (memorisation phase), then, following a distraction task, chords' memorisation accuracy was measured (recognition phase). Memorisation resulted to be significantly enhanced for subjectively preferred as compared with non-preferred chords. To explore the possible neural mechanisms underlying these results, we performed an EEG study, directed to investigate implicit perceptual learning dynamics (Experiment 2). Through an auditory mismatch detection paradigm, electrophysiological responses to standard/deviant intervals were recorded, while participants were asked to evaluate the beauty of the intervals. We found a significant trial-by-trial correlation between subjective aesthetic judgements and single trial amplitude fluctuations of the ERP attention-related N1 component. Moreover, implicit perceptual learning, expressed by larger mismatch detection responses, was enhanced for more appreciated intervals. Altogether, our results showed the existence of a relationship between aesthetic appreciation and implicit learning dynamics as well as higher-order learning processes, such as memorisation. This finding might suggest possible future applications in different research domains such as teaching and rehabilitation of memory and attentional deficits.

The fillers in these wh-dependencies involve lexically selected noun complements (Comp): quelle de ' cision a` propos de lui/`a son sujet 'which decision about him' or unselected NP-modifiers (Mod): quelle de ' cision le concernant 'which decision regarding him'; they also involve the lexical encoding of antecedent gender (lui/elle '3p. sing.masc/fem') or not (son '3p.sing.gen') in a pronoun. We propose that NNSs adapt to processing a non-native language by directing more resources toward computing lexically encoded properties than toward inferences that go beyond lexical information. At the recursive clause edge, a population-wide asymmetry between conditions arose at 15-16Hz in induced power: Lexical selection and gender specification led to diminished power for Comp son vs. Mod le/la and for specified lui/elle vs. unspecified son in Comps. This was also found at 17-22Hz in induced power in NSs whereas asymmetries were reversed in NNSs, with computations of lexically encoded properties demanding greater power. At 41-44Hz in induced power, group differences emerged: More power was directed at gender-specified le/la and lui/elle in NNSs, but at unspecified son in NSs.

Dysfunction to the facial processing areas is permanent and standard rehabilitation brings only limited improvement. Therefore, therapists suggest reinforcing the compensatory strategies used by such patients such as voice, figure, and gait recognition to help with the identification of a particular person, which promotes their social functioning. New neurotechnologies, especially QEEG/ERPs, displays of functional brain impairment in prosopagnosia, may be helpful in developing an appropriate neurotherapy protocol and create the conditions for other forms of rehabilitation in such patients. The purpose of our study was twofold: 1) to evaluate QEEG/ERPs shows of post-stroke functional impairment associated with prosopagnosia, 2) to construct a neurofeedback protocol based on these indices to sup- port the neuropsychological rehabilitation of the case study described herein. Case report: We present the case of a 23-year-old right-handed student of the Graphics Faculty of the Academy of Fine Arts, with chronic associative prosopagnosia after infection with SARS-CoV-2 followed by Covid-19 and a right hemisphere stroke. He was re- ferred in April 2021 for diagnosis and therapy at the Reintegration and Training Cen- ter of the Polish Neuropsychological Society (PTNeur). Six months earlier, in October 2020, the patient had been admitted to the Infectious Disease Hospital. COVID-19 was diagnosed based on coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcrip- tion PCR (RT-PCR) on a nasopharyngeal swab. The neurological examination re- vealed muscle weakness on the left side of the body, slow and aprosodic speech, preserved comprehension, and acute left homonymous hemianopsia, as well as prosopagnosia and mirror symptom. The patient was sedated and mechanically ventilated for six days. The CT-scan showed foci in the posterior part of the superior temporal lobe and hyperintense changes in the blood supply area of the right middle cerebral artery. After 30 days of hospitalization, the patient was discharged from this hospital and referred to an outpatient rehabilitation center for five months. Ther- apy improved his general condition but did not remove the chronic prosopagnosia: a personal tragedy for the patient which prevented him from continuing his studies. He was diagnosed at the PTNeur Reintegration and Training Center within the next few weeks: (1). ophthalmologic examinations revealed no pathology; (2) neuropsy- chological testing confirmed the presence of chronic apperceptive prosopagnosia; (3) examination of event-related potentials (ERPs) revealed a large delay of the N170 wave, particularly on the right side, indicating a slowing of the rate of nerve impulses in early face processing and a cause of prosopagnosia. The patient was referred for rehabilitation: he participated in 20 sessions of individually tailored anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) twice a week for ten weeks, and in parallel, for indi- vidualized Prosopagnosia Symbolic Art Therapy provided once a week for ten weeks. By the end of therapy, the patient was not only recognizing but also painting portraits of faces. He returned to college, finished and defended a master's thesis in Artistic Drawing, in which facial presentation played an important role. Conclusions: Quantitative EEG (QEEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) neuromarkers helped to understand the mechanism of prosopagnosia and to choose an individualized protocol, thus the appropriate application of tDCS in our patient, which accelerated the recovery of the ability to perform complex tasks and created the conditions for Symbolic Art Therapy. Modern medicine can successfully use such a management protocol in individuals with chronic prosopagnosia.

Towards understanding how we pay attention in naturalistic visual search settings	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Attentional control; Multisensory; Real-world; Semantic congruence; Temporal predictability; Context	ORIENTING ATTENTION; TASK SET; MULTISENSORY INTERACTIONS; TEMPORAL PREDICTABILITY; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; N2PC COMPONENT; CAPTURE; BRAIN; CONTINGENT; INTEGRATION	Research on attentional control has largely focused on single senses and the importance of behavioural goals in controlling attention. However, everyday situations are multisensory and contain regularities, both likely influencing attention. We investigated how visual attentional capture is simultaneously impacted by top-down goals, the multisensory nature of stimuli, and the contextual factors of stimuli's semantic relationship and temporal predictability. Participants performed a multisensory version of the Folk et al. (1992) spatial cueing paradigm, searching for a target of a predefined colour (e.g. a red bar) within an array preceded by a distractor. We manipulated: 1) stimuli's goal-relevance via distractor's colour (matching vs. mismatching the target), 2) stimuli's multisensory nature (colour distractors appearing alone vs. with tones), 3) the relationship between the distractor sound and colour (arbitrary vs. semantically congruent) and 4) the temporal predictability of distractor onset. Reaction-time spatial cueing served as a behavioural measure of attentional selection. We also recorded 129-channel event-related potentials (ERPs), analysing the distractor-elicited N2pc component both canonically and using a multivariate electrical neuroimaging framework. Behaviourally, arbitrary target-matching distractors captured attention more strongly than semantically congruent ones, with no evidence for context modulating multisensory enhancements of capture. Notably, electrical neuroimaging of surface-level EEG analyses revealed context-based influences on attention to both visual and multisensory distractors, in how strongly they activated the brain and type of activated brain networks. For both processes, the context-driven brain response modulations occurred long before the N2pc time-window, with topographic (network-based) modulations at similar to 30 ms, followed by strength-based modulations at similar to 100 ms post-distractor onset. Our results reveal that both stimulus meaning and predictability modulate attentional selection, and they interact while doing so. Meaning, in addition to temporal predictability, is thus a second source of contextual information facilitating goal-directed behaviour. More broadly, in everyday situations, attention is controlled by an interplay between one's goals, stimuli's perceptual salience, meaning and predictability. Our study calls for a revision of attentional control theories to account for the role of contextual and multisensory control.

Subconcussive brain vital signs changes predict head-impact exposure in ice hockey players	BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						concussion; subconcussion; EEG; ERP; brain vital signs	CONSCIOUSNESS; POTENTIALS; SPORT	The brain vital signs framework is a portable, objective, neurophysiological evaluation of brain function at point-of-care. We investigated brain vital signs at pre- and post-season for age 14 or under (Bantam) and age 16-20 (Junior-A) male ice hockey players to (i) further investigate previously published brain vital sign results showing subconcussive cognitive deficits and (ii) validate these findings through comparison with head-impact data obtained from instrumented accelerometers. With a longitudinal study design, 23 male ice hockey players in Bantam (n = 1 . 3; age 13.63 +/- 0.62) and Tier II Junior-A (n = 10; age 18.62 +/- 0.86) divisions were assessed at pre- and post-season. None were diagnosed with a concussion during the season. Cognitive evoked potential measures of Auditory sensation (N100), Basic attention (P300) and Cognitive processing (N400) were analysed as changes in peak amplitudes and latencies (six standard scores total). A regression analysis examined the relationship between brain vital signs and the number of head impacts received during the study season. Significant pre/post differences in brain vital signs were detected for both groups. Bantam and Junior-A players also differed in number of head impacts (Bantam: 32.92 +/- 17.68; Junior-A: 195.00 +/- 61.08; P < 0.001). lmportandy, the regression model demonstrated a significant linear relationship between changes in brain vital signs and total head impacts received (R = 0.799, P = 0.007), with clear differences between the Bantam and Junior-A groups. In the absence of a clinically diagnosed concussion, the brain vital sign changes appear to have demonstrated the compounding effects of repetitive subconcussive impacts. The findings underscored the importance of an objective physiological measure of brain function along the spectrum of concussive impacts.	[Fickling, Shaun D.; D'Arcy, Ryan C.

Here, we systematically explored how numbers of trials and subjects affect statistical power in MEG sensor-level data. More specifically, we simulated "experiments" using the MEG resting-state dataset of the Human Connectome Project (HCP). We divided the data in two conditions, injected a dipolar source at a known anatomical location in the "signal condition", but not in the "noise condition", and detected significant differences at sensor level with classical paired t-tests across subjects, using amplitude, squared amplitude, and global field power (GFP) measures. Group-level detectability of these simulated effects varied drastically with anatomical origin. We thus examined in detail which spatial properties of the sources affected detectability, looking specifically at the distance from closest sensor and orientation of the source, and at the variability of these parameters across subjects. In line with previous single-subject studies, we found that the most detectable effects originate from source locations that are closest to the sensors and oriented tangentially with respect to the head surface. In addition, cross-subject variability in orientation also affected group-level detectability, boosting detection in regions where this variability was small and hindering detection in regions where it was large. Incidentally, we observed a considerable covariation of source position, orientation, and their cross-subject variability in individual brain anatomical space, making it difficult to assess the impact of each of these variables independently of one another. We thus also performed simulations where we controlled spatial properties independently of individual anatomy. These additional simulations confirmed the strong impact of distance and orientation and further showed that orientation variability across subjects affects detectability, whereas position variability does not. Importantly, our study indicates that strict unequivocal recommendations as to the ideal number of trials and subjects for any experiment cannot be realistically provided for neurophysiological studies and should be adapted according to the brain regions under study.

Like other concepts of barrier-free communication, Easy Language ("Leichte Sprache") attempts to enhance perceptibility and comprehensibility of texts for people with reading impairments by means of a rule-based reduction of complexity on the text side. The underlying assumption of simplified languages is that the reduction of linguistic complexity correspondingly reduces cognitive processing costs. However, this interplay between linguistic complexity and cognitive processing costs still needs to be investigated by empirical research as up to date there are only a few studies investigating the perception and reception of Easy Language, mostly using offline methods (e.g., questionnaires or retrospective interviews). In contrast to offline methods, which are only capable of assessing comprehension products, online methods allow researchers to track what a participant is focusing their attention on at any given time and to thereby develop a detailed representation of the time-course of cognitive language processing. In our paper, we aim to point out how different online methods (eye-tracking, EEG and fMRI) can be used for investigating the empirical validity of the postulated rules for Easy Language by evaluating cognitive processing efficiency. Besides discussing the applicability of those neuroscientific online methods in Easy Language research, we discuss the importance of collecting personal and neuropsychological data to gain detailed profiles of the participants and therefore not only contribute to the explanation of variance but furthermore to determine the role of neuropsychological skills on reading proficiency. For each online method we elaborate basic principles, discuss some of the main findings in cognitive sciences and demonstrate the greatest advantages but also restrictions of the method and challenges related to the data collection process with impaired participants. Furthermore, we outline current challenges in Easy Language research and summarize remaining research gaps. On a final note, we emphasize that it is both the establishment of online methods and the data triangulation in Easy Language research that enable researchers to gain a profound insight into the cognitive processing of simplified languages.</p>	[Borghardt, Liv; Deilen, Silvana; Fuchs, Julia; Gros, Anne-Kathrin; Hansen-Schirra, Silvia; Nagels, Arne; Schiffl, Laura; Sommer, Johanna] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Gutenberg Council Young Researchers GYR, Easy Language Res Grp, Mainz, Germany		Fuchs, J (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Gutenberg Council Young Researchers GYR, Easy Language Res Grp, Mainz, Germany.	fuchsj@uni-mainz.de		Fuchs, Julia/0000-0001-7505-4095	Gutenberg Council for Young Researchers (GYR)	Gutenberg Council for Young Researchers (GYR)	This research was funded by the Gutenberg Council for Young Researchers (GYR).		62	0	0	2	2	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND		2297-900X		FRONT COMMUN	Front.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of epilepsy	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review						Drug Resistant Epilepsy [physiopathology] [*therapy]; Electroencephalography; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; *Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation [adverse eGects]; Humans	FREQUENCY	Background Epilepsy is a highly prevalent neurological condition characterised by repeated unprovoked seizures with various aetiologies. Although antiepileptic medications produce clinical improvement in many individuals, nearly a third of individuals have drug-resistant epilepsy that carries significant morbidity and mortality, and even individuals who have clinical improvement from antiepileptic medications oFen report iatrogenic symptoms. There remains a need for non-invasive and more eGective therapies for this population. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) uses electromagnetic coils to excite or inhibit neurons, with repetitive pulses at low-frequency producing an inhibitory eGect that could conceivably reduce cortical excitability associated with epilepsy. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in 2016. Objectives To assess the evidence for the use of TMS in individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy compared with other available treatments in reducing seizure frequency, improving quality of life, reducing epileptiform discharges, antiepileptic medication use, and side eGects. Search methods For the latest update, we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE (Ovid 1946 to 2 June 2020). CRS Web includes randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials from PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the specialised registers of Cochrane Review Groups including Epilepsy. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials that were double-blinded, single-blinded, or unblinded, and placebo controlled, no treatment, or active controlled, which used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) without restriction of frequency, coil, duration or intensity on participants with drug-resistant epilepsy. Data collection and analysis We extracted information from each trial including methodological data; participant demographics including baseline seizure frequency, type of epileptic drugs taken; intervention details and intervention groups for comparison; potential biases; and outcomes and time points, primarily change in seizure frequency or responder rates, as well as quality of life and epileptiform discharges, adverse eGects, and changes in medication use. Main results The original search revealed 274 records from the databases that aFer selection provided seven full-text relevant studies for inclusion. The latest search identified 179 new records from the databases that aFer evaluation against the inclusion and exclusion criteria provided one additional full-text relevant study. The eight included studies (241 participants) were all randomised trials; seven of the studies were blinded. Methodological and design information in the included studies was unclear, particularly relating to randomisation and allocation concealment methods. We were not able to combine the results of the trials in analysis due to diGerences in the studies' designs. For the current update, two of the eight studies analysed showed a statistically significant reduction in seizure rate from baseline (72% and 78.9% reduction of seizures per week from the baseline rate, respectively), whilst the other six studies showed no statistically significant diGerence in seizure frequency following rTMS treatment compared with controls (low-certainty evidence). One study assessed quality of life and found that more participants showed improvement in quality of life scores with active treatments compared to the sham treatment, but this only involved seven participants (very low-certainty evidence). Four studies evaluated our secondary endpoint of mean number of epileptic discharges, three of which showed a statistically significant reduction in discharges aFer active rTMS treatment. Adverse eGects were uncommon in the studies and typically involved headache, dizziness, and tinnitus; however increased seizure frequency did occur in a small number of individuals. The included trials reported no significant changes in medication use. Overall the risk of bias was either low or unclear, and the certainty of the evidence was low to very low. Authors' conclusions Overall, we judged the certainty of evidence for the primary outcomes of this review to be low to very low. We found some evidence to suggest that rTMS is safe but some adverse events were experienced. The variability in technique and outcome reporting prevented meta-analysis, and the evidence for eGicacy of rTMS for seizure reduction is still lacking, despite reasonable evidence that it is eGective at reducing epileptiform discharges.
