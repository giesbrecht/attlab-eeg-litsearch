Assessing Brain-Muscle connectivity in Human Locomotion through Mobile Brain/Body imaging: Opportunities, Pitfalls, and Future Directions	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						mobile brain/body imaging; independent component analysis; corticomuscular coherence; neural drive; gait; electroencephalography; central pattern generators; age-related sarcopenia	CORTICOKINEMATIC COHERENCE; CORTICOMUSCULAR COHERENCE; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; MOTOR CORTEX; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; ELECTROCORTICAL ACTIVITY; WALKING; EEG; TASK; GAIT	Assessment of the cortical role during bipedalism has been a methodological challenge. While surface electroencephalography (EEG) is capable of non-invasively measuring cortical activity during human locomotion, it is associated with movement artifacts obscuring cerebral sources of activity. Recently, statistical methods based on blind source separation revealed potential for resolving this issue, by segregating non-cerebral/artifactual from cerebral sources of activity. This step marked a new opportunity for the investigation of the brains' role while moving and was tagged mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI). This methodology involves simultaneous mobile recording of brain activity with several other body behavioral variables (e.g., muscle activity and kinematics), through wireless recording wearable devices/sensors. Notably, several MoBI studies using EEG-EMG approaches recently showed that the brain is functionally connected to the muscles and active throughout the whole gait cycle and, thus, rejecting the long-lasting idea of a solely spinal-driven bipedalism. However, MoBI and brain/muscle connectivity assessments during human locomotion are still in their fledgling state of investigation. Mobile brain/body imaging approaches hint toward promising opportunities; however, there are some remaining pitfalls that need to be resolved before considering their routine clinical use. This article discusses several of these pitfalls and proposes research to address them. Examples relate to the validity, reliability, and reproducibility of this method in ecologically valid scenarios and in different populations. Furthermore, whether brain/muscle connectivity within the MoBI framework represents a potential biomarker in neuromuscular syndromes where gait disturbances are evident (e.g., age-related sarcopenia) remains to be determined.

Tinnitus is understood as a problem caused by underlying damage in the inner-ear. However, recent studies have shown that tinnitus is also influenced by complexities in non-auditory brain areas. Among different brain-imaging techniques, mobile Electroencephalography (EEG) can be a viable solution in better understanding the influencing factors in the brain causing tinnitus, but real-time analysis of EEG in real-world environments is faced by unique challenges and limitations. We present the first pure smartphone-based solution to acquire and analyze EEG data in real time and in everyday settings, as well as in any other scenario which does not allow large setups. More specifically, we propose TinnituSense a smartphone app for EEG recordings and visualization, and evaluate this app to claim the feasibility of our approach. On one hand, the proposed approach will open the opportunities to perform brain-imaging in real-world environment. On the other hand, the developed app will allow tinnitus researchers to collect evidence for new facts regarding tinnitus with the help of ambulatory brain-imaging data.

However, the decoding of gait patterns from brain signals remains an open challenge. The aim of this work is to propose and validate a deep learning model to decode gait phases from Electroenchephalography (EEG).Approach.A Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep neural network has been trained to deal with time-dependent information within brain signals during locomotion. The EEG signals have been preprocessed by means of Artifacts Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) and Reliable Independent Component Analysis (RELICA) to ensure that classification performance was not affected by movement-related artifacts.Main results.The network was evaluated on the dataset of 11 healthy subjects walking on a treadmill. The proposed decoding approach shows a robust reconstruction (AUC > 90%) of gait patterns (i.e. swing and stance states) of both legs together, or of each leg independently.Significance.Our results support for the first time the use of a memory-based deep learning classifier to decode walking activity from non-invasive brain recordings. We suggest that this classifier, exploited in real time, can be a more effective input for devices restoring locomotion in impaired people.

Effects of Cable Sway, Electrode Surface Area, and Electrode Mass on Electroencephalography Signal Quality during Motion	SENSORS			English	Article						EEG; motion artifacts; electrode mass; electrode surface area; cable sway; signal to noise ratio; phantom head; locomotion	ELECTROCORTICAL ACTIVITY; WIRELESS EEG; WALKING; ARTIFACTS; HEAD; ACCELERATIONS; INTERFERENCE; OSCILLATIONS; ORIGIN; PELVIS	More neuroscience researchers are using scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to measure electrocortical dynamics during human locomotion and other types of movement. Motion artifacts corrupt the EEG and mask underlying neural signals of interest. The cause of motion artifacts in EEG is often attributed to electrode motion relative to the skin, but few studies have examined EEG signals under head motion. In the current study, we tested how motion artifacts are affected by the overall mass and surface area of commercially available electrodes, as well as how cable sway contributes to motion artifacts. To provide a ground-truth signal, we used a gelatin head phantom with embedded antennas broadcasting electrical signals, and recorded EEG with a commercially available electrode system. A robotic platform moved the phantom head through sinusoidal displacements at different frequencies (0-2 Hz). Results showed that a larger electrode surface area can have a small but significant effect on improving EEG signal quality during motion and that cable sway is a major contributor to motion artifacts. These results have implications in the development of future hardware for mobile brain imaging with EEG.

Data Descriptor: Full body mobile brain-body imaging data during unconstrained locomotion on stairs, ramps, and level ground	SCIENTIFIC DATA			English	Article; Data Paper							ELECTROCORTICAL ACTIVITY; WALKING; EEG; TREADMILL; GAIT; CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVATION; PATTERNS; RHYTHMS	Human locomotion is a complex process that requires the integration of central and peripheral nervous signalling. Understanding the brain's involvement in locomotion is challenging and is traditionally investigated during locomotor imagination or observation. However, stationary imaging methods lack the ability to infer information about the peripheral and central signalling during actual task execution. In this report, we present a dataset containing simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG), lower-limb electromyography (EMG), and full body motion capture recorded from ten able-bodied individuals. The subjects completed an average of twenty trials on an experimental gait course containing level-ground, ramps, and stairs. We recorded 60-channel EEG from the scalp and 4-channel EOG from the face and temples. Surface EMG was recorded from six muscle sites bilaterally on the thigh and shank. The motion capture system consisted of seventeen wireless IMUs, allowing for unconstrained ambulation in the experimental space. In this report, we present the rationale for collecting these data, a detailed explanation of the experimental setup, and a brief validation of the data quality.

On the contrary, recent evidence suggests that in humans the motor cortex is also significantly engaged during complex locomotion tasks. However, a detailed understanding of cortical contribution to locomotion is still lacking especially during stereotyped activities. Here, we show that cortical motor areas finely control leg muscle activation during treadmill stereotyped walking. Using a novel technique based on a combination of Reliable Independent Component Analysis, source localization and effective connectivity, and by combining electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) recordings in able-bodied adults we were able to examine for the first time cortical activation patterns and cortico-muscular connectivity including information flow direction. Results not only provided evidence of cortical activity associated with locomotion, but demonstrated significant causal unidirectional drive from contralateral motor cortex to muscles in the swing leg. These insights overturn the traditional view that human cortex has a limited role in the control of stereotyped locomotion, and suggest useful hypotheses concerning mechanisms underlying gait under other conditions. One sentence summary: Motor cortex proactively drives contralateral swing leg muscles during treadmill walking, counter to the traditional view of stereotyped human locomotion.

The diagnostic yield of ambulatory electroencephalography was determined for each of the following groups: group 1: differentiation of seizures from nonepileptic events; group 2: determination of seizure/interictal discharge frequency; and group 3: classification of seizure type or localization. The ambulatory electroencephalography answered the clinical question in 61% of group 1 (27/44) and 100% of groups 2 (16/16) and 3 (4/4). Of 44 cases in Group 1, clinical events were recorded in 61%; the ambulatory electroencephalography result changed the diagnosis from epileptic to nonepileptic or vice versa in 27%. When clinicians suspected that events were epileptic, ambulatory electroencephalography changed the clinical impression in 50%, whereas when events were suspected to be nonepileptic, ambulatory electroencephalography confirmed that impression in 83%.

Negligible Motion Artifacts in Scalp Electroencephalography (EEG) During Treadmill Walking	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography; EEG; artifacts; walking	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; REMOVAL; SIGNALS; DYNAMICS; RHYTHMS; COST; EMG	Recent Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) techniques based on active electrode scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) allow the acquisition and real-time analysis of brain dynamics during active unrestrained motor behavior involving whole body movements such as treadmill walking, over-ground walking and other locomotive and non-locomotive tasks. Unfortunately, MoBI protocols are prone to physiological and non-physiological artifacts, including motion artifacts that may contaminate the EEG recordings. A few attempts have been made to quantify these artifacts during locomotion tasks but with inconclusive results due in part to methodological pitfalls. In this paper, we investigate the potential contributions of motion artifacts in scalp EEG during treadmill walking at three different speeds (1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 km/h) using a wireless 64 channel active EEG system and a wireless inertial sensor attached to the subjects head. The experimental setup was designed according to good measurement practices using state-of-the-art commercially-available instruments, and the measurements were analyzed using Fourier analysis and wavelet coherence approaches. Contrary to prior claims, the subjects motion did not significantly affect their EEG during treadmill walking although precaution should be taken when gait speeds approach 4.5 km/h. Overall, these findings suggest how MoBI methods may be safely deployed in neural, cognitive, and rehabilitation engineering applications.

Processing complex, concurrent, multi-modal, multi-rate data streams requires a signal-processing environment quite different from one designed to process single-modality time series data. Here we describe MoBILAB (more details available at sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/MoBILAB), an open source, cross platform toolbox running on MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc.) that supports analysis and visualization of any mixture of synchronously recorded brain, behavioral, and environmental time series plus time-marked event stream data. MoBILAB can serve as a pre-processing environment for adding behavioral and other event markers to EEG data for further processing, and/or as a development platform for expanded analysis of simultaneously recorded data streams.

Electrocortical activity is coupled to gait cycle phase during treadmill walking	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Locomotion; Motor control; Walking; Independent components analysis; Mobile brain imaging	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; VISUALLY GUIDED LOCOMOTION; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; MOTOR CORTICAL ACTIVITY; SPINAL-CORD; MUSCLE-ACTIVITY; CORTICOMUSCULAR COHERENCE; BRAIN ACTIVATION; CINGULATE CORTEX	Recent findings suggest that human cortex is more active during steady-speed unperturbed locomotion than previously thought. However, techniques that have been used to image the brain during locomotion lack the temporal resolution necessary to assess intra-stride cortical dynamics. Our aim was to determine if electrocortical activity is coupled to gait cycle phase during steady-speed human walking. We used electroencephalography (EEG), motion capture, and a force-measuring treadmill to record brain and body dynamics while eight healthy young adult subjects walked on a treadmill. Infomax independent component analysis (ICA) parsed EEG signals into maximally independent component (IC) processes representing electrocortical sources, muscle sources, and artifacts. We calculated a spatially fixed equivalent current dipole for each IC using an inverse modeling approach, and clustered electrocortical sources across subjects by similarities in dipole locations and power spectra. We then computed spectrograms for each electrocortical source that were time-locked to the gait cycle. Electrocortical sources in the anterior cingulate, posterior parietal, and sensorimotor cortex exhibited significant (p<0.05) intra-stride changes in spectral power. During the end of stance, as the leading foot was contacting the ground and the trailing foot was pushing off, alpha- and beta-band spectral power increased in or near the left/right sensorimotor and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Power increases in the left/right sensorimotor cortex were more pronounced for contralateral limb push-off (ipsilateral heel-strike) than for ipsilateral limb push-off (contralateral heel-strike). Intra-stride high-gamma spectral power changes were evident in anterior cingulate, posterior parietal, and sensorimotor cortex. These data confirm cortical involvement in steady-speed human locomotion. Future applications of these techniques could provide critical insight into the neural mechanisms of movement disorders and gait rehabilitation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Electrocortical activity distinguishes between uphill and level walking in humans	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						locomotion; EEG; mobile brain imaging; motor control; independent component analysis	VISUALLY GUIDED LOCOMOTION; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATOR; SOLEUS-H-REFLEX; TREADMILL WALKING; SLOPED SURFACES; MOTOR CORTEX; GAMMA-RANGE; GAIT EVENTS; AREA 5	The objective of this study was to determine if electrocortical activity is different between walking on an incline compared with level surface. Subjects walked on a treadmill at 0% and 15% grades for 30 min while we recorded electroencephalography (EEG). We used independent component (IC) analysis to parse EEG signals into maximally independent sources and then computed dipole estimations for each IC. We clustered cortical source ICs and analyzed event-related spectral perturbations synchronized to gait events. Theta power fluctuated across the gait cycle for both conditions, but was greater during incline walking in the anterior cingulate, sensorimotor and posterior parietal clusters. We found greater gamma power during level walking in the left sensorimotor and anterior cingulate clusters. We also found distinct alpha and beta fluctuations, depending on the phase of the gait cycle for the left and right sensorimotor cortices, indicating cortical lateralization for both walking conditions. We validated the results by isolating movement artifact. We found that the frequency activation patterns of the artifact were different than the actual EEG data, providing evidence that the differences between walking conditions were cortically driven rather than a residual artifact of the experiment. These findings suggest that the locomotor pattern adjustments necessary to walk on an incline compared with level surface may require supraspinal input, especially from the left sensorimotor cortex, anterior cingulate, and posterior parietal areas. These results are a promising step toward the use of EEG as a feed-forward control signal for ambulatory brain-computer interface technologies.	[Bradford, J.

A mobile brain-body imaging dataset recorded during treadmill walking with a brain-computer interface	SCIENTIFIC DATA			English	Article; Data Paper							GAIT CYCLE	We present a mobile brain-body imaging (MoBI) dataset acquired during treadmill walking in a brain-computer interface (BCI) task. The data were collected from eight healthy subjects, each having three identical trials. Each trial consisted of three conditions: standing, treadmill walking, and treadmill walking with a closed-loop BCI. During the BCI condition, subjects used their brain activity to control a virtual avatar on a screen to walk in real-time. Robust procedures were designed to record lower limb joint angles (bilateral hip, knee, and ankle) using goniometers synchronized with 60-channel scalp electroencephalography (EEG). Additionally, electrooculogram (EOG), EEG electrodes impedance, and digitized EEG channel locations were acquired to aid artifact removal and EEG dipole-source localization. This dataset is unique in that it is the first published MoBI dataset recorded during walking. It is useful in addressing several important open research questions, such as how EEG is coupled with gait cycle during closed-loop BCI, how BCI influences neural activity during walking, and how a BCI decoder may be optimized.

Most of the initial technological drawbacks of ambulatory EEG have been circumvented by incorporating digital and computer technology. It appears superior to routine EEG in capturing interictal abnormalities particularly in relation to natural sleep, circadian variations and the patient's typical daily lifestyle. The role of ambulatory EEG in studying seizures and nonepileptic paroxysmal events remains to be defined by targeted research. It perhaps is an underutilized tool and more research is needed to expand the horizon of ambulatory EEG applications in clinical practice. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

It has become the de-facto mobile, portable, non-invasive brain imaging sensor to harness brain information in real time. It is now being used to translate or decode brain signals, to diagnose diseases or to implement Brain Computer Interface (BCI) devices. The automatic decoding is mainly implemented by using quantitative algorithms to detect the cloaked information buried in the signal. However, clinical EEG is based intensively on waveforms and the structure of signal plots. Hence, the purpose of this work is to establish a bridge to fill this gap by reviewing and describing the procedures that have been used to detect patterns in the electroencephalographic waveforms, benchmarking them on a controlled pseudo-real dataset of a P300-Based BCI Speller and verifying their performance on a public dataset of a BCI Competition.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG), due to their time resolution, non-invasiveness and portability are the techniques of choice for MoBI, but synchronization requirements among others restrict its use to high-end research facilities. Here we test the effectiveness of a technique that enables us to achieve MoBI-grade synchronization of EEG and EMG, even when other strategies (such as Lab Streaming Layer (LSL)) cannot be used e.g., due to the unavailability of proprietary Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which is often the case in clinical settings. The proposed strategy is that of aligning several spikes at the beginning and end of the session. We delivered a train of spikes to the EEG amplifier and EMG electrodes every 2 s over a 10-min time period. We selected a variable number of spikes (from 1 to 10) both at the beginning and end of the time series and linearly resampled the data so as to align them. We then compared the misalignment of the "middle" spikes over the whole recording to test for jitter and synchronization drifts, highlighting possible nonlinearities (due to hardware filters) and estimated the maximum length of the recording to achieve a [5 to 5] ms misalignment range. We demonstrate that MoBI-grade synchronization can be achieved within 10-min recordings with a 1.7 ms jitter and [5 5] ms misalignment range. We show that repeated spike delivery can be used to test online synchronization options and to troubleshoot synchronization issues over EEG and EMG. We also show that synchronization cannot rely only on the equipment sampling rate advertised by manufacturers. The synchronization strategy described can be used virtually in every clinical environment, and may increase the interest among a broader spectrum of clinicians and researchers in the MoBI framework, ultimately leading to a better understanding of the brain processes underlying locomotion control and the development of more effective rehabilitation approaches.

Adding neck muscle activity to a head phantom device to validate mobile EEG muscle and motion artifact removal	2019 9TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	9th IEEE/EMBS International Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	MAR 20-23, 2019	San Francisco, CA	IEEE, EMBS				Recent advancement in electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing and hardware can greatly reduce motion artifact, but neck muscle electrical activity is a problem during mobile brain imaging studies examining whole body movement tasks like walking and running. To test the ability of independent component analysis (ICA) to extract neural signals contaminated by neck muscle electrical activity, we broadcast ground-truth electrical signals through a head phantom device during motion. We placed the phantom on a motion platform used to replicate human head trajectories during walking and embedded neck muscle sources within the phantom. ICA was able to extract artificial neural sources from even the most contaminated data in this simulation of human walking. Performance of ICA in high muscle activity amplitude conditions was improved by including electromyographic recordings in the ICA decomposition. These results highlight the importance of recording multiple electromyographic signals from the neck during mobile brain imaging with EEG for studying electrocortical dynamics during movement.

Studying supraspinal neural pathways during human locomotion provides opportunities to better understand complex neural circuity that may become compromised due to aging, neurological disorder, or disease. Knowledge gained from studies examining human electrical brain dynamics during gait can also lay foundations for developing locomotor neurotechnologies for rehabilitation or human performance. Technical barriers have largely prohibited neuroimaging during gait, but the portability and precise temporal resolution of non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) have expanded human neuromotor research into increasingly dynamic tasks. In this narrative mini-review, we provide a (1) brief introduction and overview of modern neuroimaging technologies and then identify considerations for (2) mobile EEG hardware, (3) and data processing, (4) including technical challenges and possible solutions. Finally, we summarize (5) knowledge gained from human locomotor control studies that have used mobile EEG, and (6) discuss future directions for real-world neuroimaging research.

A wide range of interventions have been developed that aim to promote motor recovery in affected persons. High-intensity and task-specific training protocols show promising results. A better understanding of brain functioning in the context of motor learning and motor control may help to further improve rehabilitation outcome. Mobile brain imaging has brought advances that led to the development of models that characterize different aspects of the cortical involvement in movement. We are interested in translating those findings into online applications and lay a basis for novel rehabilitation interventions. In this paper, we use a model of gait consisting of two parameters: The state of walking (compared to upright standing) and the dynamics of the movement, i.e. the gait cadence. To this end, we perform mobile electroencephalography (EEG) measurements combined with inverse brain imaging and time-frequency analyses optimized for online application.

A mobile imaging approach was needed to study cognitive processes that are inherently based on the use of human physical structure to obtain behavioral goals. This review gives examples of the tight coupling between human physical structure with cognitive processing and the role of supraspinal activity during control of human stance and locomotion. Existing brain imaging methods for actively behaving participants are described and new sensor technology allowing for mobile recordings of different behavioral states in humans is introduced. Finally, we review recent work demonstrating the feasibility of a MoBI system that was developed at the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience at the University of California, San Diego, demonstrating the range of behavior that can be investigated with this method.

However, after the epilepsy is completely under control, the recurrence rate is high once the drug dose is reduced gradually. The present study investigated the possible correlation between the changes shown by ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG) and epilepsy recurrence after medication withdrawal, and assessed the value of ambulatory EEG findings in predicting the recurrence of epilepsy after medication withdrawal, in 265 patients from Southern China followed up for 5 years. Anticonvulsants were withdrawn until onset had been controlled thoroughly for over 3 years and ambulatory EEG detected no abnormalities. Ambulatory EEG was performed at least once per year, and findings at the first visit, during treatment, and before and after medication withdrawal were compared and analyzed. There were 47 patients with recurrent epilepsy in this study. Patients with normal ambulatory EEG findings at the first visit and during treatment had lower recurrence rate (about 8.1%) compared to patients with epileptic waves (25.0%), and patients with focal epileptic waves in the temporal, occipital, frontal, and parietal lobes, or in multiple areas was even higher. Patients with epileptic waves also showed higher clinical recurrence rate during the follow-up period. Abnormal ambulatory EEG findings are an important indicator of epileptic recurrence, and is of great value in predicting the recurrence of epilepsy after medication withdrawal.

Independent Component Analysis of Gait-Related Movement Artifact Recorded using EEG Electrodes during Treadmill Walking	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						walking; cortical sources; blind source separation; artifact removal; electroencephalography	OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; INVERSE; FOCUSS; SPECTROSCOPY; PERFORMANCE; ACTIVATION; SEPARATION; COGNITION; RHYTHMS	There has been a recent surge in the use of electroencephalography (EEG) as a tool for mobile brain imaging due to its portability and fine time resolution. When EEG is combined with independent component analysis (ICA) and source localization techniques, it can model electrocortical activity as arising from temporally independent signals located in spatially distinct cortical areas. However, for mobile tasks, it is not clear how movement artifacts influence ICA and source localization. We devised a novel method to collect pure movement artifact data (devoid of any electrophysiological signals) with a 256-channel EEG system. We first blocked true electrocortical activity using a silicone swim cap. Over the silicone layer, we placed a simulated scalp with electrical properties similar to real human scalp. We collected EEG movement artifact signals from ten healthy, young subjects wearing this setup as they walked on a treadmill at speeds from 0.4-1.6 m/s. We performed ICA and dipole fitting on the EEG movement artifact data to quantify how accurately these methods would identify the artifact signals as non neural. ICA and dipole fitting accurately localized 99% of the independent components in non-neural locations or lacked dipolar characteristics. The remaining 1% of sources had locations within the brain volume and low residual variances, but had topographical maps, power spectra, time courses, and event related spectral perturbations typical of non neural sources. Caution should be exercised when interpreting ICA for data that includes semi-periodic artifacts including artifact arising from human walking. Alternative methods are needed for the identification and separation of movement artifact in mobile EEG signals, especially methods that can be performed in real time. Separating true brain signals from motion artifact could clear the way for EEG brain computer interfaces for assistance during mobile activities, such as walking.

Hybrid interfaces (hHMIs) represent a very recent solution to enhance the performance of single-signal approaches. These are classification approaches that combine multiple human-machine interfaces, normally including at least one BCI with other biosignals, such as the electromyography (EMG). However, their use for the decoding of gait activity is still limited. In this work, we propose and evaluate a hybrid human-machine interface (hHMI) to decode walking phases of both legs from the Bayesian fusion of EEG and EMG signals. The proposed hHMI significantly outperforms its single-signal counterparts, by providing high and stable performance even when the reliability of the muscular activity is compromised temporarily (e.g., fatigue) or permanently (e.g., weakness). Indeed, the hybrid approach shows a smooth degradation of classification performance after temporary EMG alteration, with more than 75% of accuracy at 30% of EMG amplitude, with respect to the EMG classifier whose performance decreases below 60% of accuracy. Moreover, the fusion of EEG and EMG information helps keeping a stable recognition rate of each gait phase of more than 80% independently on the permanent level of EMG degradation. From our study and findings from the literature, we suggest that the use of hybrid interfaces may be the key to enhance the usability of technologies restoring or assisting the locomotion on a wider population of patients in clinical applications and outside the laboratory environment.

In this study, MoBI was employed to describe the behavioral and neurophysiological aspects of three different commonly occurring walking conditions in healthy adults. The experimental conditions were self-paced walking, walking while conversing with a friend and lastly walking while texting with a smartphone. We hypothesized that gait performance would decrease with increased cognitive demands and that condition-specific neural activation would involve condition-specific brain areas. Gait kinematics and high density electroencephalography (EEG) were recorded whilst walking around a university campus. Conditions with dual tasks were accompanied by decreased gait performance. Walking while conversing was associated with an increase of theta (theta) and beta (beta) neural power in electrodes located over left-frontal and right parietal regions, whereas walking while texting was associated with a decrease of beta neural power in a cluster of electrodes over the frontal-premotor and sensorimotor cortices when compared to walking whilst conversing. In conclusion, the behavioral "signatures" of common real-life activities performed outside the laboratory environment were accompanied by differing frequency-specific neural "biomarkers". The current findings encourage the study of the neural biomarkers of disrupted gait control in neurologically impaired patients.

We studied healthy human participants during active spatial learning of room-scale virtual reality (VR) mazes. In the invisible maze task, participants wearing a wireless electroencephalography (EEG) headset were free to explore their surroundings, only given the objective to build and foster a mental spatial representation of their environment. Spatial uncertainty was resolved by touching otherwise invisible walls that were briefly rendered visible inside VR, similar to finding your way in the dark. We showcase the capabilities of mobile brain/body imaging using VR, demonstrating several analysis approaches based on general linear models (GLMs) to reveal behavior-dependent brain dynamics. Confirming spatial learning via drawn sketch maps, we employed motion capture to image spatial exploration behavior describing a shift from initial exploration to subsequent exploitation of the mental representation. Using independent component analysis, the current work specifically targeted oscillations in response to wall touches reflecting isolated spatial learning events arising in deep posterior EEG sources located in the retrosplenial complex. Single-trial regression identified significant modulation of alpha oscillations by the immediate, egocentric, exploration behavior. When encountering novel walls, as well as with increasing walking distance between subsequent touches when encountering novel walls, alpha power decreased. We conclude that these oscillations play a prominent role during egocentric evidencing of allocentric spatial hypotheses.

A Channel Rejection Method for Attenuating Motion-Related Artifacts in EEG Recordings during Walking	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; artifacts; walking; locomotion; signal processing; mobile-brain imaging; ICA; EEG cleaning	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; TREADMILL WALKING; GAIT CYCLE; MOTOR; RHYTHMS; SIGNALS; CORTEX	Recording scalp electroencephalography (EEG) during human motion can introduce motion artifacts. Repetitive head movements can generate artifact patterns across scalp EEG sensors. There are many methods for identifying and rejecting bad channels and independent components from EEG datasets, but there is a lack of methods dedicated to evaluate specific intra-channel amplitude patterns for identifying motion-related artifacts. In this study, we proposed a template correlation rejection (TCR) as a novel method for identifying and rejecting EEG channels and independent components carrying motion-related artifacts. We recorded EEG data from 10 subjects during treadmill walking. The template correlation rejection method consists of creating templates of amplitude patterns and determining the fraction of total epochs presenting relevant correlation to the template. For EEG channels, the template correlation rejection removed channels presenting the majority of epochs (>75%) correlated to the template, and presenting pronounced amplitude in comparison to all recorded channels. For independent components, the template correlation rejection removed components presenting the majority of epochs correlated to the template. Evaluation of scalp maps and power spectra confirmed low neural content for the rejected components. We found that channels identified for rejection contained similar to 60% higher delta power, and had spectral properties locked to the gait phases. After rejecting the identified channels and running independent component analysis on the EEG datasets, the proposed method identified 4.3 +/- 1.8 independent components (out of 198 +/- 12) with substantive motion-related artifacts. These results indicate that template correlation rejection is an effective method for rejecting EEG channels contaminated with motion-related artifact during human locomotion.

The role of outpatient ambulatory electroencephalography in the diagnosis and management of adults with epilepsy or nonepileptic attack disorder: A systematic literature review	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Review						Ambulatory electroencephalography; Diagnostic yield; Epilepsy; Nonepileptic attack disorder; Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures	INPATIENT VIDEO-EEG; CLINICAL UTILITY; 16-CHANNEL EEG; CASSETTE EEG; SEIZURES; HOME	Electroencephalography (EEG) is an established diagnostic tool with important implications for the clinical management of patients with epilepsy or nonepileptic attack disorder. Different types of long-term EEG recording strategies have been developed over the last decades, including the widespread use of ambulatory electroencephalography (AEEG), which holds great potential in terms of both clinical usefulness and cost-effectiveness. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic review of the scientific literature on the use of AEEG in the diagnosis of epilepsy and nonepileptic attacks in adult patients. Taken together, our findings confirmed that AEEG is a useful diagnostic tool in patients with equivocal findings on routine EEG studies and influences management decisions in the majority of studies. There is evidence that AEEG is also more likely to capture events than sleep-deprived EEG; however, there are currently insufficient data available to compare the diagnostic utility of modern AEEG technology with inpatient video-telemetry. Further research on the combined use of AEEG and home-video recording is, therefore, warranted. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used technique to address research questions about brain functioning, from controlled laboratorial conditions to naturalistic environments. However, EEG data are affected by biological (e.g. ocular, myogenic) and non-biological (e.g. movement-related) artifacts, which-depending on their extent-may limit the interpretability of the study results. Blind source separation (BSS) approaches have demonstrated to be particularly promising for the attenuation of artifacts in high-density EEG (hdEEG) data. Previous EEG artifact removal studies suggested that it may not be optimal to use the same BSS method for different kinds of artifacts. Approach. In this study, we developed a novel multi-step BSS approach to optimize the attenuation of ocular, movement-related and myogenic artifacts from hdEEG data. For validation purposes, we used hdEEG data collected in a group of healthy participants in standing, slow-walking and fast-walking conditions. During part of the experiment, a series of tone bursts were used to evoke auditory responses. We quantified event-related potentials (ERPs) using hdEEG signals collected during an auditory stimulation, as well as the event-related desynchronization (ERD) by contrasting hdEEG signals collected in walking and standing conditions, without auditory stimulation. We compared the results obtained in terms of auditory ERP and motor-related ERD using the proposed multi-step BSS approach, with respect to two classically used single-step BSS approaches. Main results. The use of our approach yielded the lowest residual noise in the hdEEG data, and permitted to retrieve stronger and more reliable modulations of neural activity than alternative solutions. Overall, our study confirmed that the performance of BSS-based artifact removal can be improved by using specific BSS methods and parameters for different kinds of artifacts. Significance. Our technological solution supports a wider use of hdEEG-based source imaging in movement and rehabilitation studies, and contributes to the further development of mobile brain/body imaging applications.

J	Strangman, GE; Ivkovic, V; Zhang, Q				Strangman, Gary E.; Ivkovic, Vladimir; Zhang, Quan			Wearable brain imaging with multimodal physiological monitoring	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						ambulatory brain imaging; diffuse optical tomography; near-infrared spectroscopy; physiological monitoring	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; CEREBRAL AUTOREGULATION; OXYGEN DELIVERY; INSTRUMENTATION; ARTIFACT; SCALP; EEG	The brain is a central component of cognitive and physical human performance. Measures, including functional brain activation, cerebral perfusion, cerebral oxygenation, evoked electrical responses, and resting hemodynamic and electrical activity are all related to, or can predict, health status or performance decrements. However, measuring brain physiology typically requires large, stationary machines that are not suitable for mobile or self-monitoring. Moreover, when individuals are ambulatory, systemic physiological fluctuations-e.g., in heart rate, blood pressure, skin perfusion, and more-can interfere with noninvasive brain measurements. In efforts to address the physiological monitoring and performance assessment needs for astronauts during space-flight, we have developed easy-to-use, wearable prototypes, such as NINscan, for near-infrared scanning, which can collect synchronized multimodal physiology data, including hemodynamic deep-tissue imaging (including brain and muscles), electroencephalography, electrocardiography, electromyography, electrooculography, accelerometry, gyroscopy, pressure, respiration, and temperature measurements. Given their self-contained and portable nature, these devices can be deployed in a much broader range of settings-including austere environments-thereby, enabling a wider range of novel medical and research physiology applications. We review these, including high-altitude assessments, self-deployable multimodal e.g., (polysomnographic) recordings in remote or low-resource environments, fluid shifts in variable-gravity, or spaceflight analog environments, intracranial brain motion during high-impact sports, and long-duration monitoring for clinical symptom-capture in various clinical conditions. In addition to further enhancing sensitivity and miniaturization, advanced computational algorithms could help support real-time feedback and alerts regarding performance and health.

Toward Neuroscience of the Everyday World (NEW) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy	CURRENT OPINION IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Review						fNIRS; Brain; Mobile; Neuroscience; Everyday world; Real world; Real life	BRAIN; FNIRS; EEG; CORTEX; SYSTEM	Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) assesses human brain activity by noninvasively measuring changes of cerebral hemoglobin concentrations caused by modulation of neuronal activity. Recent progress in signal processing and advances in system design, such as miniaturization, wearability, and system sensitivity, have strengthened fNIRS as a viable and cost-effective complement to functional magnetic resonance imaging, expanding the repertoire of experimental studies that can be performed by the neuroscience community. The availability of fNIRS and electroencephalography for routine, increasingly unconstrained, and mobile brain imaging is leading toward a new domain that we term "Neuroscience of the Everyday World" (NEW). In this light, we review recent advances in hardware, study design, and signal processing, and discuss challenges and future directions toward achieving NEW.

MoBI studies and analyses pipelines combine brain measurements, e.g. Electroencephalography (EEG), with motion data as participants conduct tasks with nearnatural behavior. Within the field however, standard source decomposition and reconstruction pipelines largely rely on unsupervised blind source separation (BSS) approaches and do not consider movement information to guide the decomposition of oscillatory brain sources. We propose the use of a supervised spatial filtering method, Source Power Co-modulation (SPoC), for extracting source components that co-modulate with body motion. Further, we introduce a method to validate the quality of oscillatory sources in MoBI studies. We illustrate the approach to investigate the link between hand and head movement kinematics and power dynamics of EEG sources while participants explore an invisible maze in virtual reality. Stable oscillatory source envelopes correlating with hand and head motion were isolated in all subjects, with median rho = :13 for all sources and median rho = :16 for sources passing the selection criteria. The results indicate that it is possible to improve movement related source separation to further guide our understanding of how movement and brain dynamics interact.

However, the electroencephalography signals are distorted by movement artifacts and electromyography signals in ambulatory condition, which make hard to recognize human intention. In addition, as hardware issues are also challenging, ear-EEG has been developed for practical brain-computer interface and is widely used. However, ear-EEG still contains contaminated signals. In this paper, we proposed robust two-stream deep neural networks in walking conditions and analyzed the visual response EEG signals in the scalp and ear in terms of statistical analysis and brain-computer interface performance. We validated the signals with the visual response paradigm, steady- state visual evoked potential. The brain-computer interface performance deteriorated as 3 similar to 14% when walking fast at 1.6 m/s. When applying the proposed method, the accuracies increase 15% in cap-EEG and 7% in ear-EEG. The proposed method shows robust to the ambulatory condition in session dependent and session-to-session experiments.

The initial technological drawbacks of aEEG have been circumvented by incorporating digital and computer technology. Some of the current devices provide the facility of synchronous video recording. Low cost, convenience, higher diagnostic yield, and the ability to capture circadian patterns are the main advantages of aEEG. It is a useful tool in the diagnosis of epilepsy and nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders. Ambulatory EEG is superior to routine EEG in capturing interictal epileptiform abnormalities particularly in relation to natural sleep. However, the use of aEEG in presurgical workup is still unclear and more research is needed. At present, the place of EEG in the decision making for antiepileptic drug withdrawal is unclear and aEEG is an ideal tool to study this research question. Well-designed studies are needed to evaluate the use of aEEG in the assessment of response to antiepileptic therapy and occupational safety. Ambulatory EEG is an underutilized tool and more research is needed to expand the horizon of its applications in clinical practice.

Here we present the technical details and validation of a framework for building multi-platform, portable EEG applications with real-time 3D source reconstruction. The system - Smartphone Brain Scanner - combines an off-the-shelf neuroheadset or EEG cap with a smartphone or tablet, and as such represents the first fully portable system for real-time 3D EEG imaging. We discuss the benefits and challenges, including technical limitations as well as details of real-time reconstruction of 3D images of brain activity. We present examples of brain activity captured in a simple experiment involving imagined finger tapping, which shows that the acquired signal in a relevant brain region is similar to that obtained with standard EEG lab equipment. Although the quality of the signal in a mobile solution using an off-the-shelf consumer neuroheadset is lower than the signal obtained using high-density standard EEG equipment, we propose mobile application development may offset the disadvantages and provide completely new opportunities for neuroimaging in natural settings.

In order to integrate from clinical applications to research capabilities, the Trackit has to be interfaced with software that be able to do the electroencephalography (EEG) signals processing. In our project, LabVIEW is chosen as our software platform. Therefore, we have taken the initiative to developed the software for Trackit-LabVIEW interfaced. In this paper, we have demonstrated that the acquired electroencephalography (EEG) signals obtained using Trackit-LabVIEW software. Example of signal processing application on the raw electroencephalography (EEG) signals was shown in the results section.

EEG-BASED NEUROERGONOMICS FOR 3D USER INTERFACES: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES	TRAVAIL HUMAIN			English	Review						3D interaction; electroencephalography; workload; attention; error; visual comfort	BRAIN; POTENTIALS; USABILITY	3D user interfaces (3DUI) are increasingly used in a number of applications, spanning from entertainment to industrial design. However, 3D interaction tasks are generally more complex for users since interacting with a 3D environment is more cognitively demanding than perceiving and interacting with a 2D one. As such, it is essential that we could evaluate finely user experience, in order to propose seamless interfaces. To do so, a promising research direction is to measure users' inner-state based on brain signals acquired during interaction, by following a neuroergonomics approach. Combined with existing methods, such tool can be used to strengthen the understanding of user experience. In this paper, we review the work being undergone in this area; what has been achieved and the new challenges that arise. We describe how a mobile brain imaging technique such as electroencephalography (EEG) brings continuous and non-disruptive measures. EEG-based evaluation of users can give insights about multiple dimensions of the user experience, with realistic interaction tasks or novel interfaces. We investigate four constructs: workload, attention, error recognition and visual comfort. Ultimately, these metrics could help to alleviate users when they interact with computers.

Use of an auditory pacing stimulus stream has been recommended to identify deficits and treat gait impairments in neurologic populations. Here, the rhythmic cueing paradigm required healthy young participants to walk on a treadmill (constant speed) while attempting to maintain step synchrony with an auditory pacing stream and to adapt their step length and rate to unanticipated shifts in tempo of the pacing stimuli (e.g., sudden shifts to a faster or slower tempo). High-density electroencephalography (EEG, 108 channels), surface electromyography (EMG, bilateral tibialis anterior), pressure sensors on the heel (to register timing of heel strikes), and goniometers (knee, hip, and ankle joint angles) were concurrently recorded in 20 participants. The data is provided in the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format to promote data sharing and reuse, and allow the inclusion of the data into fully automated data analysis workflows.

Human electrocortical, electromyographical, ocular, and kinematic data during perturb ed walking and standing	DATA IN BRIEF			English	Article; Data Paper						Mobile brain/body imaging; Electroencephalography; Electromyography; Electrooculography; Motion capture; Independent component analysis		Active balance control is critical for performing many of our everyday activities. Our nervous systems rely on multiple sensory inputs to inform cortical processing, leading to coordinated muscle actions that maintain balance. However, such cortical processing can be challenging to record during mobile balance tasks due to limitations in noninvasive neuroimaging and motion artifact contamination. Here, we present a synchronized, multi-modal dataset from 30 healthy, young human participants during standing and walking while undergoing brief sensorimotor perturbations. Our dataset includes 20 total hours of high-density electroencephalography (EEG) recorded from 128 scalp electrodes, along with surface electromyography (EMG) from 10 neck and leg electrodes, electrooculography (EOG) recorded from 3 electrodes, and 3D body position from 2 sensors. In addition, we include similar to 18000 total balance perturbation events across participants. To facilitate data reuse, we share this dataset in the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) data standard and publicly release code that replicates our previous event-related findings.

Normally subject to the physical constraints in labs, neuroscience experimental paradigms can be transformed into dynamic environments allowing for the capturing of brain signals in everyday contexts. Using smartphones or tablets to access text or images may enable experimental design capable of tracing emotional responses when shopping or consuming media, incorporating sensorimotor responses reflecting our actions into brain machine interfaces, and facilitating neurofeedback training over extended periods. Even though the quality of consumer neuroheadsets is still lower than laboratory equipment and susceptible to environmental noise, we show that mobile neuroimaging solutions, like the Smartphone Brain Scanner, complemented by 3D reconstruction or source separation techniques may support a range of neuroimaging applications and thus become a valuable addition to high-end neuroimaging solutions.

Nevertheless, due to technical limitations of the EEG decoding, the brain-computer interface (BCI) protocol is often complex, and the mapping between the EEG signal and the practical instructions lack of logic associated, which restrict the user's actual use. This paper presents a strategy that can be used to control a quadruped locomotion robot by user's instinctive action, based on five kinds of movement related neurophysiological signal. In actual use, the user drives or imagines the limbs/wrists action to generate EEG signal to adjust the real movement of the robot according to his/her own motor reflex of the robot locomotion. This method is easy for real use, as the user generates the brain-control signal through the instinctive reaction. By adopting the behavioral control of learning and evolution based on the proposed strategy, complex movement task may be realized by instinctive brain-control.

Eleven of 15 patients (74%) relapsed during or after AED withdrawal. All six patients with epileptiform discharges on ambulatory electroencephalography prior to AED withdrawal relapsed, compared with five of nine patients without epileptiform discharges. Ambulatory electroencephalography significantly increases the yield in detecting epileptiform discharges (n = 6) compared with routine electroencephalography (n = 1). A negative electroencephalographic finding is only a poor predictor of seizure freedom following AED withdrawal. On clinical grounds, our data suggest that patients with epilepsy, learning disability, and other known risk factors (history of abnormal EEGs and frequent seizures, abnormal MRI) are at great risk of seizure relapse during AED taper, irrespective of very long periods of seizure freedom.

Jane			Removing Muscle Artifacts From EEG Data via Underdetermined Joint Blind Source Separation: A Simulation Study	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS II-EXPRESS BRIEFS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Electromyography; Muscles; Correlation; Matrix decomposition; Covariance matrices; Underdetermined; joint canonical polyadic decomposition; artifact removal; auto-correlations	ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM SIGNALS; IDENTIFICATION	Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are often contaminated by artifacts from electromyogram (EMG). This artifact not only affects the visual analysis but also strongly impedes its various usages in biomedical research. With a sufficient number of EEG recordings, numerous blind source separation (BSS) methods can be applied to suppress or remove such EMG artifacts. However, in many practical applications (e.g., ambulatory health-care monitoring), the number of EEG sensors is often limited, while conventional BSS methods (e.g., independent component analysis) may fail to work in such cases. Considering the increasing need for acquiring EEG signals in ambulatory environments, we propose a novel underdetermined joint BSS method to remove EMG artifacts from EEG data with a limited number of EEG sensors. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through numerical simulations in which EEG recordings are contaminated with muscle artifacts. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively remove muscle artifacts while preserving EEG signals successfully.

In mobile applications these possibilities are attractive as elements in systems for personal state monitoring and well-being, and in clinical settings were patients may need imaging under quasi-natural conditions. Challenges related to the ill-posed nature of the EEG imaging problem escalate in mobile real-time systems and new algorithms and the use of meta-data may be necessary to succeed. Based on recent work (Delorme et al., 2011) we hypothesize that solutions of interest are sparse. We propose a new Markovian prior for temporally sparse solutions and a direct search for sparse solutions as implemented by the so-called "variational garrote" (Kappen, 2011). We show that the new prior and inference scheme leads to improved solutions over competing sparse Bayesian schemes based on the "multiple measurement vectors" approach.

Long-term Home Video EEG for Recording Clinical Events	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						Epilepsy; Electroencephalography; Epileptic seizures; Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures; Diagnostic yield; Ambulatory video EEG	PSYCHOGENIC NONEPILEPTIC SEIZURES; AMBULATORY EEG; DIAGNOSTIC YIELD; DIFFERENTIAL-DIAGNOSIS; OUTPATIENT EEG; CASSETTE-EEG; EPILEPSY; TELEMETRY; UTILITY; CHILDREN	Around 50 years after the first EEG acquisition by Hans Berger, its use in ambulatory setting was demonstrated. Ever since, ambulatory EEG has been widely available and routinely used in the United States (and to a lesser extent in Europe) for diagnosis and management of patients with epilepsy. This technology alone cannot help with semiological characterization, and absence of video is one of its main drawbacks. Addition of video to ambulatory EEG potentially improves diagnostic yield and opens new aspects of utility for better characterization of patient's events, including differential diagnosis, classification, and quantification of seizure burden. Studies evaluating quality of ambulatory video EEG (aVEEG) suggest good quality recordings are feasible. In the utilization of aVEEG, to maximize yield, it is important to consider pretest probability. Having clear pretest questions and a strong index of suspicion for focal, generalized convulsive or non-epileptic seizures further increases the usefulness of aVEEG. In this article, which is part of the topical issue "Ambulatory EEG," the authors compare long-term home aVEEG to inpatient video EEG monitoring, discuss aVEEG's use in diagnosis and follow-up of patients, and present the authors' own experience of the utility of aVEEG in a teaching hospital setting.

Deployment of Mobile EEG Technology in an Art Museum Setting: Evaluation of Signal Quality and Usability	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						MoBI; aesthetics; EEG; dry-electrodes; signal quality; museum; real-world recording	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; TREADMILL WALKING; ELECTRODES; ARTIFACTS; COGNITION; DESIGN; SYSTEM; ERP	Electroencephalography (EEG) has emerged as a powerful tool for quantitatively studying the brain that enables natural and mobile experiments. Recent advances in EEG have allowed for the use of dry electrodes that do not require a conductive medium between the recording electrode and the scalp. The overall goal of this research was to gain an understanding of the overall usability and signal quality of dry EEG headsets compared to traditional gel-based systems in an unconstrained environment. EEG was used to collect Mobile Brain-body Imaging (MoBI) data from 432 people as they experienced an art exhibit in a public museum. The subjects were instrumented with either one of four dry electrode EEG systems or a conventional gel electrode EEG system. Each of the systems was evaluated based on the signal quality and usability in a real-world setting. First, we describe the various artifacts that were characteristic of each of the systems. Second, we report on each system's usability and their limitations in a mobile setting. Third, to evaluate signal quality for task discrimination and characterization, we employed a data driven clustering approach on the data from 134 of the 432 subjects (those with reliable location tracking information and usable EEG data) to evaluate the power spectral density (PSD) content of the EEG recordings. The experiment consisted of a baseline condition in which the subjects sat quietly facing a white wall for 1 min. Subsequently, the participants were encouraged to explore the exhibit for as long as they wished (piece-viewing). No constraints were placed upon the individual in relation to action, time, or navigation of the exhibit. In this freely-behaving approach, the EEG systems varied in their capacity to record characteristic modulations in the EEG data, with the gel-based system more clearly capturing stereotypical alpha and beta-band modulations.

However, the electroencephalography (EEG) signals are distorted by movement artifacts and electromyography signals when users are moving, which make hard to recognize human intention. In addition, as hardware issues are also challenging, ear-EEG has been developed for practical brain-computer interface and has been widely used. In this paper, we proposed ensemble-based convolutional neural networks in ambulatory environment and analyzed the visual event-related potential responses in scalp- and ear-EEG in terms of statistical analysis and brain-computer interface performance. The brain-computer interface performance deteriorated as 3-14% when walking fast at 1.6 m/s. The proposed methods showed 0.728 in average of the area under the curve. The proposed method shows robust to the ambulatory environment and imbalanced data as well.

Yet traditional brain imaging paradigms typically allow and record only minimal participant behavior, then reduce the recorded data to single map features of averaged responses. To more fully investigate the complex links between distributed brain dynamics and motivated natural behavior, we propose the development of wearable mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) systems that continuously capture the wearer's high-density electrical brain and muscle signals, three-dimensional body movements, audiovisual scene and point of regard, plus new data-driven analysis methods to model their interrelationships. The new imaging modality should allow new insights into how spatially distributed brain dynamics support natural human cognition and agency. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Diagnostic Accuracy of the Ambulatory EEG vs. Routine EEG for First Single Unprovoked Seizures and Seizure Recurrence: The DX-Seizure Study	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Review						ambulatory EEG; seizure recurrence; sensitivity; specificity; predictive values; diagnostic accuracy; epilepsy; single unprovoked seizure	EPILEPSY; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; MANAGEMENT; ADULTS; MODEL; RISK	Background: The DX-Seizure study aims to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and likelihood ratio) of the ambulatory EEG in comparison with the first routine EEG, and a second routine EEG right before the ambulatory EEG, on adult patients with first single unprovoked seizure (FSUS) and define the utility of ambulatory EEG in forecasting seizure recurrence in these patients after 1-year follow-up. Methods: The DX-Seizure study is a prospective cohort of 113 adult patients (>= 18-year-old) presenting with FSUS to the Single Seizure Clinic for evaluation. These patients will be assessed by a neurologist/epileptologist with the first routine EEG (referral EEG) and undergo a second routine EEG and ambulatory EEG. The three EEG (first routine EEG as gold standard) will be compared and evaluated their diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and likelihood ratios) with respect of epileptiform activity and other abnormalities. One-year follow-up of each patient will be used to assess recurrence of seizures after a FSUS and the utility of the ambulatory EEG to forecast these recurrences. Discussion: To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first study to prospectively examine the use of ambulatory EEG for a FSUS in adults and its use for prediction of recurrence of seizures. The overarching goal is to improve diagnostic accuracy with the use of ambulatory EEG in patients with their FSUS. We anticipate that this will decrease incorrect or uncertain diagnoses with resulting psychological and financial cost to the patient. We also anticipate that an improved method to predicting the recurrence of seizures will reduce the chances of repeated seizures and their consequences.

As COVID-19 exposures and deaths continues to surge in the United States and around the world, other types of long-term EEG monitoring have risen to fill the gap and minimize hospital exposure. AEEG has high yield compared to standard EEG. Prolonged audiovisual video-EEG capability can record events and epileptiform activity with quality like inpatient video-EEG monitoring. Technological advances in AEEG using miniaturized hardware and wireless secure transmission have evolved to small portable devices that are perfect for people forced to stay at home during the pandemic. Application of seizure detection algorithms and Cloud-based storage with realtime access provides connectivity to AEEG interpreters during prolonged "shut-down". In this article we highlight the benefits of AEEG as an alternative to diagnostic inpatient VEM during the paradigm shift to mobile heath forced by the Coronavirus. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Medication changes, safety, and a lack of recording EEG in one's habitual environment may interfere with diagnostic representation and subsequently affect management. Some spells defy standard EEG because of ultradian and circadian times of occurrence, manifest nocturnal expression of epileptiform activity, and require classification for clarifying diagnostic input to identify optimal treatment. Some patients may be unaware of seizures, have frequent events, or subclinical seizures that require quantification before optimal management. The influence on antiseizure drug management and clinical drug research can be enlightened by long-term outpatient ambulatory EEG monitoring. With recent governmental shifts to focus on mobile health, ambulatory EEG monitoring has grown beyond diagnostic capabilities to target the dynamic effects of medical and nonmedical treatment for patients with epilepsy in their natural environment. Furthermore, newer applications in ambulatory monitoring include additional physiologic parameters (e.g., sleep, detection of myogenic signals, etc.) and extend treatment relevance to patients beyond seizure reduction alone addressing comorbid conditions. It is with this focus in mind that we direct our discussion on the present and future aspects of using ambulatory EEG monitoring in the treatment of patients with epilepsy.

A systematic EEG processing method was implemented to reduce artifacts. Source localization using independent component analysis and k-mean clustering algorithm revealed the involvement of four clusters in the brain (Left and Right Occipital Lobe, Posterior Parietal Cortex, and Motor Cortex) during the walking tasks. Our results show significant differences in spectral power in the Occipital cluster between level-ground (LW) and stair (SA) walking. Additionally, significant increases in spectral power were detected up to 1.4 second before the critical transition time (LW to SA). The findings have implications for developing noninvasive lower-limb neuroprostheses that predict, rather than respond to, the user gait intentions. This work is a further step toward the development of a multimodal Neural-machine Interface (NMI) that fuses EEG and electromyography (EMG) signals for intuitive and flexible control of power prosthetic legs.

The role of electroencephalography in the early diagnosis of non-convulsive status epilepticus in elderly patients with acute confusional state: Two possible strategies?	SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY			English	Review						Non-convulsive status epilepticus; Elderly; Acute confusional state; Electroencephalography	HAIRLINE EEG; AMBULATORY ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; SCREENING TOOL; CRITERIA; TERMINOLOGY; ADULTS; MANAGEMENT	Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) can pose considerable diagnostic challenges, especially in the elderly, because of the wide differential diagnosis with common underlying causes of acute confusional state in this age group. We reviewed the proposed electroencephalography (EEG) strategies to improve the diagnostic yield of non-convulsive status epilepticus in the elderly population. Specifically, a debated topic of clinical relevance is the exact role of the EEG in the early diagnosis of NCSE in the elderly. Two EEG strategies have been proposed to improve the diagnostic yield of NCSE: emergent abbreviated EEG (EAEEG) recordings with reduced montages, and continuous EEG (CEEG) monitoring. Both approaches appear to be potentially advantageous, but at the same time subject to intrinsic limitations. Our literature review found initial evidence that the diagnostic yield for NCSE of prolonged EEG recordings is superior to routine EEGs. Further research is needed to confirm these preliminary findings and to explore strategies to improve the feasibility of a more widespread use of prolonged recordings within acute clinical settings.

This has been achieved by conducting simulated (and occasionally, field) driving experiments while collecting driver brain signals of various types. Here, this sector of studies is comprehensively reviewed at both macro and micro scales. At the macro scale, bibliometric aspects of these studies are analysed. At the micro scale, different themes of neuroimaging driving behaviour research are identified and the findings within each theme are synthesised. The surveyed literature has reported on applications of four major brain imaging methods. These include Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Electroencephalography (EEG), Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG), with the first two being the most common methods in this domain. While collecting driver fMRI signal has been particularly instrumental in studying neural correlates of intoxicated driving (e.g. alcohol or cannabis) or distracted driving, the EEG method has been predominantly utilised in relation to the efforts aiming at development of automatic fatigue/drowsiness detection systems, a topic to which the literature on neuro-ergonomics of driving particularly has shown a spike of interest within the last few years. The survey also reveals that topics such as driver brain activity in semiautomated settings or neural activity of drivers with brain injuries or chronic neurological conditions have by contrast been investigated to a very limited extent. Potential topics in driving behaviour research are identified that could benefit from the adoption of neuroimaging methods in future studies. In terms of practicality, while fMRI and MEG experiments have proven rather invasive and technologically challenging for adoption in driving behaviour research, EEG and fNIRS applications have been more diverse. They have even been tested beyond simulated driving settings, in field driving experiments. Advantages and limitations of each of these four neuroimaging methods in the context of driving behaviour experiments are outlined in the paper.	[Haghani, Milad; Bliemer, Michiel C.

Although brain correlates of face processing have been established in previous fMRI and electroencephalography (EEG)/MEG studies, little is known about how the brain representation of faces and emotional expressions of faces in freely moving humans. The present study aimed to detect brain electrical potentials that occur during the viewing of human faces in natural settings. 64-channel wireless EEG and eye-tracking data were recorded in 19 participants while they moved in a mock art gallery and stopped at times to evaluate pictures hung on the walls. Positive, negative and neutral valence pictures of objects and human faces were displayed. The time instants in which pictures first occurred in the visual field were identified in eye-tracking data and used to reconstruct the triggers in continuous EEG data after synchronizing the time axes of the EEG and eye-tracking device. EEG data showed a clear face-related event-related potential (ERP) in the latency interval ranging from 165 to 210 ms (N170); this component was not seen whilst participants were viewing non-living objects. The face ERP component was stronger during viewing disgusted compared to neutral faces. Source dipole analysis revealed an equivalent current dipole in the right fusiform gyrus (BA37) accounting for N170 potential. Our study demonstrates for the first time the possibility of recording brain responses to human faces and emotional expressions in natural settings. This finding opens new possibilities for clinical, developmental, social, forensic, or marketing research in which information about face processing is of importance.

This highly integrative function encompasses sensorimotor, cognitive, and executive processes that jointly mediate active exploration and spatial learning. However, most neuroimaging approaches in humans are based on static, motion-constrained paradigms and they do not account for all these processes, in particular multisensory integration. Following the Mobile Brain/Body Imaging approach, we aimed to explore the cortical correlates of landmark-based navigation in actively behaving young adults, solving a Y-maze task in immersive virtual reality. EEG analysis identified a set of brain areas matching state-of-the-art brain imaging literature of landmark-based navigation. Spatial behavior in mobile conditions additionally involved sensorimotor areas related to motor execution and proprioception usually overlooked in static fMRI paradigms. Expectedly, we located a cortical source in or near the posterior cingulate, in line with the engagement of the retrosplenial complex in spatial reorientation. Consistent with its role in visuo-spatial processing and coding, we observed an alpha-power desynchronization while participants gathered visual information. We also hypothesized behavior-dependent modulations of the cortical signal during navigation. Despite finding few differences between the encoding and retrieval phases of the task, we identified transient time-frequency patterns attributed, for instance, to attentional demand, as reflected in the alpha/gamma range, or memory workload in the delta/theta range. We confirmed that combining mobile high-density EEG and biometric measures can help unravel the brain structures and the neural modulations subtending ecological landmark-based navigation.

EEG signals have been considered to be too noisy to record brain dynamics during human locomotion. Here, we present a real-time ambulatory brain computer interface which allows us to detect gait phases and remove motion-related artifacts from EEG signals during walking in real-world environments. We first construct stride-based artifact templates employing a gyroscope to measure the angular velocity of the human body. Then, we apply an adaptive Kalman filter to estimate the mapping between the stride-based artifact template and EEG space, subtracting the motion-related noise from the raw EEG signal. This study demonstrates the robustness of our system to remove gait-related movement artifacts during human locomotion. Experiments in real-world environments show the potential practicality of real-life applications of low-cost wearable and wireless BCI systems for users actively working in and interacting with their environments.

This leaves a blind spot lingering over the neuronal correlates of episodic memory formation in day-to-day life. To address this, we presented participants with a series of words to memorise along a pre-designated route across campus while a mobile EEG system acquired ongoing neural activity. Replicating lab-based subsequent memory effects (SMEs), we identified significant low to mid frequency power decreases (< 30 Hz), including beta power decreases over the left inferior frontal gyrus. When investigating the oscillatory correlates of temporal and spatial context binding, we found that items strongly bound to spatial context exhibited significantly greater theta power decreases than items strongly bound to temporal context. These findings expand upon lab-based studies by demonstrating the influence of real world contextual factors that underpin memory formation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, neural decoding of gait in developing children has yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we collected physiological data (electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG)), and kinematic data from children performing different locomotion tasks. We also developed a state space estimation model to decode lower limb joint angles from scalp EEG. Fluctuations in the amplitude of slow cortical potentials of EEG in the delta band (0.1 - 3 Hz) were used for prediction. The decoding accuracies (Pearson's r values) were promising (Hip: 0.71; Knee: 0.59; Ankle: 0 51). Our results demonstrate the feasibility of neural decoding of children walking and have implications for the development of a real-time closed-loop BMI system for the control of a pediatric exoskeleton.

This study evaluates the yield of ambulatory EEG-video for the diagnosis of epilepsy. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the ambulatory EEG-video monitoring data from 200 consecutive and unselected patients aged 12 years and older performed by a single company (RSC Diagnostic Services) between January 2018 and May 2018. Studies were processed by two senior certified long-term monitoring EEG technologists and interpreted by neurologists. Results Of the 200 patients, 130 (65%) were women, mean age was 45 years. Mean duration of studies were 76.6 hours (range 23-175 hours). There were 110 studies (55%) with events recorded and 101 (92%) were captured on video. Epileptic events accounted for 17.8% (18/101) of the events captured and 9% (18/200) of our total cohort. Nonepileptic diagnosis accounted for 38% of the total number of patients in study (76/200). Conclusion Ambulatory EEG-video monitoring may be a useful alternative to inpatient epilepsy monitoring unit, particularly with high clinical suspicion for nonepileptic events.

Dual-electrode motion artifact cancellation for mobile electroencephalography	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						electroencephalography; motion artifact; real-world neuroimaging; signal quality	TREADMILL WALKING; EEG ARTIFACTS; MOVEMENT; REMOVAL; FMRI	Objective. Our purpose was to evaluate the ability of a dual electrode approach to remove motion artifact from electroencephalography (EEG) measurements. Approach. We used a phantom human head model and robotic motion platform to induce motion while collecting scalp EEG. We assembled a dual electrode array capturing (a) artificial neural signals plus noise from scalp EEG electrodes, and (b) electrically isolated motion artifact noise. We recorded artificial neural signals broadcast from antennae in the phantom head during continuous vertical sinusoidal movements (stationary, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2.00 Hz movement frequencies). We evaluated signal quality using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), cross-correlation, and root mean square error (RMSE) between the ground truth broadcast signals and the recovered EEG signals. Main results. Signal quality was restored following noise cancellation when compared to single electrode EEG measurements collected with no phantom head motion. Significance. We achieved substantial motion artifact attenuation using secondary electrodes for noise cancellation. These methods can be applied to studying electrocortical signals during human locomotion to improve real-world neuroimaging using EEG.

The neural correlates of musical mode and tempo perception revealed by electroencephalography (EEG) have not been adequately addressed in the literature. Method: This study used independent component analysis (ICA) to systematically assess spatio-spectral EEG dynamics associated with the changes of musical mode and tempo. Results: Empirical results showed that music with major mode augmented delta-band activity over the right sensorimotor cortex, suppressed theta activity over the superior parietal cortex, and moderately suppressed beta activity over the medial frontal cortex, compared to minor-mode music, whereas fast-tempo music engaged significant alpha suppression over the right sensorimotor cortex. Conclusion: The resultant EEG brain sources were comparable with previous studies obtained by other neuroimaging modalities, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET).

Faster Gait Speeds Reduce Alpha and Beta EEG Spectral Power From Human Sensorimotor Cortex	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Electrodes; Legged locomotion; Muscles; Fluctuations; Sensors; Electromyography; Electroencephalography; electromyography; independent component analysis; legged locomotion	MOTOR CORTEX; ELECTROCORTICAL ACTIVITY; LOCOMOTOR SPEED; BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION; MOVEMENT; CIRCUITS; DYNAMICS; WALKING; DESYNCHRONIZATION	Objective: Our aim was to determine if walking speed affected human sensorimotor electrocortical dynamics using mobile high-density electroencephalography (EEG). Methods: To overcome limitations associated with motion and muscle artifact contamination in EEG recordings, we compared solutions for artifact removal using novel dual-layer EEG electrodes and alternative signal processing methods. Dual-layer EEG simultaneously recorded human electrocortical signals and isolated motion artifacts using pairs of mechanically coupled and electrically independent electrodes. For electrical muscle activity removal, we incorporated electromyographic (EMG) recordings from the neck into our mobile EEG data processing pipeline. We compared artifact removal methods during treadmill walking at four speeds (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 m/s). Results: Left and right sensorimotor alpha and beta spectral power increased in contralateral limb single support and push off, and decreased during contralateral limb swing at each speed. At faster walking speeds, sensorimotor spectral power fluctuations were less pronounced across the gait cycle with reduced alpha and beta power (p < 0.05) compared to slower speeds. Isolated noise recordings and neck EMG spectral power fluctuations matched gait events and showed broadband spectral power increases at faster speeds. Conclusion and significance: Dual-layer EEG enabled us to isolate changes in human sensorimotor electrocortical dynamics across walking speeds. A comparison of signal processing approaches revealed similar intrastride cortical fluctuations when applying common (e.g., artifact subspace reconstruction) and novel artifact rejection methods. Dual-layer EEG, however, allowed us to document and rule out residual artifacts, which exposed sensorimotor spectral power changes across gait speeds.

In this paper, we present work on categorizing these head-movement artefacts as one distinct class and on using support vector machines to automatically detect their presence. The use of additional physical signals in detecting head-movement artefacts is also investigated by means of support vector machines classifiers implemented with gyroscope waveforms. Finally, the combination of features extracted from EEG and gyroscope signals is explored in order to design an algorithm which incorporates both physical and physiological signals in accurately detecting artefacts arising from head-movements.

Application of fuzzy logic's model	REVISTA DE NEUROLOGIA			Spanish	Article						electroencefalography; fuzzy logic; medically refractory epilepsy; prolonged monitoring; temporal lobe epilepsy; video-EEG	SEIZURES	Introduction. The video-electroencephalography (video-EEG) prolonged monitoring is an important auxiliary diagnostic instrument in epilepsy, and provides valuable information to classify the type of crisis and epileptic syndromes and to localize the epileptogenic zone. The fuzzy logic gives an efficient and intelligent analysis method, able to make inferences over ambiguous systems, and has been increasing used in several areas. Aims. To correlate clinical and electro-encephalographic data obtained with video-EEG of patients with clinical and interictal electroencephalography criteria of medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and to make inferences of diagnosis precision with the application of the Fuzzy Hierarchy COPPE/Cosenza Model; to investigate the frequency in which the clinical, syndromic and topographic diagnosis can be modified in these patients; to evaluate the usefulness and applicability of fuzzy logic on the analysis of this type of study. Patients and methods. Transversal, prospective study, that included 22 adult outpatients with ambulatory diagnosis of medically refractory TLE, submitted to video-EEG monitoring that varied from 48 hours to 10 days. The grade of diagnosis precision was infered by fuzzy logic. Results. The clinical diagnosis of epilepsy was modified in two (9%) patients, the syndromic in six (27.2%) and the topographic in 16 (72.7%). The fuzzy indicators of ambulatory diagnostic precision were: 0.91 to clinical diagnosis; 0.74 to syndromic diagnosis and 0.36 to topographic diagnosis, considering 1 the maximal precision diagnostic value (attributed to the video-EEG results). Conclusions.

In this study, it is presented a novel epileptic-like event detection algorithm based on a mixture of amplitude, frequency and spatial analysis with rule-based decision. In this work, EEG signals from 6 different subjects were searched for epileptic-like and normal data segments. The herein proposed algorithm detects putative epileptic EEG channels by comparing the RMS values of EEG activity with a hysteresis threshold, on a channel basis. The raw EEG signals are filtered with an artefact attenuation technique. The threshold is calculated on a reviewer-visually-selected baseline epoch, free of artefacts. Generalized epileptic activity detection is based on a spatial decision rule. Experimental results have shown detection rates as high as 95% with a false-negative rate as low as 1%. The algorithm seems to show a promising detection performance, even on artifact contaminated datasets. The proposed algorithm is intended to be used in real-time ambulatory monitoring of epileptic patients, with subject personalization, small size window analysis, good artefact immunity and no need for classifier training.

To increase portability of the setup and reduce cabling it is possible to perform a unified and real-time synchronized recording of data from multiple sources. However, delays and jitter may impair the quality of the subsequent event-related potential (ERP) analyses. Here we used an online auditory oddball P300 paradigm on one subject to compare the quality of P300 ERPs obtained (i) with online synchronization and alignment and (ii) offline with conventional alignment (synchronization channel) while sitting. We showed that offline and online synchronization strategies provided comparable although slightly different P300 ERP. We also recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) while walking indoors and outdoors. A decreasing P300 amplitude respectively from sitting to walking indoors and outdoors confirms the dual-task effect on P300. These results show that integrated real-time P300 protocols are feasible but it is also necessary to test delays and quantify the jitter among different signals when developing real-world MoBI applications.

However, performance differences still exist between the laboratory and the real world environments. One of the main reasons for such differences comes from the user's unstable physical states (e.g., human movements are not strictly controlled), which produce unexpected signal artifacts. Hence, to minimize the performance degradation of electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCIs, we present a novel artifact removal method named constrained independent component analysis with online learning (cIOL). The cIOL can find and reject the noise-like components related to human body movements (i.e., movement artifacts) in the EEG signals. To obtain movement information, isolated electrodes are used to block electrical signals from the brain using high-resistance materials. We estimate artifacts with movement information using constrained independent component analysis from EEG signals and then extract artifact-free signals using online learning in each sample. In addition, the cIOL is evaluated by signal processing under 16 different experimental conditions (two types of EEG devices x two BCI paradigms x four different walking speeds). The experimental results show that the cIOL has the highest accuracy in both scalp- and ear-EEG, and has the highest signal-to-noise ratio in scalp-EEG among the state-of-the-art methods, except for the case of steady-state visual evoked potential at 2.0 m/s with superposition problem.

Measuring human locomotor control using EMG and EEG: Current knowledge, limitations and future considerations	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SPORT SCIENCE			English	Review						Electromyography; electroencephalography; brain; muscle; movement; locomotion	TIME-FREQUENCY SPACE; MOTOR CORTEX; TREADMILL WALKING; MUSCLE COORDINATION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; SURFACE EMG; MOVEMENTS; TASK; SIGNALS; DRIVE	Electrical signals encoding different forms of information can be observed at multiple levels of the human nervous system. Typically, these signals have been recorded in a rather isolated fashion with little overlap between the static recordings of electroencephalography (EEG) commonly used in neuroscience and the typical surface electromyography (EMG) recordings used in biomechanics. However, within the last decade, there has been an emerging need to link the electrical activation patterns of brain areas during movement to the behavior of the musculoskeletal system. This review discusses some of the most recent studies using the EEG and/or EMG to study the neural control of movement and human locomotion as well as studies quantifying the connectivity between brain and muscles. The focus is on rhythmic locomotor-type activities; however, results are discussed within the framework of initial work that has been done in upper and lower limbs during static and dynamic contractions. Limitations and current challenges as well as the possibility and functional interpretation of studying the connectivity between the cortex and skeletal muscles using a measure of coherence are discussed. The manuscript is geared toward scientists interested in the application of EEG in the field of locomotion, sports and exercise.

A Novel Experimental and Analytical Approach to the Multimodal Neural Decoding of Intent During Social Interaction in Freely-behaving Human Infants	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Behavior; Issue 104; Neuroscience; neural decoding; neural classification; neural signal processing; EEG; mobile brain imaging; behavior; developmental psychology; infant; imitation; brain; inertial measurement units	EEG	Understanding typical and atypical development remains one of the fundamental questions in developmental human neuroscience. Traditionally, experimental paradigms and analysis tools have been limited to constrained laboratory tasks and contexts due to technical limitations imposed by the available set of measuring and analysis techniques and the age of the subjects. These limitations severely limit the study of developmental neural dynamics and associated neural networks engaged in cognition, perception and action in infants performing "in action and in context". This protocol presents a novel approach to study infants and young children as they freely organize their own behavior, and its consequences in a complex, partly unpredictable and highly dynamic environment. The proposed methodology integrates synchronized high-density active scalp electroencephalography (EEG), inertial measurement units (IMUs), video recording and behavioral analysis to capture brain activity and movement non-invasively in freely-behaving infants. This setup allows for the study of neural network dynamics in the developing brain, in action and context, as these networks are recruited during goal-oriented, exploration and social interaction tasks.

Neurofeedback and networks of depression	DIALOGUES IN CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						emotion; frontal lobe; functional magnetic resonance imaging; limbic system; mood disorder; self-regulation	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; ASYMMETRY; TIME; CLASSIFICATION; VALIDATION; ACTIVATION; CHALLENGES; OUTCOMES; THERAPY; TRIALS	Recent advances in imaging technology and in the understanding of neural circuits relevant to emotion, motivation, and depression have boosted interest and experimental work in neuromodulation for affective disorders. Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be used to train patients in the self-regulation of these circuits, and thus complement existing neurofeedback technologies based on electroencephalography (EEG). EEG neurofeedback for depression has mainly been based on models of altered hemispheric asymmetry. fMRI-based neurofeedback (fMRI-NF) can utilize functional localizer scans that allow the dynamic adjustment of the target areas or networks for self-regulation training to individual patterns of emotion processing. An initial application of fMRI-NF in depression has produced promising clinical results, and further clinical trials are under way. Challenges lie in the design of appropriate control conditions for rigorous clinical trials, and in the transfer of neurofeedback protocols from the laboratory to mobile devices to enhance the sustainability of any clinical benefits.

We developed a methodology to interpret EEG signals at Fp1 of the frontal lobe during VFT in order to detect whether the EEG signal suggests dementia. We hypothesized that the difference in EEG patterns between (1) normal controls and (2) dementia patients with damaged semantic networks would show similar characteristics to the difference in EEG patterns between (1) normal controls performing "easy" VFT tasks and (2) normal controls performing "hard" VFT tasks. We then identified EEG indexes that represent the differences of VFT difficulty. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to verify the applicability of the identified EEG indexes. In our experiments, the pairs of EEG samples from 35 subjects were collected from both easy and hard VFT tasks, and our results showed a 65% diagnostic accuracy which is significantly higher than chance. Our research proposes that single-channel EEG measurement can complement VFT to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of dementia.

Here we tested the feasibility of such a mobile brain/body (MoBI) imaging approach by recording high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and body movements of subjects standing or walking on a treadmill while performing a visual oddball response task. Independent component analysis of the EEG data revealed visual event-related potentials that during standing, slow walking, and fast walking did not differ across movement conditions, demonstrating the viability of recording brain activity accompanying cognitive processes during whole body movement. Non-invasive and relatively low-cost MoBI studies of normal, motivated actions might improve understanding of interactions between brain and body dynamics leading to more complete biological models of cognition.

J	Narayanan, AM; Bertrand, A				Narayanan, Abhijith Mundanad; Bertrand, Alexander			Analysis of Miniaturization Effects and Channel Selection Strategies for EEG Sensor Networks With Application to Auditory Attention Detection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Electrodes; Decoding; Scalp; Correlation; Wireless sensor networks; Auditory attention detection; brain-computer interface; channel selection; EEG processing; EEG sensor networks	WIRELESS EEG; SPEECH; REGRESSION	Objective: Concealable, miniaturized electroencephalography (mini-EEG) recording devices are crucial enablers toward long-term ambulatory EEG monitoring. However, the resulting miniaturization limits the inter-electrode distance and the scalp area that can be covered by a single device. The concept of wireless EEG sensor networks (WESNs) attempts to overcome this limitation by placing a multitude of these mini-EEG devices at various scalp locations. We investigate whether optimizing the WESN topology can compensate for miniaturization effects in an auditory attention detection (AAD) paradigm. Methods: Starting from standard full-cap high-density EEG data, we emulate several candidate mini-EEG sensor nodes that locally collect EEG data with embedded electrodes separated by short distances. We propose a greedy group-utility based channel selection strategy to select a subset of these candidate nodes to form a WESN. We compare the AAD performance of this WESN with the performance obtained using long-distance EEG recordings. Results: The AAD performance using short-distance EEG measurements is comparable to using an equal number of long-distance EEG measurements if, in both cases, the optimal electrode positions are selected. A significant increase in performance was found when using nodes with three electrodes over nodes with two electrodes. Conclusion: When the nodes are optimally placed, WESNs do not significantly suffer from EEG miniaturization effects in the case of AAD. Significance: WESN-like platforms allow us to achieve similar AAD performance as with long-distance EEG recordings while adhering to the stringent miniaturization constraints for ambulatory EEG. Their applicability in an AAD task is important for the design of neuro-steered auditory prostheses.

Traditional monitoring of electrical activity in a diseased brain is limited to the clinical environment where patients being put away from natural environment in which provoking factors of abnormalities in the electrical activity of the brain are more likely to occur. Similarly, ambulatory EEG systems have a drawback of being cumbersome and impose some restrictions on the patient, such as not being able to show in public due to the social acceptability of wearing such a head-mounted device. The will of the patients to not publicizing their disorder or illnesses is a major drawback for current EEG system to be widely adopted. This paper presents an attempt to develop a wearable EEG prototype using off-the-shelf components to record EEG signal from the ear and display the obtained brain signals in the LabVIEW software. The developed prototype was able to record Ear -EEG in real-time. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded and a systematic EEG processing method was implemented to reduce artifacts. Source localization using independent component analysis and k-means clustering revealed the involvement of four clusters in the brain (Left and Right Occipital Lobe, Posterior Parietal Cortex (PPC), and Sensorimotor Area) during the walking tasks. We found that electrocortical amplitude modulations varied across different walking conditions. Specifically, our results showed that the modulations in the PPC shifted to higher frequency bands when the subjects walked in RA and SA conditions. Moreover, we found low. modulations in the sensorimotor area in LW walking and the modulations in this cluster shifted to lower frequency bands in RA and SA walking. These results are a promising step toward the development of a non-invasive Neural-machine Interface (NMI) for locomotion mode recognition.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the significance of AEEG for differentially diagnosing epilepsy and syncope, compared to EEG. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: Sixty patients with brief loss of consciousness, complicated by suspect or mild limb spasm, were selected from Suqian People's Hospital between January 2006 and June 2007. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty participants comprised 34 males and 26 females, aged 13-64 years. According to clinical symptoms prior to the study, 36 patients were initially diagnosed with epilepsy and 24 with syncope. METHODS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Abnormalities and epileptiform discharge were detected using EEG and AEEG, and the diagnostic value of the two methods for epilepsy and syncope was compared. RESULTS: A total of sixty patients were included in the final analysis. Abnormal AEEGs were observed in 37 cases (62%) and epileptiform discharge AEEGs in 23 cases (38%), both of which were significantly greater than EEGs [37% (22/60), 18% (11/60), respectively, P < 0.01, 0.05]. The detection rate of abnormal AEEG and epileptiform discharge in the epilepsy group [75% (27/36), 47% (17/36), respectively] was significantly greater than in the syncope group [42% (10/24), 25% (6/24), respectively, P < 0.01, 0.05]. CONCLUSION: AEEG can improve detection probability of epileptiform discharge and exhibits significant differences in the differential diagnosis of epilepsy and syncope.

This may be particularly problematic during everyday multitasking situations when cognitively demanding tasks are performed while walking. Due to previous limitations in neuroimaging technology, much remains unknown about the cortical mechanisms underlying resource allocation during locomotion. Here, we utilized an EEG-based mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) technique that integrates high-density event-related potential (ERP) recordings with simultaneously acquired foot-force sensor data to monitor gait patterns and brain activity concurrently. To assess effects of motor load on cognition we evaluated young (N = 17; mean age = 27.2) and older adults (N = 16; mean age = 63.9) and compared behavioral and ERP measures associated with performing a Go/No-Go response inhibition task as participants sat stationary or walked on a treadmill. Stride time and variability were also measured during task performance and compared to stride parameters obtained without task performance, thereby assessing effects of cognitive load on gait. Results showed that older, but not young adults' accuracy dropped significantly when performing the inhibitory task while walking. Young adults revealed ERP modulations at relatively early (N2 amplitude reduction) and later (earlier P3 latency) stages within the processing stream as motor load increased while walking. In contrast, older adults' ERP modulations were limited to later processing stages (increased P3 amplitude) of the inhibitory network. The relative delay and attenuation of ERP modulations accompanied by behavioral costs in older participants might indicate an age-associated loss in flexible resource allocation across multiple tasks. Better understanding of the neural underpinnings of these age-related changes may lead to improved strategies to reduce fall risk and enhance mobility in aging. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Morphological imaging yields complementary data, yet it cannot replace the essential functional analysis tool that is EEG. Furthermore, EEG has the great advantage of being non-invasive, easy to perform and allows repeat testing when follow-up is necessary, even at the patient's bedside. Faced with advances in knowledge, techniques and indications, the Societe de neurophysiologie clinique de longue francaise (SNCLF) and the Ligue francaise contre l'epilepsie (LFCE) found it necessary to provide an update on EEG recommendations. This article will review the methodology applied to this work, refine the various topics detailed in the following chapters. It will go over the summary of recommendations for each of these chapters and highlight proposals for writing an EEG report. Some questions could not be answered by review of the literature; in such cases, in addition to the guidelines the working and reading groups provided their expert opinion.

Devices for mobile monitoring can record these using sensors which capture specific biosignatures of these signs and classify them based thereon for seizure detection, seizure prediction and for a risk assessment. Presently the performance of wearables to detect seizures is best for motor seizures with tonic and clonic components; however, other seizure types are candidates for an objective seizure detection as well. The combination with ultralong electroencephalography (EEG) recordings widens the spectrum of seizure types to be captured and opens up a perspective for a qualitatively new era of treatment monitoring.

The development of flexible, long-term wearable, conductive nanomaterials with high fidelity can enable continuous and socially discrete ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG) since the sensing materials are the garment fibers themselves (i.e., 3rd generation intelligent clothing), not a rigid device. Here we introduce graphene-based electronic textiles (e-textile) sensors in series of proof of principle experiments to record brain waves, including alpha rhythms activity, merely from the forehead and achieved an impressive correlation of similar to 91% in benchmarking with commercial dry electrodes.

Analyses of behavioral measurements locomotion and sensorimotor gating - and the pharmacokinetics of ketamine and norketamine were also conducted. Methods: Ketamine and norketamine levels in rat sera and brains were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after ketamine 30 mg/kg (i.p.). Ketamine 9 and 30 mg/kg (i.p.) were used in the behavioral and EEG experiments. Locomotor effects in an open field test and deficits in prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle reaction (PPI ASR) were evaluated in the behavioral experiments. EEG signals were simultaneously recorded from 12 implanted active electrodes; subsequently, an EEG power spectral and coherence analysis was performed. Results: Ketamine had a rapid penetration into the brain; the peak concentrations of the drug were reached within 15 min after administration. Ketamine induced marked hyperlocomotion and deficits in the PPI ASR. EEG spectral analysis mainly showed increases in EEG power as well as coherence. These were most robust at 10-15 min after the administration and influenced all parts of the spectrum with ketamine 30 mg/kg. Conclusions: Ketamine at behaviorally active doses induces a robust increase in EEG power spectra and coherence. The maximum levels of change correlated with the kinetics of ketamine.

J	Gramann, K; Ferris, DP; Gwin, J; Makeig, S				Gramann, Klaus; Ferris, Daniel P.; Gwin, Joseph; Makeig, Scott			Imaging natural cognition in action	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						Mobile brain imaging; EEG; ICA; Natural cognition	NECK MUSCLE VIBRATION; VISUAL-MOTION; EEG; RESPONSES; MEMORY; ORIENTATION; MOVEMENTS; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS; ARTIFACT	The primary function of the human brain is arguably to optimize the results of our motor actions in an ever-changing environment. Our cognitive processes and supporting brain dynamics are inherently coupled both to our environment and to our physical structure and actions. To investigate human cognition in its most natural forms demands imaging of brain activity while participants perform naturally motivated actions and interactions within a full three-dimensional environment. Transient, distributed brain activity patterns supporting spontaneous motor actions, performed in pursuit of naturally motivated goals, may involve any or all parts of cortex and must be precisely timed at a speed faster than the speed of thought and action. Hemodynamic imaging methods give information about brain dynamics on a much slower scale, and established techniques for imaging brain dynamics in all modalities forbid participants from making natural extensive movements so as to avoid intractable movement-related artifacts. To overcome these limitations, we are developing mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) approaches to study natural human cognition. By synchronizing lightweight high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) recording with recordings of participant sensory experience, body and eye movements, and other physiological measures, we can apply advanced data analysis techniques to the recorded signal ensemble. This MoBI approach enables the study of human brain dynamics accompanying active human cognition in its most natural forms. Results from our studies have provided new insights into the brain dynamics supporting natural cognition and can extend theories of human cognition and its evolutionary function to optimize the results of our behavior to meet ever-changing goals, challenges, and opportunities.

Significant progress on this question has been made in the domain of spatial cognition, where a consistent network of brain regions that represent external space has been identified in both humans and rodents. In rodents, much of the work to date has been done in situations where the animal is free to move about naturally. By contrast, the majority of work carried out to date in humans is static, due to limitations imposed by traditional laboratory based imaging techniques. In recent years, significant progress has been made in bridging the gap between animal and human work by employing virtual reality (VR) technology to simulate aspects of real-world navigation. Despite this progress, the VR studies often fail to fully simulate important aspects of real-world navigation, where information derived from self-motion is integrated with representations of environmental features and task goals. In the current review article, we provide a brief overview of animal and human imaging work to date, focusing on commonalties and differences in findings across species. Following on from this we discuss VR studies of spatial cognition, outlining limitations and developments, before introducing mobile brain imaging techniques and describe technical challenges and solutions for real-world recording. Finally, we discuss how these advances in mobile brain imaging technology, provide an unprecedented opportunity to illuminate how the brain represents complex multifaceted information during naturalistic navigation.

An accelerometer was placed on the head of the subjects in order to record the shocks undergone by the EEG electrodes during walking. Our results indicate that up to 15 harmonics of the fundamental stepping frequency may pollute EEG signals, depending on the walking speed and also on the electrode location. This finding may call into question some conclusions drawn in previous EEG studies where low-delta band (especially around 1 Hz, the fundamental stepping frequency) had been announced as being the seat of angular and linear kinematics control of the lower limbs during walk. Additionally, our analysis reveals that EEG and accelerometer signals exhibit similar time-frequency properties, especially in frequency bands extending up to 150 Hz, suggesting that previous conclusions claiming the activation of high-gamma rhythms during walking may have been drawn on the basis of insufficiently cleaned EEG signals. Our results are put in perspective with recent EEG studies related to locomotion and extensively discussed in particular by focusing on the low-delta and high-gamma bands.

There have been mobile EEG units, for instance ambulatory electroencephalography (AEEG), a portable device designed for recording ictal events or interictal epileptiform discharge. However, these were never intended for motion related EEG recordings. Such techniques constrain motion related brain potential tests. A number of papers have considered this issue and as a result a new research area was established. This paper is a review on the different aspects of this problem, such as algorithms and hardware design, for the reduction of motion related EEG artifacts. Finally, this paper recommends several proper strategies on EEG artifact reduction.

A new method in imaging brain activity using the acoustoelectric (AE) allows for the combination of high temporal and spatial resolution imaging beyond existing techniques. AE imaging takes advantage of mechanoelectrical properties of ultrasound (US) pressure waves which modulate the tissue's electrical resistivity. Using surface and depth electrodes we record these modulated signals to electrically map local brain activity. In recent experiments we have been able to image evoked responses in the hippocampus of an anesthetized rat showing high temporal correlations between low frequency recordings and ABI. Further optimization of ABI can allow for better detection of evoked potentials in the brain to allow for faster real-time scanning possibilities with capabilities of miniaturizing a system for hand held imaging.

Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of Ambulatory Electroencephalography During Mild Traumatic Brain Injury	ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							EEG; CONCUSSION	Objectives: To characterize the neurophysiological changes in a patient with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and to compare these changes with a small cohort of patients with neurocardiogenic syncope, an analogous cause of transient neurological dysfunction. Design: Case report and quantitative analysis of a small electroencephalography (EEG) cohort. Setting: University-affiliated teaching hospital. Patients: A 64-year-old man with mTBI recorded on ambulatory EEG. The comparison group was 4 patients with spontaneous neurocardiogenic syncope during continuous video EEG recording. Intervention: Quantitative and qualitative analysis of EEG. Main Outcome Measures: Changes in quantitative EEG measurements between the patient with mTBI and the comparison group. Results: In the patient with mTBI, there was an abrupt decrease in high-frequency (beta) power and alpha-delta ratio immediately after the injury and a corresponding increase in lower-frequency (alpha, theta, delta) power. The change in beta power resolved within 5 minutes of the injury, but the increases in low-frequency power persisted up to 20 minutes after the injury before resolving. Similar but smaller changes were seen in the patients with syncope, but these changes resolved within 5 minutes, with no intermediate or long-term changes. Conclusions: The quantitative EEG changes in mTBI are initially similar to those in syncope, suggesting acute transient cortical dysfunction. However, there are longer-lasting increases in low-frequency power during mTBI, suggesting ongoing disruption of cortical-thalamic circuits.

Your Brain on Art: Emergent Cortical Dynamics During Aesthetic Experiences	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; machine learning; functional connectivity (FC); aesthetics; freely moving	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; DECISION-MAKING; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; APPRECIATION; POTENTIALS; NETWORKS; DELTA	The brain response to conceptual art was studied with mobile electroencephalography (EEG) to examine the neural basis of aesthetic experiences. In contrast to most studies of perceptual phenomena, participants were moving and thinking freely as they viewed the exhibit The Boundary of Life is Quietly Crossed by Dario Robleto at the Menil Collection-Houston. The brain activity of over 400 subjects was recorded using dry electrode and one reference gel based EEG systems over a period of 3 months. Here, we report initial findings based on the reference system. EEG segments corresponding to each art piece were grouped into one of three classes (complex, moderate, and baseline) based on analysis of a digital image of each piece. Time, frequency, and wavelet features extracted from EEG were used to classify patterns associated with viewing art, and ranked based on their relevance for classification. The maximum classification accuracy was 55% (chance = 33%) with delta and gamma features the most relevant for classification. Functional analysis revealed a significant increase in connection strength in localized brain networks while subjects viewed the most aesthetically pleasing art compared to viewing a blank wall. The direction of signal flow showed early recruitment of broad posterior areas followed by focal anterior activation. Significant differences in the strength of connections were also observed across age and gender. This work provides evidence that EEG, deployed on freely behaving subjects, can detect selective signal flow in neural networks, identify significant differences between subject groups, and report with greater-than-chance accuracy the complexity of a subject's visual percept of aesthetically pleasing art. Our approach, which allows acquisition of neural activity "in action and context," could lead to understanding of how the brain integrates sensory input and its ongoing internal state to produce the phenomenon which we term aesthetic experience.

For long-term recording of EEG signals, current research is heading towards simple, unobtrusive and ambulatory devices with a small number of channels. The primary contribution of this paper is to assess the performance difference between the seizure detection results using features from all channels versus only the channels in/around the temporal region. For this purpose, we develop a supervised seizure detection algorithm that uses time domain features extracted sequentially for every 1-second epoch. By using this algorithm, we obtained sensitivity values of 0.95 and 0.92, specificity values of 0.99 and 0.99 and false positive per hour values as 0.16 and 0.21 for all 23 channels and 10 temporal region channels, respectively. These results show that restricting the EEG analysis to temporal region results only in a graceful and gradual degradation of classifier performance. We conclude that EEG ambulatory devices with a montage local to the temporal region could demonstrate satisfactory performance. This presents a promising way forward for the use of ambulatory devices with compact wearable design.

Neural markers of proactive and reactive cognitive control are altered during walking: A Mobile Brain-Body Imaging (MoBI) study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Dual-task design; Attention; Event-related potential; ERP; EEG; Gait	DUAL-TASK INTERFERENCE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ATTENTIONAL CONTROL; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; MOTOR INTERFERENCE; GAIT VARIABILITY; CINGULATE CORTEX; CONTROL NETWORK; CHANGING PLANS; POTENTIAL ERP	The processing of sensory information and the generation of motor commands needed to produce coordinated actions can interfere with ongoing cognitive tasks. Even simple motor behaviors like walking can alter cognitive task performance. This cognitive-motor interference (CMI) could arise from disruption of planning in anticipation of carrying out the task (proactive control) and/or from disruption of the execution of the task (reactive control). In young healthy adults, walking-induced interference with behavioral performance may not be readily observable because flexibility in neural circuits can compensate for the added demands of simultaneous loads. In this study, cognitive-motor loads were systematically increased during cued task-switching while underlying neurophysiologic changes in proactive and reactive mechanisms were measured. Brain activity was recorded from 22 healthy young adults using 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) based Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) as they alternately sat or walked during performance of cued task-switching. Walking altered neurophysiological indices of both proactive and reactive control. Walking amplified cue-evoked late fontal slow waves, and reduced the amplitude of target-evoked fronto-central N2 and parietal P3. The effects of walking on evoked neural responses systematically increased as the task became increasingly difficult. This may provide an objective brain marker of increasing cognitive load, and may prove to be useful in identifying seemingly healthy individuals who are currently able to disguise ongoing degenerative processes through active compensation. If, however, degeneration continues unabated these people may reach a compensatory limit at which point both cognitive performance and control of coordinated actions may decline rapidly.

We report a state of acute confusion in a 15-year-old boy on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) receiving cefepime that was diagnosed as status epilepticus by electroencephalography (EEG). The EEG improved after anticonvulsive therapy. All clinical symptoms disappeared dramatically within 24 h of discontinuation of cefepime. The differential diagnosis of confusional states and the mechanisms of the convulsive effects of antimicrobials in chronic renal failure are discussed. The importance that the clinician is aware of the rare side effects of antimicrobials is emphasized.

J	Jungnickel, E; Gramann, K				Jungnickel, Evelyn; Gramann, Klaus			Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) of Physical Interaction with Dynamically Moving Objects	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mobile brain/body imaging; EEG; embodied cognition; independent component analysis; P300; oddball paradigm; MoBI	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EEG; SEPARATION; COGNITION	The non-invasive recording and analysis of human brain activity during active movements in natural working conditions is a central challenge in Neuroergonomics research. Existing brain imaging approaches do not allow for an investigation of brain dynamics during active behavior because their sensors cannot follow the movement of the signal source. However, movements that require the operator to react fast and to adapt to a dynamically changing environment occur frequently in working environments like assembly-line work, construction trade, health care, but also outside the working environment like in team sports. Overcoming the restrictions of existing imaging methods would allow for deeper insights into neurocognitive processes at workplaces that require physical interactions and thus could help to adapt work settings to the user. To investigate the brain dynamics accompanying rapid volatile movements we used a visual oddball paradigm where participants had to react to color changes either with a simple button press or by physically pointing towards a moving target. Using a mobile brain/body imaging approach (MoBI) including independent component analysis (ICA) with subsequent backprojection of cluster activity allowed for systematically describing the contribution of brain and non-brain sources to the sensor signal. The results demonstrate that visual event-related potentials (ERPs) can be analyzed for simple button presses and physical pointing responses and that it is possible to quantify the contribution of brain processes, muscle activity and eye movements to the signal recorded at the sensor level even for fast volatile arm movements with strong jerks. Using MoBI in naturalistic working environments can thus help to analyze brain dynamics in natural working conditions and help improving unhealthy or inefficient work settings.

Although changes in theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha frequency power (8-12 Hz) were shown to reflect attentional and sensorimotor processing during balance tasks, information about the effect of stance leg on cortical processing related to postural control is lacking. Therefore, the aim was to examine patterns of cortical activity during single-leg stance with varying surface stability. EEG and force plate data from 21 healthy males (22.43 +/- 2.23 years) was recorded during unipedal stance (left/right) on a stable and unstable surface. Using source-space analysis, power spectral density was analyzed in the theta, alpha-1 (8-10 Hz) and alpha-2 (10-12 Hz) frequency bands. Repeated measures ANOVA with the factors leg and surface stability revealed significant interaction effects in the left (p = 0.045, eta(2)(p) = 0.13) and right motor clusters (F = 16.156; p = 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.41). Furthermore, significant main effects for surface stability were observed for the fronto-central cluster (theta), left and right motor (alpha-1), as well as for the right parieto-occipital cluster (alpha-1/alpha-2). Leg dependent changes in alpha-2 power may indicate lateralized patterns of cortical processing in motor areas during single-leg stance. Future studies may therefore consider lateralized patterns of cortical activity for the interpretation of postural deficiencies in unilateral lower limb injuries.

The application of BCI ranges from assisting in disabilities to interaction in a virtual reality environment by detecting user intent from EEG signals. The major problem lies in correctly classifying the EEG signals to issue a command with minimal requirement of pre-processing and resources. To overcome these problems, we have proposed, BCINet, a novel optimized convolution neural network model. We have evaluated the BCINet over two EEG based BCI datasets collected in mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) settings. BCINet significantly outperforms the classification for two datasets with up to 20% increase in accuracy while fewer than 75% trainable parameters. Such a model with improved performance while less requirement of computation resources opens the possibilities for the development of several real-world BCI applications with high performance.

Data related to the target behaviour, as represented by EEG activity, were collected each week. Power mobility skills were assessed using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM), the Wheelchair Skills Checklist (WSC), and the Assessment of Learning Powered mobility use (ALP). Weekly power mobility training was provided during the intervention phases. EEG data were analyzed by means of three measurement metrics (power spectral density, mutual information, and transfer entropy).Results:All three participants demonstrated changes in activation in frontoparietal EEG recordings and clinically significant improvements in power mobility skill acquisition as measured by the COPM as well as by the ALP and WSC.Conclusions:Power mobility training appeared to affect both neuroplastic and skill acquisition. Combining the use of EEG with direct therapist-observation measurement tools may provide a more complete understanding of the impact of power mobility training on children with severe CP.

Ambulatory EEG: a cost-effective alternative to inpatient video-EEG in adult patients	EPILEPTIC DISORDERS			English	Article						ambulatory EEG; portable EEG; epilepsy; non-epileptic events; pseudoseizures; diagnostic yield; cost-of-illness	CHILDREN; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; EPILEPSY	Introduction. Ambulatory electroencephalography (AEEG) is a monitoring technique that allows the recording of continuous EEG activity when patients are at home, without the necessity of admission to the hospital for prolonged video-EEG monitoring. Methods. This is a prospective cohort study performed in a Canadian academic centre in order to assess the yield and tolerability of AEEG in the adult population. Over a period of three years, 101 patients were included. The yield of AEEG was assessed by taking into account the questions asked by the clinician before and after the investigation. Results. One hundred and one patients undergoing AEEG were prospectively recruited during a three-year-period. Our population consisted of 45 males (44.6%) and 56 females (55.4%). The mean age of the group was 36.6 +/- 16.1 years. Most of the patients had at least one previous routine EEG (93%). The primary reasons for the AEEGs were subdivided into four categories: a) to differentiate between seizures and non-epileptic events; b) to determine the frequency of seizures and epileptiform discharges; c) to characterize seizure type or localization; and d) to potentially diagnose epilepsy. The mean duration of AEEG recording was 32 +/- 17 hours (15-96 hours). For 73 (72%) patients, the AEEG provided information that was useful for the management. For 28 (28%) patients, the AEEG did not provide information on diagnosis because no events or epileptiform activity occurred. In only 1 patient was the AEEG inconclusive due to non-physiological artefacts. Three patients were referred for epilepsy surgery without the necessity of video-EEG telemetry. Conclusion. In this study, we found that AEEG has a high diagnostic yield (72%) and believe that careful selection of patients is the most important factor for a high diagnostic yield. The main use of AEEG is the characterization of patients with non-epileptic events, in patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy that is not clear, and quantification of spikes and seizures to improve the medical management. Ambulatory EEG is a cost-effective solution for increasing demands for in-hospital video-EEG monitoring of adult patients.

However, since the quality of the recordings is altered by muscular activity, most EEG recordings on animals are obtained using invasive methods with deeply implanted electrodes. This requires anesthesia and can thus only be used in laboratory or clinical settings. As EEG is a very useful tool both for detecting brain alterations due to diseases or accidents and to evaluate the arousal and attentional state of the animal, it seemed crucial to develop a tool that would make such recordings possible in the horse's home environment, with a freely moving horse. Such a tool should neither be invasive nor cause discomforts to the horse as the usual other practice which consists, after shaving the zone, in gluing the electrodes to the skin. To fulfill these requirements, we developed a novel EEG headset adapted to the horse's head that allows an easy and fast positioning of the electrodes and that can be used in the home environment on a freely moving horse. In this study, we show that this EEG headset allows to obtain reliable recordings, and we propose an original evaluation of an animal's "EEG profile" that allows comparisons between individuals and situations. This EEG headset opens new possibilities of investigation on horse cognition, and it can also become a useful tool for veterinarians to evaluate cerebral disorders or check the anesthesia level during a surgery.

Utilizing the remote images of an environment, transferred to the human operator, visual compressive feedback loop produces imagine errors in nonvector space, where images are considered as a set without image processing of feature extraction. Given an initial set and a goal set, visual evoked potentials are used to generate EEG motion commands to make the image set converge to the goal set. The online BMI, utilizing steady-state visually evoked potentials, analyzes the human EEG data in such a format that human intentions can be recognized by AdaBoostSVM classifier and motion commands produced for the teleoperated robot. Bezier curve is utilized to parameterize the motion commands and leader-follower formation control is proposed to guarantee a good reference trajectory tracking performance. Extensive experimental studies have been carried out to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

Video-ambulatory EEG in a secondary care center: A retrospective evaluation of utility in the diagnosis of epileptic and nonepileptic seizures	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Video-ambulatory electroencephalography; Diagnostic yield; Epilepsy; Seizures; Nonepileptic seizures	ATTACK DISORDER; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; REQUIREMENTS; TELEMETRY; ADULTS	The development and optimization of protocols using simultaneous video recording alongside long-term electroencephalography (EEG), such as ambulatory EEG (AEEG), expanded the range of available techniques for the investigation of paroxysmal clinical events. In particular, video-AEEG has received increasing attention over the last few years because of its potential to further improve diagnostic utility in the differential diagnosis between epileptic and nonepileptic seizures. We retrospectively evaluated 88 video-AEEG studies in order to assess the diagnostic utility of video-AEEG in 87 patients consecutively referred to a neurophysiology department. Typical clinical events occurred during 55 studies (62.5%). In 26 of these, at least one event was also clearly seen on video recording, contributing to a confident diagnosis. Clinical events were classified according to three diagnostic categories: epileptic seizures (6 studies, 6.8%), physiologic nonepileptic events (13 studies, 14.8%), or psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (36 studies, 40.9%). Of the studies with an event not recorded on video, a confident diagnosis could be reached in 55.2% of cases. The main reason for unsuccessful video recording was failure to activate the camcorder by the patient or carer. We found an overall diagnostic utility of 67.0%, which confirms the findings of previous reports evaluating the diagnostic yield of AEEG. Implementation of videoAEEG protocols in a secondary care center appears to have high diagnostic utility, particularly for patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures. Our findings prompt further research into the potential applications of video-AEEG, in consideration of important implications for successful patient management and healthcare resource allocation.

With the advent of digital EEG, more advanced applications of EEG have emerged. Compared with technologically advanced practice in focal epilepsies, the utilization of EEG in idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) has been lagging, often restricted to a simple diagnostic tool. In this narrative review, we provide an overview of broader applications of EEG beyond this narrow scope, discussing how the current clinical and research applications of EEG may potentially be extended to IGE. The current literature, although limited, suggests that EEG can be used in syndromic classification, guiding antiseizure medication therapy, predicting prognosis, unraveling biorhythms, and investigating functional brain connectivity of IGE. We emphasize the need for longer recordings, particularly 24-h ambulatory EEG, to capture discharges reflecting circadian and sleep-wake cycle-associated variations for wider EEG applications in IGE. Finally, we highlight the challenges and limitations of the current body of literature and suggest future directions to encourage and enhance more extensive applications of this potent tool.

Irrespective of the experimental setting, EEG recordings are contaminated with noise that has to be removed before the data can be functionally interpreted. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a commonly used tool to remove artifacts such as eye movement, muscle activity, and external noise from the data and to analyze activity on the level of EEG effective brain sources. The effectiveness of filtering the data is one key preprocessing step to improve the decomposition that has been investigated previously. However, no study thus far compared the different requirements of mobile and stationary experiments regarding the preprocessing for ICA decomposition. We thus evaluated how movement in EEG experiments, the number of channels, and the high-pass filter cutoff during preprocessing influence the ICA decomposition. We found that for commonly used settings (stationary experiment, 64 channels, 0.5 Hz filter), the ICA results are acceptable. However, high-pass filters of up to 2 Hz cut-off frequency should be used in mobile experiments, and more channels require a higher filter to reach an optimal decomposition. Fewer brain ICs were found in mobile experiments, but cleaning the data with ICA has been proved to be important and functional even with low-density channel setups. Based on the results, we provide guidelines for different experimental settings that improve the ICA decomposition.

Visual analysis is rater-dependent and time consuming, especially for long-term recordings, such as in sleep studies or in ambulatory EEG. Computerized methods can improve efficiency in reviewing long EEG recordings. The proposed method applies coarse to detailed modeling of the spike waveform and classifies the transients based on Locality Preserving Projections (LPP) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The method achieves high sensitivity with low false positive rate in a intra-patient cross-validated setting and thus constitutes a valuable tool for automatic spike assessment.	[Zacharaki, E.

The EEG, with its excellent temporal resolution, provides.a direct measurement of cortical electrophysiology, revealing, for example, the presence of interictal epileptiform discharges that identify regions of an epileptogenic brain. We define the EEG characteristics of focal and generalized epileptiform discharges and provide evidence for their varying diagnostic importance in different patient populations. Identification of nonepileptiform EEG transients, such as wicket waves, small sharp spikes, rhythmic temporal theta activity, and 14- and 6-Hz positive bursts, that can be-confused for epileptiform transients is emphasized. A final point is that the clinician must interpret EEG findings within the overall clinical context.

Under-sampling in epilepsy: Limitations of conventional EEG	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY PRACTICE			English	Review						Interictal epileptiform activity; Chronic EEG; Chronobiology; Circadian; Multidien	INTERICTAL EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; PROGNOSTIC-SIGNIFICANCE; SEIZURE OCCURRENCE; AMBULATORY EEG; SPIKES; STIMULATION; POTENTIALS; PATTERNS; SPIKING; RHYTHM	The cyclical structure of epilepsy was recently (re)-discovered through years-long intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) obtained with implanted devices. In this review, we discuss how new revelations from chronic EEG relate to the practice and interpretation of conventional EEG. We argue for an electrographic definition of seizures and highlight the caveats of counting epileptiform discharges in EEG recordings of short duration. Limitations of conventional EEG have practical implications with regard to titrating anti-seizure medications and allowing patients to drive, and we propose that chronic monitoring of brain activity could greatly improve epilepsy care. An impending paradigm shift in epilepsy will involve using next-generation devices for chronic EEG to leverage known biomarkers of disease state.

Real-Time Human Body and Brain Monitoring During Horseback Riding Simulator by Means of Inertial Motion Capture and EEG Systems	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Sensors; Medical treatment; Legged locomotion; Actuators; Back; Velocity measurement; Electroencephalography (EEG); horse simulator; horseback riding therapy; motion capture system	CEREBRAL-PALSY; CHILDREN; EXERCISE; THERAPY	One type of effective muscular disorders therapy is horseback riding. The main objective of the present study is developing a physiotherapeutic simulator (concept proof) instead of a real horse though employing the Electroencephalography (EEG) amplifier and inertial motion capture system (IMCS). In the experiment, the professional and non-professional rider's body movements and brain-behaviors monitored during the horseback riding simulator. The computational analysis for identifying the alterations of the pelvic area activity among two group riders were considered based on the IMCS. The EEG system was used for investigating the brain signals of the experienced horseback rider who had never experienced using horse simulator. For this purpose, the following experiments were handled, representing body and brain-behavior. As a result, it was concluded, that inexperienced horseback riders tend to make movement mistakes while riding a simulator, which may cause asymmetry shift in external hip and back regions. The study of EEG shows that the frontal lobes, which are responsible for intelligence and concentration were activated. Also, the temporal and the parietal areas of the brain which are responsible for movements and vision were activated significantly, respectively.

The cognitive processes underlying dual tasking have been investigated extensively using EEG. Due to technological restrictions, however, this was not possible for dual-task scenarios including locomotion. With new technological opportunities, this became possible and cognitive-motor interference can be studied, even in outside-the-lab environments. In the present study, participants carried out a cognitive-motor interference task as they responded to cued, auditory task-switch stimuli while performing locomotive tasks with increasing complexity (standing, walking, traversing an obstacle course). We observed increased subjective workload ratings as well as decreased behavioural performance for increased movement complexity and cognitive task difficulty. A higher movement load went along with a decrease of parietal P2, N2 and P3 amplitudes and frontal Theta power. A higher cognitive load, on the other hand, was reflected by decreased frontal CNV amplitudes. Additionally, a connectivity analysis using inter-site phase coherence revealed that higher movement as well as cognitive task difficulty had an impairing effect on fronto-parietal connectivity. In conclusion, subjective ratings, behavioural performance and electrophysiological results indicate that less cognitive resources were available to be deployed towards the execution of the cognitive task when in locomotion compared to standing still. Connectivity results also show a scarcity of attentional resources when switching a task during the highest movement complexity condition. Summarized, all findings indicate a central role of attentional control regarding cognitive-motor dual tasking and an inherent limitation of cognitive resources.

We hypothesized that cortical dynamics involved in top-down regulation of postural responses carry information about directional postural changes (i.e., sway) imposed by sudden perturbations to standing balance (i.e., support surface translations). To test our hypothesis, we evaluated the single-trial classification of perturbation-induced directional changes in postural stability from high-density EEG. We analyzed EEG recordings from six young able-bodied individuals and three older individuals with chronic hemiparetic stroke, which were acquired while individuals reacted to low-intensity balance perturbations. Using common spatial patterns for feature extraction and linear discriminant analysis or support vector machines for classification, we achieved classification accuracies above random level (p < 0.05; cross-validated) for the classification of four different sway directions (one vs. the rest scheme). Screening of spectral features (3-50 Hz) revealed that the highest classification performance occurred when low-frequency (3-10 Hz) spectral features were used. Strikingly, the participant-specific classification results were qualitatively similar between young able-bodied individuals and older individuals with chronic hemiparetic stroke. Our findings demonstrate that low-frequency spectral components, corresponding to the cortical theta rhythm, carry direction-specific information about changes in postural stability. Our work presents a new perspective on the cortical representation of postural stability and the possible role of the theta rhythm in the modulation of (directional) reactive balance responses. Importantly, our work provides preliminary evidence that the cortical encoding of direction-specific changes in postural stability is present in chronic hemiparetic stroke.

The analysis presented here will aid the designer of a wireless EEG headset in improving the ratio of battery lifetime to battery size, with the aim of minimising the size and weight of the device. Data compression is proposed as a method to reduce the power used by the wireless transceiver, shown to dominate the system power budget. Graphs are presented which show the power available to perform varying degrees of compression in order to achieve the required lifetime or battery volume.

The form or shape of the built environment is fundamental to architectural design, but not many studies have shown the impact of different forms on the inhabitants' emotions. This study investigated the neurophysiological correlates of different interior forms on the perceivers' affective state and the accompanying brain activity. To understand the impact of naturalistic three- dimensional (3D) architectural forms, it is essential to perceive forms from different perspectives. We computed clusters of form features extracted from pictures of residential interiors and constructed exemplary 3D room models based on and representing different formal clusters. To investigate human brain activity during 3D perception of architectural spaces, we used a mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) approach recording the electroencephalogram (EEG) of participants while they naturally walk through different interior forms in virtual reality (VR). The results revealed a strong impact of curvature geometries on activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Theta band activity in ACC correlated with specific feature types (rs (14) = 0.525, p = 0.037) and geometry (rs (14) = 0.579, p = 0.019), providing evidence for a role of this structure in processing architectural features beyond their emotional impact. The posterior cingulate cortex and the occipital lobe were involved in the perception of different room perspectives during the stroll through the rooms. This study sheds new light on the use of mobile EEG and VR in architectural studies and provides the opportunity to study human brain dynamics in participants that actively explore and realistically experience architectural spaces.

Associations between daily affect and sleep vary by sleep assessment type: What can ambulatory EEG add to the picture?	SLEEP HEALTH			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Positive affect; Negative affect; Actigraphy; Sleep diary; Longitudinal	SUBJECTIVE SLEEP; NIGHTTIME SLEEP; DAYTIME AFFECT; MOOD; WELL; DISTURBANCES; EXPERIENCES; ACTIGRAPHY; INTERPLAY; INSOMNIA	Objective/Background: Disrupted sleep can be a cause and a consequence of affective experiences. However, daily longitudinal studies show sleep assessed via sleep diaries is more consistently associated with positive and negative affect than sleep assessed via actigraphy. The objective of the study was to test whether sleep parameters derived from ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG) in a naturalistic setting were associated with day-to-day changes in affect. Participants/Method: Eighty adults (mean age = 32.65 years, 63% female) completed 7 days of affect and sleep assessments. We examined bidirectional associations between morning positive affect and negative affect with sleep assessed via diary, actigraphy, and ambulatory EEG. Results: Mornings with lower positive affect than average were associated with higher diary- and actigraphy-determined sleep efficiency that night. Mornings with higher negative affect than average were associated with longer actigraphy-determined total sleep time that night. Nights with longer diary-determined total sleep time, greater sleep efficiency, and shorter sleep onset latency than average were associated with higher next-morning positive affect, and nights with lower diary-determined wake-after-sleep-onset were associated with lower next-morning negative affect. EEG-determined sleep and affect results were generally null in both directions: only higher morning negative affect was associated with longer rapid eye movement (REM) sleep that night. Conclusions: Self-reported sleep and affect may occur in a bidirectional fashion for some sleep parameters. EEG-determined sleep and affect associations were inconsistent but may still be important to assess in future studies to holistically capture sleep. Single-channel EEG represents a novel, ecologically valid tool that may provide information beyond diaries and actigraphy. (C) 2020 National Sleep Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The applicability of ambulatory electroencephalography (AEEG) in healthy horses and horses with abnormal behaviour or clinical signs of epilepsy	VETERINARY QUARTERLY			English	Article						equine; horse; neurophysiology; electroencephalography; EEG; epilepsy; seizures	EEG PATTERNS; ENCEPHALOPATHY	Background: Short-duration electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in horses are helpful in diagnosing intracranial disorders. Potentially, long-duration ambulatory EEG (AEEG) recordings in horses will enhance the chance of detecting abnormal brain activity independent of the presence of an insult.Objective: The objective of this study was to test if AEEG recordings in unsedated horses can be acquired and benefit diagnosing abnormal brain activity.Animals and methods: Recordings were taken from 8 adult control horses and 10 patients suspected of intracranial abnormalities. Self-adhesive electrodes and the Porti-5' recording system were used. Filter settings were 0.5Hz high pass and 35Hz low pass. The records were analysed offline at a 50-200V/division and 10 seconds/division scale. Abnormal activity was defined as a spike or sharp wave, a period of generalised slow wave rhythmical activity or a generalised fast rhythmical discharge. The recording time ranged from 5 to 49hours.Results: In the control group, one horse showed pathological activity. In the patient group, six out of nine horses showed abnormal activity during the recordings. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of an intracranial mass in one patient. Long-term recordings of high quality can be obtained in unsedated horses by allowing daily activity using AEEG, resulting in a reasonable chance of recording (inter)ictal abnormal brain activity indicating epileptic or seizure-like activity in the absence of clinical signs or seizures.Conclusions: It is concluded that abnormal behaviour can be expressed intermittently, and with the availability of AEEG a useful tool is added to the diagnostic scenario for horses.

Avila			Mobile robot navigation with a self-paced brain-computer interface based on high-frequency SSVEP	ROBOTICA			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Electroencephalography; Man-machine system; Mobile robot; Steady-state visual evoked potentials	VISUAL-EVOKED POTENTIALS; ACTUATED WHEELCHAIR; OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE; STABLE CONTROL; HUMAN EEG; BCI; PEOPLE	A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system for commanding a device by means of brain signals without having to move any muscle. One kind of BCI is based on Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP), which are evoked visual cortex responses elicited by a twinkling light source. Stimuli can produce visual fatigue; however, it has been well established that high-frequency SSVEP (>30 Hz) does not. In this paper, a mobile robot is remotely navigated into an office environment by means of an asynchronous high-frequency SSVEP-based BCI along with the image of a video camera. This BCI uses only three electroencephalographic channels and a simple processing signal method. The robot velocity control and the avoidance obstacle algorithms are also herein described. Seven volunteers were able to drive the mobile robot towards two different places. They had to evade desks and shelves, pass through a doorway and navigate in a corridor. The system was designed so as to allow the subject to move about without restrictions, since he/she had full robot movement's control. It was concluded that the developed system allows for remote mobile robot navigation in real indoor environments using brain signals. The proposed system is easy to use and does not require any special training. The user's visual fatigue is reduced because high-frequency stimulation is employed and, furthermore, the user gazes at the stimulus only when a command must be sent to the robot.

We combined experimental electroencephalography (EEG) analysis of 18 subjects and neural mass modeling approaches to investigate functional neural connectivity during walking on uneven terrain. Both approaches revealed a pattern of connectivity involving the anterior cingulate and posterior parietal cortices at alpha frequencies. Further, the modeling identified that the timing of recovered connectivity can be affected by the complexity of inter-node connections. Understanding these cortical connections could lead to new insights into brain function during normal human behaviors.	[Snyder, K. L.; Ferris, D.

Interacting with these devices, however, requires users to use their hands to touch the screen of the device which deprives users with hand disabilities from using them. In this paper, we introduce a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system that allows users to interact with smart mobile devices using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Two applications are introduced for Android-based devices: RunApp and ImgView. RunApp enables users to select and run any installed application on the device while ImgView allows viewing and manipulating images. Both applications rely on the P300 signal paradigm. We utilize a computationally-efficient Principal Component Analysis (PCA) ensemble classifier to identify P300 signals. Results demonstrate the efficacy of the introduced applications using limited training data and limited number of trials with an average online accuracy of 79.17 +/- 13.69% for RunApp and 87.5 +/- 8.74% for ImgView for 6 different subjects. In addition, we demonstrate the cross-subject generalization capability of the algorithm where we got average online accuracy of 54.17 +/- 20.2.4% for RunApp and 55.56 +/- 11.38% for ImgView. These results demonstrate the feasibility of running BCI applications on smart mobile devices.

This exploratory study aims to detect brain signals during walking and determine the effect of exoskeleton-walking robot (EWR) assistance on brain activity using mobile brain imaging techniques (scalp EEG). Acquiring such knowledge in SCI is critical to the development of effective rehabilitation interventions aimed at maximizing gait function recovery. EEG data were collected from 1 able-bodied (AB) and 1 iSCI participant during walking and with and without EWR assistance (using both "Max Assist" and "Free Limb" settings). Results showed our ability to record EEG data and to measure cortico-muscular coherence correlating with walking task and to identify differences in cortical connectivity during different types of EWR assistance.

The clinical utility of ambulatory EEG in childhood	SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Child; Ambulatory EEG; Epilepsy; Encephalopathy with status epilepticus during sleep; Clinical utility	VIDEO; CHILDREN; DIAGNOSIS; EPILEPSY; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; RECORDINGS; AUDIT	Purpose: To evaluate the clinical utility of the ambulatory electroencephalogram (AEEG) in children. Method: Data from 199 consecutive referrals for a paediatric AEEG were reviewed retrospectively. Information was gathered on various aspects of the referral process, the characteristics of the children referred and the reasons for referral. Clinical utility was calculated as the percentage of cases in which the investigation provided useful information with respect to the question asked of the test. Results: The AEEG was useful in 64.8% cases overall. In 51.4% of cases the reason for referral was to capture events, however the test was only useful in 42.6% of these. The most common reason for an unsuccessful investigation was failure to capture events (55.6%). Suspected encephalopathy with status epilepticus during sleep (ESES) was the indication in a substantial number of cases (38.6%), and the investigation was useful in most of these (97.5%). Technical issues were only responsible for 7 (9.7%) of unsuccessful studies. Conclusion: The paediatric AEEG was useful in two thirds of patients. Failure to capture events appears to be the most significant limiting factor. The AEEG is very useful in investigating suspected ESES.

The development of continuous EEG monitoring (CEEGM) in the past decades has allowed a better diagnosis of epileptic patients of all ages. In this paper we review the data available in the literature about the efficacy of the different modalities of CEEGM in the diagnosis of pediatric epilepsy, emphasizing our personal experience. In our studies the ambulatory CEEGM supplemented with video allowed to answer the question that prompted its request in 80% of patients diagnosed with epilepsy and in 83% of those with the suspected diagnosis of epilepsy. With ambulatory computer-assisted CEEGM those figures were 88% and 89%. respectively. and with inpatient video-CEEGM they were 82% and 51%, respectively. The latter is crucial in the evaluation of epilepsy patients who are candidates for surgical treatment. Inpatient video-CEEGM is also very important in the management of patients with acute encephalopathies admitted to the Intensive Care Units. Both, ambulatory or inpatient CEEGM, are very useful in the differential diagnosis of clinical epileptic versus non-epileptic events, as well as in the confirmation of the type of epilepsy or epileptic syndrome. The development of technological advances and new EEG modalities in the future will help to continue to consider electroencephalography as a very important technique in the study of brain function in patients with acute or chronic encephalopathies.

Conversely, in people, objective data from electroencephalography (EEG) are mainly used to diagnose epilepsy, measure seizure frequency and evaluate efficacy of antiseizure drugs. These EEG data minimize the possibility of the underreporting of seizures, a known phenomenon in human epileptology. Objective To evaluate the correlation between reported seizure frequency and EEG frequency of ictal paroxysmal discharges (PDs) and to determine whether seizure underreporting phenomenon exists in veterinary epileptology. Animals Thirty-three ambulatory video-EEG recordings in dogs showing >= 1 ictal PD, excluding dogs with status epilepticus. Methods Retrospective observational study. Ictal PDs were counted manually over the entire recording to obtain the frequency of EEG seizures. Caregiver-reported seizure frequency from the medical record was categorized into weekly, daily, hourly, and per minute seizure groupings. The Spearman rank test was used for correlation analysis. Results The coefficient value (r(s)) comparing reported seizure to EEG-confirmed ictal PD frequencies was 0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.048-0.64, P = .03). Other r(s) values comparing history against various seizure types were: 0.36 for motor seizures and 0.37 for nonmotor (absence) seizures. Conclusions and Clinical Importance A weak correlation was found between the frequency of reported seizures from caregivers (subjective data) and ictal PDs on EEG (objective data). Subjective data may not be reliable enough to determine true seizure frequency given the discrepancy with EEG-confirmed seizure frequency. Confirmation of the seizure underreporting phenomenon in dogs by prospective study should be carried out.

We constructed a novel dual-layer EEG electrode system to isolate electrocortical signals, and then validated the system using an electrical head phantom and robotic motion platform. We collected data from young healthy subjects walking and running on a treadmill while they encountered unexpected obstacles to step over. Supplementary motor area and premotor cortex had spectral power increases within similar to 200 ms after object appearance in delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands (3-13 Hz). That activity was followed by similar posterior parietal cortex spectral power increase that decreased in lag time with increasing locomotion speed. The sequence of activation suggests that supplementary motor area and premotor cortex interrupted the gait cycle, while posterior parietal cortex tracked obstacle location for planning foot placement nearly two steps ahead of reaching the obstacle. Together, these results highlight advantages of adopting dual-layer mobile EEG, which should greatly facilitate the study of human brain dynamics in physically active real-world settings and tasks.

The entire multi-channel recording, quantization, and motion artifact removal circuitries are implemented on a 4-layer polyimide flexible substrate. The recording electrodes and active shielding are also integrated on the same substrate, yielding the smallest form factor compared to the state of the art. Thanks to the dry non-contact electrodes, the system is quickly mountable with minimal assistance required, making it an ideal ambulatory front- and temporal-lobe EEG monitoring device. The flexible main board is connected to a rechargeable battery on one end and to a 13 x 17 mm(2) rigid board on the other end. The mini rigid board hosts a low-power programmable FPGA and a BLE 5.0 transceiver, which add diagnostic capability and wireless connectivity features to the device, respectively. Design considerations for a wearable EEG monitoring and diagnostic device are discussed in details. The theory of the novel fully-analog method for motion artifact detection and removal is described and the detailed circuit implementation is presented. The device performance in terms of voltage gain (260 V/V), bandwidth (DC-300 Hz), motion artifact removal, and wireless communication throughput (up to 1 Mbps) is experimentally validated. The entire wearable solution with the battery weighs 9.2 grams.

Ambulatory EEG has superior sampling compared with standard EEG recordings and advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness and convenience compared with a prolonged inpatient EEG study. Ambulatory EEG allows for EEG recording in all sleep stages and transitional states, which can be very helpful in capturing interictal epileptiform discharges. In the absence of interictal epileptiform discharges or in patients with atypical events, the characterization of an epilepsy syndrome may require recording of the habitual events. Diagnostic ambulatory EEG can be a useful alternative to inpatient video-EEG monitoring in a selected number of patients with frequent events who do not require medication taper or seizure testing for surgical localization.

In this paper, we present the results of an investigation into appropriate features for artefact detection in the REACT ambulatory EEG system. The study focuses on EEG artefacts arising from head movement. The use of one generalised movement artefact class to detect movement artefacts is proposed. Temporal, frequency, and entropy-based features are evaluated using Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Wilcoxon rank-sum non-parametric tests, Mutual Information Evaluation Function and Linear Discriminant Analysis. Results indicate good separation between normal EEG and artefacts arising from head movement, providing a strong argument for treating these head movement artefacts as one generalised class rather than treating their component signals individually.

Such predictive mechanisms originate from the motor system and allow for inferring actions from environmental affordances, and the potential to act within a specific environment. Using architecture, we provide a unique perspective on the ongoing debate in cognitive neuroscience and philosophy on whether cognition depends on movement or is decoupled from our physical structure. To investigate cognitive processes associated with architectural affordances, we used a mobile brain/body imaging approach recording brain activity synchronized to head-mounted displays. Participants perceived and acted on virtual transitions ranging from nonpassable to easily passable. We found that early sensory brain activity, on revealing the environment and before actual movement, differed as a function of affordances. In addition, movement through transitions was preceded by a motor-related negative component that also depended on affordances. Our results suggest that potential actions afforded by an environment influence perception.

Lateralization of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with chronic ambulatory electrocorticography	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						EEG monitoring; Electrocorticography; Ambulatory EEG; Intracranial EEG; Responsive stimulation; Localization	SEIZURES; STIMULATION; WITHDRAWAL; RECURRENCE; SURGERY; ADULTS; BRAIN	ObjectivePatients with suspected mesial temporal lobe (MTL) epilepsy typically undergo inpatient video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring with scalp and/or intracranial electrodes for 1 to 2weeks to localize and lateralize the seizure focus or foci. Chronic ambulatory electrocorticography (ECoG) in patients with MTL epilepsy may provide additional information about seizure lateralization. This analysis describes data obtained from chronic ambulatory ECoG in patients with suspected bilateral MTL epilepsy in order to assess the time required to determine the seizure lateralization and whether this information could influence treatment decisions. MethodsAmbulatory ECoG was reviewed in patients with suspected bilateral MTL epilepsy who were among a larger cohort with intractable epilepsy participating in a randomized controlled trial of responsive neurostimulation. Subjects were implanted with bilateral MTL leads and a cranially implanted neurostimulator programmed to detect abnormal interictal and ictal ECoG activity. ECoG data stored by the neurostimulator were reviewed to determine the lateralization of electrographic seizures and the interval of time until independent bilateral MTL electrographic seizures were recorded. ResultsEighty-two subjects were implanted with bilateral MTL leads and followed for 4.7years on average (median 4.9years). Independent bilateral MTL electrographic seizures were recorded in 84%. The average time to record bilateral electrographic seizures in the ambulatory setting was 41.6days (median 13days, range 0-376days). Sixteen percent had only unilateral electrographic seizures after an average of 4.6years of recording. SignificanceAbout one third of the subjects implanted with bilateral MTL electrodes required >1month of chronic ambulatory ECoG before the first contralateral MTL electrographic seizure was recorded. Some patients with suspected bilateral MTL seizures had only unilateral electrographic seizures. Chronic ambulatory ECoG in patients with suspected bilateral MTL seizures provides data in a naturalistic setting, may complement data from inpatient video-EEG monitoring, and can contribute to treatment decisions.

Indications and yield of ambulatory EEC recordings	EPILEPTIC DISORDERS			English	Article						ambulatory electroencephalogram; prolonged electroencephalogram; seizures; epilepsy; diagnostic yield; interictal epileptiform discharges	VIDEO-EEG; ROUTINE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; ABNORMALITIES; DISCHARGES; EPILEPSY; UTILITY	Objective. To study the yield of prolonged ambulatory electroencephalogram (aEEG). Methods. A retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent aEEG studies between 2013 and 2017 was performed. Reasons for aEEG were classified into five categories: detection of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), capturing clinical events, detection of unrecognized seizures, monitoring IEDs during treatment, and unclassifiable. Ambulatory EEG reports were reviewed to evaluate whether the study answered the clinical question. Results. A total of 1,264 patients were included. Forty studies were excluded for incomplete data and 234 for being a repeat study. The average number of recording days was 1.57 +/- 0.73. Based on initial clinical evaluation, patients carried the following presumptive diagnosis: 61% epilepsy, 11% single unprovoked or acute symptomatic seizure and 28% non-epileptic paroxysmal events (PEs). Overall, focal IEDs were seen in 16.1% of studies, generalized IEDs in 10.8%, focal seizures in 4.1%, and generalized seizures in 1.9%. The most frequent reason for ordering aEEG was to detect IEDs for diagnostic purposes (48.1%). For this indication, additional information was provided by the aEEG in 19.1% of cases (58.6% focal IEDs, 33.5% generalized IEDs, 7.9% seizures without IEDs). Ambulatory EEG was ordered with the intent to capture and characterize clinical events in 18.9%, mostly in patients who reported daily or weekly events. In these, aEEG captured either epileptic seizures or PEs in 102 (42.7%) of the studies (83.3% PEs, 16.7% epileptic seizures). Ambulatory EEG was ordered to evaluate unrecognized seizures in 17.8% of patients, and electrographic seizures were identified in 13.3% of these studies. Significance. The yield of aEEG varies based on the indication for the study. Ambulatory EEG can be a useful tool for recording IEDs in the outpatient setting and in a select group of patients to capture clinical events or unrecognized seizures.

J	Katona, J; Kovari, A				Katona, J.; Kovari, A.			EEG-based Computer Control Interface for Brain-Machine Interaction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONLINE ENGINEERING			English	Article							NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY	Recently more and more research methods are available to observe brain activity; for instance, Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS), Electroencephalograph (EEG) or Magnetoencephalography (MEG), which provide new research opportunities for several applications. For example, control methods based on the evaluation of measurable signals of human brain activity. In the past few years, more mobile EEG (electroencephalogram) based brain activity biosensor and signal processing devices have become available not only for medical examinations, but also to be used in different scopes; for instance, in control applications. These methods provide completely new possibilities in human-machine interactions by digital signal processing of brain signals. In this study, the program model, the establishment, the implementation and the test results of the quantitative EEG-based computer control interface, protocol and digital signal processing application are demonstrated. The user-friendly visualization of the evaluated brain wave signals is implemented in visual C# object-oriented language. This EEG-based control unit and interface provides an adequate basis for further research in different fields of brain-machine control methods regarding the examination of possible machine control applications.

It is characterized by abnormal neuronal signaling and can cause strange sensations, emotions, behavior, loss of consciousness, muscle spasms, and convulsions. These episodes are very difficult to predict with the current technologies available, and almost impossible to accurately record outside clinical settings. This project aims to create an ambulatory device that can continuously measure long-term electroencephalography (EEG) outside of a hospital. The Epileptic Monitoring Device (EMD) is a portable device with two separate units: a head-mounted EEG recording system and a data viewing application on an Android platform. The EEG is recorded using five electrodes in referential montage attached to a headset and passes the signal through an isolation amplifier and then into a microprocessor for analog-to-digital conversion. The digital signal is sent via Bluetooth transceiver to the mobile device where it is processed and viewed using the Android application. An alarm will be triggered when the application detects seizure-like activity. The EMD will provide accurate monitoring for epileptic patients within the comfort of day-to-day activities. Caretakers and medical professionals can use this data to determine types of seizures, number of seizures, and the efficacy of medication.

In the clinical practice, EEG features are considered to be related to the risk of seizure recurrence for genetic generalized epilepsies (GGE). However, to our knowledge, there are no studies analyzing systematically specific EEG features as indices of ASM efficacy in GGE. In this study, we aimed at identifying EEG indicators of ASM responsiveness in Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME), which, among GGE, is characterized by specific electroclinical features. Methods We compared the features of prolonged ambulatory EEG (paEEG, 22 h of recording) of JME patients experiencing seizure recurrence within a year ("cases") after EEG recording, with those of patients with sustained seizure freedom for at least 1 year after EEG ("controls"). We included only EEG recordings of patients who had maintained the same ASM regimen (dosage and type) throughout the whole time period from the EEG recording up to the outcome events (which was seizure recurrence for the "cases", or 1-year seizure freedom for "controls"). As predictors, we evaluated the total number, frequency, mean and maximum duration of epileptiform discharges (EDs) and spike density (i.e. total EDs duration/artifact-free EEG duration) recorded during the paEEG. The same indexes were assessed also in standard EEG (stEEG), including activation methods. Results Both the maximum length and the mean duration of EDs recorded during paEEG significantly differed between cases and controls; when combined in a binary logistic regression model, the maximum length of EDs emerged as the only valid predictor. A cut-off of EDs duration of 2.68 seconds discriminated between cases and controls with a 100% specificity and a 93% sensitivity.

Significance The occurrence of prolonged EDs in EEG recording might represent an indicator of antiepileptic drug failure in JME patients.

Walking reduces sensorimotor network connectivity compared to standing	JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						EEG (electroencephalography); Walking; Connectivity; Multi-tasking; Brain	SPINAL-CORD; CORTICAL ACTIVATION; DEFAULT MODE; BRAIN; EEG; LOCOMOTION; GAIT; BLIND; SPEED; ARTIFACTS	Background: Considerable effort has been devoted to mapping the functional and effective connectivity of the human brain, but these efforts have largely been limited to tasks involving stationary subjects. Recent advances with high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and Independent Components Analysis (ICA) have enabled study of electrocortical activity during human locomotion. The goal of this work was to measure the effective connectivity of cortical activity during human standing and walking. Methods: We recorded 248-channels of EEG as eight young healthy subjects stood and walked on a treadmill both while performing a visual oddball discrimination task and not performing the task. ICA parsed underlying electrocortical, electromyographic, and artifact sources from the EEG signals. Inverse source modeling methods and clustering algorithms localized posterior, anterior, prefrontal, left sensorimotor, and right sensorimotor clusters of electrocortical sources across subjects. We applied a directional measure of connectivity, conditional Granger causality, to determine the effective connectivity between electrocortical sources. Results: Connections involving sensorimotor clusters were weaker for walking than standing regardless of whether the subject was performing the simultaneous cognitive task or not. This finding supports the idea that cortical involvement during standing is greater than during walking, possibly because spinal neural networks play a greater role in locomotor control than standing control. Conversely, effective connectivity involving non-sensorimotor areas was stronger for walking than standing when subjects were engaged in the simultaneous cognitive task. Conclusions: Our results suggest that standing results in greater functional connectivity between sensorimotor cortical areas than walking does. Greater cognitive attention to standing posture than to walking control could be one interpretation of that finding. These techniques could be applied to clinical populations during gait to better investigate neural substrates involved in mobility disorders.

Towards a non-invasive brain-machine interface system to restore gait function in humans	2011 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	33rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 30-SEP 03, 2011	Boston, MA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)			PERFORMANCE; WALKING; EEG	Before 2009, the feasibility of applying brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) to control prosthetic devices had been limited to upper limb prosthetics such as the DARPA modular prosthetic limb. Until recently, it was believed that the control of bipedal locomotion involved central pattern generators with little supraspinal control. Analysis of cortical dynamics with electroencephalography (EEG) was also prevented by the lack of analysis tools to deal with excessive signal artifacts associated with walking. Recently, Nicolelis and colleagues paved the way for the decoding of locomotion showing that chronic recordings from ensembles of cortical neurons in primary motor (M1) and primary somatosensory (S1) cortices can be used to decode bipedal kinematics in rhesus monkeys. However, neural decoding of bipedal locomotion in humans has not yet been demonstrated. This study uses non-invasive EEG signals to decode human walking in six nondisabled adults. Participants were asked to walk on a treadmill at their self-selected comfortable speed while receiving visual feedback of their lower limbs, to repeatedly avoid stepping on a strip drawn on the treadmill belt. Angular kinematics of the left and right hip, knee and ankle joints and EEG were recorded concurrently. Our results support the possibility of decoding human bipedal locomotion with EEG. The average of the correlation values (r) between predicted and recorded kinematics for the six subjects was 0.7 (+/- 0.12) for the right leg and 0.66 (+/- 0.11) for the left leg. The average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values for the predicted parameters were 3.36 (+/- 1.89) dB for the right leg and 2.79 (+/- 1.33) dB for the left leg. These results show the feasibility of developing non-invasive neural interfaces for volitional control of devices aimed at restoring human gait function.

Morphological imaging yields complementary data, yet it cannot replace the essential functional analysis tool that is EEG. Furthermore, EEG has the great advantage of being non-invasive, easy to perform and allows control tests when follow-up is necessary, even at the patient's bedside. Faced with the advances in knowledge, techniques and indications, the Societe de Neurophysiologie Clinique de Longue Francaise (SNCLF) and the Ligue Francaise Contre l'Epilepsie (LFCE) found it necessary to provide an update on EEG recommendations. This article will review the methodology applied to this work, refine the various topics detailed in the following chapters. It will go over the summary of recommendations for each of these chapters and underline proposals for writing an EEG report. Some questions could not be answered by the review of the literature; in those cases, an expert advice was given by the working and reading groups in addition to the guidelines.

Immersive VR can also be used in conjunction with neurophysiological monitoring techniques, such as electroencephalography (EEG), to record neural activity as users perform complex tasks. As such, the fusion of VR, kinematic tracking, and EEG offers a powerful testbed for naturalistic neuroscience research. In this study, we combine these elements to investigate the cognitive and neural mechanisms that underlie motor skill learning during a multi-day simulated marksmanship training regimen conducted with 20 participants. On each of 3 days, participants performed 8 blocks of 60 trials in which a simulated clay pigeon was launched from behind a trap house. Participants attempted to shoot the moving target with a firearm game controller, receiving immediate positional feedback and running scores after each shot. Over the course of the 3 days that individuals practiced this protocol, shot accuracy and precision improved significantly while reaction times got significantly faster. Furthermore, results demonstrate that more negative EEG amplitudes produced over the visual cortices correlate with better shooting performance measured by accuracy, reaction times, and response times, indicating that early visual system plasticity underlies behavioral learning in this task. These findings point towards a naturalistic neuroscience approach that can be used to identify neural markers of marksmanship performance.

As therapeutic interventions focus on reduction or elimination of seizures, the accurate documentation of seizure occurrence is essential. However, patient self-evaluation compared with objective evaluation by video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring or long-term ambulatory EEG revealed that patients document fewer than 50% of their seizures, on average, and that documentation accuracy varies significantly over time. For good clinical practice in epilepsy, novel and feasible seizure detection techniques for ambulatory long-term use are needed. Generalised tonic-clonic seizures can already be detected reliably by methods that rely on motion recording (eg, surface electromyography). However, the automatic detection of other seizure types, such as complex partial seizures, will require multimodal approaches that combine the measurement of ictal autonomic alterations (eg, heart rate) and of characteristic movement patterns (eg, accelerometry). Innovative and feasible tools for automatic seizure detection are likely to advance both monitoring of the outcome of a treatment in a patient and clinical research in epilepsy.

J	Hussein, R; Mohamed, A; Alghoniemy, M				Hussein, Ramy; Mohamed, Amr; Alghoniemy, Masoud			Scalable real-time energy-efficient EEG compression scheme for wireless body area sensor network	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Wireless body area sensor network; Compression; Convex optimization		Recent technological advances in wireless body sensor networks have made it possible for the development of innovative medical applications to improve health care and the quality of life. By using miniaturized wireless electroencephalography (EEG) sensors, it is possible to perform ambulatory EEG recording and real-time healthcare applications. One master consideration in using such battery-powered wireless EEG monitoring system is energy constraint at the sensor side. The traditional EEG streaming approach imposes an excessive power consumption, as it transmits the entire EEG signals wirelessly. Therefore, innovative solutions to alleviate the total power consumption at the receiver are highly desired. This work introduces the use of the discrete wavelet transform and compressive sensing algorithms for scalable EEG data compression in wireless sensors in order to address the power and distortion constraints. Encoding and transmission power models of both systems are presented which enable analysis of power and performance costs. We then present a theoretical analysis of the obtained distortion caused by source encoding and channel errors. Based on this analysis, we develop an optimization scheme that minimizes the total distortion for different channel conditions and encoder settings. Using the developed framework, the encoder can adaptively tune the encoding parameters to match the energy constraint without performance degradation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This review focuses on the most relevant topics on brain-controlled vehicles, with a special reference to the terrestrial BCV (e.g., the mobile car, car simulator, real car, graphical and gaming car) and the aerial BCV, also called BCAV (e.g., real quadcopters, drones, fixed wings, graphical helicopter, and aircraft) controlled by using bio-signals, such as electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrooculogram (EOG), and Electromyogram (EMG). For instance, EEG-based algorithms detect patterns from the motor imaginary cortex area of the brain for intention detection, patterns like event-related desynchronization/event-related synchronization, steady-state visually evoked potentials, P300, and generated local evoked potential patterns. We have identified that the reported best-performing approaches employ machine learning and artificial intelligence optimization methods, namely support vector machine, neural network, linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbor, k-means, water drop optimization, and chaotic tug of war. We considered the following metrics to analyze the efficiency of the different methods: type and combination of bio-signals, time response, and accuracy values with statistical analysis. The present work provides an extensive literature review of the key findings of the past ten years, indicating future perspectives in the field.

This approach, termed Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI), has the potential to elucidate the neural correlates of perceptual and cognitive processes during real-life activities, such as locomotion. However, as of yet, no one has assessed the long-term stability of event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded under these conditions. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to evaluate the test-retest reliability of cognitive ERPs recorded while walking. High-density EEG was acquired from 12 young adults on two occasions, separated by an average of 2.3 years, as they performed a Go/No-Go response inhibition paradigm. During each testing session, participants performed the task while walking on a treadmill and seated. Using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) as a measure of agreement, we focused on two well-established neurophysiological correlates of cognitive control, the N2 and P3 ERPs. Following ICA-based artifact rejection, the earlier N2 yielded good to excellent levels of reliability for both amplitude and latency, while measurements for the later P3 component were generally less robust but still indicative of adequate to good levels of stability. Interestingly, the N2 was more consistent between walking sessions, compared to sitting, for both hits and correct rejection trials. In contrast, the P3 waveform tended to have a higher degree of consistency during sitting conditions. Overall, these results suggest that the electro-cortical signals obtained during active walking are representative of stable indices of neurophysiological function. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE			English	Review							TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; PHOTON EMISSION CT; IMAGING APPROACH; MILD; SPECT; MEG; PERFORMANCE; MILITARY; BLAST	Objective The purpose of this critical review is to summarise the evidence for the following technologies/strategies related to diagnosing or managing sports-related concussion: quantitative EEG, functional neuroimaging, head impact sensors, telemedicine and mobile devices. Data sources MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Controlled Trials Registers, SportDiscus, EMBASE, Web of Science and ProQuest databases. Primary search keywords were concussion, sports concussion and mild traumatic brain injury. The keywords used for secondary, topic specific searches were quantitative electroencephalography, qEEG, functionalMRI, magnetoencephalography, near-infrared spectroscopy, positron emission tomography, single photon emissionCT, accelerometer, impact sensor, telemetry, remote monitoring, robotic medicine, telemedicine, mobile device, mobile phone, smart phone and tablet computer. Results The primary search produced 8567 publications. The secondary searches produced nine publications that presented original data, included a comparison group in the study design and involved sports-related concussion. Four studies spoke to the potential of qEEG as a diagnostic or management tool, while five studies addressed the potential of fMRI to be used in the same capacity. Conclusions Emerging technologies and novel approaches that aid in sports concussion diagnosis and management are being introduced at a rapid rate. While some technologies show promise, their clinical utility remains to be established.

Subjects walking with reduced vision on a treadmill were acoustically informed about an approaching obstacle and received feedback about task performance. Only following a task-relevant acoustic signal, spinal reflex responses, evoked by tibial nerve stimulation during mid-stance, were enhanced in proximal arm and leg flexor muscles prior to obstacle compared to normal swing, reflecting the neuronal preparation of the task. During swing over the obstacle, limb muscle EMG activity was greater than in normal swing. Both the preparation and the performance (i.e. ascending movement slope of the obstacle-crossing leg) were associated with an enhanced EEG signal mainly in the prefrontal cortex of the right hemisphere. Adaptational changes in performance, reflex activity and muscle activation during repetitive obstacle stepping were not reflected in the EEG activity, probably due to an insufficient resolution of the EEG. The observations suggest that drive from supraspinal centers initiates and maintains spinal neuronal activity underlying obstacle task preparation and performance.

Surrogate-Based Artifact Removal From Single-Channel EEG	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Artifact removal; electroencephalography (EEG); single-channel EEG; surrogate data; wavelet decomposition	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; TIME-SERIES; PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNALS; MUSCLE ARTIFACTS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; ALGORITHM; NETWORKS; TOOL	Objective: the recent emergence and success of electroencephalography (EEG) in low-cost portable devices, has opened the door to a new generation of applications processing a small number of EEG channels for health monitoring and brain-computer interfacing. These recordings are, however, contaminated by many sources of noise degrading the signals of interest, thus compromising the interpretation of the underlying brain state. In this paper, we propose a new data-driven algorithm to effectively remove ocular and muscular artifacts from single-channel EEG: the surrogate-based artifact removal (SuBAR). Methods: by means of the time-frequency analysis of surrogate data, our approach is able to identify and filter automatically ocular and muscular artifacts embedded in single-channel EEG. Results: in a comparative study using artificially contaminated EEG signals, the efficacy of the algorithm in terms of noise removal and signal distortion was superior to other traditionally-employed single-channel EEG denoizing techniques: wavelet thresholding and the canonical correlation analysis combined with an advanced version of the empirical mode decomposition. Even in the presence of mild and severe artifacts, our artifact removal method provides a relative error 4 to 5 times lower than traditional techniques. Significance: in view of these results, the SuBAR method is a promising solution for mobile environments, such as ambulatory healthcare systems, sleep stage scoring, or anesthesia monitoring, where very few EEG channels or even a single channel is available.

Diagnostic yield of ambulatory EEGs in the elderly	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Geriatric; Seizure; Epilepsy; Epileptiform discharges; EEG monitoring; Diagnosis	EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; 16-CHANNEL EEG; EPILEPSY; UTILITY	Objective: The diagnostic yield of ambulatory EEG in the elderly is not known. We sought to determine diagnostic yield and identify factors predicting diagnostic findings in this elderly population. Methods: We reviewed 156 consecutive 24-72 h ambulatory EEGs performed on patients aged 60 or older. Results: Of the 156 studies, 58 studies (37%) revealed potentially diagnostic findings: either epileptiform discharges, an epileptic seizure, or a typical nonepileptic event. Focal slowing on routine EEG predicted epileptiform abnormalities on ambulatory EEG with an odds ratio of 4.0 (95% CI 1.7-9.7, p = 0.002). Age, the presence of a focal lesion on MRI, and duration of ambulatory EEG failed to predict epileptiform abnormalities on ambulatory EEG. Duration of ambulatory EEG predicted capture of a typical nonepileptic event with an odds ratio of 2.7 (95% CI 1.3-5.7, p = 0.009) for every additional day of study duration. Conclusions: Focal slowing on routine EEGs may warrant an ambulatory EEG in the setting of diagnostic uncertainty. Longer ambulatory EEGs have a higher yield in capturing patients' typical non-epileptic events, and should be considered in patients where nonepileptic events are a likely diagnostic possibility. Significance: These findings offer guidance in the use of ambulatory EEGs in the elderly. (C) 2017 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Weighted phase lag index stability as an artifact resistant measure to detect cognitive EEG activity during locomotion	JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Walking; Movement artifact; Artifact removal; Connectivity; Phase lag	BRAIN; NETWORK; SYNCHRONIZATION; CONNECTIVITY; REMOVAL; P300; P3A	Background: High-density electroencephalography (EEG) with active electrodes allows for monitoring of electrocortical dynamics during human walking but movement artifacts have the potential to dominate the signal. One potential method for recovering cognitive brain dynamics in the presence of gait-related artifact is the Weighted Phase Lag Index. Methods: We tested the ability of Weighted Phase Lag Index to recover event-related potentials during locomotion. Weighted Phase Lag Index is a functional connectivity measure that quantified how consistently 90 degrees (or 270 degrees) phase 'lagging' one EEG signal was compared to another. 248-channel EEG was recorded as eight subjects performed a visual oddball discrimination and response task during standing and walking (0.8 or 1.2 m/s) on a treadmill. Results: Applying Weighted Phase Lag Index across channels we were able to recover a p300-like cognitive response during walking. This response was similar to the classic amplitude-based p300 we also recovered during standing. We also showed that the Weighted Phase Lag Index detects more complex and variable activity patterns than traditional voltage-amplitude measures. This variability makes it challenging to compare brain activity over time and across subjects. In contrast, a statistical metric of the index's variability, calculated over a moving time window, provided a more generalized measure of behavior. Weighted Phase Lag Index Stability returned a peak change of 1.8% + -0.5% from baseline for the walking case and 3.9% + -1.3% for the standing case. Conclusions: These findings suggest that both Weighted Phase Lag Index and Weighted Phase Lag Index Stability have potential for the on-line analysis of cognitive dynamics within EEG during human movement. The latter may be more useful from extracting general principles of neural behavior across subjects and conditions.

Methods: A total of 167 hours of EEG data containing 899 marked interictal events is analysed to determine the percentage of events correctly recorded (the sensitivity) and the amount of data reduction achieved. Results: A better sensitivity-data reduction trade-off is found in the ambulatory recorded data. This may be unexpected as ambulatory recordings are known to contain large numbers of artifacts, but is accounted for by these artifacts being easily detected and discarded, improving the data reduction. Conclusions: Satisfactory performance levels are found in both data types, no degradation is present with ambulatory recordings. Significance: Demonstrates that the processing of EEG data for wearable EEG applications is feasible without a loss in performance compared to traditional inpatient EEG usage.

Effect of prior general anesthesia or sedation and antiseizure drugs on the diagnostic utility of wireless video electroencephalography in dogs	JOURNAL OF VETERINARY INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Article						EEG; epilepsy; movement disorder; paroxysmal episode; veterinary neurology	INTERICTAL EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; INTRAOPERATIVE ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHY; ROUTINE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAMS; ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS; IDIOPATHIC EPILEPSY; EEG; SEIZURE; CANINE; RECORDINGS; ARTIFACTS	Background Ambulatory wireless video electroencephalography (AEEG) is the method of choice to discriminate epileptic seizures from other nonepileptic episodes. However, the influence of prior general anesthesia (GA), sedation, or antiseizure drug (ASD) on the diagnostic ability of AEEG is unknown. Hypothesis/Objectives The use of sedation/GA or ASD treatment before AEEG recording may affect the diagnostic ability of AEEG and the time to first abnormality on AEEG. Animals A total of 108 client-owned dogs undergoing ambulatory AEEG for paroxysmal episodes. Methods Retrospective cohort study. Proportions of diagnostic AEEG and time to first abnormality were compared between dogs that received sedation/GA or neither for instrumentation as well as dogs receiving at least 1 ASD and untreated dogs. Results Ambulatory EEG was diagnostic in 60.2% of all dogs including 49% of the sedation/GA dogs and 68% of dogs that received neither (odds ratio [OR], 2.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-5.00;P= .05). The AEEG was diagnostic in 51% of dogs receiving at least 1 ASD and 66% of untreated dogs (OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 0.9-4.3;P= .11). No difference was found in time to first abnormality between sedation/GA or neither or ASD-treated or untreated dogs (P= .1 andP= .3 respectively). Ninety-five percent of dogs had at least 1 abnormality within 277 minutes. Conclusion and Clinical Importance Sedation/GA and concurrent ASD administration were not identified as confounding factors for decreasing AEEG diagnostic capability nor did they delay the time to first abnormality. A 4-hour minimal recording period is recommended.	[Parmentier, Thomas] Univ Guelph, Ontario Vet Coll, Dept Biomed Sci, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Monteith, Gabrielle; James, Fiona M.

The majority of these recorders are only capable of capturing and storing EEG for later review by clinicians. A few models are equipped with real-time seizure event detectors, but these detectors make no guarantees on when during a seizure a detection is made. This renders current ambulatory EEG recorders unsuitable for activating alarms or initiating therapies to acutely impact seizure progression in the ambulatory setting. Integrating seizure onset detectors into existing ambulatory recorders will make these applications feasible. Successful integration requires that these detectors be executable on the resource-limited digital signal processors found within ambulatory recorders. In this paper we describe the integration of a patient-specific seizure onset detector with a commercially available ambulatory EEG recorder, and demonstrate how such integration could enable the detection of seizure onset in the ambulatory setting.

The target specification was a system with 19 EEG channels and data stored onto the smartphone via a Wi-Fi connection. The hardware was developed using three ADS1299 integrated circuits, and the game engine, Unity, was used to develop the smartphone app. An evaluation of the system was conducted using recordings of alpha waves during periods of eye closure in participants (Bland-Altman statistical comparison with a clinical grade EEG system). The smartphone was also used to deliver time-locked auditory stimuli using an oddball paradigm to evaluate the ability of the developed system to acquire event related potentials (ERP) during sitting and walking. No significant differences were found for the alpha wave peak amplitude, frequency and area under the curve for the intra-system (two consecutive periods of alpha waves) or inter-system (developed smartphone-based EEG system versus FDA-approved system) comparisons. ERP results showed the peak amplitude of the auditory P300 component to deviant tones was significantly higher when compared to standard tones for sitting and walking activities. It is envisaged that our general-purpose EEG system will encourage other researchers to design and build their own specific versions rather than being limited by the fixed features of commercial products.

Here, noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) recorded from able-bodied volunteers during a novel treadmill walking paradigm was used to assess neural correlates of walking. A systematic processing method, including a recently developed subspace reconstruction algorithm, reduced movement-related EEG artifact prior to independent component analysis and dipole source localization. We quantified cortical activity while participants tracked slow and fast target speeds across two treadmill conditions: an active mode that adjusted belt speed based on user movements and a passive mode reflecting a typical treadmill. Our results reveal frequency specific, multi-focal task related changes in cortical oscillations elicited by active walking. Low gamma band power, localized to the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices, was significantly increased during double support and early swing phases, critical points in the gait cycle since the active controller adjusted speed based on pelvis position and swing foot velocity. These phasic gamma band synchronizations provide evidence that prefrontal and posterior parietal networks, previously implicated in visuo-spatial and somotosensory integration, are engaged to enhance lower limb control during gait. Sustained mu and beta band desynchronization within sensorimotor cortex, a neural correlate for movement, was observed during walking thereby validating our methods for isolating cortical activity. Our results also demonstrate the utility of EEG recorded during locomotion for probing the multi-regional cortical networks which underpin its execution. For example, the cortical network engagement elicited by the active treadmill suggests that it may enhance neuroplasticity for more effective motor training.

In fact, this scenario generates a degree of incapacity in terms of the performance of basic activities on the part of the wheelchair user. The treatment of disabled patients is performed in an individualized manner according to their particular clinical aspects. People with visual and motor disabilities are restricted in independent navigation. In this navigation scenario, there is a requirement for interaction that justifies the use of virtual reality (VR). In addition, locomotion needs to be under natural control to be successfully incorporated. Based on such a condition, electroencephalography (EEG) has shown great advances in the area of health by employing spontaneous brain signals. This research demonstrates, through an experiment, the use of a wheelchair adapted to have the support of VR and EEG for training of locomotion and individualized interaction of wheelchair users with visual impairment. The objective was to provide efficient interactions, thus allowing the social inclusion of patients who are considered otherwise incapacitated. This project was based on the following criteria: natural control, feedback, stimuli, and safety. A multilayer computer rehabilitation system was developed that incorporated natural interaction supported by EEG, which activated the movements in the virtual environment and real wheelchair through adequately performed experiments. This research consisted of elaborating a suitable approach for blind wheelchair user patients. The results demonstrated that the use of VR with EEG signals has the potential for improving the quality of life and independence of blind wheelchair users.

X.; Gramann, Klaus			Mobile brain/body Imaging in dance: A dynamic transdisciplinary field for applied research	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Editorial Material						dance therapy; mobile EEG; motor learning; neuroplasticity	COGNITION; NETWORK	Neuroscience of dance is an emerging field with important applications related to health and well-being, as dance has shown potential to foster adaptive neuroplasticity and is increasingly popular as a therapeutic activity or adjunct therapy for people living with conditions such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. However, the multimodal nature of dance presents challenges to researchers aiming to identify mechanisms involved when dance is used to combat neurodegeneration or support healthy ageing. Requiring simultaneous engagement of motor and cognitive domains, dancing includes coordination of systems involved in timing, memory and spatial learning. Studies on dance to this point rely primarily on assessments of brain dynamics and structure through pre/post-tests or studies on expertise, as traditional brain imaging modalities restrict participant movement to avoid movement-related artefacts. In this paper, we describe the process of designing and implementing a study that uses mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) to investigate real-time changes in brain dynamics and behaviour during the process of learning and performing a novel dance choreography. We show the potential for new insights to emerge from the coordinated collection of movement and brain-based data, and the implications of these in an emerging field whose medium is motion.

J	Mehra, D; Tiwari, A; Joshi, D				Mehra, Dhruv; Tiwari, Ashutosh; Joshi, Deepak			Investigating neural correlates of locomotion transition via temporal relation of EEG and EOG-recorded eye movements	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						EOG; EEG; Intention decoding; Neural machine interface (NMI)		The present study examines a temporal relation of walking behavior during locomotion transition (walking to stair ascent) to electrooculography (EOG) signals recorded from eye movement. Further, electroencephalography (EEG) signals from the occipital region of the brain are processed to understand the relative occurrence in EOG and EEG signals during the transition. The dipole sources in the occipital region with reference to EOG detection were estimated from independent components and then clustered using the k means algorithm. The dynamics of the dipoles in the occipital cluster in different frequency bands revealed significant desynchronization in the beta and low gamma bands, followed by resynchronization. This transitional behavior coincided with transient features suggesting possible saccadic movement of the eyes in the EOG signal. With the data from six able-bodied participants, the desynchronization in EEG from the occipital region was detected by nearly 2.2 +/- 0.5s before the transition. Using preprocessing techniques on the EOG signal followed by detecting saccades from the derivative of the EOG signal, the eye movements were detected by nearly 2.5 +/- 0.5s before the transition. The EOG decoded intention of transition appeared as early as 3.0 +/- 1.63s before desynchronization in the EEG. A paired t-test analysis showed that the EOG-based intent decoding of transition reflects significantly earlier than occipital EEG (p < 0.00001). This study could lead to a multi-modal neural-machine interface that may produce results superior to previous attempts involving only EEG and EMG signals.

In experimental lab settings EEG neuroimaging and eye tracking data are traditionally combined using external triggers to synchronize the signals. However, with biometric sensors increasingly being applied in everyday usage scenarios, there will be a need for solutions providing a continuous alignment of signals. In the present paper we propose using spontaneous eye blinks, as a means to achieve near real-time synchronization of EEG and eye tracking. Analyzing key parameters that define eye blink signatures across the two domains, we outline a probability function based algorithm to correlate the signals. Comparing the accuracy of the method against a state of the art EYE-EEG plug-in for offline analysis of EEG and eye tracking data, we propose our approach could be applied for robust synchronization of biometric sensor data collected in a mobile context.

The main indications of long-term EEG are: syndromic classification of epilepsy; search for interictal discharges when epilepsy is suspected or for the purpose of therapeutic evaluation; positive diagnosis of paroxysmal clinical events; and pre-surgical evaluation of drug-resistant epilepsy. Steep deprived-EEG and ambulatory-EEG are indicated to detect interictal discharges in order to validate a syndromic classification of epilepsy when standard EEG is negative. These exams can help in evaluating treatment efficacy, especially when clinical evaluation is difficult. Long-term video EEG is indicated for drug-resistant epilepsy, to analyze electro-clinical correlations in a pre-surgical evaluation context, and to refine a positive diagnosis when paroxysmal clinical events are frequent.

Sensitivity of magnetoencephalography as a diagnostic tool for epilepsy: a prospective study	EPILEPTIC DISORDERS			English	Article						magnetoencephalography; epilepsy; diagnosis; sensitivity	AMBULATORY EEG; MEG; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; ACCURACY	Aim. The diagnostic process for epilepsy can be lengthy and stressful, which may delay the start of treatment. The objective of this study was to determine the benefit of routine magnetoencephalography (MEG) with regard to diagnostic gain, compared to routine electroencephalography (EEG), EEG following sleep deprivation (EEGsd), and 24-hour EEG. Methods. In this prospective study, patients were included from two centres (Academic Centre for Epileptology Kempenhaeghe, Heeze and Elisabeth-Twee Steden Hospital, Tilburg) and MEG recording took place at a single centre (Amsterdam University Medical Centre, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam) in The Netherlands. Consecutively referred patients from peripheral hospitals were included between August 2013 and March 2016. Patients were offered routine MEG in addition to EEG examination and MRI for the diagnosis of epilepsy. The final clinical diagnosis was based on all available clinical data and test results at the end of the diagnostic process. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated for routine EEG, routine EEG plus additional EEG and MEG. In addition, diagnostic gain associated with MEG, relative to the other modalities, was calculated. Secondary outcome was congruence of localization of epileptiform discharges between MEG and MRI or final clinical diagnosis. Results. Based on a cohort of 138 patients, sensitivity and specificity was shown to be 31.6% and 78.4% for routine MEG, 31.6% and 100% for routine EEG, and 52.6% and 97.3% for routine EEG plus additional EEG, respectively. Routine MEG demonstrated a diagnostic gain of 16.8% compared to routine EEG and 9.5% compared to routine EEG plus additional EEG. In 35.7% of patients with a lesion on MRI that was consistent with the final clinical diagnosis, MEG showed epileptiform discharges in the same area. Conclusion. Routine MEG may provide additional value during the initial diagnosis of epilepsy.

The value of long term EEG monitoring in children: A comparison of ambulatory EEG and video telemetry	SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY			English	Article						Ambulatory EEG; Video telemetry; Video-EEG; Seizure; Epilepsy	EPILEPSY; UTILITY	Purpose: Outpatient ambulatory EEG may be followed by inpatient video telemetry EEG when investigating children for possible seizures and for classification of epilepsy. We investigated the value of ambulatory EEG and subsequent video telemetry recording in our centre. Method: The departmental EEG database was interrogated retrospectively for children undergoing ambulatory recording followed by inpatient video telemetry within an 18-month period. Results: 30 patients fitted these criteria, 21 females, 9 males, age range 3-16 years. The mean interval between studies was 9 months. For ambulatory recordings 93% of studies were undertaken to ascertain if behaviours were epileptic. 66% of ambulatory recordings studies captured an event of interest and 63% were able to answer the question asked of the test. In video telemetry recording 80% of studies were aimed at ascertaining if events were epileptic or not, 20% were undertaken for classification of seizure type. 70% of recordings captured an ictus and were considered helpful in addressing the clinical question. Pooled together 90% of patients had a paroxysmal event captured and the clinical question answered by the recording techniques. In patients for whom ambulatory recording failed to capture an attack or answer the clinical question, 70% went on to have a successful video telemetry recording. Conclusion: Both ambulatory EEG and inpatient video telemetry are effective tools for diagnosis of seizures. The majority of patients with failed ambulatory recordings go on to have successful video telemetry. Combining the two resources provides useful clinical information in nearly all instances.

Neurophysiology centers had to suddenly reschedule their activities, with a lack of specific recommendations about electroencephalography (EEG) execution. During the pandemic phase 1, we launched an online survey to understand the flaws and strengths of the EEG management in Italy at the time of Covid-19 pandemic. Methods A 45-item online survey (published from April 16 to 30, 2020), endorsed by the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology (SINC), the Italian League Against epilepsy (LICE), and the Italian Association of Neurophysiology technologists (AITN), collected EEG management data (EEG's number and type, indications, personnel and patients safety, devices' sanification) during the Covid-19 pandemic. Results We received responses from 206 centers. The number of EEGs performed was reduced by 76 +/- 20%, and several types of specific EEG (video-EEG, ambulatory-EEG, LTM, polysomnography) were reduced at a minimum. Half of the centers performed inpatient EEGs only for urgencies. Repetitive seizures, encephalitis, and non-convulsive status epilepticus were the most common indications. Covid-19-positive patients received less EEG than negative ones (p < 0.0001). EEG requests came mainly not only from neurologists (n = 176) but also from general practitioners (n = 40), emergentists (n = 79), intensivists (n = 72), and other specialists (n = 53). Those centers which continued performing outpatient EEG examinations were instructed to perform the EEG after a Covid-19-related symptom screening for patients and using personal protective equipment (PPE) through all the procedure. Inpatient EEGs were performed using FFP2/FFP3 masks by neurophysiology technologists in only 50% of cases. Patients executed hyperventilation only for real clinical needs, but often (56%) with a mask. Conclusions Italian neurophysiology centers strongly adhered to government restrictions of lockdown. Some issues emerged, ranging from the evaluation of a proper indication for EEG, technical procedures of EEG recording, and protection of neurophysiology technicians.

To date, few studies have been conducted on the effect of exposure to LTE EMF. Here, we evaluated the changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) due to LTE EMF exposure. An LTE EMF exposure system with a stable power emission, which was equivalent to the maximum emission from an LTE mobile phone, was used to radiate the subjects. Numerical simulations were conducted to ensure that the specific absorption rate in the subject's head was below the safety limits. Exposure to LTE EMF reduced the spectral power and the interhemispheric coherence in the alpha and beta bands of the frontal and temporal brain regions. No significant change was observed in the spectral power and the inter-hemispheric coherence in different timeslots during and after the exposure. These findings also corroborated those of our previous study using functional magnetic resonant imaging.

Multimodal Imaging of Brain Activity to Investigate Walking and Mobility Decline in Older Adults (Mind in Motion Study): Hypothesis, Theory, and Methods	FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mobility; walking; older adults; brain; neuroimaging; EEG; MRI; fNIRS	LOWER-EXTREMITY FUNCTION; DYNAMIC BALANCE CONTROL; PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE; GAIT TERMINATION; COMPLEX WALKING; ELECTROCORTICAL ACTIVITY; SUBSEQUENT DISABILITY; MUSCLE-ACTIVITY; WHITE-MATTER; INITIATION	Age-related brain changes likely contribute to mobility impairments, but the specific mechanisms are poorly understood. Current brain measurement approaches (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), PET) are limited by inability to measure activity from the whole brain during walking. The Mind in Motion Study will use cutting edge, mobile, high-density electroencephalography (EEG). This approach relies upon innovative hardware and software to deliver three-dimensional localization of active cortical and subcortical regions with good spatial and temporal resolution during walking. Our overarching objective is to determine age-related changes in the central neural control of walking and correlate these findings with a comprehensive set of mobility outcomes (clinic-based, complex walking, and community mobility measures). Our hypothesis is that age-related walking deficits are explained in part by the Compensation Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis (CRUNCH). CRUNCH is a well-supported model that describes the over-recruitment of brain regions exhibited by older adults in comparison to young adults, even at low levels of task complexity. CRUNCH also describes the limited brain reserve resources available with aging. These factors cause older adults to quickly reach a ceiling in brain resources when performing tasks of increasing complexity, leading to poor performance. Two hundred older adults and twenty young adults will undergo extensive baseline neuroimaging and walking assessments. Older adults will subsequently be followed for up to 3 years. Aim 1 will evaluate whether brain activity during actual walking explains mobility decline. Cross sectional and longitudinal designs will be used to study whether poorer walking performance and steeper trajectories of decline are associated with CRUNCH indices. Aim 2 is to harmonize high-density EEG during walking with fNIRS (during actual and imagined walking) and fMRI (during imagined walking). This will allow integration of CRUNCH-related hallmarks of brain activity across neuroimaging modalities, which is expected to lead to more widespread application of study findings. Aim 3 will study central and peripheral mechanisms (e.g., cerebral blood flow, brain regional volumes, and connectivity, sensory function) to explain differences in CRUNCH indices during walking. Research performed in the Mind in Motion Study will comprehensively characterize the aging brain during walking for developing new intervention targets.

Fifty-four children underwent ambulatory EEG recordings for 48 hours over a 12 month period. Only 31 of the 54 children experienced one of their typical clinical episodes during their recordings. Fifteen of these 31 patients were considered to have epilepsy, only three of whom had a clinical episode at the time of their recording and in all three the EEG demonstrated abnormal (generalized spike and slow wave or focal, rhythmic slow wave) activity. All 10 patients who were considered to have non-epileptic episodes showed no electrical change during their EEG recordings. The results of the ambulatory cassette EEG recordings were considered to have been helpful and to have contributed to the management of only 17 (31%) of the 54 patients in this audit. Stricter clinical criteria for undertaking ambulatory recordings and improved technology are likely to increase the role and usefulness of this procedure. (C) 2001 BEA Trading Ltd.

Non-invasive wearable seizure detection using long-short-term memory networks with transfer learning	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						seizure detection; machine learning; wearable devices; epilepsy	TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURES; AUTOMATED SEIZURE; IMPLANTED DEVICE; EPILEPSY; VALIDATION; SYSTEM	Objective. The detection of seizures using wearable devices would improve epilepsy management, but reliable detection of seizures in an ambulatory environment remains challenging, and current studies lack concurrent validation of seizures using electroencephalography (EEG) data. Approach. An adaptively trained long-short-term memory deep neural network was developed and trained using a modest number of seizure data sets from wrist-worn devices. Transfer learning was used to adapt a classifier that was initially trained on intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) signals to facilitate classification of non-EEG physiological datasets comprising accelerometry, blood volume pulse, skin electrodermal activity, heart rate, and temperature signals. The algorithm's performance was assessed with and without pre-training on iEEG signals and transfer learning. To assess the performance of the seizure detection classifier using long-term ambulatory data, wearable devices were used for multiple months with an implanted neurostimulator capable of recording iEEG signals, which provided independent electrographic seizure detections that were reviewed by a board-certified epileptologist. Main results. For 19 motor seizures from 10 in-hospital patients, the algorithm yielded a mean area under curve (AUC), a sensitivity, and an false alarm rate per day (FAR/day) of 0.98, 0.93, and 2.3, respectively. Additionally, for eight seizures with probable motor semiology from two ambulatory patients, the classifier achieved a mean AUC of 0.97 and an FAR of 2.45 events/day at a sensitivity of 0.9. For all seizure types in the ambulatory setting, the classifier had a mean AUC of 0.82 with a sensitivity of 0.47 and an FAR of 7.2 events/day. Significance. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated using motor and non-motor seizures during in-hospital and ambulatory use. The classifier was able to detect multiple types of motor and non-motor seizures, but performed significantly better on motor seizures.

An exploratory project	DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION-ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Power mobility; electroencephalography; single-subject research design; cerebral palsy; multiple-severe impairments	CLASSIFICATION-SYSTEM; JOYSTICK-USE; INFANTS; PEOPLE; QUESTIONNAIRE; ADOLESCENTS; RELIABILITY; DIMENSIONS; WHEELCHAIR; LOCOMOTION	Purpose: The purposes of this exploratory project were: (1) to evaluate the impact of power mobility training with a child who has multiple, severe impairments and (2) to determine if the child's spectrum of electroencephalography (EEG) activity changed during power mobility training. Study design: A single-subject A-B-A-B research design was conducted with a four-week duration for each phase. Two target behaviours were explored: (1) mastery motivation assessed via the dimensions of mastery questionnaire (DMQ) and (2) EEG data collected under various conditions. Power mobility skills were also assessed. Methods: The participant was a three-year, two-month-old girl with spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy, gross motor function classification system level V. Each target behaviour was measured weekly. During intervention phases, power mobility training was provided. Results: Improvements were noted in subscale scores of the DMQ. Short-term and long-term EEG changes were also noted. Improvements were noted in power mobility skills. Conclusions: The participant in this exploratory project demonstrated improvements in power mobility skill and function. EEG data collection procedures and variability in an individual's EEG activity make it difficult to determine if the participant's spectrum of EEG activity actually changed in response to power mobility training. Additional studies are needed to investigate the impact of power mobility training on the spectrum of EEG activity in children who have multiple, severe impairments. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Power mobility training appeared to be beneficial for a child with multiple, severe impairments though the child may never become an independent, community-based power wheelchair user. Electroencephalography may be a valuable addition to the study of power mobility use in children with multiple, severe impairments. Power mobility training appeared to impact mastery motivation (the internal drive to solve complex problems and master new skills) in a child who has multiple, severe impairments.

Impact of video-ambulatory electroencephalography on the medical management of epilepsy	JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Antiepileptic drugs; Epileptic seizures; Non-epileptic attacks; Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures; Video-ambulatory electroencephalography	NONEPILEPTIC ATTACK DISORDER; EEG; DIAGNOSIS; TELEMETRY; SEIZURES; CHILDREN; ADULTS; CARE; HOME	Video-ambulatory electroencephalography (video-AEEG) is increasingly being used in secondary care centres for the diagnostic work-up of new cases with suspected epilepsy and for the review of known cases with active seizures despite medical treatment. We reviewed how the outcome of video-AEEG influenced the medical management of patients who underwent this investigation at a neurophysiology department within a secondary care centre. Out of a total of 171 consecutive video-AEEG studies performed over a period of two years, 111 could be included in our retrospective analysis, based on availability and completeness of relevant clinical information pre- and post-investigation. In our sample, 55.9% of patients had typical clinical events captured on video-AEEG and diagnostic yield was higher in patients with a previously established diagnosis of epilepsy (n = 62; diagnostic yield 62.9%). A total of 27 patients (243%) had changes in medical treatment following video-AEEG, most frequently antiepileptic drug introduction/increase when epileptic seizures were captured. This proportion was similar between patients with or without a previously established diagnosis of epilepsy. Our findings in a real life setting confirm the usefulness of video-AEEG in influencing the clinical attitude towards complex patients with suspected or longstanding history of epilepsy.

The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is utilized to recognize the human electroencephalograph (EEG) signals in the brain-computer interface (BCI) system which is based on steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP). In this way the intentions of human can be distinguished and control commands are generated for mobile robot. The DLT is used to recognize the type of environmental obstacles and environmental features by analysing the images that describe the environment. And then according to the classification of obstacle, various potential fields are built for the specific obstacles. By utilizing bottles as the features of environment, a whole map of the surroundings can be built through a sequential simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. The main contribution of this paper is that the relationship between the potential field strength and classification of EEG signals is built up through the combination of multiple artificial potential fields with the brain signals, which produces the motion commands and designs a trajectory free of obstacles in un-structure environments. Three volunteer subjects are invited to test the entire system, and all operators can successfully complete experiments of manipulating the robot in corridor environments.

These studies observed enhanced cortical activation and connectivity when task-difficulty and postural instability increased. However, little attention has been paid to the allocation of cortical networks appearing with a decreasing base of support from bipedal to single leg stance. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate modulations of functional connectivity from bipedal to single leg stance. Experimental procedures: Cortical activity during bipedal and single leg stance (left) was investigated in 15 male subjects using 128 channel mobile electroencephalography (EEG), while standing on a triaxial force plate. Power spectral density was calculated for theta (4-7 Hz), alpha-1 (8-10 Hz) and alpha-2 (10-12 Hz) frequency bands. Estimations of the phase lag index (PLI) were conducted as a measure of functional connectivity. Moreover, postural control was analyzed by the area of sway and sway velocity. Results: The results demonstrated a significantly increased area of sway and decreased alpha-2 power in single leg compared to bipedal stance. Furthermore, PLIs within the alpha-2 frequency band showed significantly decreased inter-hemispherical phase coupling in single leg stance, associated with connections involving the left motor region. Discussion: Altogether, the present findings may indicate modulations of cortical contributions in single leg compared to bipedal stance. The present data suggest that decreased inter-hemispherical functional connectivity, in conjunction with a global increase in cortical excitability, may indicate enhanced alertness and task-specific selective inhibition of motor networks in favor of postural control.

Here, we have conducted an in-depth comparison of the EEG-recordings obtained with a medical-grade golden-cup electrodes ambulatory device, the SOMNOwatch + EEG-6, vs those obtained with a consumer-grade, single dry electrode low-cost device, the NeuroSky MindWave, one of the most affordable devices currently available. We recorded EEG signals at Fp1 using the two different devices simultaneously on 21 participants who underwent two experimental phases: a 12-minute resting state task (alternating two cycles of closed/open eyes periods), followed by 60-minute virtual-driving task. We evaluated the EEG recording quality by comparing the similarity between the temporal data series, their spectra, their signal-to-noise ratio, the reliability of EEG measurements (comparing the closed eyes periods), as well as their blink detection rate. We found substantial agreement between signals: whereas, qualitatively, the NeuroSky MindWave presented higher levels of noise and a biphasic shape of blinks, the similarity metric indicated that signals from both recording devices were significantly correlated. While the NeuroSky MindWave was less reliable, both devices had a similar blink detection rate. Overall, the NeuroSky MindWave is noise-limited, but provides stable recordings even through long periods of time. Furthermore, its data would be of adequate quality compared to that of conventional wet electrode EEG devices, except for a potential calibration error and spectral differences at low frequencies.

Changes in cortical activity measured with EEG during a high-intensity cycling exercise	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						electroencephalography; locomotion; motor control; fatigue	MOTOR CORTEX; PARIETAL CORTEX; PREMOTOR AREAS; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; TREADMILL WALKING; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RHYTHMS; DYNAMICS; BRAIN; DESYNCHRONIZATION	This study investigated the effects of a high-intensity cycling exercise on changes in spectral and temporal aspects of electroencephalography (EEG) measured from 10 experienced cyclists. Cyclists performed a maximum aerobic power test on the first testing day followed by a time-to-exhaustion trial at 85% of their maximum power output on 2 subsequent days that were separated by similar to 48 h. EEG was recorded using a 64-channel system at 500 Hz. Independent component (IC) analysis parsed the EEG scalp data into maximal ICs. An equivalent current dipole model was calculated for each IC, and results were clustered across subjects. A time-frequency analysis of the identified electrocortical clusters was performed to investigate the magnitude and timing of event-related spectral perturbations. Significant changes (P < 0.05) in electrocortical activity were found in frontal, supplementary motor and parietal areas of the cortex. Overall, there was a significant increase in EEG power as fatigue developed throughout the exercise. The strongest increase was found in the frontal area of the cortex. The timing of event-related desynchronization within the supplementary motor area corresponds with the onset of force production and the transition from flexion to extension in the pedaling cycle. The results indicate an involvement of the cerebral cortex during the pedaling task that most likely involves executive control function, as well as motor planning and execution.

However, manipulation of the console by physicians themselves may not be possible because their hands may be otherwise engaged. In this study, an image manipulation system using an electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor mounted on the operator's head was developed. In this system, data acquired by the device is used to manipulate images, and the output can be converted to commands for various actions such as paging, which can be controlled by the operator's eye-blink, and zooming of a region indicated by the cursor, which can be controlled by the operator's mental concentration. In this study, the MindWave Mobile headset was used as EEG sensor, and AZEWIN for the display system. Ten observers were enrolled and fitted with EEG device to determine the threshold values of blink strength and attention; threshold value of 100 for blink strength and 65 for attention were determined. Thirty-one observers were enrolled and fitted with EEG device to investigate average response-time; the average response time for detecting paging was 0.43 +/- 0.02s, and that for zooming was 5.85 +/- 0.56s. Thus, the proposed image manipulation system using the operator's EEG signals enabled physicians to assess and manipulate images without using their hands.

It's not easy for the disabled and elderly people to maneuver a mechanical wheelchair, which many of them normally use for locomotion. Hence there is a need for designing a wheelchair that is intelligent and provides easy maneuverability. In this context, an attempt has been made to propose a thought controlled wheelchair, which uses the captured signals from the brain and eyes and processes it to control the wheelchair. Electroencephalography (EEG) technique deploys an electrode cap that is placed on the user's scalp for the acquisition of the EEG signals which are captured and translated into movement commands by the arduino micro-controller which in turn move the wheelchair.

Due to its limited provision, video EEG monitoring is unavailable to many patients under investigation(1). The aim of this study was to examine the utility of the alternate investigation of outpatient ambulatory EEG. Methods: In this retrospective study we analysed 324 consecutive prolonged outpatient ambulatory EEGs lasting 72-96 h (4-5 days), without medication withdrawal. EEG data and the clinical record were reviewed to investigate the utility of the investigation. Results: Of 324 studies: 219 (68%) studies gave positive data, 116 (36%) showed interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), 167 (52%) had events. 105 (32%) studies were normal. Overall 51% of studies changed management of which 22% of studies changed the diagnosis and 29% of studies refined the diagnosis by classifying the epilepsy into focal or generalised. Conclusion: The present study confirms the diagnostic utility of outpatient ambulatory EEG in the diagnosis of paroxysmal events. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 British Epilepsy Association.

Establishing an optimal duration of recording for ambulatory video EEG	EPILEPSIA OPEN			English	Article						epilepsy; epilepsy monitoring; recording duration; remote care; video electroencephalography	DIAGNOSTIC YIELD; ROUTINE; UTILITY	Objective Ambulatory video EEG allows for extended recording of EEG in the comfort of a patient's home. However, the optimal duration of recording to capture clinical events is yet to be established. The current study uses retrospective analyses to identify an optimal recording duration for at-home video EEG. Methods A retrospective review was performed utilizing an anonymized database of ambulatory video EEG recordings performed between March and September 2020 with a national in-home EEG provider. Only completed assessments with neurologists' reads of raw data were reviewed, resulting in 3644 unique studies divided into three age cohorts: pediatrics (n = 941), adult (n = 2020), and geriatric (n = 683). Cohorts were characterized by assessment yield and time to first typical clinical event, as well as subsequent typical events over duration of recording. Results Frequency distributions reveal over half of first events are captured within 12 hours, but longer recording durations capture a much wider majority of both first typical events, as well as the mean number of subsequent events (5 clinical events). In 72 hours, over 97% of first events were observed in adult and geriatric patients, as well as over 95% of the mean number of subsequent events. In children, time to first event was significantly earlier than either adult or geriatric samples, with 98% of first events, and 92.8% of the mean number of subsequent events being observed in 48 hours. Significance These results from a large-scale, national dataset of patients using in-home EEG monitoring suggests recording at least 48 hours in duration for children, and at least 72 hours in duration for adult and geriatric samples, is optimal to maximize the likelihood of observing typical clinical events to facilitate diagnosis.

JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						ambulatory EEG; state of the art	EPILEPSY; SURGERY	When someone asks the question, how good is ambulatory EEG telemetry, there is no correct answer. There are many manufacturers of ambulatory EEG technology. Each device has its own strengths and weaknesses. What one is really interested in when one asks such a question needs to be defined in terms of expectations and technical capabilities for the piece of equipment under discussion. Systems exist or can be easily modified to be as sophisticated as the best of the inpatient units. However, is that level of sophistication needed for the ambulatory based recordings? Again, the answer to that is dependent on the ordering physician's expectations. Below is a discussion of the different clinical expectations that are frequently encountered and the needed requirements for an ambulatory system to properly address them.

Study design Single animals chronically instrumented for electroencephalography (EEG) recording were randomized to undergo euthanasia with either CO2 or Xe (n = 6 animals per group). Animals Twelve adult (>6 weeks old) male C57Bl6/n mice. Methods Mice were surgically instrumented with EEG and electromyogram electrodes. Following a 7-day recovery period, animals were placed individually in a sealed chamber and a 5-minute baseline recorded in 21% O-2. Gas [100% Xe (n = 6) or 100% CO2 (n = 6)] was then added to the chamber at 30% chamber volume minute(-1) (2.8 L minute(-1)) until cessation of breathing. EEG, behaviour (jumping and freezing) and locomotion speed were recorded throughout. Results Mice undergoing single gas euthanasia with Xe did not show jumping or freezing behaviours and had reduced locomotion speed compared to baseline, in contrast to CO2, which resulted in increases in these variables. EEG recordings revealed sedative effects from Xe but heightened arousal from CO2. Conclusions Our data suggest that Xe may be less aversive than CO2 when using a 30% chamber volume minute(-1) fill rate and could improve the welfare of mice undergoing gas euthanasia.

Examples of such applications include control of mobile devices, analysis of the driving habits and drowsiness of drivers, diagnosis of brain diseases such as epileptic seizure, and analysis of eye fatigue on display devices. In general, several electrodes should be attached to the surface of the head in order to measure the EEG signal, but noise occurs due to the movements of the attached electrodes by the user's head movements. In order to solve this problem, we propose a new method for correctly obtaining robust EEG data from head movements. This research is novel in the following three ways. First, a user's head movements are estimated by using a frontal viewing camera attached to a wearable device. Second, in order to estimate the accurate direction and amount of head movement with successive images by the frontal viewing camera, motion vectors between the images are obtained by the Lucas-Kanade-Tomasi (LKT) method. Third, whether or not the user's head movement occurs is determined by using a user-dependent support vector machine (SVM) with two features based on the motion vectors. The experimental results showed that the proposed method could measure the EEG signals robust to the user's head movements.

Choosing Wisely: Highest-Cost Tests in Outpatient Neurology	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							TOP 5 LISTS; HEALTH-CARE; RESPONSIBILITY	Identifying the tests/procedures ordered by neurologists that contribute most to health care expenditures is a critical step in the process of creating the neurology top 5 list for the Choosing Wisely initiative. Using data from the 2007-2010 National Ambulatory Care Medical Survey, we found that $13.3 billion (95% confidence interval=$10.1-$16.5 billion) was spent on tests ordered at neurologist visits. The tests/procedures with the highest expenditures were magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; 51% of total expenditures; $7.5 billion), electromyography (EMG; 20% of expenditures; $2.6 billion), and electroencephalography (EEG; 8% of expenditures; $1.1 billion). MRI, EMG, and EEG should receive close scrutiny in the development of the neurology top 5 list.

Recalibration of inhibitory control systems during walking-related dual-task interference: A Mobile Brain-Body Imaging (MOBI) Study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Dual-task design; Event-related potentials; Gait; Inhibitory control; EEG; Mobile Brain-Body Imaging	GO NOGO TASKS; OLDER-ADULTS; CORTICAL ACTIVATION; SCALP DISTRIBUTION; TREADMILL WALKING; COGNITIVE CONTROL; FRONTAL-CORTEX; ERP COMPONENTS; MOTOR TASK; GAIT	Walking while simultaneously performing cognitively demanding tasks such as talking or texting are typical complex behaviors in our daily routines. Little is known about neural mechanisms underlying cortical resource allocation during such mobile actions, largely due to portability limitations of conventional neuroimaging technologies. We applied an EEG-based Mobile Brain-Body Imaging (MOBI) system that integrates high-density event-related potential (ERP) recordings with simultaneously acquired foot-force sensor data to monitor gait patterns and brain activity. We compared behavioral and ERP measures associated with performing a Go/NoGo response-inhibition task under conditions where participants (N = 18) sat in a stationary way, walked deliberately or walked briskly. This allowed for assessment of effects of increasing dual-task load (i.e. walking speed) on neural indices of inhibitory control. Stride time and variability were also measured during inhibitory task performance and compared to stride parameters without task performance, thereby assessing reciprocal dual-task effects on gait parameters. There were no task performance differences between sitting and either walking condition, indicating that participants could perform both tasks simultaneously without suffering dual-task costs. However, participants took longer strides under dual-task load, likely indicating an adaptive mechanism to reduce inter-task competition for cortical resources. We found robust differences in amplitude, latency and topography of ERP components (N2 and P3) associated with inhibitory control between the sitting and walking conditions. Considering that participants showed no dual-task performance costs, we suggest that observed neural alterations under increasing task-load represent adaptive recalibration of the inhibitory network towards a more controlled and effortful processing mode, thereby optimizing performance under dual-task situations.

With digital technology, there are now many ways to perform EEG recordings. Variable attributes of EEG recordings include: inpatient versus outpatient, prolonged versus short, with video versus without, and with provocation/activation versus without. Each method has advantages and disadvantages, and, in particular, inpatient versus outpatient studies have major cost differences. In some situations EEG-video monitoring can be performed in the ambulatory/home rather than the inpatient setting.

Jane			The Use of Multivariate EMD and CCA for Denoising Muscle Artifacts From Few-Channel EEG Recordings	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Canonical correlation analysis (CCA); denoising; electroencephalogram (EEG); few-channel; multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD)	EMPIRICAL-MODE DECOMPOSITION; SOURCE SEPARATION; ELECTROMYOGENIC ARTIFACTS; WAVELET TRANSFORM; MULTICHANNEL; BCI	Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are often contaminated by muscle artifacts. In the literature, a number of methods have been proposed to deal with this problem. Yet most denoising muscle artifact methods are designed for either single-channel EEG or hospital-based, high-density multichannel recordings, not the few-channel scenario seen in most ambulatory EEG instruments. In this paper, we propose utilizing interchannel dependence information seen in the few-channel situation by combining multivariate empirical mode decomposition and canonical correlation analysis (MEMD-CCA). The proposed method, called MEMD-CCA, first utilizes MEMD to jointly decompose the few-channel EEG recordings into multivariate intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Then, CCA is applied to further decompose the reorganized multivariate IMFs into the underlying sources. Reconstructing the data using only artifact-free sources leads to artifact-attenuated EEG. We evaluated the performance of the proposed method through simulated, semisimulated, and real data. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is a promising tool for muscle artifact removal in the few-channel setting.

Hence, neurovascular coupling (NC) alteration could become a biomarker of the disease. NC might be assessed in clinical settings through multimodal electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Multimodal EEG-fNIRS was recorded at rest in an ambulatory setting to assess NC and to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the methodology to AD. Global NC was evaluated with a general linear model (GLM) framework by regressing whole-head EEG power envelopes in three frequency bands (theta, alpha and beta) with average fNIRS oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin concentration changes in the frontal and prefrontal cortices. NC was lower in AD compared to healthy controls (HC) with significant differences in the linkage of theta and alpha bands with oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin, respectively (p = 0.028 and p = 0.020). Importantly, standalone EEG and fNIRS metrics did not highlight differences between AD and HC. Furthermore, a multivariate data-driven analysis of NC between the three frequency bands and the two hemoglobin species delivered a cross-validated classification performance of AD and HC with an Area Under the Curve, AUC = 0.905 (p = 2.17 x 10(-5)). The findings demonstrate that EEG-fNIRS may indeed represent a powerful ecological tool for clinical evaluation of NC and early identification of AD.

The reference standard diagnostic monitoring is continuous video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring, ideally capturing all events or concordant interictal discharges. Automating EEG data review would save time and resources, thus enabling more people to receive reference standard monitoring and also potentially heralding a more quantitative approach to therapeutic outcomes. There is substantial research into the automated detection of seizures and epileptic activity from EEG. However, automated detection software is not widely used in the clinic, and despite numerous published algorithms, few methods have regulatory approval for detecting epileptic activity from EEG. This study reports on a deep learning algorithm for computer-assisted EEG review. Deep convolutional neural networks were trained to detect epileptic discharges using a preexisting dataset of over 6000 labelled events in a cohort of 103 patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). Patients underwent 24-hour ambulatory outpatient EEG, and all data were curated and confirmed independently by two epilepsy specialists (Seneviratne et al., 2016). The resulting automated detection algorithm was then used to review diagnostic scalp EEG for seven patients (four with IGE and three with events mimicking seizures) to validate performance in a clinical setting. The automated detection algorithm showed state-of-the-art performance for detecting epileptic activity from clinical EEG, with mean sensitivity of N95% and corresponding mean false positive rate of 1 detection per minute. Importantly, diagnostic case studies showed that the automated detection algorithm reduced human review time by 80%-99%, without compromising event detection or diagnostic accuracy.

However, many patients do not receive a definitive diagnosis following EMU admission. Ambulatory EEG following nondiagnostic EMU admissions was evaluated as a means of providing a diagnosis for these patients. Methods: In this retrospective study, we performed a chart review of 62 pediatric and adult patients who had a 72-hour ambulatory EEG following a nondiagnostic EMU admission. Results: In total, there were 62 patients with nondiagnostic EMU admissions who subsequently underwent ambulatory EEG. Mean age was 33.8 (SD, 18.5) years. Forty-one patients (66.2%) were female and 46 (74.2%) adult. Fifty patients (80.7%) had an additional comorbid neurologic, somatoform, or psychiatric diagnoses. Of the original 62 patients, 32 (51.6%) had no events, 3 (4.8%) had events with and without EEG changes, 4 (6.5%) had only events with EEG changes, and 23 (37.1%) had only events without EEG changes. Ambulatory EEG thus provided clinically useful information in 30 (48.4%) cases, with 20 (66.7%) reaching diagnosis within 24 hours. Conclusions: Ambulatory EEG following a nondiagnostic EMU admission may yield positive results in approximately half of all patients. A substantial proportion of the events that were captured in this setting were without EEG changes. In the absence of video and supportive clinical information, these events not only may represent nonepileptic events but also could represent focal seizures without EEG changes. The presence of particular stressors in the home environment may explain why many patients, specifically those who are nonepileptic, had events relatively quickly following discharge.

Mobile Brain/Body Imaging of cognitive-motor impairment in multiple sclerosis: Deriving EEG-based neuro-markers during a dual-task walking study	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Multiple sclerosis; EEG; Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI); Dual-task walking	RESPONSE-INHIBITION; FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITE; ERP COMPONENTS; INTERFERENCE; DYSFUNCTION; ATTENTION; IMPACT; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ACTIVATION; AMPLITUDE	Objective: Individuals with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) often present with cognitive and motor deficits, and thus the ability to perform tasks that rely on both domains may be particularly impaired. Yet, dual-task walking studies yield mixed results. Individual variance in the ability to cope with brain insult and mobilize additional brain resources may contribute to mixed findings. Methods: To test this hypothesis, we acquired event-related potentials (ERP) in individuals with MS and healthy controls (HCs) performing a Go/NoGo task while sitting (i.e., single task) or walking (i.e., dual-task) and looked at the relationship between task related modulation of the brain response and performance. Results: On the Go/NoGo task the MS group showed dual-task costs when walking, whereas HCs showed a dual-task benefit. Further, whereas the HC group showed modulation of the brain response as a function of task load, this was not the case in the MS group. Analysis for the pooled sample revealed a positive correlation between load-related ERP effects and dual-task performance. Conclusions: These data suggest a neurophysiological marker of cognitive-motor dysfunction in MS. Significance: Understanding neural processes underlying dual-task walking will help identify objective brain measurements of real-world issues and may improve assessment of MS.

This study was performed to determine how successful AEEG would be in recording seizures when the events were reported to occur at least 3 days per week. AEEGs of children who were patients at Children's Hospital Oakland between December 1993 and June 1997 were reviewed to see why the recordings were performed and to determine whether typical seizures were recorded. Children who had seizurelike events needed to have typical spells 3 days or more per week to justify obtaining AEEG. Most AEEGs were performed to discriminate between epileptic and nonepileptic seizures. A total of 167 children underwent AEEG recording. Ten were recorded to determine whether they were having frequent subtle seizures or frequent interictal epileptiform discharges. The remaining 157 patients had discrete events. A total of 140 children (89%) had their typical spells recorded. A total of 107 of these children (76%) had nonepileptic events. Average duration of recording was 1.9 days. AEEG is very successful in recording children's seizurelike events when parents report events occur at least 3 days per week. The procedure is well tolerated and there are few technical problems that prolong recording time.

Little is known about the dynamics of the neural processes that underpin this form of value-based decision making and no studies have investigated these processes outside of controlled laboratory settings. The current study investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics that accompany economic valuation of products using mobile electroencephalography (EEG) and eye tracking techniques. Participants viewed and rated images of household products in a gallery setting while EEG and eye tracking data were collected wirelessly. A Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) auction task was subsequently used to quantify the individual's willingness to pay (WTP) for each product. WTP was used to classify products into low, low medium, high medium and high economic value conditions. Eye movement related potentials (EMRP) were examined, and independent component analysis (ICA) was used to separate sources of activity from grand averaged EEG data. Four independent components (ICs) of EMRPs were modulated by WTP (i.e., SV) in the latency range of 150-250 ms. Of the four value-sensitive ICs, one IC displayed enhanced amplitude for all value conditions excluding low value, and another IC presented enhanced amplitude for low value products only. The remaining two value-sensitive ICs resolved inter-mediate levels of SV. Our study quantified, for the first time, the neural processes involved in economic value based decisions in a natural setting. Results suggest that multiple spatio-temporal brain activation patterns mediate the attention and aversion of products which could reflect an early valuation system. The EMRP parietal P200 component could reflect an attention allocation mechanism that separates the lowest-value products (IC7) from products of all other value (IC4), suggesting that low-value items are categorized early on as being aversive. While none of the ICs showed linear amplitude changes that parallel SV's of products, results suggest that a combination of multiple components may sub-serve a fine-grained resolution of the SV of products.

Simultaneous recordings of body movement and brain activity from highly skilled individuals as they demonstrate their exceptional skills in real-world settings, can shed new light on the neurobehavioural structure of human expertise. Driving is a real-world skill which many of us acquire to different levels of expertise. Here we ran a case-study on a subject with the highest level of driving expertise-a Formula E Champion. We studied the driver's neural and motor patterns while he drove a sports car on the "Top Gear" race track under extreme conditions (high speed, low visibility, low temperature, wet track). His brain activity, eye movements and hand/foot movements were recorded. Brain activity in the delta, alpha, and beta frequency bands showed causal relation to hand movements. We herein demonstrate the feasibility of using mobile brain and body imaging even in very extreme conditions (race car driving) to study the sensory inputs, motor outputs, and brain states which characterise complex human skills.

In particular, the use of laboratory-based experiments in which stimuli are artificial, and response options are fixed, inevitably results in findings that are less ecologically valid in relation to real-world behavior. In the present review we highlight the opportunities provided by a range of new mobile technologies that allow traditionally lab-bound measurements to now be collected during natural interactions with the world. We begin by outlining the theoretical support that mobile approaches receive from the development of embodied accounts of cognition, and we review the widening evidence that illustrates the importance of examining cognitive processes in their context. As we acknowledge, in practice, the development of mobile approaches brings with it fresh challenges, and will undoubtedly require innovation in paradigm design and analysis. If successful, however, the mobile cognition approach will offer novel insights in a range of areas, including understanding the cognitive processes underlying navigation through space and the role of attention during natural behavior. We argue that the development of real world mobile cognition offers both increased ecological validity, and the opportunity to examine the interactions between perception, cognition and action rather than examining each in isolation.

J	Hazra, S; Pratap, AA; Agrawal, O; Nandy, A				Hazra, Sumit; Pratap, Acharya Aditya; Agrawal, Oshin; Nandy, Anup			On effective cognitive state classification using novel feature extraction strategies	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						Gammatone cepstrum coefficient (GTCC); Probabilistic neural network (P-NN); EEG (Electroencephalogram); Discrete wavelet transformation (DWT); Fisher discriminant ratio (FDR)	NEURAL-NETWORK; EEG; DIMENSION; SELECTION; SIGNALS	Investigating new features for human cognitive state classification is an intiguing area of research with Electroencephalography (EEG) based signal analysis. We plan to develop a cost-effective system for cognitive state classification using ambulatory EEG signals. A novel event driven environment is created using external stimuli for capturing EEG data using a 14-channel Emotiv neuro-headset. A new feature extraction method, Gammatone Cepstrum Coefficients (GTCC) is introduced for ambulatory EEG signal analysis. The efficacy of this technique is compared with other feature extraction methods such as Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) using statistical metrics such as Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR) and Logistic Regression (LR). We obtain higher values for GTCC features, demonstrating its discriminative power during classification. A superior performance is achieved for the EEG dataset with a novel ensemble feature space comprising of GTCC and MFCC. Furthermore, the ensemble feature sets are passed through a proposed 1D Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) model to extract novel features. Various classification models like Probabilistic neural network (P-NN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Multi-Class Support Vector Machine (MCSVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) are employed to observe best accuracy on extracted features. The proposed GTCC, (GTCC+MFCC) & (GTCC +MFCC +CNN) features outperform the state-of-the-art techniques for all cases in our work. With GTCC+MFCC feature space and GTCC+MFCC+CNN features, accuracies of 96.42% and 96.14% are attained with the DCGAN classifier. Higher classification accuracies of the proposed system makes it a cynosure in the field of cognitive science.

Home PSG is more affordable, but applying conventional electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes increases its overall complexity and lowers the availability. Simple, self-administered single-channel EEG monitors on the other hand suffer from poor reliability. In this study, we aimed to quantify the reliability of self-administrated home PSG recordings conducted with a newly designed ambulatory electrode set (AES) that enables multichannel EEG, electrooculography, electromyography, and electrocardiography recordings. We assessed the sleep study success rate and technical quality of the recordings performed in subjects with possible sleep bruxism (SB). Thirty-two females and five males aged 39.6 +/- 11.6 years (mean +/- SD) with self-reported SB were recruited in the study. Self-administrated home PSG recordings with two AES designs were conducted (n = 19 and 21). The technical quality of the recordings was graded based on the proportion of interpretable data. Technical failure rate for AES (both designs) was 5% and SB was scorable for 96.9% of all recorded data. Only one recording failed due to mistakes in self-applying the AES. We found that the proportion of good quality self-administrated EEG recordings is significantly higher when multiple channels are used compared to using a single channel. Sleep study success rates and proportion of recordings with high quality interpretable data from EEG channels of AES were comparable to that of conventional home PSG. Self-applicable AES has potential to become a reliable tool for widely available home PSG.

Ear-EEG detects ictal and interictal abnormalities in focal and generalized epilepsy - A comparison with scalp EEG monitoring	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Long-term monitoring; Mobile EEG; Temporal lobe epilepsy; Wearable EEG; Ear-EEG; Ultra-long term monitoring	OUTPATIENT AMBULATORY EEG; SEIZURES; SPIKES	Objective: Ear-EEG is recording of electroencephalography from a small device in the ear. This is the first study to compare ictal and interictal abnormalities recorded with ear-EEG and simultaneous scalp-EEG in an epilepsy monitoring unit.& para;& para;Methods: We recorded and compared simultaneous ear-EEG and scalp-EEG from 15 patients with suspected temporal lobe epilepsy. EEGs were compared visually by independent neurophysiologists. Correlation and time-frequency analysis was used to quantify the similarity between ear and scalp electrodes. Spike-averages were used to assess similarity of interictal spikes.& para;& para;Results: There were no differences in sensitivity or specificity for seizure detection. Mean correlation coefficient between ear-EEG and nearest scalp electrode was above 0.6 with a statistically significant decreasing trend with increasing distance away from the ear. Ictal morphology and frequency dynamics can be observed from visual inspection and time-frequency analysis. Spike averages derived from ear-EEG electrodes yield a recognizable spike appearance.& para;& para;Conclusions: Our results suggest that ear-EEG can reliably detect electroencephalographic patterns associated with focal temporal lobe seizures. Interictal spike morphology from sufficiently large temporal spike sources can be sampled using ear-EEG.& para;& para;Significance: Ear-EEG is likely to become an important tool in clinical epilepsy monitoring and diagnosis.

The data were collected from 32-channel scalp-EEG, 14-channel ear-EEG, 4-channel electrooculography, and 9-channel inertial measurement units placed at the forehead, left ankle, and right ankle. The recording conditions were as follows: standing, slow walking, fast walking, and slight running at speeds of 0, 0.8, 1.6, and 2.0 m/s, respectively. For each speed, two different BCI paradigms, event-related potential and steady-state visual evoked potential, were recorded. To evaluate the signal quality, scalp- and ear-EEG data were qualitatively and quantitatively validated during each speed. We believe that the dataset will facilitate BCIs in diverse mobile environments to analyze brain activities and evaluate the performance quantitatively for expanding the use of practical BCIs.

While non-invasive methodologies are safer, cheaper and vastly more accessible technologies, signals suffer from either poor resolution in the space domain (EEG) or the temporal domain (BOLD signal of functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy, fNIRS). The non-invasive BCI decoding of bimanual force generation and the continuous force signal has not been realised before and so we introduce an isometric grip force tracking task to evaluate the decoding. We find that combining EEG and fNIRS using deep neural networks works better than linear models to decode continuous grip force modulations produced by the left and the right hand. Our multi-modal deep learning decoder achieves 55.2 FVAF[%] in force reconstruction and improves the decoding performance by at least 15% over each individual modality. Our results show a way to achieve continuous hand force decoding using cortical signals obtained with non-invasive mobile brain imaging has immediate impact for rehabilitation, restoration and consumer applications.

Over the years, the main underlying mechanisms have been partially unveiled thanks to standard functional neuroimaging techniques as well as electroencephalography (EEG). However, a complete picture is still lacking to date, due to particularly challenging experimental difficulties arising on top of the inherent complexity of the involved mechanisms. In this context, the aim of this study was to investigate the EEG dynamics associated to the production of voluntary rhythmic foot movements only. We used an experimental protocol limiting drastically the presence of movement artifacts in the EEG signals compared to real walk on a treadmill. A time-frequency analysis was performed, based on a time-warping method allowing an ensemble averaging of the data of 3 subjects. Characteristic alternation of power increases and decreases in the alpha, beta and gamma bands during the movement cycle is demonstrated as well as the emergence of two different neural coordination schemes related to in-phase and anti-phase foot movements.

In this paper, we present a new application of RMRobots for improving human spatial ability which plays a significant role in developing an individual's performance and achievement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Two user studies are conducted, and the results show that: 1) the task performance of interacting with RMRobots has a significant positive relationship with mental rotation, a widely used measure of spatial ability; and 2) interacting with RMRobots can effectively improve the performance on a task related to spatial reasoning skills according to behavioral data and electroencephalograph (EEG) indices. Our presented study broadens RMRobot research in the area of human-robot interaction.

More Reliable EEG Electrode Digitizing Methods Can Reduce Source Estimation Uncertainty, but Current Methods Already Accurately Identify Brodmann Areas	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electrocortical dynamics; electrode position; 3D scanning; source localization; spatial accuracy; independent component analysis (ICA); mobile brain; body imaging (MoBI)	HIGH-DENSITY EEG; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; SYSTEM; MODEL; PHOTOGRAMMETRY; RESOLUTION; ERRORS	Electroencephalography (EEG) and source estimation can be used to identify brain areas activated during a task, which could offer greater insight on cortical dynamics. Source estimation requires knowledge of the locations of the EEG electrodes. This could be provided with a template or obtained by digitizing the EEG electrode locations. Operator skill and inherent uncertainties of a digitizing system likely produce a range of digitization reliabilities, which could affect source estimation and the interpretation of the estimated source locations. Here, we compared the reliabilities of five digitizing methods (ultrasound, structured-light 3D scan, infrared 3D scan, motion capture probe, and motion capture) and determined the relationship between digitization reliability and source estimation uncertainty, assuming other contributors to source estimation uncertainty were constant. We digitized a mannequin head using each method five times and quantified the reliability and validity of each method. We created five hundred sets of electrode locations based on our reliability results and applied a dipole fitting algorithm (DIPFIT) to perform source estimation. The motion capture method, which recorded the locations of markers placed directly on the electrodes had the best reliability with an average electrode variability of 0.001 cm. Then, in order of decreasing reliability were the method using a digitizing probe in the motion capture system, an infrared 3D scanner, a structured-light 3D scanner, and an ultrasound digitization system. Unsurprisingly, uncertainty of the estimated source locations increased with greater variability of EEG electrode locations and less reliable digitizing systems. If EEG electrode location variability was similar to 1 cm, a single source could shift by as much as 2 cm. To help translate these distances into practical terms, we quantified Brodmann area accuracy for each digitizing method and found that the average Brodmann area accuracy for all digitizing methods was >80%. Using a template of electrode locations reduced the Brodmann area accuracy to similar to 50%. Overall, more reliable digitizing methods can reduce source estimation uncertainty, but the significance of the source estimation uncertainty depends on the desired spatial resolution. For accurate Brodmann area identification, any of the digitizing methods tested can be used confidently.

Prior BMI efforts based on scalp electroencephalography (EEG) have revealed that fluctuations in the amplitude of slow cortical potentials in the delta band contain information that can be used to infer motor intent, and more specifically, the kinematics of walking and non-locomotive tasks such as sitting and standing. However, little is known about the extent to which EEG can be used to discern the expressive qualities that influence such functional movements. Here, we discuss how novel experimental approaches integrated with machine learning techniques can deployed to decode expressive qualities of movement. Applications to artistic brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), movement aesthetics, and gait neuroprostheses endowed with expressive qualities aloe discussed.

An ethnographic pre/post study was conducted in a habituated naturalistic setting, combining qualitative and quantitative methods with four single case studies. Physiological results were gained with a mobile bedside EEG imaging machine in an authentic setting of the consumer's life-world. Results represent explorative data of participants' spontaneous EEG-activity, referable to results of psychological and medical studies. Increasing Alpha-signal strength in parietal association cortex and significant Theta band changes in temporal and on Alpha in occipital areas seem to represent an intraindividual constant EEG correlate of temporarily intensified attention ("high"), resulting in an altered music perception by hyperfocusing on acoustic space and broadened insight into the "space between the notes." THC has a measurable influence on cerebral music processing and seems to enhance acoustic perception temporarily.

Real-Time Hybrid Ocular Artifact Detection and Removal for Single Channel EEG	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRO/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (EIT)	International Conference on Electro Information Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRO/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (EIT)	MAY 21-23, 2015	Dekalb, IL	IEEE		Algebraic Method; Electroencephalograph (EEG); Ocular Artifact; Online removal; Wavelet Transform		Electroencephalography (EEG) is a promising technique to record brain activities in natural settings. However, EEG signals are usually contaminated by Ocular Artifacts (OA) such as eye blink activities. Removal of OA is critical to obtain clean EEG signals required for the feature extraction and classification. With the increasing interest in wearable technologies, single channel EEG systems are becoming more prevalent. Such ambulatory devices require real-time signal processing for immediate feedback. This paper presents a hybrid algorithm to detect and remove OA from single channel EEG signal using NeuroMonitor hardware platform. The algorithm first detects the eye blinks (OA zone) using Algebraic approach, and then removes artifact from OA zone using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) decomposition method. De-noising technique is applied only to the OA zone to keep the critical neural information intact. The OA removal algorithm is applied to the online data for 0.5 sec epoch length. The performance evaluation is carried out qualitatively and quantitatively using time-frequency analysis, mean square coherence and other statistical parameters, i.e. Correlation Coefficient and Mutual Information. Processing time for DWT was significantly lower (x25) to that of SWT. This proposed hybrid OA removal algorithm demonstrates real-time execution with sufficient accuracy.

We examined a consecutive sample of 72 individuals who had undergone 32-channel paEEG immediately after an rEEG, creating perfectly matched EEG samples. Each recording was prospectively assessed for epileptiform discharges (ED) and nonepileptiform abnormalities. The median paEEG duration was 22.5 hours (interquartile range: 22.0-23.0). The sensitivity of paEEG was 2.23 times greater than that of rEEG [sensitivity ratio: 2.23 (95% CI = 1.49-3.34)] if a positive test was limited to the presence of epileptiform discharges. This benefit of paEEG versus rEEG was no longer evident if the definition of a positive test included nonepileptiform abnormalities (sensitivity ratio 1.26; 95% CI = 1.02-1.55). The specificity of the 2 tests was not evidently different (specificity ratio 0.67; 95% CI = 0.17-2.67). Twenty-six percent of paEEG recorded epileptic seizures while none of the rEEG did (absolute difference 26.0% (95% CI = 11.8-40.2). Our findings quantify the benefit of 32-channel paEEG, relative to rEEG, and support its role in the diagnosis and characterization of epilepsy.

Moreover, the spectral characteristics of cortical activity showed significant differences in different walking conditions. However, whether brain connectivity presents a significant difference during rats walking under different behavior conditions has yet to be verified. Similarly, whether brain connectivity can be used in locomotion detection remains unknown. To address those concerns, we recorded locomotion and implanted electroencephalography signals in freely moving rats performing two kinds of task conditions (upslope and downslope walking). The Granger causality method was used to determine brain functional directed connectivity in rats during these processes. Machine learning algorithms were then used to categorize the two walking states, based on functional directed connectivity. We found significant differences in brain functional directed connectivity varied between upslope and downslope walking. Moreover, locomotion detection based on brain connectivity achieved the highest accuracy (91.45%), sensitivity (90.93%), specificity (91.3%), and F1-score (91.43%). Specifically, the classification results indicated that connectivity features in the high gamma band contained the most discriminative information with respect to locomotion detection in rats, with the support vector machine classifier exhibiting the most efficient performance. Our study not only suggests that brain functional directed connectivity in rats showed significant differences in various behavioral contexts but also proposed a method for classifying the locomotion states of rat walking, based on brain functional directed connectivity. These findings elucidate the characteristics of neural information interaction between various cortical areas in freely walking rats.

Ambulatory electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring allows for long-term, mobile electroencephalographic recordings of patients. This study aims to describe and analyze the results obtained with ambulatory EEG in our clinical practice. Methods. We have analyzed the results of 264 ambulatory EEG records, grouped according to the reason for the request: a) group 1: diagnostic evaluation of episodes of epileptic nature; b) group 2: diagnostic evaluation of paroxysmal episodes, and c) group 3: evaluation of the risk of relapse during anti-seizure treatment withdrawal in certain epileptic patients. Results. a) Group 1 (n = 137): normal results were found in 54 records (39.4%). There was generalized epileptic activity in 20 (14.6%) of them (5 with ictal activity) and focal epileptic activity was detected in 57 cases (42%) (8 with ictal activity). No EEG diagnosis could be reached in 6 (4%) recordings due to the presence of artefacts; b) group 2 (n = 99): in 47 records (47.5%), there were no episodes and the Holter-EEG was normal. There was a clinically documented episode without anomalies during Holter-EEG registration in 14 cases (14.2%). In 29 records (29.3%), focal epileptic activity was recorded (ictal 4) and generalized epileptic activity (ictal in 1) was recorded in 4 patients (4%). No EEG diagnosis could be reached in 5 cases (5%), and c) group 3 (n = 28): the study was normal in 15 cases (53.6%) and showed focal interictal epileptic activity in 8 (28.6%) and generalized interictal epileptic activity in 5 of them (17.8%). Conclusion. We believe that the ambulatory EEG recordings in correctly selected cases can provide important additional information regarding global assessment of patients with epilepsy.

The value of home video with ambulatory EEG: A prospective service review	SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY			English	Article						Ambulatory EEG; Video telemetry; Video-EEG; Seizure; Epilepsy	UTILITY	Purpose: The demand for long term EEG monitoring is increasing with the emphasis on recording patients' attacks. Outpatient ambulatory EEG is relatively inexpensive and widely available. The main disadvantage of the technique is the lack of video which can make interpretation of an ictus difficult. We investigated whether patients, if offered home video equipment, would take it, if this resulted in simultaneous EEG-video capture of an ictus and if interpretation of the recording was facilitated by the video. Method: All ambulatory EEG patients, adults and children, were offered a camcorder to take home during a 17-month study period. Results: 130 patients/carers were offered a camcorder (93 adults, 37 children), 45 patients (35%) accepted; the main reason for not accepting was that attacks were considered too brief to record. An ictal event occurred in 34 patients (76%) with a camcorder; in 17 (50%) of these an attack was captured successfully on video. The main reasons for failure to capture events were that attacks were too brief, or that the camcorder was not operated successfully. Attacks were captured with greater success in children (14/23, 61%) than adults (3/11, 27%). Of the 17 video recordings, 14(82%) were helpful in aiding interpretation of the ambulatory EEG. Conclusion: In our study, home video facilities aided interpretation of ambulatory EEG recordings in approximately one third of patients. Technological advances and familiarity with portable recording devices will improve this figure and patients and their carers should be encouraged to use such facilities when available.

J	van der Ree, M; Wijnberg, I				van der Ree, Marleen; Wijnberg, Inge			A review on epilepsy in the horse and the potential of Ambulatory EEG as a diagnostic tool	VETERINARY QUARTERLY			English	Review						equine; seizures; neurophysiology; electroencephalogram; intracranial pathology	QUANTITATIVE CHARACTERISTICS; CASSETTE EEG; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; SLEEP; SEIZURES; CHILDREN	Epilepsy in the horse is diagnosed based on clinical signs, but diagnosing can be difficult if a grand mal is not present. The future prospects of the horse and potentially the safety of the owner depend on an accurate diagnosis. This review presents information on epilepsy and focuses on the diagnostic potential of (Ambulatory) electroencephalography ((A) EEG). An epileptic seizure is a brain disorder, which expresses itself as a recurrent episode of involuntary abnormal behaviour. The aetiology can originate from inside or outside the brain or is idiopathic. Besides those categories, seizures can be classified as generalised or partial. A typical generalised tonicclonic seizure is characterised by the prodrome, the ictus and the post-ictal phase. EEG is the graphic recording of rhythmic bioelectric activity which originates predominantly from the cerebral cortex. In human medicine, the 10/20 international basis system for electrode placement is used. This makes comparison more reliable and consistent. The normal human brainwaves recorded are alpha, beta, theta and delta waves. In the horse, fewer descriptions of normal signals are available. In humans suffering from epilepsy, spikes, complexes, spike-and-wave discharges and rhythmical multi-spike activity are seen. In horses suffering from epilepsy, spikes, sharp waves and spike-and-wave discharges are seen. In humans, AEEG has numerous advantages above short-duration EEG in diagnosing epilepsy or intracranial pathology. In future, AEEG might be useful to record brain signals in awake horses expressing their behaviour under natural circumstances.

Genetic factors may play a significant role in the frequency of epilepsy, yet the frequency in normal age-matched controls is unknown. We studied overnight ambulatory electroencephalograms (EEGs) in 12 nonepileptic, nonautistic children with a sibling with both ASDs and an abnormal EEG. EEG studies were read and described independently by two pediatric epileptologists; 10 were normal Studies and 2 were abnormal. The Occurrence of abnormal EEGs in our sample (16.6%,) was lower than the reported occurrence in children with ASDs. Further, the two abnormal EEGs were of types typically found in childhood and were different from those found in the ASD-affected siblings. The lack of similarity between sibling EEGs suggests that genetic factors alone do not explain the higher frequency of EEG abnormalities reported in ASDs. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Wireless Electroencephalography (EEG) to Monitor Sleep Among Patients Being Withdrawn From Opioids: Evidence of Feasibility and Utility	EXPERIMENTAL AND CLINICAL PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						opioid; withdrawal; sleep; EEG; buprenorphine	ACUTE HEROIN ABSTINENCE; CHRONIC MORPHINE; METHADONE; PAIN; DISTURBANCES; INDIVIDUALS; DISORDERS; FREQUENCY; DURATION; WAKING	Public Health Significance Many people who are withdrawing off of opioids experience severe and clinically significant levels of sleep impairment and insomnia. In order to learn more about sleep impairment and appropriate treatment strategies, we must identify comfortable and precise ways to measure sleep in patients experiencing withdrawal. This study provides initial evidence that a commercially available, wireless, ambulatory EEG sleep monitor was accepted by patients and provided information that was more closely associated with measures of withdrawal than a standard sleep diary. Sleep impairment is a common comorbid and debilitating symptom for persons with opioid use disorder (OUD). Research into underlying mechanisms and efficacious treatment interventions for OUD-related sleep problems requires both precise and physiologic measurements of sleep-related outcomes and impairment. This pilot examined the feasibility of a wireless sleep electroencephalography (EEG) monitor (Sleep Profiler (TM)) to measure sleep outcomes and architecture among participants undergoing supervised opioid withdrawal. Sleep outcomes were compared to a self-reported sleep diary and opioid withdrawal ratings. Participants (n = 8, 100% male) wore the wireless EEG 85.6% of scheduled nights. Wireless EEG detected measures of sleep architecture including changes in total, NREM and REM sleep time during study phases, whereas the diary detected changes in wakefulness only. Direct comparisons of five overlapping outcomes revealed lower sleep efficiency and sleep onset latency and higher awakenings and time spent awake from the wireless EEG versus sleep diary. Associations were evident between wireless EEG and increased withdrawal severity, lower sleep efficiency, less time in REM and non-REM stages 1 and 2, and more hydroxyzine treatment; sleep diary was associated with total sleep time and withdrawal only. Data provide initial evidence that a wireless EEG is a feasible and useful tool for objective monitoring of sleep in persons experiencing acute opioid withdrawal. Data are limited by the small and exclusively male sample, but provide a foundation for using wireless EEG sleep monitors for objective evaluation of sleep-related impairment in persons with OUD in support of mechanistic and treatment intervention research.

In this article, we review our developments in this area and put them into perspective. These examples cover a wide range of maturity levels with respect to their applicability. While we assume we are still a long way away from integrating Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology in general interaction with computers, or from implementing neurotechnological measures in safety-critical workplaces, results have already now been obtained involving a BCI as research tool.

Though gait impairments in Parkinson's disease have been extensively described in terms of spatiotemporal gait parameters, little is known regarding associated patterns of cortical activity. The objective of the present study is to test if interhemispheric synchronization differs between participants with PD and healthy elderly controls (NPD). We analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded during bilateral movements, i.e., locomotion and hand tapping. Methods: Fifteen participants with PD ('OFF' their anti-parkinsonian medications) and eight NPD were assessed during quiet standing, straight-line walking, turning, and hand tapping tasks. Using a 32-electrode EEG array, we quantified the synchronization in periodic cortical activation between the brain hemispheres (interhemispheric phase synchronization; inter-PS). Theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands were evaluated. Results: In all bands, inter-PS was significantly higher for the PD group as compared with the NPD group during standing and walking (p < 0.001) and during bimanual tasks (p = 0.026). Conclusions: Persons with PD exhibit increased inter-PS as compared with NPD participants. These findings support previous evidence from animal studies, that bilateral cortical hypersynchronization emerges from the asymmetric neural degeneration that is at the base of the disease. Future studies should elucidate the long-term temporal development of this hypersynchronization and its clinical relevance (e.g., can it 'serve' as prodromal marker?).

One such research field is related to epilepsy. The EEG based methods are not will designed for pre-occurrence recognition scheme to detect and predict partial seizure for epileptic patients. The system even becomes more complicated if the detection system is to be designed for ubiquitous operations, for the identification of people with seizure disabilities. In this case, the patients are not restricted to the clinical environment in which many devices are involved to the patient externally while he/she can continue daily activities. This paper demonstrates a classification method by using Fuzzy Logic System to identify, predict the Partial Seizure from Epileptic data. Here the paper shows preliminary results of the normal state, pre-seizure state and seizure state of the subject's brain signal data. This can be observed and the algorithm with the detection structure can produce cautioning signals for epileptic seizure.

Electroencephalographic recordings of physiological activity of the sheep cerebral cortex	POLISH JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCES			English	Article						brain; electroencephalography; sheep	STIMULATION; RESPONSES; SYSTEM; DOGS	This paper presents the physiological activity of the cerebral cortex in sheep in electroencephalographic findings. The study was performed to evaluate and improve understanding of brain monitoring methods in freely moving animals without the use of any anaesthetic methods during the acquisition stage. The aim of the study was to determine the physiological activity of the cerebral cortex in animals in a sheep model (using clinically healthy Polish Merino rams, aged 1 yr.) to determine its clinical EEG protocol. The EEG was registered using an in-lab EEG device as well as ambulatory systems (Holter EEG). The bioelectrical activity of the sheep cerebral cortex was recorded using gold disc and needle electrodes placed on experimentally determined locations on the scalp. The main finding of this study was the rhythmic EEG activity of the sheep brain in wakeful and conscious states (eyes open). The rhythm was bilaterally synchronous and determined a basic pattern in the registration of physiological activity of the cerebral cortex. The acquired rhythm may correspond to the theta rhythm in humans, which is a normal activity controlled by the hippocampus. This background activity comprised intermittent episodic slow waves and synchronous beta waves.

Motion and Muscle Artifact Removal Validation Using an Electrical Head Phantom, Robotic Motion Platform, and Dual Layer Mobile EEG	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Muscles; Electroencephalography; Phantoms; Magnetic heads; Neck; Robot sensing systems; Correlation; Electroencephalography; head phantom; motion artifacts; muscle artifacts; signal processing	ELECTROCORTICAL ACTIVITY; WALKING; TOOLBOX; LEVEL; PHASE	Motion and muscle artifacts can undermine signal quality in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during locomotion. We evaluated approaches for recovering ground-truth artificial brain signals from noisy EEG recordings. We built an electrical head phantom that broadcast four brain and four muscle sources. Head movements were generated by a robotic motion platform. We recorded 128-channel dual layer EEG and 8-channel neck electromyography (EMG) from the head phantom during motion. We evaluated ground-truth electrocortical source signal recovery from artifact contaminated data using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to determine: (1) the number of isolated noise sensor recordings needed to capture and remove motion artifacts, (2) the ability of Artifact Subspace Reconstruction to remove motion and muscle artifacts at contrasting artifact detection thresholds, (3) the number of neck EMG sensor recordings needed to capture and remove muscle artifacts, and (4) the ability of Canonical Correlation Analysis to remove muscle artifacts. We also evaluated source signal recovery by combining the best practices identified in aims 1-4. By including isolated noise and EMG recordings in the ICA decomposition, we more effectively recovered ground-truth artificial brain signals. A reduced subset of 32-noise and 6-EMG channels showed equivalent performance compared to including the complete arrays. Artifact Subspace Reconstruction improved source separation, but this was contingent on muscle activity amplitude. Canonical Correlation Analysis also improved source separation. Merging noise and EMG recordings into the ICA decomposition, with Artifact Subspace Reconstruction and Canonical Correlation Analysis preprocessing, improved source signal recovery. This study expands on previous head phantom experiments by including neck muscle source activity and evaluating artificial electrocortical spectral power fluctuations synchronized with gait events.

He developed myoclonic seizures at the age of 4 years, which manifested as head shaking to the left. Approximately 6 months later, narcolepsy-cataplexy with excessive daytime sleepiness occurred. Although a short-time electroencephalography (EEG) and 24-hour ambulatory EEG monitoring found epileptiform discharges, no seizures were determined. Oxcarbazepine was used and led to increased attacks. Video EEG testing finally confirmed the diagnosis of epilepsy; therefore, valproate was given and seizures were controlled completely. Typical cataplexy triggered by laughing, together with the positive multiple sleep latency tests confirmed a diagnosis of narcolepsy-cataplexy. Human leukocyte antigens DQB1*0602 was positive, and the hypocretin level in cerebrospinal fluid was found to be decreased. Combination of valproate, methylphenidate, and clomipramine treatment improved the symptoms of both narcolepsy-cataplexy and seizure. The coexistence of both disorders in this single patient indicated that there might be a common mechanism between epilepsy and narcolepsy-cataplexy.

Recordings were obtained using a novel implantable device wirelessly linked to an external, portable real-time processing unit. We demonstrate previously uncharacterized intracranial seizure onset patterns in these animals that are strikingly similar in appearance to human partial onset epilepsy. We propose: (1) canine epilepsy as an appropriate model for testing human antiepileptic devices and new approaches to epilepsy surgery, and (2) this new technology as a versatile platform for evaluating seizures and response to therapy in the natural, ambulatory setting.

A new era in electroencephalographic monitoring? Subscalp devices for ultra-long-term recordings	EPILEPSIA			English	Review						automatic seizure detection; chronotherapy; circadian rhythm; epilepsy monitoring and recording; subcutaneous EEG	SUBDERMAL WIRE ELECTRODES; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; SEIZURE DETECTION; EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; AMBULATORY EEG; PREDICTION; COMPLICATIONS; SYSTEMS; VIEWS; VIDEO	Inaccurate subjective seizure counting poses treatment and diagnostic challenges and thus suboptimal quality in epilepsy management. The limitations of existing hospital- and home-based monitoring solutions are motivating the development of minimally invasive, subscalp, implantable electroencephalography (EEG) systems with accompanying cloud-based software. This new generation of ultra-long-term brain monitoring systems is setting expectations for a sea change in the field of clinical epilepsy. From definitive diagnoses and reliable seizure logs to treatment optimization and presurgical seizure foci localization, the clinical need for continuous monitoring of brain electrophysiological activity in epilepsy patients is evident. This paper presents the converging solutions developed independently by researchers and organizations working at the forefront of next generation EEG monitoring. The immediate value of these devices is discussed as well as the potential drivers and hurdles to adoption. Additionally, this paper discusses what the expected value of ultra-long-term EEG data might be in the future with respect to alarms for especially focal seizures, seizure forecasting, and treatment personalization.

Ambulatory systems require low power consumption and offer a significant reduction of the patient's incommodity during the EEG signal monitoring process. Hardware/Software co-design techniques were applied during the design of the EEG signal compression subsystem. A methodology for evaluating the efficiency of the hardware/software partitioning was applied to optimize the power consumption and to minimize the complexity of the hardware portion of the algorithm. The results show a significant reduction in the total execution time of the compression algorithm and a moderate reduction on the power consumption of the subsystem.

Most of these investigations have focused on the upper body. Only few studies consider gait because of the difficulty of recording EEG during gross movements. However, for stroke patients the rehabilitation of gait is of crucial importance. Therefore, this study investigates if a BCI can be based on walking related desynchronization features. Furthermore, the influence of complexity of the walking movements on the classification performance is investigated. Two BCI experiments were conducted in which healthy subjects performed a cued walking task, a more complex walking task (backward or adaptive walking), and imagination of the same tasks. EEG data during these tasks was classified into walking and no-walking. The results from both experiments show that despite the automaticity of walking and recording difficulties, brain signals related to walking could be classified rapidly and reliably. Classification performance was higher for actual walking movements than for imagined walking movements. There was no significant increase in classification performance for both the backward and adaptive walking tasks compared with the cued walking tasks. These results are promising for developing a BCI for the rehabilitation of gait.

Home video telemetry in children: A comparison to inpatient video telemetry	SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY			English	Article						Epilepsy; Seizure; Paediatric; Telemetry; EEG	AMBULATORY EEG; EPILEPSY; UTILITY; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; RECOMMENDATIONS; UK	Purpose: Home Video Telemetry (HVT) combines ambulatory EEG with simultaneous video recording. No previous reports have compared HVT and inpatient video telemetry (IVT) in a purely paediatric population. This study compares HVT and IVT in this group in terms of diagnostic efficacy, recording quality and acceptability to parents/carers. Methods: 33 HVT and 29 IVT patients aged 1-17 years were included. Information regarding patient demographics, ictal capture, diagnostic utility, recording quality (e.g. video clarity, EEG artefacts) and parent/carer preferences was documented. Difficulties using HVT equipment were recorded. Results: 62% of IVT patients and 64% of HVT patients had typical attacks during the recording. 59% of IVT and 70% of HVT recordings were considered to have answered the referral question. Study quality was similar in both groups. In HVT studies the rate of equipment difficulties was 52%; problems included camera positioning and failure to turn on the infrared button at night. Diagnostic information was lost in 15% of patients. 76% of parents/carers of HVT patients would choose this investigation again. Conclusions: The diagnostic efficacy and study quality of HVT and IVT are similar in paediatric patients. HVT is acceptable to most parents/carers. User error may compromise the investigation in a minority of cases but did not impact on diagnostic utility. Adoption of HVT investigation could provide an accessible and economic alternative to IVT.

Electrocortical correlates of human level-ground, slope, and stair walking	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATOR; TREADMILL WALKING; ACTIVATION PATTERNS; POSTERIOR PARIETAL; BRAIN ACTIVATION; SPEED CONTROL; GAIT; EEG; LOCOMOTION; SYNCHRONIZATION	This study investigated electrocortical dynamics of human walking across different unconstrained walking conditions (i. e., level ground (LW), ramp ascent (RA), and stair ascent (SA)). Non-invasive active-electrode scalp electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded and a systematic EEG processing method was implemented to reduce artifacts. Source localization combined with independent component analysis and k-means clustering revealed the involvement of four clusters in the brain during the walking tasks: Left and Right Occipital Lobe (LOL, ROL), Posterior Parietal Cortex (PPC), and Central Sensorimotor Cortex (SMC). Results showed that the changes of spectral power in the PPC and SMC clusters were associated with the level of motor task demands. Specifically, we observed a and beta suppression at the beginning of the gait cycle in both SA and RA walking (relative to LW) in the SMC. Additionally, we observed significant beta rebound (synchronization) at the initial swing phase of the gait cycle, which may be indicative of active cortical signaling involved in maintaining the current locomotor state. An increase of low gamma band power in this cluster was also found in SA walking. In the PPC, the low. band power increased with the level of task demands (from LW to RA and SA). Additionally, our results provide evidence that electrocortical amplitude modulations (relative to average gait cycle) are correlated with the level of difficulty in locomotion tasks. Specifically, the modulations in the PPC shifted to higher frequency bands when the subjects walked in RA and SA conditions. Moreover, low. modulations in the central sensorimotor area were observed in the LW walking and shifted to lower frequency bands in RA and SA walking. These findings extend our understanding of cortical dynamics of human walking at different level of locomotion task demands and reinforces the growing body of literature supporting a shared-control paradigm between spinal and cortical networks during locomotion.

J	Hussain, I; Park, SJ				Hussain, Iqram; Park, Se Jin			HealthSOS: Real-Time Health Monitoring System for Stroke Prognostics	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Feature extraction; Monitoring; Stroke (medical condition); Electrodes; Biomedical monitoring; Sleep; Sensor systems and applications; brain&#8211; computer interfaces; neuroscience; biomedical monitoring	ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE; QUANTITATIVE EEG; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; DELTA/ALPHA RATIO; CARE	Electroencephalography (EEG) is immediate and sensitive to cortical impairment resulting from ischemic stroke and is considered as the potential predictive tool of stroke onset, and post-stroke clinical management. Brainwave monitoring outside the heavily equipped clinical environment demands a low-cost, portable, and wearable EEG system. This study aims to assess the feasibility of using an ambulatory EEG system to classify the stroke patient group with neurological changes due to ischemic stroke and the control healthy adult group. HealthSOS, a real-time health monitoring system for stroke prognostics, is proposed here, which consists of an eye-mask embedded portable EEG device, data analytics, and medical ontology based health advisor service. This system was investigated with 37 stroke patients (mean age 71.6 years, 61% male) admitted in the emergency unit of a hospital and 36 healthy elderly volunteers (mean age 76 years, 28% male). EEG was recorded in resting-state using the portable device with frontal cortical electrodes (Fp1, Fp2) embedded in an eye-mask within 120 h after the onset of symptoms of ischemic stroke (confirmed clinically). The EEG data acquisition of the left and right brain hemispheres was done for at least 15 minutes in the awake resting state while subjects laid down on the bed. The statistical result shows that the revised brain symmetry index (rsBSI), the delta-alpha ratio, and the delta-theta ratio of the stroke group differ significantly from those of the healthy control group. In the machine learning analysis, the support vector machine (SVM) model shows the highest accuracy (Overall accuracy: 92%) and the highest Gini coefficient (95%) in classification performance. This study will be useful for early stroke prognostics and the management of post-stroke treatment.

The system is composed of a spherical treadmill, a curved screen which covers almost completely the field of view of the mouse, a light-scattering mirror system, a DLP projector, a reward supplying system, and a virtual environment simulator. A mouse is set on the apex of the spherical treadmill under head-restrained condition and can freely move the sphere by its limbs. The field of view in the virtual environment is projected on the screen and updated in real time in response to the movement of the mouse. We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) signal from cerebral cortex of a mouse freely behaving in a virtual environment. It was found that the pattern of EEG changed over time and was strongly correlated with the behavior of the mouse in the virtual environment.

The Cycle of Daily Stress and Sleep: Sleep Measurement Matters	ANNALS OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Stress; Actigraphy; Sleep diary; Longitudinal; Repeated measures	DAILY-LIFE; REACTIVITY; EVENTS; HEALTH; VULNERABILITY; ASSOCIATIONS; PERFORMANCE; EXPERIENCES; DISRUPTION; ACTIGRAPHY	Background Disturbed sleep can be a cause and a consequence of elevated stress. Yet intensive longitudinal studies have revealed that sleep assessed via diaries and actigraphy is inconsistently associated with daily stress. Purpose We expanded this research by examining daily associations between sleep and stress using a threefold approach to assess sleep: sleep diaries, actigraphy, and ambulatory single-channel electroencephalography (EEG). Methods Participants were 80 adults (mean age = 32.65 years, 63% female) who completed 7 days of stressor and sleep assessments. Multilevel models were used to examine bidirectional associations between occurrence and severity of daily stress with diary-, actigraphy-, and EEG-determined sleep parameters (e.g., total sleep time [TST], sleep efficiency, and sleep onset latency, and wake after sleep onset [WASO]). Results Participants reported at least one stressor 37% of days. Days with a stressor were associated with a 14.4-min reduction in actigraphy-determined TST (beta = -0.24, p = 0.030), but not with other actigraphy, diary, or EEG sleep measures. Nights with greater sleep diary-determined WASO were associated with greater next-day stressor severity (beta = 0.01, p = 0.026); no other diary, actigraphy, or EEG sleep measures were associated with next-day stressor occurrence or severity. Conclusions Daily stress and sleep disturbances occurred in a bidirectional fashion, though specific results varied by sleep measurement technique and sleep parameter. Together, our results highlight that the type of sleep measurement matters for examining associations with daily stress. We urge future researchers to treat sleep diaries, actigraphy, and EEG as complementary-not redundant-sleep measurement approaches.

Seizure symptoms and ambulatory EEG findings: incidence of epileptiform discharges	EPILEPTIC DISORDERS			English	Article						EEG; seizure symptoms; ambulatory EEG; epileptiform discharges	DIAGNOSTIC-VALUE; EPILEPSY; YIELD	Aims. Ambulatory video-EEG monitoring has been utilized as a cost-effective alternative to inpatient video-EEG monitoring for non-surgical diagnostic evaluation of symptoms suggestive of epileptic seizures. We aimed to assess incidence of epileptiform discharges in ambulatory video-EEG recordings according to seizure symptom history obtained during clinical evaluation. Methods. This was a retrospective cohort study. We queried seizure symptoms from 9,221 consecutive ambulatory video-EEG studies in 35 states over one calendar year. We assessed incidence of epileptiform discharges for each symptom, including symptoms that conformed to a category heading, even if not included in the ILAE 2017 symptom list. We report incidences, odds ratios, and corresponding p values using Fisher's exact test and univariate logistic regression. We applied multivariable logistic regression to generate odds ratios for the six symptom categories that are controlled for the presence of other symptoms. Results. History that included motor symptoms (OR=1.53) or automatisms (OR=1.42) was associated with increased occurrence of epileptiform discharges, whereas history of sensory symptoms (OR=0.76) predicted lack of epileptiform discharges. Patient-reported symptoms that were associated with increased occurrence of epileptiform discharges included lip-smacking, moaning, verbal automatism, aggression, eye-blinking, deja vu, muscle pain, urinary incontinence, choking and jerking. On the other hand, auditory hallucination memory deficits, lightheadedness, syncope, giddiness, fibromyalgia and chronic pain predicted absence of epileptiform discharges. The majority of epileptiform discharges consisted only of interictal sharp waves or spikes. Conclusions. Our study shows that the use of ILAE 2017 symptom categories may help guide ambulatory video-EEG studies.

Sudden death in epilepsy recorded in ambulatory EEG	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY NEUROSURGERY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							UNEXPLAINED DEATH; APNEA	A woman with epilepsy died during a seizure and the event was recorded on ambulatory EEG. The circumstances were typical of sudden death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The EEG revealed that the patient had suffered a generalised seizure that abruptly ended with cessation of all cerebral electrical activity. Two other cases recorded on videotelemetry demonstrating similar EEG features were reported in the literature. We postulate that abrupt irreversible cerebral electrical shutdown during a seizure may be the primary mechanism of SUDEP.	[McLean, B.

The psychological and psychiatric sciences were early adopters of implementing these promising techniques into their research to better understand the human mind. The most often studied data to predict mental states and traits at the moment represent reaction-time and app usage data from multi-step human-smartphone interactions and digital footprints left from the user's interactions with social media platforms. Interestingly, research that links reaction time measurements and other digital footprints to underlying neurobiology data from magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, or molecular genetics has thus far been mostly lacking. As a starting point for discussion among neuroscientists, in this article, we review the scant literature applying digital phenotyping/mobile sensing to neuroscientific research and outline the potential of this new research approach. With the ubiquity of smartphones, many of these reviewed works focus on smartphone-based-studies in the neuroscientific digital phenotyping/mobile sensing field.

Ecological study of sleep disruption in PTSD - A pilot study	PSYCHOBIOLOGY OF POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER: A DECADE OF PROGRESS	ANNALS OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCES		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Meeting on Psychobiology of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder	SEP 11-13, 2005	New York, NY	New York Acad Sci		PTSD; sleep; in-home polysomnography	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER	Laboratory-based sleep studies have yielded inconsistent results regarding the presence and nature of objective sleep anomalies in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This pilot study aimed at assessing sleep in adult crime victims with PTSD by using in-home polysomnography. Compared to healthy archival subjects, PTSD subjects showed longer sleep latency, reduced total sleep time, and increased duration of nocturnal awakening. Quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) measures of delta and beta activity also differed in PTSD and healthy subjects. These preliminary findings suggest that ambulatory methods can capture objective signs of sleep disruption, and corroborate subjective complaints of disrupted sleep in PTSD.

Recently, gyroscopes have been identified as a useful modality for providing complementary information to the head movement artefact detection task. In this work, a comprehensive data fusion analysis is conducted to investigate how EEG and gyroscope signals can be most effectively combined to provide a more accurate detection of head-movement artefacts in the EEG. To this end, several methods of combining these physiological and physical signals at the feature, decision and score fusion levels are examined. Results show that combination at the feature, score and decision levels is successful in improving classifier performance when compared to individual EEG or gyroscope classifiers, thus confirming that EEG and gyroscope signals carry complementary information regarding the detection of head-movement artefacts in the EEG. Feature fusion and the score fusion using the sum-rule provided the greatest improvement in artefact detection. By extending multimodal head-movement artefact detection to the score and decision fusion domains, it is possible to implement multimodal artefact detection in environments where gyroscope signals are intermittently available.

Comparative Analysis of Wavelet Based Approaches for Reliable Removal of Ocular Artifacts from Single Channel EEG	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRO/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (EIT)	International Conference on Electro Information Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRO/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (EIT)	MAY 21-23, 2015	Dekalb, IL	IEEE		Electroencephalogram; Wavelet Transform; Ocular Artifact; Artifact Removal	COMPONENT ANALYSIS; DOMAIN	For biomedical and scientific fields, Electroencephalography (EEG) has turned out to be an important tool to understand, study, and utilize brain functionalities. To fully utilize EEG signals in real-life closed-loop applications, artifacts such as ocular must be removed. Wavelet transform is one of the powerful methods to remove ocular artifacts from single channel EEG devices. In this study, both stationary and discrete wavelet transforms (SWT and DWT, respectively) have been compared with various wavelet basis functions, such as sym3, haar, coif3, and bior4.4 using either universal threshold (UT) or statistical threshold (ST). Different combinations of wavelet transform techniques, mother wavelets, and thresholds are compared to identify an optimum combination for ocular artifact removal. Performance metrics like Correlation Coefficient (CC), Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE), Time Frequency Analysis, and execution time have been calculated for measuring the effectiveness of each combination. According to CC, DWT+UT combination turned out to be a good option for the ocular artifact removal. However, according to NMSE and time frequency analysis, SWT+ST has generated better performance in keeping neural segments of EEG unaffected. According to the measurement of execution times, DWT+ST is faster compared to other combinations. The study shows that wavelet transform is suitable in artifact removal from single channel EEG data to implement in ambulatory real-time EEG systems.

Prolonged EEG recording is used primarily for epilepsy monitoring, but LTM is also used in the intensive care unit, the operating room, and in the emergency department. The purpose of LTM is to expand the limited time sampling associated with shorter "routine" EEG recording. Audiovisual monitoring may also be used in conjunction with LTM to evaluate simultaneously a specific clinical behavior that may or may not be associated with EEG alteration. This is typically performed in a hospital setting for safety and ancillary testing purposes. LTM is used most frequently in the diagnosis and management of seizures and "spells." but has also gained wider application in the evaluation of sleep disorders, cerebrovascular disease, psychiatric conditions, and movement disorders. Computer-assisted LTM systems that process, analyze, compress, and store data digitally have become widely available in clinical practice both in the hospital as well as outside the hospital when the patient is ambulatory.

One prominent class of actions, the human locomotion, has been object of several studies, all focused on manipulating the shape of degraded human figures like point-light walker (PLW) stimuli, represented as walking on the spot. Nevertheless, since the main goal of the locomotor function is to displace the whole body from one position to the other, these stimuli might not fully represent a goal-directed action and thus might not be able to induce the same motor resonance mechanism expected when observing a natural locomotion. To explore this hypothesis, we recorded the event-related potentials (ERP) of canonical/scrambled and translating/centered PLWs decoding. We individuated a novel ERP component (N2c) over central electrodes, around 435 ms after stimulus onset, for translating compared to centered PLW, only when the canonical shape was preserved. Consistently with our hypothesis, sources analysis associated this component to the activation of trunk and lower legs primary sensory-motor and supplementary motor areas. These results confirm the role of own motor repertoire in processing human action and suggest that ERP can detect the associated motor resonance only when the human figure is explicitly involved in performing a meaningful action.

Quantifying Cognitive Load using EEG during Ambulation and Postural Tasks	42ND ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY: ENABLING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR GLOBAL HEALTHCARE EMBC'20	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	42nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 20-24, 2020	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			ATTENTIONAL DEMANDS; WALKING; COST	Cognitive load may be an important outcome measure for the effectiveness of assistive devices such as prostheses and exoskeletons, but cognitive load is not adequately assessed in part due to the indirect physiological measures traditionally used for evaluation. Robust, direct measures are now available through mobile electroencephalography (EEG), but there are no standard protocols for measuring cognitive load during ambulatory and postural activities. Here we provide a proof-of-concept protocol for measuring cognitive load using an auditory oddball cognitive task to elicit P3 event-related potentials (ERP) during three tasks: sitting, standing, and walking on a treadmill. Our results show that this protocol successfully elicited P3 in each task, with as little as 5 minutes of data collection per task. We found a difference in P3 during sitting and walking after approximately 30 minutes of task completion, indicating that the cognitive load of walking was higher than that of sitting (p = .012).

Epilepsy management relies on patient reporting to validate whether seizures occur during treatment. The goal of this study was to assess the frequency of unreported seizures recorded during routine outpatient ambulatory EEG recording. The authors reviewed 552 records from 502 patients who underwent outpatient 16-channel computer-assisted ambulatory EEG monitoring (CPLA-EEG). Seizure identification was evaluated by assessing push-button activation. Partial seizures were seen most commonly. A total of 47 of 552 records (8.5%) had partial seizures recorded on CAA-EEG, with 29 of 47 (61.7%) with electroclinical seizures identified by push-button activation. Seizures on EEG without push-button activation were analyzed separately and compared with a self-reported written diary to verify lack of recognition. A total of 18 of 47 records (38.3%) had some partial seizures that were unrecognized by the patient, and 11 of 47 records (23.4%) had seizures recognized only by the computer. The authors conclude that patients frequently have seizures outside of the hospital that go unrecognized. Underreporting of seizure frequency occurs in the outpatient setting and impacts optimal diagnosis and treatment for patients with epilepsy.

While the results of previous studies have shown promise, a NMI which takes advantage of early movement-related EEG activity preceding movement onset, as well as the improved signal-to-noise ratio of EMG, could prove to be more accurate and responsive than current NMI designs based solely on EEG or EMG. Previous studies have demonstrated that the activity of the sensorimotor cortex is coupled to the firing rate of motor units in lower limb muscles during voluntary contraction. However, the exploration of corticomuscular coherence during locomotive tasks has been limited. In this study, coupling between the motor cortex and right tibialis anterior muscle activity was preliminarily investigated during self-paced over-ground walking and ramp ascent. EEG at the motor cortex and surface EMG from the tibialis anterior were collected from one able-bodied subject. Coherence between the two signals was computed and studied across gait cycles. The EEG activity led the EMG activity in the low gamma band in swing phase of level ground walking and in stance phase of ramp ascent. These results may inform the future design of EEG-EMG multimodal NMIs for lower limb devices that assist locomotion of people with physical disabilities.

J	Choi, SI; Hwang, HJ				Choi, Soo-In; Hwang, Han-Jeong			Effects of Different Re-referencing Methods on Spontaneously Generated Ear-EEG	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography (EEG); ear-EEG; re-referencing; mental task classification; brain-computer interface (BCI)	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; AVERAGE REFERENCE; CLASSIFICATION; POTENTIALS	In recent years, electroencephalography (EEG) measured around the ears, called ear-EEG, has been introduced to develop unobtrusive and ambulatory EEG-based applications. When measuring ear-EEGs, the availability of a reference site is restricted due to the miniaturized device structure, and therefore a reference electrode is generally placed near the recording electrodes. As the electrical brain activity recorded at a reference electrode closely placed to recording electrodes may significantly cancel or influence the brain activity recorded by the recording electrodes, an appropriate re-referencing method is often required to mitigate the impact of the reference brain activity. In this study, therefore, we systematically investigated the impact of different re-referencing methods on ear-EEGs spontaneously generated from endogenous paradigms. To this end, we used two ear-EEG datasets recorded behind both ears while subjects performed an alpha modulation task [eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO)] and two mental tasks [mental arithmetic (MA) and mental singing (MS)]. The measured ear-EEGs were independently re-referenced using five different methods: (i) all-mean, (ii) contralateral-mean, (iii) ipsilateral-mean, (iv) contralateral-bipolar, and (v) ipsilateral-bipolar. We investigated the changes in alpha power during EO and EC tasks, as well as event-related (de) synchronization (ERD/ERS) during MA and MS. To evaluate the effects of re-referencing methods on ear-EEGs, we estimated the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the two ear-EEG datasets, and assessed the classification performance of the two mental tasks (MA vs. MS). Overall patterns of changes in alpha power and ERD/ERS were similar among the five re-referencing methods, but the contralateral-mean method showed statistically higher SNRs than did the other methods for both ear-EEG datasets, except in the contralateral-bipolar method for the two mental tasks. In concordance with the SNR results, classification performance was also statistically higher for the contralateral-mean method than it was for the other re-referencing methods. The results suggest that employing contralateral mean information can be an efficient way to re-reference spontaneously generated ear-EEGs, thereby maximizing the reliability of ear-EEG-based applications in endogenous paradigms.

Precise, individualized placement of DBS electrodes is a key contributor to clinical outcomes following surgery. Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used to identify the sources of intracerebral signals from the potential on the scalp. EEG is portable, non-invasive, low-cost, and it could be easily integrated into the intraoperative or ambulatory environment for localization of either the DBS electrode or evoked potentials triggered by stimulation itself. In this work, we studied with numerical simulations the principle of extracting the DBS electrical pulse from the patient's EEG - which normally constitutes an artifact - and localizing the source of the artifact (i.e., the DBS electrodes) using EEG localization methods. A high-resolution electromagnetic head model was used to simulate the EEG potential at the scalp generated by the DBS pulse artifact. The potential distribution on the scalp was then sampled at the 256 electrode locations of a high-density EEG Net. The electric potential was modeled by a dipole source created by a given pair of active DBS electrodes. The dynamic Statistical Parametric Maps (dSPM) algorithm was used to solve the EEG inverse problem, and it allowed localization of the position of the stimulus dipole in three DBS electrode bipolar configurations with a maximum error of 1.5 cm. To assess the accuracy of the computational model, the results of the simulation were compared with the electric artifact amplitudes over 16 EEG electrodes measured in five patients. EEG artifacts measured in patients confirmed that simulated data are commensurate to patients' data (0 +/- 6.6 mu V). While we acknowledge that further work is necessary to achieve a higher accuracy needed for surgical navigation, the results presented in this study are proposed as the first step toward a validated computational framework that could be used for non-invasive localization not only of the DBS system but also brain rhythms triggered by stimulation at both proximal and distal sites in the human central nervous system.

Using an incidental go/no-go priming paradigm, we have previously shown a facilitation effect for the execution of a walking-related action in response to far vs. near objects/locations in the extrapersonal space, and this effect has been called "macro-affordance " to reflect the role of locomotion in the coverage of extrapersonal distance. Here, we investigated the neurophysiological underpinnings of such an effect by recording scalp electroencephalography (EEG) from 30 human participants during the same paradigm. The results of a whole-brain analysis indicated a significant modulation of the event-related potentials (ERPs) both during prime and target stimulus presentation. Specifically, consistent with a mechanism of action anticipation and automatic activation of affordances, a stronger ERP was observed in response to prime images framing the environment from a far vs. near distance, and this modulation was localized in dorso-medial motor regions. In addition, an inversion of polarity for far vs. near conditions was observed during the subsequent target period in dorso-medial parietal regions associated with spatially directed foot-related actions. These findings were interpreted within the framework of embodied models of brain functioning as arising from a mechanism of motor-anticipation and subsequent prediction error which was guided by the preferential affordance relationship between the distant large-scale environment and locomotion. More in general, our findings reveal a sensory-motor mechanism for the processing of walking-related environmental affordances.

Using the deep-learning-based object recognition in the red-green-blue-depth (RGB-D) data acquisition process, the designed SLAM approach can select the valid feature points effectively, and the speed of displacement tracking can be improved by combining the oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF (ORB) SLAM algorithm with the optical flow method. The global trajectory map can also be mended using graph-based nonlinear error optimization. In addition, to build the connection between human intentions and the robot control commands flexibly in the developed mobile robot, a common spatial pattern (CSP)-based support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm is proposed so that the control commands can be obtained directly from the human electroencephalograph (EEG) signals, which are preanalyzed and classified using the phenomena of event-related synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD). Experiments involving several operators have verified the effectiveness of the proposed framework in the actual unstructured environments. Note to Practitioners This paper is motivated by the exploration of the mobile robots remotely controlled by the disables in an unstructured environment that includes some unknown moving objects in the background. In the conventional approaches, the image feedback and the brain-computer interface-based EEG signals invoked by the visual stimulus are used to guide the motion of the robots. In this paper, the MI of left or right hand is adopted as an input of the brain teleoperation system, and the EEG signals are classified into two categories representing two robot control commands through the designed algorithm. Besides, a deep-learning-based SLAM is designed to analyze the image and depth of the environmental information provided by the robot RGB-D sensor, and the results can be transferred into a 3-D map locating the robot and assisting the operator to understand the operating environment. It has been verified that the deep-learning-based SLAM presented is more efficient and robust than traditional SLAM. The feasibility of the system is demonstrated by a set of experiments in the corridor environment.

Using mobile brain/body imaging to advance research in arts, health, and related therapeutics	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						4E cognition; art Therapy; creative arts therapies; mobile Brain; Body Imaging; neuroaesthetics	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; QUANTITATIVE EEG; NEGATIVE MOOD; BILATERAL ART; THERAPY; AMPLITUDE; MODEL; NEUROAESTHETICS	The uses of mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) are expanding and allow for more direct study of the neurophysiological signals associated with behavior in psychotherapeutic encounters. Neuroaesthetics is concerned with the cognitive and neural basis of art appreciation, and scientific correlations are being made in the field that might help to clarify theories claimed in the creative arts therapies. Yet, most neuroaesthetics studies are confined to the laboratory and do not propose a translation for research methods and clinical applications. The creative arts therapies have a long history of clinical success with various patient populations and will benefit from increased scientific explanation to support intervention strategies. Examining the brain dynamics and motor behaviors that are associated with the higher complex processes involved in artistic expression offers MoBI as a promising instrumentation to move forward in linking ideas from neuroaesthetics to the creative arts therapies. Tracking brain dynamics in association with behavioral change allows for more objective and quantitative physiological monitors to evaluate, and together with subjective patient reports provides insight into the psychological mechanisms of change in treatment. We outline a framework that shows how MoBI can be used to study the effectiveness of creative arts therapy interventions motivated by the 4E approach to cognition with a focus on visual art therapy. The article illuminates how a new partnership among the fields of art therapy, neuroscience, and neuroaesthetics might work together within the 4E/MoBI framework in efforts to advance transdisciplinary research for clinical health populations.

Because the gold standard of video electroencephalography (vEEG) is not available worldwide, or for every patient, the group delineated a staged approach to PNES diagnosis. Using a consensus review of the literature, this group evaluated key diagnostic approaches. These included: history, EEG, ambulatory EEG, vEEG/monitoring, neurophysiologic, neurohumoral, neuroimaging, neuropsychological testing, hypnosis, and conversation analysis. Levels of diagnostic certainty were developed including possible, probable, clinically established, and documented diagnosis, based on the availability of history, witnessed event, and investigations, including vEEG. The aim and hope of this report is to provide greater clarity about the process and certainty of the diagnosis of PNES, with the intent to improve the care for people with epilepsy and nonepileptic seizures.

To prolong the battery lifetime, analog wavelet filter is used for epileptic event detection in WAEEG system to achieve on-line data reduction. For mapping continuous wavelet transform to analog filter implementation with low-power consumption and high approximation accuracy, this paper proposes a novel approximation method to construct the wavelet base in analog domain, in which the approximation process in frequency domain is considered as an optimization problem by building a mathematical model with only one term in the numerator. The hybrid genetic algorithm consisting of genetic algorithm and quasi-Newton method is employed to find the globally optimum solution, taking required stability into account. Experiment results show that the proposed method can give a stable analog wavelet base with simple structure and higher approximation accuracy compared with existing method, leading to a better spike detection accuracy. The fourth-order Marr wavelet filter is designed as an example using Gm-C filter structure based on LC ladder simulation, whose power consumption is only 33.4 pW at 2.1Hz. Simulation results show that the design method can be used to facilitate low power and small volume implementation of on-line epileptic event detector.

Prolonged EEG recording is used primarily for epilepsy monitoring, but LTM is also used in the intensive care unit, the operating room, and the emergency department. The purpose of LTM is to expand the limited time sampling associated with shorter "routine" EEG recording. Audiovisual monitoring may also be used in conjunction with LTM to evaluate simultaneously a specific clinical behavior that may or may not be associated with EEG alteration. This is typically performed in a hospital setting for safety and ancillary testing purposes. LTM is used most frequently in the diagnosis and management of seizures and "spells," but has also gained wider application in the evaluation of sleep disorders, cerebrovascular disease, psychiatric conditions, and movement disorders. Computer-assisted LTM systems that process, analyze, compress and store data digitally have become widely available in clinical practice both in the hospital as well as outside the hospital when the patient is ambulatory.

Ambulatory Seizure Monitoring: From Concept to Prototype Device	ANNALS OF NEUROSCIENCES			English	Article						Brain computer interface; Phase lock value; Seizure monitoring	WIRELESS EEG; SYSTEM	Background: The brain, made up of billions of neurons and synapses, is the marvelous core of human thought, action and memory. However, if neuronal activity manifests into abnormal electrical activity across the brain, neural behavior may exhibit synchronous neural firings known as seizures. If unprovoked seizures occur repeatedly, a patient may be diagnosed with epilepsy. Purpose: The scope of this project is to develop an ambulatory seizure monitoring system that can be used away from a hospital, making it possible for the user to stay at home, and primary care personnel to monitor a patient's seizure activity in order to provide deeper analysis of the patient's condition and apply personalized intervention techniques. Methods: The ambulatory seizure monitoring device is a research device that has been developed with the objective of acquiring a portable, clean electroencephalography (EEG) signal and transmitting it wirelessly to a handheld device for processing and notification. Result: This device is comprised of 4 phases: acquisition, transmission, processing and notification. During the acquisition stage, the EEG signal is detected using EEG electrodes; these signals are filtered and amplified before being transmitted in the second stage. The processing stage encompasses the signal processing and seizure prediction. A notification is sent to the patient and designated contacts, given an impending seizure. Each of these phases is comprised of various design components, hardware and software. The experimental findings illustrate that there may be a triggering mechanism through the phase lock value method that enables seizure prediction. Conclusion: The device addresses the need for long-term monitoring of the patient's seizure condition in order to provide the clinician a better understanding of the seizure's duration and frequency and ultimately provide the best remedy for the patient.

Tellez; Crawford, Sara L.; Wu, Adam			Outpatient ambulatory EEG as an option for epilepsy surgery evaluation instead of inpatient EEG telemetry	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR CASE REPORTS			English	Article						Ambulatory EEG; Portable EEG; Epilepsy; Complex partial seizure; Diagnostic yield; Cost-effectiveness		Outpatient ambulatory EEG is more cost-effective than inpatient EEG telemetry and may provide adequate seizure localization in a presurgical evaluation. A 51-year-old right-handed male had been unable to work or drive since the age of 35 due to intractable partial onset epilepsy. A 72-hour outpatient ambulatory EEG recorded 18 seizures from the right temporal region. No epileptiform activity was seen in the left hemisphere. Magnetic resonance imaging showed right mesial temporal sclerosis as well as an area of encephalomalacia at the medial inferior right temporal lobe. Neuropsychological assessment found that the patient was a good neurosurgery candidate. At this point, the patient was considered to be a candidate for a right temporal lobectomy. A standard right temporal lobectomy was performed. The patient has been seizure-free for 10 months after the surgery. Follow-up EEGs show no epileptiform activity. The patient is preparing to go back to work, and his driver's license was reinstated 9 months postsurgery. Neuropsychological reassessment is pending, but no apparent change in cognition has been noticed by the patient or his family. Cases with a high congruence between diagnostic imaging and the EEG abnormalities identified in the portable EEG may provide enough information regarding seizure frequency and localization to eliminate the need for inpatient EEG telemetry in the evaluation of patients for epilepsy surgery. We believe that the use of a EEG in preoperative planning should be restricted to cases of TLE and to patients with a high frequency of seizures. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Comparison of a single-channel EEG sleep study to polysomnography	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						ambulatory; inter-rater agreement; sleep stage scoring	HEALTHY-ADULTS; MONITOR SLEEP; TOPOGRAPHY; VALIDATION; ELECTRODES; WAVES; AGE	An accurate home sleep study to assess electroencephalography (EEG)-based sleep stages and EEG power would be advantageous for both clinical and research purposes, such as for longitudinal studies measuring changes in sleep stages over time. The purpose of this study was to compare sleep scoring of a single-channel EEG recorded simultaneously on the forehead against attended polysomnography. Participants were recruited from both a clinical sleep centre and a longitudinal research study investigating cognitively normal ageing and Alzheimer's disease. Analysis for overall epoch-by-epoch agreement found strong and substantial agreement between the single-channel EEG compared to polysomnography (kappa = 0.67). Slow wave activity in the frontal regions was also similar when comparing the single-channel EEG device to polysomnography. As expected, Stage N1 showed poor agreement (sensitivity 0.2) due to lack of occipital electrodes. Other sleep parameters, such as sleep latency and rapid eye movement (REM) onset latency, had decreased agreement. Participants with disrupted sleep consolidation, such as from obstructive sleep apnea, also had poor agreement. We suspect that disagreement in sleep parameters between the single-channel EEG and polysomnography is due partially to altered waveform morphology and/or poorer signal quality in the single-channel derivation. Our results show that single-channel EEG provides comparable results to polysomnography in assessing REM, combined Stages N2 and N3 sleep and several other parameters, including frontal slow wave activity. The data establish that single-channel EEG can be a useful research tool.

Overground Walking Decreases Alpha Activity and Entrains Eye Movements in Humans	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mobile EEG; alpha oscillations; blinks; saccades; locomotion; pupil size; walking phase; motor entrainment	VISUAL-MOTION; EEG ALPHA; ELECTROCORTICAL ACTIVITY; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; LOCOMOTION; BRAIN; SUPPRESSION; MODULATION; ATTENTION; CORTEX	Experiments in animal models have shown that running increases neuronal activity in early visual areas in light as well as in darkness. This suggests that visual processing is influenced by locomotion independent of visual input. Combining mobile electroencephalography, motion- and eye-tracking, we investigated the influence of overground free walking on cortical alpha activity (similar to 10 Hz) and eye movements in healthy humans. Alpha activity has been considered a valuable marker of inhibition of sensory processing and shown to negatively correlate with neuronal firing rates. We found that walking led to a decrease in alpha activity over occipital cortex compared to standing. This decrease was present during walking in darkness as well as during light. Importantly, eye movements could not explain the change in alpha activity. Nevertheless, we found that walking and eye related movements were linked. While the blink rate increased with increasing walking speed independent of light or darkness, saccade rate was only significantly linked to walking speed in the light. Pupil size, on the other hand, was larger during darkness than during light, but only showed a modulation by walking in darkness. Analyzing the effect of walking with respect to the stride cycle, we further found that blinks and saccades preferentially occurred during the double support phase of walking. Alpha power, as shown previously, was lower during the swing phase than during the double support phase. We however could exclude the possibility that the alpha modulation was introduced by a walking movement induced change in electrode impedance. Overall, our work indicates that the human visual system is influenced by the current locomotion state of the body. This influence affects eye movement pattern as well as neuronal activity in sensory areas and might form part of an implicit strategy to optimally extract sensory information during locomotion.

We test HemCNN's decoding capabilities to decode in a streaming way the hand, left or right, from fNIRS data. HemCNN learned to detect which hand executed a grasp at a naturalistic hand action speed of 1 Hz, outperforming standard methods. Since HemCNN does not require baseline correction and the convolution operation is invariant to time translations, our method can help to unlock fNIRS for a variety of real-time tasks. Mobile brain imaging and mobile brain machine interfacing can benefit from this to develop real-world neuroscience and practical human neural interfacing based on BOLD-like signals for the evaluation, assistance and rehabilitation of force generation, such as fusion of fNIRS with EEG signals.

The BRI system is based on motor imagery(MI), which analyze the human electroencephalograph (EEG) signals through the CSP-based SVM classification algorithm. The SLAM system presented in this paper is improved by combining the RGB-D SLAM, optical flow and deep leaning based Recognition. The optical flow method is used to accurately track the displacement of ORB feature points which consume much less time than calculating the ORB characteristics in each image, while the deep learning based recognition reduce the error caused by detected moving objects, and the error of the localization is minimized through global graph-based nonlinear error Optimization. Experiments have been taken by 3 operators and successfully certify the feasibility and efficiency of the whole system.

Low-Power, 8-Channel EEG Recorder and Seizure Detector ASIC for a Subdermal Implantable System	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Biomedical electronics; biomedical signal processing; electroencephalography; epilepsy; implantable biomedical devices; microelectronic implants	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; INSTRUMENTATION AMPLIFIER; CMOS	EEG remains the mainstay test for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with epilepsy. Unfortunately, ambulatory EEG systems are far from ideal for patients who have infrequent seizures. These systems only last up to 3 days and if a seizure is not captured during the recordings, a definite diagnosis of the patient's condition cannot be given. This work aims to address this need by proposing a subdermal implantable, eight-channel EEG recorder and seizure detector that has two modes of operation: diagnosis and seizure counting. In the diagnosis mode, EEG is continuously recorded until a number of seizures are recorded. In the seizure counting mode, the system uses a low-power algorithm to track the number of seizures a patient has, providing doctors with a reliable count to help determine medication efficacy or other clinical endpoint. An ASIC that implements the EEG recording and seizure detection algorithm was designed and fabricated in a 0.18 mu m CMOS process. The ASIC includes eight EEG channels and is designed to minimize the system's power and size. The result is a power-efficient analog front end that requires 2.75 mu W per channel in diagnosis mode and 0.84 mu W per channel in seizure counting mode. Both modes have an input referred noise of approximately 1.1 mu Vrms.

An integrated video-telemetric electroencephalography (Video-tEEG) system, which allows the simultaneous and continuous recording of EEG and video images for long periods, was developed. Methods: This study focuses on the refinement of the surgical methodology for the combined recording of cortical, hippocampal EEG and electromyogram (EMC) waveforms in freely moving rats. The post-operative recovery of animals was monitored by recording EEGs by telemetry and the general activity by video, on days 1, 6 and 15 after surgery, for approximately 24 h, on each occasion. Results: The results suggested that the applied surgical technique for the implantation of the telemetric transmitter, allowed for a gradual recovery of the animals within 15 days. During the recovery period the behavioural and locomotor parameters measured, indicated that there were no changes to the light-dark circadian cycle, and these parameters gradually tended to reach background levels within a 15-day period. Using a mechanical connection between the deep and the telemetric electrodes, 15 days after surgical implantation the recording system was able to acquire cortical and hippocampal EEG traces of good quality. Discussion: This present study is concerned with the refinement of the surgical technique, as well as the integration and synchronisation of the commercially available Dataquest telemetry system and the Noldus video system, in order to study cortical, hippocampal EEG waveforms, in combination with behaviour and locomotion. The application of this integrated Video-tEEG system could provide advantages in the ethical use of animals in different pre-clinical research areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Understanding neural activity patterns in the developing brain remains one of the grand challenges in neuroscience. Developing neural networks are likely to be endowed with functionally important variability associated with the environmental context, age, gender, and other variables. Therefore, we conducted experiments with typically developing children in a stimulating museum setting and tested the feasibility of using deep learning techniques to help identify patterns of brain activity associated with different conditions. Approach. A four-channel dry EEG-based Mobile brain-body imaging data of children at rest and during videogame play (VGP) was acquired at the Children's Museum of Houston. A data-driven approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) was used to describe underlying feature representations in the EEG and their ability to discern task and gender. The variability of the spectral features of EEG during the rest condition as a function of age was also analyzed. Main results. Alpha power (7-13 Hz) was higher during rest whereas theta power (4-7 Hz) was higher during VGP. Beta (13-18 Hz) power was the most significant feature, higher in females, when differentiating between males and females. Using data from both temporoparietal channels to classify between VGP and rest condition, leave-one-subject-out cross-validation accuracy of 67% was obtained. Age-related changes in EEG spectral content during rest were consistent with previous developmental studies conducted in laboratory settings showing an inverse relationship between age and EEG power. Significance. These findings are the first to acquire, quantify and explain brain patterns observed during VGP and rest in freely behaving children in a museum setting using a deep learning framework. The study shows how deep learning can be used as a data driven approach to identify patterns in the data and explores the issues and the potential of conducting experiments involving children in a natural and engaging environment.

Differential Theta-Band Signatures of the Anterior Cingulate and Motor Cortices During Seated Locomotor Perturbations	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Perturbation methods; Legged locomotion; Task analysis; Electroencephalography; Data collection; Synchronization; Immune system; Cortical control; mobile brain-body imaging; motor adaptation; use-dependent learning		Quantifying motor and cortical responses to perturbations during seated locomotor tasks such as recumbent stepping and cycling will expand and improve the understanding of locomotor adaptation processes beyond just perturbed gait. Using a perturbed recumbent stepping protocol, we hypothesized motor errors and anterior cingulate activity would decrease with time, and perturbation timing would influence electrocortical elicitation. Young adults (n = 17) completed four 10-minute arms and legs stepping tasks, with perturbations applied at every left or right leg extension-onset or mid-extension. A random no-perturbation "catch" stride occurred in every five perturbed strides. We instructed subjects to follow a pacing cue and to step smoothly, and we quantified temporal and spatial motor errors. We used high-density electroencephalography to estimate sources of electrocortical fluctuations shared among >70% of subjects. Temporal and spatial errors did not decrease from early to late for either perturbed or catch strides. Interestingly, spatial errors post-perturbation did not return to pre-perturbation levels, suggesting use-dependent learning occurred. Theta (3-8 Hz) synchronization in the anterior cingulate cortex and left and right supplementary motor areas (SMA) emerged near the perturbation event, and extension-onset perturbations elicited greater theta-band power than mid-extension perturbations. Even though motor errors did not adapt, anterior cingulate theta synchronization decreased from early to late perturbed strides, but only during the right-side tasks. Additionally, SMA mainly demonstrated specialized, not contralateral, lateralization. Overall, seated locomotor perturbations produced differential theta-band responses in the anterior cingulate and SMAs, suggesting that tuning perturbation parameters, e.g., timing, can potentially modify electrocortical responses.

Neural predictors of gait stability when walking freely in the real-world	JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						Mobile brain/body imaging (MOBI); EEG; Gait; Acceleration; RMSR; Urban environment	POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; ACCELERATION PATTERNS; OLDER-ADULTS; INTEGRATION; LOCOMOTION; NETWORKS; LEVEL; BETA; ACCELEROMETRY	Background: Gait impairments during real-world locomotion are common in neurological diseases. However, very little is currently known about the neural correlates of walking in the real world and on which regions of the brain are involved in regulating gait stability and performance. As a first step to understanding how neural control of gait may be impaired in neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease, we investigated how regional brain activation might predict walking performance in the urban environment and whilst engaging with secondary tasks in healthy subjects. Methods: We recorded gait characteristics including trunk acceleration and brain activation in 14 healthy young subjects whilst they walked around the university campus freely (single task), while conversing with the experimenter and while texting with their smartphone. Neural spectral power density (PSD) was evaluated in three brain regions of interest, namely the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) and bilateral posterior parietal cortex (right/left PPC). We hypothesized that specific regional neural activation would predict trunk acceleration data obtained during the different walking conditions. Results: Vertical trunk acceleration was predicted by gait velocity and left PPC theta (4-7 Hz) band PSD in single-task walking (R-squared = 0.725, p = 0.001) and by gait velocity and left PPC alpha (8-12 Hz) band PSD in walking while conversing (R-squared = 0.727, p = 0.001). Medio-lateral trunk acceleration was predicted by left PPC beta (15-25 Hz) band PSD when walking while texting (R-squared = 0.434, p = 0.010). Conclusions: We suggest that the left PPC may be involved in the processes of sensorimotor integration and gait control during walking in real-world conditions. Frequency-specific coding was operative in different dual tasks and may be developed as biomarkers of gait deficits in neurological conditions during performance of these types of, now commonly undertaken, dual tasks.

However, manual scoring of sleep stages is time-consuming, subjective, and costly. To overcome this shortcoming, we aimed to develop an accurate deep learning approach for automatic classification of sleep stages and to study the effect of OSA severity on the classification accuracy. Overnight polysomnographic recordings from a public dataset of healthy individuals (Sleep-EDF, n = 153) and from a clinical dataset (n = 891) of patients with suspected OSA were used to develop a combined convolutional and long short-term memory neural network. On the public dataset, the model achieved sleep staging accuracy of 83.7% (kappa = 0.77) with a single frontal EEG channel and 83.9% (kappa = 0.78) when supplemented with EOG. For the clinical dataset, the model achieved accuracies of 82.9% (kappa = 0.77) and 83.8% (kappa = 0.78) with a single EEG channel and two channels (EEG+EOG), respectively. The sleep staging accuracy decreased with increasing OSA severity. The single-channel accuracy ranged from 84.5% (kappa = 0.79) for individuals without OSA diagnosis to 76.5% (kappa = 0.68) for patients with severe OSA. In conclusion, deep learning enables automatic sleep staging for suspected OSA patients with high accuracy and expectedly, the accuracy decreased with increasing OSA severity. Furthermore, the accuracies achieved in the public dataset were superior to previously published state-of-the-art methods. Adding an EOG channel did not significantly increase the accuracy. The automatic, single-channel-based sleep staging could enable easy, accurate, and cost-efficient integration of EEG recording into diagnostic ambulatory recordings.

BCIs are technologies that enable direct communication between the human brain and external devices. Conventionally, wet electrodes have been employed to obtain unprecedented sensitivity to high-temporal-resolution brain activity; recently, the growing availability of various sensors that can be used to detect high-quality brain signals in a wide range of clinical and everyday environments is being exploited. This development of biosensing neurotechnologies and the desire to implement them in real-world applications have led to the opportunity to develop augmented BCIs (ABCIs) in the upcoming decades. An ABCI is similar to a BCI in that it relies on biosensors that record signals from the brain in everyday environments; the signals are then processed in real time to monitor the behavior of the human. To use an ABCI as a mobile brain imaging technique for everyday, real-life applications, the sensors and the corresponding device must be lightweight and the equipment response time must be short. This study presents an overview of the wide range of biosensor approaches currently being applied to ABCIs, from their use in the laboratory to their application in clinical and everyday use. The basic principles of each technique are described along with examples of current applications of cutting-edge neuroscience research. In summary, we show that ABCI techniques continue to grow and evolve, incorporating new technologies and advances to address ever more complex and important neuroscience issues, with advancements that are envisioned to lead to a wide range of real-life applications.

High similarity between EEG from subcutaneous and proximate scalp electrodes in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						long-term monitoring; subcutaneous EEG; temporal lobe epilepsy; ultra-long-term monitoring; wearable EEG	SUBDERMAL WIRE ELECTRODES; AMBULATORY EEG; EAR-EEG; SLEEP DISORDERS; MONITORING UNIT; CARE-UNIT; LONG-TERM; ACTIGRAPHY; SEIZURES; SYSTEM	Subcutaneous recording using electroencephalography (EEG) has the potential to enable ultra-long-term epilepsy monitoring in real-life conditions because it allows the patient increased mobility and discreteness. This study is the first to compare physiological and epileptiform EEG signals from subcutaneous and scalp EEG recordings in epilepsy patients. Four patients with probable or definite temporal lobe epilepsy were monitored with simultaneous scalp and subcutaneous EEG recordings. EEG recordings were compared by correlation and time-frequency analysis across an array of clinically relevant waveforms and patterns. We found high similarity between the subcutaneous EEG channels and nearby temporal scalp channels for most investigated electroencephalographic events. In particular, the temporal dynamics of one typical temporal lobe seizure in one patient were similar in scalp and subcutaneous recordings in regard to frequency distribution and morphology. Signal similarity is strongly related to the distance between the subcutaneous and scalp electrodes. On the basis of these limited data, we conclude that subcutaneous EEG recordings are very similar to scalp recordings in both time and time-frequency domains, if the distance between them is small. As many electroencephalographic events are local/ regional, the positioning of the subcutaneous electrodes should be considered carefully to reflect the relevant clinical question. The impact of implantation depth of the subcutaneous electrode on recording quality should be investigated further. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study is the first publication comparing the detection of clinically relevant, pathological EEG features from a subcutaneous recording system designed for out-patient ultralong-term use to gold standard scalp EEG recordings. Our study shows that subcutaneous channels are very similar to comparable scalp channels, but also point out some issues yet to be resolved.

Indications for epilepsy monitoring in pediatric and adolescent health care	CURRENT PROBLEMS IN PEDIATRIC AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH CARE			English	Article							LIFE-THREATENING EVENTS; 1ST UNPROVOKED SEIZURE; PARTIAL SLEEP-DEPRIVATION; EXTENDED OUTPATIENT EEG; VIDEO-EEG; DIAGNOSTIC YIELD; AMBULATORY EEG; ELECTROGRAPHIC SEIZURES; NONEPILEPTIC SEIZURES; SUBCLINICAL SEIZURES	Seizures present in childhood with infinite diversity. History alone may suffice for diagnosis in some cases; more often additional evidence is needed to clarify events of concern. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a primary methodology used for seizure identification and management. Pediatric and adolescent health care providers are increasingly asked to make decisions about when and how to refer patients for eventual monitoring and must then be able to confidently interpret any resulting report(s). Comprehensive literature review was undertaken to provide a succinct and up-to-date overview aimed at general and subspecialty non-neurologist pediatric and adolescent health care providers to not only convey a solid general understanding of EEG and what it entails for patients and their families, but also foster a deeper understanding of the indications for monitoring-and how to interpret documented findings. In plain language this resultant guide reviews EEG basics, provides a crash course in the various types of EEG available, discusses broad indications for epilepsy monitoring, guides counseling and management for patients and their families both before and after EEG, and ultimately aids in the interpretation of both findings and prognosis. This review should allow both primary and subspecialty non-neurologic pediatric and adolescent health care providers to better identify when and how to best utilize EEG as part of a larger comprehensive clinical approach, distinguishing and managing both epileptic and nonepileptic disorders of concern while fostering communication across providers to facilitate and coordinate better holistic long-term care of pediatric and adolescent patients.

Corticospinal Control of Human Locomotion as a New Determinant of Age-Related Sarcopenia: An Exploratory Study	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						sarcopenia; dynapenia; corticomuscular coherence; corticospinal control; connectivity; EEG; EMG; gait; walking; locomotion	CORTICOMUSCULAR COHERENCE; INTERMUSCULAR COHERENCE; MUSCULAR COHERENCE; COGNITIVE DECLINE; HEALTHY OLDER; WALKING; MUSCLE; GAIT; PREVALENCE; STRENGTH	Sarcopenia is a muscle disease listed within the ICD-10 classification. Several operational definitions have been created for sarcopenia screening; however, an international consensus is lacking. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recently recognized that sarcopenia detection requires improved diagnosis and screening measures. Mounting evidence hints towards changes in the corticospinal communication system where corticomuscular coherence (CMC) reflects an effective mechanism of corticospinal interaction. CMC can be assessed during locomotion by means of simultaneously measuring Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electromyography (EMG). The aim of this study was to perform sarcopenia screening in community-dwelling older adults and explore the possibility of using CMC assessed during gait to discriminate between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic older adults. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves showed high sensitivity, precision and accuracy of CMC assessed from EEG Cz sensor and EMG sensors located over Musculus Vastus Medialis [Cz-VM; AUC (95.0%CI): 0.98 (0.92-1.04), sensitivity: 1.00, 1-specificity: 0.89, p < 0.001] and with Musculus Biceps Femoris [Cz-BF; AUC (95.0%CI): 0.86 (0.68-1.03), sensitivity: 1.00, 1-specificity: 0.70, p < 0.001]. These muscles showed significant differences with large magnitude of effect between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic older adults [Hedge's g (95.0%CI): 2.2 (1.3-3.1), p = 0.005 and Hedge's g (95.0%CI): 1.5 (0.7-2.2), p = 0.010; respectively]. The novelty of this exploratory investigation is the hint toward a novel possible determinant of age-related sarcopenia, derived from corticospinal control of locomotion and shown by the observed large differences in CMC when sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic older adults are compared. This, in turn, might represent in future a potential treatment target to counteract sarcopenia as well as a parameter to monitor the progression of the disease and/or the potential recovery following other treatment interventions.

Assessing Footwear Comfort by Electroencephalography Analysis	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Footwear; Electroencephalography; Electrodes; Neuroscience; Legged locomotion; Tools; Feature extraction; Consumer neuroscience; comfort perception; EEG; footwear; neuro-marketing	PLANTAR PRESSURE	Footwear comfort is one of the determinant factors in a buyout decision. The understanding of which brain patterns are involved in the comfort perception of footwear could be an important element to develop the consumer neuroscience field, and could even help during the development phase of new products. The present paper studies the comfort perception through the electroencephalography analysis of the brain signals of ten subjects during walking. For the analysis, different features were extracted from the subject's biosignals based on power spectral density attributes and temporal and statistical parameters of the data under analysis. The research compared the features when the subjects were wearing a comfortable and a uncomfortable shoe by size on a treadmill. The results indicate that both kind of shoes could be classified with average accuracies of 84,3% and that an influence of parietal, tempo-parietal and in a minor way frontal lobes was detected. Despite the subject's dependency on the results, the research demonstrates that a common electrode and feature configuration could be applied keeping the results in an average accuracy of 83,7% and that a reduction to a 12 electrode setup maintains the accuracy at a 78,0% value.

We have previously demonstrated that Ro 10-5824, a D4R partial agonist, improves the performance of common marmosets in the object retrieval detour (ORD) task. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this improvement are unknown. We investigated the behavioral and neurophysiological effects of Ro 10-5824 in common marmosets. The effects of Ro 10-5824 on cognitive function were evaluated using the ORD task. The neurophysiological effects of Ro 10-5824 were investigated by quantitative electroencephalography, especially on baseline gamma band activity in the frontal cortex. The effects of Ro 10-5824 on spontaneous locomotion were also assessed. Systemic administration of Ro 10-5824 at 3 mg/kg significantly increased the success rate in the ORD task. At doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg, Ro 10-5824 increased baseline gamma band activity in the frontal cortex. Ro 10-5824 had no effect on spontaneous locomotion. Activation of D4R by Ro 10-5824 improves the success rate in the ORD task and increases baseline gamma band activity in the frontal cortex without affecting locomotion in common marmosets. These findings highlight the role of D4R in gamma oscillations of non-human primates. As gamma oscillations are thought to be involved in attention and behavioral inhibition, our results suggest D4R agonists may improve these cognitive functions by modulating baseline gamma band activity in the frontal cortex.

In cats, the motor and posterior parietal cortices have crucial roles for precisely adjusting limb trajectory during walking. In human walking, however, it remains unclear which cortical information contributes to voluntary gait modification. In this study, we investigated cortical activity changes associated with visually guided precision stepping using electroencephalography source analysis. Our results demonstrated frequency- and gait-event-dependent changes in the cortical power spectrum elicited by voluntary gait modification. The main differences between normal walking and precision stepping were as follows: (a) the alpha, beta or gamma power decrease during the swing phases in the sensorimotor, anterior cingulate and parieto-occipital cortices, and (b) a power decrease in the theta, alpha and beta bands and increase in the gamma band throughout the gait cycle in the parieto-occipital cortex. Based on the previous knowledge of brain functions, the former change was considered to be related to execution and planning of leg movement, while the latter change was considered to be related to multisensory integration and motor awareness. Therefore, our results suggest that the gait modification is achieved by higher cortical involvements associated with different sensorimotor-related functions across multiple cortical regions including the sensorimotor, anterior cingulate and parieto-occipital cortices. The results imply the critical importance of the cortical contribution to voluntary modification in human locomotion. Further, the observed cortical information related to voluntary gait modification would contribute to developing volitional control systems of brain-machine interfaces for walking rehabilitation.

However, these measurements are temporally limited and affected by clinical variables. The RNS System (NeuroPace, Inc.) is a chronic, closed-loop electrographic seizure detection and stimulation system. When adapted by investigators for research, it facilitates cognitive testing in a controlled ambulatory setting, with measurements collected over months to years. We utilized an associative learning paradigm in 5 patients with traditional iEEG and 3 patients with chronic iEEG, and found increased hippocampal gamma (60-100 Hz) sustained at 1.3-1.5 seconds during encoding in successful versus failed trials in surgical patients, with similar results in our RNS System patients (1.4-1.6 seconds). Our findings replicate other studies demonstrating that sustained hippocampal gamma supports encoding. Importantly, we have validated the RNS System to make sensitive measurements of hippocampal dynamics during cognitive tasks in a chronic ambulatory research setting.

A Deep Learning Strategy for Automatic Sleep Staging Based on Two-Channel EEG Headband Data	SENSORS			English	Article						deep learning; EEG headband; sleep staging; machine learning; neurodegenerative disease; sleep	NEURAL-NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEM	Sleep disturbances are common in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, and together represent a potential therapeutic target for disease modification. A major barrier for studying sleep in patients with dementia is the requirement for overnight polysomnography (PSG) to achieve formal sleep staging. This is not only costly, but also spending a night in a hospital setting is not always advisable in this patient group. As an alternative to PSG, portable electroencephalography (EEG) headbands (HB) have been developed, which reduce cost, increase patient comfort, and allow sleep recordings in a person's home environment. However, naive applications of current automated sleep staging systems tend to perform inadequately with HB data, due to their relatively lower quality. Here we present a deep learning (DL) model for automated sleep staging of HB EEG data to overcome these critical limitations. The solution includes a simple band-pass filtering, a data augmentation step, and a model using convolutional (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) layers. With this model, we have achieved 74% (+/- 10%) validation accuracy on low-quality two-channel EEG headband data and 77% (+/- 10%) on gold-standard PSG. Our results suggest that DL approaches achieve robust sleep staging of both portable and in-hospital EEG recordings, and may allow for more widespread use of ambulatory sleep assessments across clinical conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders.

The interictal EEG frequently shows focal activity. This report describes a 3 1/2-year-old boy who presented with episodes of unmotivated laughter associated with other epileptic symptomatology before the age of 3 years. Prolonged ambulatory EEG monitoring recorded electroclinical seizures starting in the right frontal area and spreading to the adjacent frontotemporal region. Neurological examination and brain magnetic resonance imaging were normal. Vigabatrin resulted in immediate remission of the seizures and normalization of the EEG. (C) 2000 BEA Trading Ltd.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of 1750 consecutive patients referred to the Department of Neurology at the Vienna General Hospital between January 1 and December 31, 2009. The incidence of epilepsy in patients with ED and no prior history of epilepsy was compared with a disease control group matched for gender and neuroimaging findings. Results: ED were identified in 26 (4%) of 629 patients without a history of epilepsy. Sixteen (62%) of these patients developed epilepsy during follow-up compared with five (19%) of the disease controls (p = 0.01), yielding an adjusted odds ratio of 8.8 (95% CI 2.1-37.7) for developing epilepsy in patients with ED and no prior history of epilepsy. Conclusions: Incidental ED during routine EEG significantly increase the likelihood of developing epilepsy. Significance: Patients with incidental ED should be specifically asked for any signs and symptoms suggestive of seizures, since they appear more prone to develop epilepsy.

Previous studies have established that drugs affect EEG characteristics in humans and rodents in a similar manner. However, there has been little work to establish correlations between drug effects on behavioral and EEG characteristics in rats. In the current study, we have simultaneously monitored EEG characteristics during a novel object recognition task (NORT) or open field (OF) test in rats. EEG was monitored using telemetric device from epidural and hippocampal regions during the choice trial in the NORT after treatment with scopolamine (0.1mg/kg, intraperitoneal) alone or in combination with donepezil (0.3mg/kg, subcutaneous). Power changes across spectral frequency bands during exploration of novel and familiar object were assessed separately. Amphetamine (2mg/kg, intraperitoneal) was used to monitor effects on locomotor activity and EEG changes in the OF test. In the NORT, scopolamine impaired object recognition, but no differences were observed in the power densities across spectral bands during exploration of novel and familiar objects. Treatment with donepezil reversed scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment, and the power density in the theta frequency band was increased during exploration of the novel object. In OF, amphetamine increased locomotion and produced an overall decrease in the power densities of all frequency bands. Overall, the results indicate that EEG characteristics are closely related to behavioral changes in the NORT and OF in rodents.

However, approximately one third of stroke patients do not receive early in hospital rehabilitation programs due to insufficient medical facilities or lack of motivation. Gait triggered mixed reality (GTMR) is a cognitive-motor dual task with multisensory feedback tailored for lower-limb post-stroke rehabilitation, which we propose as a potential method for addressing these rehabilitation challenges. Simultaneous gait and EEG data from nine stroke patients was recorded and analyzed to assess the applicability of GTMR to different stroke patients, determine any impacts of GTMR on patients, and better understand brain dynamics as stroke patients perform different rehabilitation tasks. Walking cadence improved significantly for stroke patients and lower-limb movement induced alpha band power suppression during GTMR tasks. The brain dynamics and gait performance across different severities of stroke motor deficits was also assessed; the intensity of walking induced event related desynchronization (ERD) was found to be related to motor deficits, as classified by Brunnstrom stage. In particular, stronger lower-limb movement induced ERD during GTMR rehabilitation tasks was found for patients with moderate motor deficits (Brunnstrom stage IV). This investigation demonstrates the efficacy of the GTMR paradigm for enhancing lower-limb rehabilitation, explores the neural activities of cognitive-motor tasks in different stages of stroke, and highlights the potential for joining enhanced rehabilitation and real-time neural monitoring for superior stroke rehabilitation.

These methods however have to rely on very complex, power hungry algorithms, implemented on the system backend, in order to achieve acceptable levels of accuracy. In size, and therefore power-constrained EEG systems, an alternative approach to the problem of data reduction is online data selection, in which simpler algorithms select potential epileptiform activity for discontinuous recording but accurate analysis is still left to a medical practitioner. Such a diagnostic decision support system would still provide doctors with information relevant for diagnosis while reducing the time taken to analyze the EEG. For wearable systems with limited power budgets, data selection algorithm must be of sufficiently low complexity in order to reduce the amount of data transmitted and the overall power consumption. In this paper, we present a low-power hardware implementation of an online epileptic seizure data selection algorithm with encryption and data transmission and demonstrate the tradeoffs between its accuracy and the overall system power consumption. We demonstrate that overall power savings by data selection can be achieved by transmitting less than 40% of the data. We also show a 29% power reduction when selecting and transmitting 94% of all seizure events and only 10% of background EEG.

However, the presence of motion artifacts forms a major obstacle for such systems. In previous studies, it has been shown that continuous electrode-tissue impedance monitoring can be used to handle motion artifacts. In this paper, we demonstrate that the in-phase and quadrature components of the contact impedance provide complementary information that can be used to improve the prediction of motion artifacts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the prediction of motion artifacts at one electrode can be further improved by also incorporating the impedance measurements at other electrodes. With this, we propose a motion artifact reduction algorithm based on a multi-channel linear prediction (MLP) filter. Although the MLP filter is not able to completely remove motion artifacts, a substantial reduction can indeed be achieved.

In parallel, the introduction of new powerful mixed-signal devices will enhance the possibility of garments including cost-effective biopotential measurements, over the classical analog signal conditioning configurations. This paper presents the use of a recently introduced ASIC device (ADS1298) for measuring ECG, EEG and EMG data, towards developing a multimodal biopotential measurement system. Two programmable analog filter configurations are tested for comparison. The results show that adjusting the analog filters to accommodate different biopotentials is an unfeasible task in comparison with the ASIC device, which proved useful for measuring common biopotentials: ECG, EMG and EEG, and thus is more suitable for wearable sensor applications.

Detecting interictal discharges in first seizure patients: ambulatory EEG or EEG after sleep deprivation?	SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY			English	Article						Epilepsy; Ambulatory EEG; Sleep deprived EEG; Diagnostics; Interictal discharges	EPILEPSY; ADULTS; DIAGNOSIS; UTILITY	Purpose: Uncertainty about recurrence after a first unprovoked seizure is a significant psychological burden for patients, and motivates the need for diagnostic tools with high sensitivity and specificity to assess recurrence risk. As the sensitivity of a routine EEG after a first unprovoked seizure is limited, patients often require further diagnostics. Here, we study if ambulatory EEG (aEEG) has similar diagnostic accuracy as sleep deprived EEG (sdEEG). Methods: In this retrospective cohort, we included patients with an unprovoked first seizure and a normal routine EEG who subsequently underwent an sdEEG or aEEG. All EEGs were reviewed for the presence of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). We calculated specificity and sensitivity of sdEEG and aEEG, using the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy as golden standard. All patients had a follow-up of one year. Results: We included 104 patients. Sensitivities for sdEEG and aEEG were 45% (specificity 91%) and 63% (specificity 95%), respectively. Independent risk factor for recurrent seizure were IEDs on the additional EEG, with a relative risk of 1.5 of having a recurrent seizure within a year. Conclusion: Diagnostic accuracies of sdEEG and aEEG are similar and depending on patients' and clinicians' preference both can be considered in patients with a first seizure and a normal routine EEG to determine recurrence risk.

Although electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities and clinical seizures may play a role in ASDs, the exact frequency of EEG abnormalities in an ASD population that has not had clinical seizures or prior abnormal EEGs is unknown. There is no current consensus on whether treatment of EEG abnormalities may influence development. This retrospective review of 24-hour ambulatory digital EEG data collected from 889 ASD patients presenting between 1996 and 2005 (with no known genetic conditions, brain malformations, prior medications, or clinical seizures) shows that 540 of 889 (60.7%) subjects had abnormal EEG epileptiform activity in sleep with no difference based on clinical regression. The most frequent sites of epileptiform abnormalities were localized over the right temporal region. Of 176 patients treated with valproic acid, 80 normalized on EEG and 30 more showed EEG improvement compared with the first EEG (average of 10.1 months to repeat EEG). (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: Cross-sectional analysis in preadolescents aged 9-12 years from the Generation R Study, a population-based birth cohort set up in Rotterdam, The Netherlands (n = 2592). An integrated exposure model was used to estimate whole-brain and lobe-specific RF-EMF doses (mJ/kg/day) from different RF EMF sources including mobile and Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) phone calls, other mobile phone uses than calling, tablet use, laptop use, and far-field sources. Whole-brain and lobe-specific RF EMF doses were estimated for all RF EMF sources together (i.e. overall) and for three groups of RF EMF sources that lead to a different pattern of RF EMF exposure. Information on brain volumes was extracted from magnetic resonance imaging scans. Results: Estimated overall whole-brain RF EMF dose was 84.3 mJ/kg/day. The highest overall lobe-specific dose was estimated in the temporal lobe (307.1 mJ/kg/day). Whole-brain and lobe-specific RF EMF doses from all RF-EMF sources together, from mobile and DECT phone calls, and from far-field sources were not associated with global, cortical, or subcortical brain volumes. However, a higher whole-brain RF EMF dose from mobile phone use for interne' browsing, e-mailing, and text messaging, tablet use, and laptop use while wirelessly connected to the interne' was associated with a smaller caudate volume. Conclusions: Our results suggest that estimated whole-brain and lobe-specific RF EMF doses were not related to brain volumes in preadolescents at 9-12 years old. Screen activities with mobile communication devices while wirelessly connected to the internet lead to low RF-EMF dose to the brain and our observed association may thus rather reflect effects of social or individual factors related to these specific uses of mobile communication devices. However, we cannot discard residual confounding, chance finding, or reverse causality. Further studies on mobile communication devices and their potential negative associations with brain development are warranted, regardless whether associations are due to RF-EMF exposure or to other factors related to their use.

However, it is restrictedly available, and too cumbersome and expensive for the purpose. The aim of this study was to introduce an ambulatory electrode set and evaluate its feasibility for more cost-effective diagnostics of sleep bruxism. Six self-assessed bruxers (one male, five females; aged 21-58years) and six healthy controls (four males, two females, aged 21-25years) underwent a standard polysomnographic study and a concurrent study with the ambulatory electrode set. Bruxism events, cortical arousals and sleep stages were scored for the two montages separately in a random order, and obtained sleep parameters were compared. In addition, the significance of video recording and sleep stage scoring for the diagnostic accuracy of ambulatory electrode set wasdetermined. Ambulatory electrode set yielded similar diagnoses asstandard polysomnography in all subjects. However, compared with standard polysomnography the median (interquartile range) tonic bruxism event index was significantly higher in the control group [+0.38 (+0.08 to +0.56) events per hour, P = 0.046], and the phasic bruxism event index was significantly lower in the bruxer group [-0.44 (-1.30 to +0.07) events per hour, P = 0.046]. Exclusion of video recording and both video recording and sleep stage scoring from analysis increased overestimation of the tonic bruxism event index in the control group +0.86 (+0.42 to +1.03) and +1.19 (+0.55 to +1.39) events per hour, P=0.046 and P=0.028, respectively], resulting in one misdiagnosed control subject. To conclude, ambulatory electrode set is a sensitive method for ambulatory diagnostics of sleep bruxism, and video recording and sleep stage scoring help reaching the highest specificity of sleep bruxism diagnostics.

J	Calhas, D; Romero, E; Henriques, R				Calhas, David; Romero, Enrique; Henriques, Rui			On the use of pairwise distance learning for brain signal classification with limited observations	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Pairwise learning; Schizophrenia; Classification; Electroencephalography	NEURAL-NETWORKS; EEG	The increasing access to brain signal data using electroencephalography creates new opportunities to study electrophysiological brain activity and perform ambulatory diagnoses of neurological disorders. This work proposes a pairwise distance learning approach for schizophrenia classification relying on the spectral properties of the signal. To be able to handle clinical trials with a limited number of observations (i.e. case and/or control individuals), we propose a Siamese neural network architecture to learn a discriminative feature space from pairwise combinations of observations per channel. In this way, the multivariate order of the signal is used as a form of data augmentation, further supporting the network generalization ability. Convolutional layers with parameters learned under a cosine contrastive loss are proposed to adequately explore spectral images derived from the brain signal. The proposed approach for schizophrenia diagnostic was tested on reference clinical trial data under resting-state protocol, achieving 0.95 +/- 0.05 accuracy, 0.98 +/- 0.02 sensitivity and 0.92 +/- 0.07 specificity. Results show that the features extracted using the proposed neural network are remarkably superior than baselines to diagnose schizophrenia (+20pp in accuracy and sensitivity), suggesting the existence of non-trivial electrophysiological brain patterns able to capture discriminative neuroplasticity profiles among individuals.

Patients and methods: Children meeting enrollment criteria (n = 54) received a confirmatory 24-h ambulatory electroencephalogram (EEG) and then entered a Escalation Phase of up to 20-weeks during which lamotrigine was titrated until seizures were controlled or maximum dose (10.2 mg/kg) was reached. Seizure freedom was assessed by diary review and clinic hyperventilation (clinic HV) and then confirmed by EEG with hyperventilation (HV/EEG). Patients who maintained seizure freedom for two consecutive weekly visits were entered into the Maintenance Phase (n = 30). Diary, clinic HV, and HV/EEG data were supplemented with 24-h ambulatory EEG at baseline and the ends of the Escalation and Maintenance Phases. Health outcome assessments were completed at screening and at the end of the Maintenance Phase. Results: By the end of the Escalation Phase, seizure-free rates (responders) were 59% by seizure diary (n = 51), 56% by HV/EEG (n = 54) (primary endpoint), and 49% by 24-h ambulatory EEG (n = 49). During the Maintenance Phase, 89% (week 24) and 86% (week 32) remained seizure free by diary (n = 28), 78% by clinic HV (n = 27), and 81% by 24-h ambulatory EEG (n = 26). Seizure freedom was first observed beginning at the fifth week of the Escalation Phase. The most frequent adverse events were headache and cough. Health outcome scores were either improved or unchanged at the end of the Maintenance Phase.	[Holmes, Gregory L.] Ctr Neurosci, Dartmouth Med Sch, Lebanon, NH USA; [Frank, L.

Therefore, much research over the past 15 years has focused on identifying ways for handling such artifacts in the preprocessing stage. However, this is still an active area of research as no single existing artifact detection/removal method is complete or universal. This article presents an extensive review of the existing state-of-the-art artifact detection and removal methods from scalp EEG for all potential EEG-based applications and analyses the pros and cons of each method. First, a general overview of the different artifact types that are found in scalp EEG and their effect on particular applications are presented. In addition, the methods are compared based on their ability to remove certain types of artifacts and their suitability in relevant applications (only functional comparison is provided not performance evaluation of methods). Finally, the future direction and expected challenges of current research is discussed. Therefore, this review is expected to be helpful for interested researchers who will develop and/or apply artifact handling algorithm/technique in future for their applications as well as for those willing to improve the existing algorithms or propose a new solution in this particular area of research.

EEG signals were recorded as the subjects walked through the exhibit in guided groups of 6-8 people. Moreover, guided groups were either provided with an explanation of each art piece (Guided-E), or given no explanation (Guided-NE). The study was performed using portable Muse (InteraXon, Inc, Toronto, ON, Canada) headbands with four dry electrodes located at AF7, AF8, TP9, and TP10. Each participant performed a baseline (BL) control condition devoid of artistic stimuli and selected his/her favorite piece of art (FP) during the guided tour. In this study, we report data related to participants' demographic information and aesthetic preference as well as effects of art viewing on neural activity (EEG) in a select subgroup of 18-30 year-old subjects (Nc = 25) that generated high-quality EEG signals, on both BL and FP conditions. Dependencies on gender, sensor placement, and presence or absence of art explanation were also analyzed. After denoising, clustering of spectral EEG models was used to identify neural patterns associated with BL and FP conditions. Results indicate statistically significant suppression of beta band frequencies (15-25 Hz) in the prefrontal electrodes (AF7 and AF8) during appreciation of subjects' favorite painting, compared to the BL condition, which was significantly different from EEG responses to non-favorite paintings (NFP). No significant differences in brain activity in relation to the presence or absence of explanation during exhibit tours were found. Moreover, a frontal to posterior asymmetry in neural activity was observed, for both BL and FP conditions. These findings provide new information about frequency-related effects of preferred art viewing in brain activity, and support the view that art appreciation is independent of the artists' intent or original interpretation and related to the individual message that viewers themselves provide to each piece.

NeuroMonitor Ambulatory EEG Device: Comparative Analysis and Its Application for Cognitive Load Assessment	2014 IEEE HEALTHCARE INNOVATION CONFERENCE (HIC)			English	Proceedings Paper	2014 IEEE Healthcare Innovation Conference (HIC)	OCT 08-10, 2014	Seattle, WA					We have previously presented a wireless ambulatory EEG device (NeuroMonitor) to non-invasively monitor prefrontal cortex scalp EEG activity in real-life settings. This paper discusses analysis and application of data acquired using this device. We assess the device data against a commercially available, clinical grade Neuroscan SynAmps RT EEG system. For the comparison, temporal statistical measures and Power Spectral Density (PSD) are computed for the simultaneous recordings from both devices from (nearly) identical electrode locations. Although the analog signal processing, sampling, and data recording specifications are slightly different for these devices (e.g., filter specifications, ADC - NeuroMonitor: 16 bit and Neuroscan: 24 bit, electrodes - NeuroMonitor: GS26 Pre-gelled Disposable, Neuroscan: Ag/AgCl reusable EEG disc electrodes), the temporal signals and the PSD of two devices had sufficient correlation. The paper also describes pilot data collection for a test protocol to determine cognitive load using the NeuroMonitor device. For analyzing attention levels for 5 different tasks, EEG rhythms (Alpha, Beta and Theta) are extracted and cognitive load index (CLI) is computed. Results show variations in the PSD of these rhythms with respect to corresponding expected cognitive loads in attention-related and relaxed tasks. This study validates the NeuroMonitor ambulatory EEG device data and shows a use-case for real-life cognitive load studies.

Outcome of ambulatory video-EEG monitoring in a (similar to)10,000 patient nationwide cohort	SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY			English	Article						EEG; Epilepsy monitoring; Video/EEG use in epilepsy; Ambulatory EEG	PSYCHOGENIC NONEPILEPTIC SEIZURES; INTERNATIONAL LEAGUE; EPILEPSY; DIAGNOSIS; CLASSIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; DURATION; CHILDREN; UTILITY	Purpose: We evaluate outcome of in-home diagnostic ambulatory video-EEG monitoring (AVEM) performed on a nationwide cohort of patients over one calendar year, and we compare our findings with outcomes of inpatient adult and pediatric VEM performed during the same year at two academic epilepsy centers. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study. We obtained AVEM outcome data from an independent ambulatory-EEG testing facility. Inpatient VEM data from a 4-bed adult epilepsy center and an 8-bed pediatric epilepsy center were also included. Primary outcome measure was composite percentage of VEM records with epileptiform activity on EEG tracings or at least one video-recorded pushbutton event. We assessed patient-reported symptoms documented in AVEM event diaries. Results: Of 9221 AVEM recordings performed across 28 states, 62.5% attained primary outcome. At least one patient-activated pushbutton event was captured on video in 54% of AVEM recordings (53.6% in adults, 56.1% in children). Epileptiform activity was reported in 1657 (18.0%) AVEM recordings (1473 [88.9%] only interictal, 9 [0.5%] only ictal, 175 [10.6%] both interictal and ictal). Most common patient-reported symptomatology during AVEM pushbutton events was behavioral/autonomic/emotional in adults and children. Compared to AVEM, inpatient VEM captured more confirmed representative events in adult and pediatric samples. Conclusions: AVEM is useful for non-urgent diagnostic evaluation of events.

Examining factors related to accelerated long-term forgetting in epilepsy using ambulatory EEG monitoring	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Sleep; Verbal memory; Visual memory; Mood; Memory questionnaires; Discharges	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; DECLARATIVE MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; VERBAL MEMORY; SLEEP; AMNESIA; ASSOCIATION; IMPAIRMENT; SEIZURES; SEVERITY	Purpose Some patients with epilepsy demonstrate normal memory when this is tested at relatively short intervals (e.g., 30min), but substantial loss over longer delay periods (e.g., days or weeks) when compared to healthy control subjects. This pattern of accelerated long-term forgetting (ALF) affects the everyday lives of patients, yet goes undetected by standard neuropsychological memory tests, and its pathophysiologic basis is poorly understood. By testing memory over a period of concurrent ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG), the current study aimed to investigate possible factors contributing to ALF. Methods Thirty-nine patients diagnosed with epilepsy or probable epilepsy underwent 5days of continuous ambulatory EEG: 18 had normal EEG studies, 10 had focal epileptic discharges, 5 had generalized epileptic discharges, and 6 had one or more seizures. Fifteen matched healthy control subjects also participated, but did not undergo EEG. Subjects were taught 13-item word and design lists to criterion, and recall was tested at 30min, 24h, and 4days. Subjects also completed questionnaires pertaining to everyday memory and mood. Key Findings Group analyses (excluding patients who experienced seizures during monitoring) indicated that patients who experienced generalized discharges during the 24-h to 4-day delay intervals showed higher rates of forgetting for nonverbal information. Those with focal discharges showed ALF between 30min and 4days for verbal information, whereas those with normal EEGs over the 4days recording had no evidence of ALF. Surprisingly, mood and epilepsy variables (such as duration of disease or number of anticonvulsant medications) showed no significant correlation with ALF. Although no aspect of nighttime sleep architecture was found to be related to recall after the first 24h, daytime naps were associated with better retention. Self-report of everyday memory functioning was related to recall at longer delays, but not at 30min. Significance The present findings indicated that ALF in epilepsy is associated with subclinical discharges rather than antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), mood or sleep disturbance. Measures of longer-term recall can reveal correlations with subjective everyday memory complaints that are not evident when recall is only tested at a standard (30min) delay interval. These findings have the potential to improve treatment strategies for patients who complain of memory difficulties.

This makes the discrimination of cognitive states during different motor imagery tasks within the same limb, very challenging; particularly when using electroencephalography (EEG) signals, as they share close spatial representations. Following that more research is needed in this area, as successfully discriminating different imaginary movements within the same limb, in form of a single cognitive entity, could potentially increase the dimensionality of control signals in a braincomputer interface (BCI) system. This report presents our research outcomes in the discrimination of left foot-knee vs. right foot-knee movement imagery signals extracted from EEG. Each cognitive state task outcome was evaluated by the analysis of eventrelated desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS). Results reflecting prominent ERD/ ERS, to draw the difference between each cognitive task, are presented in the form of topographical scalp plots and average time course of percentage power ERD/ ERS. Possibility of any contralateral dominance during each task was also investigated. We have compared the topographical distributions and based on the results we were able to distinguish between the activation of different cortical areas during foot and knee movement imagery tasks. Currently, there are no reports in the literature on discrimination of different tasks within the same lower-limb. Hence, an attempt towards getting a step closer to this has been done. Presented results could be the basis for control signals used in a cognitive infocommunication (CogInfoCom) system to restore locomotion function in a wearable lower-limb rehabilitation system, which can assist patients with spinal cord injury (SCI).

First published July 13, 2011; doi: 10.1152/jn.00104.2011.-Chronic recordings from ensembles of cortical neurons in primary motor and somatosensory areas in rhesus macaques provide accurate information about bipedal locomotion (Fitzsimmons NA, Lebedev MA, Peikon ID, Nicolelis MA. Front Integr Neurosci 3: 3, 2009). Here we show that the linear and angular kinematics of the ankle, knee, and hip joints during both normal and precision (attentive) human treadmill walking can be inferred from noninvasive scalp electroencephalography (EEG) with decoding accuracies comparable to those from neural decoders based on multiple single-unit activities (SUAs) recorded in nonhuman primates. Six healthy adults were recorded. Participants were asked to walk on a treadmill at their self-selected comfortable speed while receiving visual feedback of their lower limbs (i.e., precision walking), to repeatedly avoid stepping on a strip drawn on the treadmill belt. Angular and linear kinematics of the left and right hip, knee, and ankle joints and EEG were recorded, and neural decoders were designed and optimized with cross-validation procedures. Of note, the optimal set of electrodes of these decoders were also used to accurately infer gait trajectories in a normal walking task that did not require subjects to control and monitor their foot placement. Our results indicate a high involvement of a fronto-posterior cortical network in the control of both precision and normal walking and suggest that EEG signals can be used to study in real time the cortical dynamics of walking and to develop brain-machine interfaces aimed at restoring human gait function.

Usually, the BCI is applied to the subjects in sitting conditions to have high quality of the EEG. Such limited condition has prevented the users to use the novel interfacing system in their ordinary lives. In this paper, toward the lifelog application, we developed a prototype of wearable BCI system which enables us to operate it in ambulatory condition in outdoor environment. By using the auditory stimulations in oddball paradigm, the EEG was recorded in learning phase, and the classification of P300 signals was performed in the following testing phase. The users equipped the system and walked in outdoor to make online lifelog indexing. As the results, in this preliminary study, it is suggested that the BCI system could successfully record the target scenes in real-time only from the user's brain activities.

Understanding the neurophysiological difference between "voluntary stopping" and "involuntary stopping" caused by FOG is vital for the detection of and potential intervention for FOG in the daily lives of patients. This study characterised the electroencephalographic (EEG) signature associated with FOG in contrast to voluntary stopping. The protocol consisted of a timed up-and-go (TUG) task and an additional TUG task with a voluntary stopping component, where participants reacted to verbal "stop" and "walk" instructions by voluntarily stopping or walking. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) analysis was performed to study the dynamics of the EEG spectra induced by different walking phases, including normal walking, voluntary stopping and episodes of involuntary stopping (FOG), as well as the transition windows between normal walking and voluntary stopping or FOG. These results demonstrate for the first time that the EEG signal during the transition from walking to voluntary stopping is distinguishable from that during the transition to involuntary stopping caused by FOG. The EEG signature of voluntary stopping exhibits a significantly decreased power spectrum compared with that of FOG episodes, with distinctly different patterns in the delta and low-beta power in the central area. These findings suggest the possibility of a practical EEG-based tool that can accurately predict FOG episodes, excluding the potential confounding of voluntary stopping.

Previous studies have demonstrated changes in behavior and gait with increased sensory and cognitive load, but the underlying cortical mechanisms remain largely unknown. In the present study. in a mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) approach, 16 young adults walked on a treadmill with high-density EEG while 3-dimensional (3D) motion capture tracked kinematics of the head and feet. Visual load was manipulated with the presentation of optic flow with and without continuous mediolateral perturbations. The effects of cognitive load were assessed by the performance of a go/no-go task on half of the blocks. During increased sensory load, participants walked with shorter and wider strides. which may indicate a more restrained pattern of gait. Interestingly. cognitive task engagement attenuated these effects of sensory load on gait. Using an independent component analysis and dipole-filling approach, we found that cautious gait was accompanied by neuro-oscillatory modulations localized to frontal (supplementary motor area, anterior cingulate cortex) and parietal (inferior parietal lobule, precuneus) areas. Our results show suppression in alpha/mu (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) rhythms. suggesting enhanced activation of these regions with unreliable sensory inputs. These findings provide insight into the neural correlates of gait adaptation and may be particularly relevant to older adults who are less able to adjust to ongoing cognitive and sensory demands while walking. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The neural underpinnings of gait adaptation in humans are poorly understood. To this end, we recorded high-density EEG combined with three-dimensional body motion tracking as participants walked on a treadmill while exposed to full-field optic flow stimulation. Perturbed visual input led to a more cautious gait pattern with neuro-oscillatory modulations localized to premotor and parietal regions. Our findings show a possible brain-behavior link that might further our understanding of gait and mobility impairments.

The purpose of our study analyzes the use of brain-computer interface (BCI), wearable technology, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the aesthetic processing of visual neural response to UI and UX designs. Specifically, this review aims to understand neuroaesthetic processing knowledge, aesthetic appreciation models, and the ways in which visual brain studies can improve the quality of current and future UI and UX designs. Recent research has found that subjective evaluations of aesthetic appreciation produce different results for objective evaluations of brain research analysis. We applied SWOT analysis and examined the advantages and disadvantages of both evaluation methods. Furthermore, we conducted a traditional literature review on topics pertaining to the use of aesthetic processing knowledge in the visual interaction field in terms of art therapy, information visualization, website or mobile applications, and other interactive platforms. Our main research findings from current studies have helped and motivated researchers and designers to use convincing scientific knowledge of brain event-related potential, electroencephalography, and fMRI to understand aesthetic judgment. The key trend finds that many designers, artists, and engineers use artistic BCI technology in the visual interaction experience. Herein, the scientific methods applied in the aesthetic appreciation to human-computer interface are summarized, and the influence of the latest wearable brain technology on visual interaction design is discussed. Furthermore, current possible research entry points for aesthetics, usability, and creativity in UI and UX designs are explicated. The study results have implications for the visual user experience research domain as well as for interaction industries, which produce interactive projects to improve people's daily lives.

Energy-Efficient Data Reduction Techniques for Wireless Seizure Detection Systems	SENSORS			English	Article						electroencephalography; wireless sensor networks; seizure detection; compressive sensing; feature extraction	EEG RECORDINGS; SELECTION; EPILEPSY; ONSET	The emergence of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has motivated a paradigm shift in patient monitoring and disease control. Epilepsy management is one of the areas that could especially benefit from the use of WSN. By using miniaturized wireless electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors, it is possible to perform ambulatory EEG recording and real-time seizure detection outside clinical settings. One major consideration in using such a wireless EEG-based system is the stringent battery energy constraint at the sensor side. Different solutions to reduce the power consumption at this side are therefore highly desired. The conventional approach incurs a high power consumption, as it transmits the entire EEG signals wirelessly to an external data server (where seizure detection is carried out). This paper examines the use of data reduction techniques for reducing the amount of data that has to be transmitted and, thereby, reducing the required power consumption at the sensor side. Two data reduction approaches are examined: compressive sensing-based EEG compression and low-complexity feature extraction. Their performance is evaluated in terms of seizure detection effectiveness and power consumption. Experimental results show that by performing low-complexity feature extraction at the sensor side and transmitting only the features that are pertinent to seizure detection to the server, a considerable overall saving in power is achieved. The battery life of the system is increased by 14 times, while the same seizure detection rate as the conventional approach (95%) is maintained.

One suggested reason for this discrepancy is that the processes underpinning lexical access to semantic knowledge may be sensitive to ageing. It is therefore necessary to assess semantic memory utilising tasks that are not explicitly linguistic. In this study, a fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS) paradigm coupled with EEG was used to assess the ability of younger and older adults to automatically distinguish between images by their semantic category. Participants were presented with a 6 Hz stream of images drawn from one semantic category except every fifth image (occurring at a rate of 1.2 Hz) which was drawn from an alternate semantic category. For both younger and older adults, results demonstrate successful and comparable semantic categorisation. This was detectable at the individual level for 71% and 72% of older and younger adults, respectively. Given the rapid presentation rate and absence of explicit instruction to categorise images, the task is unlikely to utilise linguistic strategies and suggests the maintenance of semantic memory in healthy ageing.

Seizure Forecasting Using a Novel Sub-Scalp Ultra-Long Term EEG Monitoring System	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						seizure; seizure cycles; seizure forecasting; epilepsy; implantable device; sub scalp	EPILEPSY; PATIENT	Accurate identification of seizure activity, both clinical and subclinical, has important implications in the management of epilepsy. Accurate recognition of seizure activity is essential for diagnostic, management and forecasting purposes, but patient-reported seizures have been shown to be unreliable. Earlier work has revealed accurate capture of electrographic seizures and forecasting is possible with an implantable intracranial device, but less invasive electroencephalography (EEG) recording systems would be optimal. Here, we present preliminary results of seizure detection and forecasting with a minimally invasive sub-scalp device that continuously records EEG. Five participants with refractory epilepsy who experience at least two clinically identifiable seizures monthly have been implanted with sub-scalp devices (Minder (R)), providing two channels of data from both hemispheres of the brain. Data is continuously captured via a behind-the-ear system, which also powers the device, and transferred wirelessly to a mobile phone, from where it is accessible remotely via cloud storage. EEG recordings from the sub-scalp device were compared to data recorded from a conventional system during a 1-week ambulatory video-EEG monitoring session. Suspect epileptiform activity (EA) was detected using machine learning algorithms and reviewed by trained neurophysiologists. Seizure forecasting was demonstrated retrospectively by utilizing cycles in EA and previous seizure times. The procedures and devices were well-tolerated and no significant complications have been reported. Seizures were accurately identified on the sub-scalp system, as visually confirmed by periods of concurrent conventional scalp EEG recordings. The data acquired also allowed seizure forecasting to be successfully undertaken. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC score) achieved (0.88), which is comparable to the best score in recent, state-of-the-art forecasting work using intracranial EEG.

Detection of Gait Initiation Failure in Parkinson's Disease Patients using EEG Signals	2016 38TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 16-20, 2016	Orlando, FL	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; BETA-ACTIVITY	Gait Initiation Failure (GIF) is one of the most disabling gait disturbances seen in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Gait Initiation is a complex motor task that requires motor and cognitive processing to enable the correct selection, timing and scaling of movement. Failure to initiate the first step often precipitates falls and leads to significant morbidity. However, the brain mechanisms underlying GIF remain unknown. This study utilized an ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG) technique to investigate the brain dynamic changes underlying GIF and aims to detect the occurrence of GIF in four PD patients. We sought to determine whether episodes of GIF might be associated with a characteristic brain signal that could be detected by surface EEG. This preliminary investigation analyzed the EEG signals through power spectra density (PSD) and centroid frequency (CF) to show that the GIF episodes were associated with significant increases in the high beta band (21-38Hz) across the central, frontal, occipital and parietal EEG sites. By implementing PSD and CF as input features with two-layer Back Propagation neural networks as a classifier, the proposed system was able to detect GIF events with a classification performance of 84.27% sensitivity and 84.80% accuracy. This is the first study to show cortical dynamic changes associated with GIF in Parkinson's disease, providing valuable information to enhance the performance of future GIF detection that could be translated into clinical practice.

Identifying signal-dependent information about the preictal state: A comparison across ECoG, EEG and EKG using deep learning	EBIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Epilepsy; Seizure prediction; Electrocardiogram; Deep neural networks; Precision medicine	SEIZURE PREDICTION; EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; LONG	Background: The inability to reliably assess seizure risk is a major burden for epilepsy patients and prevents developing better treatments. Recent advances have paved the way for increasingly accurate seizure preictal state detection algorithms, primarily using electrocorticography (ECoG). To develop seizure forecasting for broad clinical and ambulatory use, however, less complex and invasive modalities are needed. Algorithms using scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (EKG) have also achieved better than chance performance. But it remains unknown how much preictal information is in ECoG versus modalities amenable to everyday use - such as EKG and single channel EEG - and how to optimally extract that preictal information for seizure prediction. Methods: We apply deep learning - a powerful method to extract information from complex data - on a large epilepsy data set containing multi-day, simultaneous recordings of EKG, ECoG, and EEG, using a variety of feature sets. We use the relative performance of our algorithms to compare the preictal information contained in each modality. Results: We find that single-channel EKG contains a comparable amount of preictal information as scalp EEG with up to 21 channels and that preictal information is best extracted not with standard heart rate measures, but from the power spectral density. We report that preictal information is not preferentially contained in EEG or ECoG channels within the seizure onset zone. Conclusion: Collectively, these insights may help to devise future prospective, minimally invasive long-term epilepsy monitoring trials with single-channel EKG as a particularly promising modality.

In this work, we propose a novel entropy-based machine learning method to classify between standing and walking conditions from the sole brain activity. The Shannon entropy has been used as a complexity measure of electroencephalography (EEG) signals and subject-specific features for classification have been selected by Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) filter. Exploiting these features with a linear classifier, we achieved > 85% of classification accuracy over a long period (approximate to 25 min) of standing and treadmill walking on 11 healthy subjects. Moreover, we implemented the proposed approach to successfully discriminate in real-time between standing and over-ground walking on one healthy subject. We suggest that the reliable discrimination of rest against walking conditions achieved by the proposed method may be exploited to have more stable control of devices to restore locomotion, avoiding unpredictable and dangerous behaviors due to the delivery of undesired control commands.

As cortical signals recorded by the EEG are very weak, they are often obscured by motion artifacts and various non-brain physiological activities, such as eye movement, heart rhythms, and muscle activity, adversely affecting subsequent analysis and interpretation. Over the past decades, a number of techniques have been developed for preprocessing EEG recordings to improve the signal-tonoise ratio. However, based on our extensive literature survey, despite an increasing trend recently, only 14.72% of published studies on EEG preprocessing were involved with the removal of electromygraphic (EMG) artifacts. Given that ambulatory healthcare systems are continuously emerging, artifacts induced by muscle contraction become unavoidable, whereas in the past data tended to be collected in well-controlled clinical/laboratory settings. Motivated by the fact that EMG artifact removal is becoming an important issue to be addressed, we investigated the state-of-the-art muscle artifact removal methods systematically and comparatively, from the perspective of signal processing. In this review, we first present the signal characteristics from brain and muscle activity, and highlight the importance of this issue for subsequent artifact removal. We then provide an overview and taxonomy of representative methods. Based on the results in reported studies, we describe the pros and cons of different methods and give suggestions on selecting a suitable technique in different scenarios (e.g., single-channel, few-channel, and multichannel). Finally, we discuss remaining challenges and provide feasible recommendations for further exploration in this field.

However, wearable robotics increases the risk from falling. Neuroimaging studies have provided evidence for the involvement of frontocentral and parietal cortices in postural control and this opens up the possibility of using decoders for early detection of balance loss by using electroencephalography (EEG). This study investigates the presence of commonly identified components of the perturbation evoked responses (PEP) when a person is in an exoskeleton. We also evaluated the feasibility of using single-trial EEG to predict the loss of balance using a convolution neural network. Overall, the model achieved a mean 5-fold cross-validation test accuracy of 75.2 % across six subjects with 50% as the chance level. We employed a gradient class activation map-based visualization technique for interpreting the decisions of the CNN and demonstrated that the network learns from PEP components present in these single trials. The high localization ability of Grad-CAM demonstrated here, opens up the possibilities for deploying CNN for ERP/PEP analysis while emphasizing on model interpretability.

Using the MoBI motion capture system to rapidly and accurately localize EEG electrodes in anatomic space	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; electrode locations; motion capture		During mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) experiments, electroencephalography and motion capture systems are used in concert to record high temporal resolution neural activity and movement kinematics while participants perform demanding perceptual and cognitive tasks in a naturalistic environment. A typical MoBI setup involves positioning multi-channel electrode caps based on anatomical fiducials as well as experimenter and participant intuition regarding the scalp midpoint location (i.e., Cz). Researchers often use the "template" electrode locations provided by the manufacturer, however, the "actual" electrode locations can vary based on each participant's head morphology. Accounting for differences in head morphologies could provide more accurate clinical diagnostic information when using MoBI to identify neurological deficits in patients with motor, sensory, or cognitive impairments. Here, we asked whether the existing motion capture system used in a MoBI setup could be easily adapted to improve spatial localization of electrodes across participants without requiring additional or specialized equipment that might impede clinical adoption. Using standard electrode configurations, infrared markers were placed on a subset of electrodes and anatomical fiducials, and the remaining electrode locations were estimated using spherical or ellipsoid models. We identified differences in event-related potentials between "template" and "actual" electrode locations during a Go/No-Go task (p < 9.8e-5) and an object-manipulation task (p < 9.8e-5). Thus, the motion capture system already used in MoBI experiments can be effectively deployed to accurately register and quantify the neural activity. Improving the spatial localization without needing specialized hardware or additional setup time to the workflow has important real-world implications for translating MoBI to clinical environments.

Designing circuits and systems capable of high-quality EEG recording regardless of these artifacts requires a clear understanding of how the electrode-skin interface is affected by physical motions. In this work, first, we report statistically-significant experimental characterization results of electrode-skin interface impedance for dry contact and non-contact electrodes in the presence of various motions. This leads to a model describing the motion-induced electrode-skin interface impedance variations for these electrodes. Next, a critical review of the possible analog front-end circuits for surface EEG recording is presented, followed by theoretical circuit analysis discussing the effect of electrode movements on the operation of these circuits. Inspired by the developed model and the analytical review, a novel front-end architecture capable of extracting motion from the EEG signal during the amplification stage is presented and experimentally characterized.

In order to study cortical activity during real locomotion, electroencephalography (EEG) appears to be particularly appropriate. It is now possible to record changes in cortical neural synchronization/desynchronization during gait. Studying gait initiation is also of particular interest because it implies motor and cognitive cortical control to adequately perform a step. Time-frequency analysis enables to study induced changes in EEG activity in different frequency bands. Such analysis reflects cortical activity implied in stabilized gait control but also in more challenging tasks (obstacle crossing, changes in speed, dual tasks horizontal ellipsis ). These spectral patterns are directly influenced by the walking context but, when analyzing gait with a more demanding attentional task, cortical areas other than the sensorimotor cortex (prefrontal, posterior parietal cortex, etc.) seem specifically implied. While the muscular activity of legs and cortical activity are coupled, the precise role of the motor cortex to control the level of muscular contraction according to the gait task remains debated. The decoding of this brain activity is a necessary step to build valid brain-computer interfaces able to generate gait artificially.

Prevalence and clinical correlates of non-convulsive status epilepticus in elderly patients with acute confusional state: A systematic literature review	JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						Non-convulsive status epilepticus; Elderly; Acute confusional state; Electroencephalography	NONEPILEPTIC ATTACK DISORDER; ABSENCE STATUS; AMBULATORY ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; EEG TERMINOLOGY; LATE-ONSET; EPILEPSY; CRITERIA; ADULTS; CONSCIOUSNESS; EPIDEMIOLOGY	Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is a potentially treatable condition that poses considerable diagnostic challenges. NCSE is thought to be more common in the elderly than in the general population, however additional diagnostic challenges complicate its recognition in older patients, because of the wide differential diagnosis with common underlying causes of acute confusional state in this age group. We set out to review the existing evidence on the clinical correlates of NCSE in the elderly population. A systematic literature review was conducted according to the methodological standards outlined in the PRISMA statement to assess the clinical correlates of NCSE in patients aged 60 or older. Our literature search identified 11 relevant studies, which confirmed that the incidence of NCSE increases with age, in particular with regard to focal forms with impairment of consciousness. Female gender, history of epilepsy (or a recently witnessed seizure with motor features), and abnormal ocular movements appeared to correlate with the diagnosis of NCSE in the elderly, prompting prioritization of electroencephalography tests for diagnostic confirmation. Epidemiological data in the elderly vary widely because of the heterogeneity of definitions and diagnostic criteria applied across different studies. Based on our findings, it is recommended to keep a low threshold for requesting electroencephalography tests to confirm the diagnosis of NCSE in elderly patients with acute confusional state, even in the presence of a presumed symptomatic cause.

The purpose of this study is to assess the characteristics of ambulatory EEGs before the decision to withdraw AEDs and to clarify potential influencing factors for abnormal EEGs. Methods: 214 epileptic patients were included in the study. These patients were seizure-free for 3-5 years on AED medication. Ambulatory 24-h EEGs were performed before the decision to withdraw AEDs. The demographical data and clinical information of the patients were used for the analysis of influencing factors for EEG findings. Results: Ambulatory EEGs showed abnormalities in 41.1% of the patients (88/214). Of 88 patients with abnormal EEGs, 43 had unequivocal epileptic discharges; and 45 only had nonspecific EEG abnormalities. In our analysis, the potential factors for abnormal EEGs included female, delayed therapy, longer duration of intractability/treatment response time and medications failed. Conclusions: In many patients ambulatory EEGs remain abnormal even after seizure-free for 3-5 years; and many factors influenced the characteristics of the EEGs. The findings can assist in establishment of therapeutic principles. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Deciphered intents, after detecting electrical signals from the human scalp, are translated into control commands used to operate external devices, computer displays and virtual objects in the real-time. BCI provides an augmentative communication by creating a muscle-free channel between the brain and the output devices, primarily for subjects having neuromotor disorders, or trauma to nervous system, notably spinal cord injuries (SCI), and subjects with unaffected sensorimotor functions but disarticulated or amputated residual limbs. This review identifies the potentials of electroencephalography (EEG) based BCI applications for locomotion and mobility rehabilitation. Patients could benefit from its advancements such as wearable lower-limb (LL) exoskeletons, orthosis, prosthesis, wheelchairs, and assistive-robot devices. The EEG communication signals employed by the aforementioned applications that also provide feasibility for future development in the field are sensorimotor rhythms (SMR), event-related potentials (ERP) and visual evoked potentials (VEP). The review is an effort to progress the development of user's mental task related to LL for BCI reliability and confidence measures. As a novel contribution, the reviewed BCI control paradigms for wearable LL and assistive-robots are presented by a general control framework fitting in hierarchical layers. It reflects informatic interactions, between the user, the BCI operator, the shared controller, the robotic device and the environment. Each sub layer of the BCI operator is discussed in detail, highlighting the feature extraction, classification and execution methods employed by the various systems. All applications' key features and their interaction with the environment are reviewed for the EEG-based activity mode recognition, and presented in form of a table. It is suggested to structure EEG-BCI controlled LL assistive devices within the presented framework, for future generation of intent-based multifunctional controllers. Despite the development of controllers, for BCI-based wearable or assistive devices that can seamlessly integrate user intent, practical challenges associated with such systems exist and have been discerned, which can be constructive for future developments in the field.

Injury occurs in the EMU, including reports of death. No standardized patient safety protocols exist. Our objective is to determine the frequency and contributing factors to injury in the EMU. We reviewed medical records and video EEG of patients with epilepsy admitted to our EMU from December 1, 2008 to June 1, 2009. Data was collected on seizure type, onset, length, and frequency. Seizure related falls, injury, and adverse events were recorded. Data regarding the physical environment and treatment during seizures were analyzed too. 20 patients with 170 seizures were collected. Of the 170 total seizures captured, only 1 injury (0.6%) and 6 falls occurred (3.5%). 5 of the 6 falls were related to patients being ambulatory. No seizures resulted in prolonged stay. Of the 170 seizures captured, other adverse events included I status epilepticus (0.6%), 2 postictal aggression (1.2%), 4 objects in mouth (2.4%), 14 ambulatory at seizure onset (8.2%) and 5 postictal ambulation from bed (2.9%). Staff responded to 69 out of 170 seizures (40.6%). Of the 101 seizures without staff response, 57 seizures were electrographic without seizure detection software or push button activation. Falls and adverse events that can lead to injury occur in the EMU, yet the degree of actual injury is minimal. To improve safety outcomes, standardized protocols with appropriate outlined nursing care and procedures for continuous monitoring of patients by staff need to be employed.

Purpose: The impact of exercise on brain function has gained broad interest. Because hemodynamic and imaging studies are difficult to perform during and after exercise, electroencephalography (EEG) is often the method of choice. Within this study, we aimed 1) to extend prior work examining changes in scalp-recorded brain electrical activity associated with exercise and 2) to use a distributed source localization algorithm (standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography [sLORETA]) to model the probable neural sources of changes in EEG activity after exercise. Methods: Electrocortical activity of 22 recreational runners (21-45 yr) was recorded before and after exhaustive treadmill ergometry. Data were analyzed using sLORETA. Results: There was an increase in alpha-1 activity (7.5-10 Hz) immediately after exercise, which was localized to the left frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 8). This finding is consistent with alterations in emotional processing. Fifteen minutes after exercise, a decrease in alpha-2 (10-12.5 Hz), beta-1 (12.5-18 Hz), and gamma activities (35-48 Hz) was observed in Brodmann areas 18 and 20-22, which are well known to be involved in language processing. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that sLORETA is a robust method that allows brain activity maps to be generated from standardized EEG recordings following exercise.

The objectives were to examine the seizure duration and interseizure interval (ISI), their relationship to each other, and the effect of these features on the clinical manifestation of events. MethodsChronic ambulatory intracranial EEG data acquired for the purpose of seizure prediction were analyzed and annotated. A detection algorithm identified potential seizure activity, which was manually confirmed. Events were classified as clinically corroborated, electroencephalographically identical but not clinically corroborated, or subclinical. K-means cluster analysis supplemented by finite mixture modeling was used to locate groupings of seizure duration and ISI. ResultsQuantitative analyses confirmed well-resolved groups of seizure duration and ISIs, which were either mono-modal or multimodal, and highly subject specific. Subjects with a single population of seizures were linked to improved seizure prediction outcomes. There was a complex relationship between clinically manifest seizures, seizure duration, and interval. SignificanceThese data represent the first opportunity to reliably investigate the statistics of seizure occurrence in a realistic, long-term setting. The presence of distinct duration groups implies that the evolution of seizures follows a predetermined course. Patterns of seizure activity showed considerable variation between individuals, but were highly predictable within individuals. This finding indicates seizure dynamics are characterized by subject-specific time scales; therefore, temporal distributions of seizures should also be interpreted on an individual level. Identification of duration and interval subgroups may provide a new avenue for improving seizure prediction.

In this study, the temporal and spatial characteristics of averaged electrocortical activity during treadmill walking in healthy subjects was assessed. Electroencephalography data were recorded from 32 scalp locations, averaged across trials, and related to phases of the gait cycle based on the detection of left heel strike. A characteristic temporal pattern of positive and negative potentials, similar to movement-related cortical potentials, and related to the gait cycle was observed over the cortical leg representation area. Source localization analysis revealed that mainly the primary somatosensory, somatosensory association, primary motor and cingulate cortex were activated during walking. The negative peaks of the gait-related cortical potential were associated with activity predominantly in the cingulate and prefrontal cortex, while the primary motor, primary somatosensory and somatosensory association cortex were mainly active during the positive peaks. This study identified gait-related cortical potentials during walking. The results indicate a widely distributed cortical network involved in gait control. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The retrosplenial complex (RSC) is an integral part of coordination and translation between spatial reference frames. Previous studies have demonstrated that the RSC is active during a spatial navigation tasks. The specifics of RSC activity under various navigation loads, however, are still not characterized. This study investigated the local information processed by the RSC under various navigation load conditions manipulated by the number of turns in the physical navigation setup. The results showed that the local information processed via the RSC, which was reflected by the segregation network, was higher when the number of turns increased, suggesting that RSC activity is associated with the navigation task load. The present findings shed light on how the brain processes spatial information in a physical navigation task.

Here, we characterized how EEG complexity, as indexed by Multiscale Permutation Entropy (MSPE), changed progressively in the evening prior to light off and during the transition from wakefulness to sleep. We further explored whether MSPE was able to discriminate between wakefulness and sleep around sleep onset and whether MSPE changes were correlated with spectral measures of the EEG related to sleep need during concomitant wakefulness (theta power-P-theta: 4-8 Hz). To address these questions, we took advantage of large datasets of several hundred of ambulatory EEG recordings of individual of both sexes aged 25-101 years. Results show that MSPE significantly decreases before light off (i.e. before sleep time) and in the transition from wakefulness to sleep onset. Furthermore, MSPE allows for an excellent discrimination between pre-sleep wakefulness and early sleep. Finally, we show that MSPE is correlated with concomitant P-theta. Yet, the direction of the latter correlation changed from before light-off to the transition to sleep. Given the association between EEG complexity and consciousness, MSPE may track efficiently putative changes in consciousness preceding sleep onset. An MSPE stands as a comprehensive measure that is not limited to a given frequency band and reflects a progressive change brain state associated with sleep and wakefulness regulation. It may be an effective mean to detect when the brain is in a state close to sleep onset.

A growing body of evidence suggests that ADpatients have a higher risk to develop epileptic seizures; however, results are contradictory due to different methodological approaches of previous studies. Objective: We aimed to identify the prevalence, semiology, and risk factors of epilepsy in AD using long-term EEG. Methods: We selected forty-two AD patients and examined them using 24-hour ambulatory EEG. Neurological and epileptological data were collected with retro- and prospective methods. We analyzed the semiology of the identified seizures and the possible risk factors using logistic regression analysis. Results: We identified seizures confirmed by EEG in 24%. The majority of the seizures were aware focal (72%) without any motor activity (55%). We found epileptiform discharges without seizures in 28%. Patients with seizures and only with epileptic EEG activity showed similar clinical and demographical features. Higher education (OR: 1.8) and lower Addenbrooke Examination Score (OR: 0.9) were identified as risk factors of epilepsy. Increase of 0.1 point in the Verbal-Language/Orientation-Memory ratio (VLOM) was associated with higher epilepsy risk as well (OR: 2.9). Conclusion: Epilepsy is a frequent comorbidity of AD. Since most of the seizures are aware non-motor focal seizures, sensitive EEG techniques are required for precise diagnosis of epilepsy. Long-term ambulatory EEG is a safe and welltolerated option. Epileptiform EEG in AD signals the presence of concomitant epilepsy. Clinicians have to pay attention to comorbid epilepsy in dementia patients with high education, with high VLOM ratio and severe stage.

LIVE-streaming 3D images: A neuroscience approach to full-body illusions	BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS			English	Article						3D; Streaming; Augmented reality (AG); Virtual reality (VR); Game technology; Gaming; Full-body illusion (FBI); Out-of-body experience (OBE); Brain stimulation; Neuroscience methods; Rehabilitation	VIRTUAL-REALITY CHALLENGE; SELF-LOCATION; MECHANISMS; BRAIN; HALLUCINATION; PARTICIPANTS; EXPERIENCES; OWNERSHIP; PART	Inspired by recent technological advances in the gaming industry, we used capture cards to create and LIVE-stream high quality 3D-images. With this novel technique, we developed a real-life stereoscopic 3D full-body illusion paradigm (3D projection). Unlike previous versions of the full-body illusion that rely upon unwieldy head-mounted displays, this paradigm enables the unobstructed investigation of such illusions with neuroscience methods (e.g., transcranial direct current stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, electroencephalography, and near-infrared spectroscopy) and examination of their neural underpinnings. This paper has three aims: (i) to provide a step-by-step guide on how to implement 3D LIVE-streaming, (ii) to explain how this can be used to create a full-body illusion paradigm; and (iii) to present evidence that documents the effectiveness of our methods (de Boer et al., 2020), including suggestions for potential applications. Particularly significant is the fact that 3D LIVE-streaming is not GPU-intensive and can easily be applied to any device or screen that can display 3D images (e.g., TV, tablet, mobile phone). Therefore, these methods also have potential future clinical and commercial benefits. 3D LIVE-streaming could be used to enhance future clinical observations or educational tools, or potentially guide medical interventions with real-time high-quality 3D images. Alternatively, our methods can be used in future rehabilitation programs to aid recovery from nervous system injury (e.g., spinal cord injury, brain damage, limb loss) or in therapies aimed at alleviating psychosis symptoms. Finally, 3D LIVE-streaming could set a new standard for immersive online gaming as well as augmenting online and mobile experiences (e.g., video chat, social sharing/events).	[de Boer, D. M.

People collect their daily memorial moments and share with friends on the social network, which is an emerging lifestyle. We see great potential of lifelogging applications along with rapid recent growth of the wearables market, where more sensors are introduced to wearables, i.e., electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors, that can further sense the user's mental activities, e.g., emotions. In this article, we present the design and implementation of Memento, an emotion-driven lifelogging system on wearables. Memento integrates EEG sensors with smart glasses. Since memorable moments usually coincides with the user's emotional changes, Memento leverages the knowledge from the brain-computer-interface domain to analyze the EEG signals to infer emotions and automatically launch lifelogging based on that. Towards building Memento on Commercial off-the-shelf wearable devices, we study EEG signals in mobility cases and propose a multiple sensor fusion based approach to estimate signal quality. We present a customized two-phase emotion recognition architecture, considering both the affordability and efficiency of wearable-class devices.

Long-term use of computers, mobile phones, and tablets can cause eye soreness and fatigue, but can also cause more serious conditions including myopia, cataracts, and glaucoma. This study assesses changes in brain wave activity detected by eight electrodes targeting different brain regions to identify and assess the brain wave patterns in the regions associated with visual fatigue under various visual presentation methods. Furthermore, linear discriminant analysis and Min-Max scaling techniques are applied to develop a visual fatigue assessment model to quantify visual fatigue. Finally, experiments are run to assess the impact of screen size (smartphone, tablet, computer) and visual presentation mode (2D, 3D, AR, VR) on visual fatigue. This study finds that (1) the brain wave features which influence the reaction to 2D and 3D imaging are the delta and theta waves at the prefrontal Fp1 and Fp2 poles. When viewing AR images, the alpha bands at the O1 and O2 poles of the occipital lobe show a relatively clear impact, while the delta and theta waves at the C3 pole in the left center area are associated with VR images; (2) larger screens cause greater visual fatigue, indicating that excessive visual stimulation will increase visual loading and thus produce greater visual fatigue; (3) the results show that VR can cause quite severe visual fatigue, along with motion sickness passed on sensory mismatch. Therefore, it is recommended to avoid viewing experiences that are inconsistent with the brain's physiological experience, such as walking while viewing a mobile phone, or reading in a moving car. The proposed visual fatigue assessment model provides easy and objective quantification of visual fatigue indicators, contributing to the reduction of risk for eye injury and disease.

Neurological assessment, outside of a highly-equipped clinical setting, requires an ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG) headset. This study aimed to quantify neurological biomarkers during a resting state and two different scenarios of driving states in a virtual driving environment. We investigated the neurological responses of seventeen healthy male drivers. EEG data were measured in an initial resting state, city-roadways driving state, and expressway driving state using a portable EEG headset in a driving simulator. During the experiment, the participants drove while experiencing cognitive workloads due to various driving environments, such as road traffic conditions, lane changes of surrounding vehicles, the speed limit, etc. The power of the beta and gamma bands decreased, and the power of the delta waves, theta, and frontal theta asymmetry increased in the driving state relative to the resting state. Delta-alpha ratio (DAR) and delta-theta ratio (DTR) showed a strong correlation with a resting state, city-roadways driving state, and expressway driving state. Binary machine-learning (ML) classification models showed a near-perfect accuracy between the resting state and driving state. Moderate classification performances were observed between the resting state, city-roadways state, and expressway state in multi-class classification. An EEG-based neurological state prediction approach may be utilized in an advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS).

We used electrophysiological data (electroencephalography; EEG, electromyography; EMG, and electro-oculography; EOG) to characterize sleep states in calves and examined how well observations of resting behaviour were correlated with the electrophysiological data. We obtained 20 h of EEG, EMG and EOG recordings from each of six pair-housed dairy calves using an ambulatory EEG recording device, while recording their resting posture via direct observation. Visual scoring of the electrophysiological data was used to distinguish between awake, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep during 30 s epochs. Calves were asleep for a mean (+/-S.D.) 25% (+/-2.0) of all observations in 50 (+/-22) bouts of 5 (+/-2) min per day. NREM sleep composed 55% (+/-7) and REM sleep 45% (+/-7) of the calves' total sleep time. Both types of sleep occurred in short bouts of 2-3 min. According to electrophysiological data, calves were awake during 81% (+/-9) of the 30 s-epochs when the calf was standing or resting with its head lifted up and moving. Observations of "the calf resting head lifted up still" predicted 55% (+/-9) of the epochs of NREM sleep. The best behavioural predictor of REM sleep was "the calf resting with neck relaxed", which predicted 61% (+/-9) of the epochs of REMS. The calves' resting body postures can successfully be used to estimate calves' total duration of time asleep and duration of time spent in REM and NREM sleep states. However, there was less success in estimating the time spent in the different phases of sleep during each 30 s epoch. Electrophysiological data can be recorded non-invasively from freely-moving, group-housed calves and observations of resting behaviour can identify when calves are asleep, although further work is needed to use behaviour to identify the phases of sleep.

Those suffering from sleep disorders often present with symptoms of discontent with regard to sleep quality, timing and quantity, and these symptoms have an adverse impact on function and quality of life. A minimally invasive technique would be preferable in patients with psychiatric disorders, who tend to be sensitive to environmental change. Accordingly, we evaluated the performance of Zmachine Insight Plus, an ambulatory electroencephalography sleep monitor, in patients with psychiatric disorders. One hundred and three patients undergoing polysomnography were enrolled in this study. Zmachine Insight Plus was performed simultaneously with polysomnography. Total sleep time, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, light sleep (stages N1 and N2) and deep sleep (stage N3) were assessed. Total sleep time, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, REM sleep duration and non-REM sleep duration of Zmachine Insight Plus showed a significant correlation with those of polysomnography. Lower sleep efficiency and increased frequency of waking after sleep onset, the arousal index and the apnea-hypopnea index on polysomnography were significantly associated with the difference in sleep parameters between the two methods. Among patients with psychiatric disorders who are sensitive to environmental change, Zmachine Insight Plus would be a useful technique to objectively evaluate sleep quality.

A Preliminary Study of Muscular Artifact Cancellation in Single-Channel EEG	SENSORS			English	Article						EEG; single-channel; muscular artifacts; EEMD; JBSS	EMPIRICAL-MODE DECOMPOSITION; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SOURCE SEPARATION; MUSCLE ARTIFACT; REMOVAL; SIGNALS	Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings are often contaminated with muscular artifacts that strongly obscure the EEG signals and complicates their analysis. For the conventional case, where the EEG recordings are obtained simultaneously over many EEG channels, there exists a considerable range of methods for removing muscular artifacts. In recent years, there has been an increasing trend to use EEG information in ambulatory healthcare and related physiological signal monitoring systems. For practical reasons, a single EEG channel system must be used in these situations. Unfortunately, there exist few studies for muscular artifact cancellation in single-channel EEG recordings. To address this issue, in this preliminary study, we propose a simple, yet effective, method to achieve the muscular artifact cancellation for the single-channel EEG case. This method is a combination of the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and the joint blind source separation (JBSS) techniques. We also conduct a study that compares and investigates all possible single-channel solutions and demonstrate the performance of these methods using numerical simulations and real-life applications. The proposed method is shown to significantly outperform all other methods. It can successfully remove muscular artifacts without altering the underlying EEG activity. It is thus a promising tool for use in ambulatory healthcare systems.

Brief light stimulation during the mouse nocturnal activity phase simultaneously induces a decline in core temperature and locomotor activity followed by EEG-determined sleep. Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 304: R459-R471, 2013. First published January 30, 2013; doi: 10.1152/ajpregu.00460.2012.-Light exerts a variety of effects on mammals. Unexpectedly, one of these effects is the cessation of nocturnal locomotion and the induction of behavioral sleep (photosomnolence). Here, we extend the initial observations in several ways, including the fundamental demonstration that core body temperature (T-c) drops substantially (about 1.5 degrees C) in response to the light stimulation at CT15 or CT18 in a manner suggesting that the change is a direct response to light rather than simply a result of the locomotor suppression. The results show that 1) the decline of locomotion and T-c begin soon after nocturnal light stimulation; 2) the variability in the magnitude and onset of light-induced locomotor suppression is very large, whereas the variability in T-c is very small; 3) T-c recovers from the light-induced decline in advance of the recovery of locomotion; 4) under entrained and freerunning conditions, the daily late afternoon T-c increase occurs in advance of the corresponding increase in wheel running; and 5) toward the end of the subjective night, the nocturnally elevated T-c persists longer than does locomotor activity. Finally, EEG measurements confirm light-induced sleep and, when T-c or locomotion was measured, show their temporal association with sleep onset. Both EEG-and immobility-based sleep detection methods confirm rapid induction of light-induced sleep. The similarities between light-induced loss of locomotion and drop in T-c suggest a common cause for parallel responses. The photosomnolence response may be contingent upon both the absence of locomotion and a simultaneous low T-c.

Due to the limitations of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for real-world situations and its high costs, the aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of a mobile functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system. Two experiments dealing with brands and labels are used to discuss how and if neuromarketing can enrich marketing research and to what extent existing limitations and challenges can be overcome. In both experiments, differences in prefrontal cortex activity were measured. Thus, it is possible to measure brand- and label-related prefrontal cortex activation using fNIRS. As fNIRS is mobile and allows for experiments outside the laboratory, this considerably expands the field of usage of neuroimaging processes and can therefore decrease the costs of neuroimaging.

Only those studies performed for "possible seizures" due to motor phenomena and whose clinical events were captured on video were analyzed. A total of 52 studies were performed. Fourteen patients (27%) had epileptic seizures. Thirty-eight (73%) had nonepileptic events. These consisted of 12 (23%) with tremor-like movements, 7 (13.5%) with multifocal myoclonic jerks without electrographic changes, 7 (13.5%) with slow semipurposeful movements, and 10 with other movements. Therefore, seizure mimics in the ICU setting were diverse and distinct from the usual differential diagnosis of seizures seen in ambulatory patients.

Reduced dual-task gait speed is associated with visual Go/No-Go brain network activation in children and adolescents with concussion	BRAIN INJURY			English	Article						Locomotion; mild traumatic brain injury; electroencephalography; attention	BALANCE CONTROL; EXECUTIVE DYSFUNCTION; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; SINGLE-TASK; ATTENTION; INJURY; YOUNG; PERFORMANCE; STABILITY; RECOVERY	Objective: To investigate the association between dual-task gait performance and brain network activation (BNA) using an electroencephalography (EEG)-based Go/No-Go paradigm among children and adolescents with concussion. Methods: Participants with a concussion completed a visual Go/No-Go task with collection of electroencephalogram brain activity. Data were treated with BNA analysis, which involves an algorithmic approach to EEG-ERP activation quantification. Participants also completed a dual-task gait assessment. The relationship between dual-task gait speed and BNA was assessed using multiple linear regression models. Results: Participants (n=20, 13.9 +/- 2.3years of age, 50% female) were tested at a mean of 7.0 +/- 2.5days post-concussion and were symptomatic at the time of testing (post-concussion symptom scale=40.4 +/- 21.9). Slower dual-task average gait speed (mean=82.2 +/- 21.0cm/s) was significantly associated with lower relative time BNA scores (mean=39.6 +/- 25.8) during the No-Go task (=0.599, 95% CI=0.214, 0.985, p=0.005, R-2=0.405), while controlling for the effect of age and gender. Conclusion: Among children and adolescents with a concussion, slower dual-task gait speed was independently associated with lower BNA relative time scores during a visual Go/No-Go task. The relationship between abnormal gait behaviour and brain activation deficits may be reflective of disruption to multiple functional abilities after concussion.

Validation of a Wireless, Self-Application, Ambulatory Electroencephalographic Sleep Monitoring Device in Healthy Volunteers	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						sleep; ambulatory EEG; validation; polysomnography	AMERICAN-ACADEMY; REM-SLEEP; RELIABILITY; INSOMNIA; APNEA	Study Objectives: To evaluate the validity of an ambulatory electroencephalographic (EEG) monitor for the estimation of sleep continuity and architecture in healthy adults. Methods: Healthy, good sleeping participants (n = 14) were fit with both an ambulatory EEG monitor (Sleep Profiler) and a full polysomnography (PSG) montage. EEG recordings were gathered from both devices on the same night, during which sleep was permitted uninterrupted for eight hours. The study was set in an inpatient clinical research suite. PSG and Sleep Profiler records were scored by a neurologist board certified in sleep medicine, blinded to record identification. Agreement between the scored PSG record, the physician-scored Sleep Profiler record, and the Sleep Profiler record scored by an automatic algorithm was evaluated for each sleep stage, with the PSG record serving as the reference. Results: Results indicated strong percent agreement across stages. Kappa was strongest for Stage N3 and REM. Specificity was high for all stages; sensitivity was low for Wake and Stage N1, and high for Stage N2, Stage N3, and REM. Agreement indices improved for the manually scored Sleep Profiler record relative to the autoscore record. Conclusions: Overall, the Sleep Profiler yields an EEG record with comparable sleep architecture estimates to PSG. Future studies should evaluate agreement between devices with a clinical sample that has greater periods of wake in order to better understand utility of this device for estimating sleep continuity indices, such as sleep onset latency and wake after sleep onset.

Wireless Behind-the-Ear EEG Recording Device with Wireless Interface to a Mobile Device (iPhone/iPod Touch)	2014 36TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 26-30, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE Engn Medicine & Biol Soc				EEG remains the mainstay test for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with epilepsy. Unfortunately, ambulatory EEG systems are far from ideal for patients that have infrequent seizures. The systems only last up to 3 days and if a seizure is not captured during the recordings, the doctor cannot give a definite diagnosis of the patient's condition. The ambulatory systems also suffers from being too bulky and posing some constraints on the patient, such as not being able to shower during the recordings. This paper presents a novel behind-the-ear EEG recording device that uses an iPhone or iPod Touch to continuously upload the patient's data to a secure server. This device not only gives the doctors access to the EEG data in real time but it can be easily removed and re-applied by the patient at any time, thus reducing the interference with quality of life.

J	Faulkner, HJ; Arima, H; Mohamed, A				Faulkner, Howard J.; Arima, Hisatomi; Mohamed, Armin			Latency to first interictal epileptiform discharge in epilepsy with outpatient ambulatory EEG	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Interictal epileptiform discharges; Epilepsy; Ambulatory EEG	UTILITY; SPIKE	Objective: The diagnosis and classification of epilepsy often relies upon the demonstration of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). Routine 20-min EEG recording has low sensitivity, with multiple EEGs increasing sensitivity to a maximum of 77% (Doppelbauer et al., 1993). An alternate strategy is the use of prolonged continuous EEG; however, there are no data on the average latency to first IED with ambulatory monitoring. Methods: In this retrospective study we reviewed 180 consecutive patients with epilepsy referred to a Specialist Epilepsy Unit who had undergone 96 h outpatient ambulatory EEGs, without medication withdrawal, where IEDs were recorded. Latency to, and factors affecting first IED were analysed. Results: Median latency to first IED was 316 min, (interquartile range 70-772 min, n = 180). IEDs were recorded in 44% of patients within 4 h, 58% within 8 h, 85% within 24 h and 95% within 48 h. Recording for the full 96 h period revealed only 5% further IEDs. Multivariate analysis showed the latencies to IEDs with generalised epilepsies were shorter than with focal epilepsies (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: In 95% of patients showing scalp IEDs a 48 h recording was sufficient for electro-clinical classification in this study. Significance: Our data are the first to show the latency to recording interictal epileptiform discharges with prolonged outpatient EEG monitoring. These data are important in guiding diagnostic practice in Specialist Epilepsy Services.

Gonzalez; Mikhaeil-Demo, Yara; Bachman, Elizabeth M.; Balaguera, Pedro; Schuele, Stephan			Automated seizure detection accuracy for ambulatory EEG recordings	NEUROLOGY			English	Article								Objective To investigate the accuracy of preselected software automatic seizure files to detect at least one seizure per study in prolonged ambulatory EEG recording. Methods All the prolonged ambulatory EEG recordings (>24 hours) read at the Northwestern Memorial Hospital from January 2013 to October 2017 were included. We selected only the first study of each patient. We reviewed the studies entirely, and processed the recordings through 1 of 3 different detection software that are commercially available (Persyst 11, Persyst 12, and Gotman TM Event Detection). The proportion of patients with at least one electrographic seizure (>= 10 seconds) correctly identified by a seizure detector was calculated. Finally, we evaluated whether the type of seizure (focal vs generalized) may affect the chances of being automatically detected. Results We read 1,478 ambulatory EEG studies entirely (2,323 days of EEG recording; average 1.6 d/study). From the first study of each patient (1,257 studies), we found electrographic seizures in 70 (5.6%) studies. In 37 of 70 patients (53%), the automatic detectors correctly identified at least one seizure. Detections happened slightly more frequently in generalized seizures (14/20, 70%) compared to focal seizures (23/50, 46%) (p = 0.06). Conclusion Seizures were found in 5.6% of the studies. Automatic seizure detectors identified at least one electrographic seizure in only 53% of the studies. They performed slightly better detecting generalized than focal seizures. Therefore, the review of only automatically selected segments may be of decreased value to identify seizures, in particular when focal seizures are suspected.	[Otarula, Karina A.

Induction and separation of motion artifacts in EEG data using a mobile phantom head device	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; motion artifacts; ICA; signal-to-noise ratio; phantom head; walking; locomotion	VISUAL-EVOKED RESPONSES; HUMAN SKULL PHANTOM; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; TREADMILL WALKING; BRAIN; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; ACCELERATIONS; DYNAMICS; HUMANS	Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) can assess brain activity during whole-body motion in humans but head motion can induce artifacts that obfuscate electrocortical signals. Definitive solutions for removing motion artifact from EEG have yet to be found, so creating methods to assess signal processing routines for removing motion artifact are needed. We present a novel method for investigating the influence of head motion on EEG recordings as well as for assessing the efficacy of signal processing approaches intended to remove motion artifact. Approach. We used a phantom head device to mimic electrical properties of the human head with three controlled dipolar sources of electrical activity embedded in the phantom. We induced sinusoidal vertical motions on the phantom head using a custom-built platform and recorded EEG signals with three different acquisition systems while the head was both stationary and in varied motion conditions. Main results. Recordings showed up to 80% reductions in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and up to 3600% increases in the power spectrum as a function of motion amplitude and frequency. Independent component analysis (ICA) successfully isolated the three dipolar sources across all conditions and systems. There was a high correlation (r >. 0.85) and marginal increase in the independent components' (ICs) power spectrum (similar to 15%) when comparing stationary and motion parameters. The SNR of the IC activation was 400%-700% higher in comparison to the channel data SNR, attenuating the effects of motion on SNR. Significance. Our results suggest that the phantom head and motion platform can be used to assess motion artifact removal algorithms and compare different EEG systems for motion artifact sensitivity. In addition, ICA is effective in isolating target electrocortical events and marginally improving SNR in relation to stationary recordings.

However, the objective examination of ambulatory sleep quality remains a challenge, since sleep is a state of unconsciousness, which limits the reliability of self-reports. Therefore, a non-invasive, continuous, and objective method for the recording and analysis of naturalistic sleep is required. Objective: Portable sleep recording devices provide a suitable solution for the ambulatory analysis of sleep quality. In this study, the performance of two activity-based sleep monitors (Actiwatch and MTN-210) and a single-channel electroencephalography (EEG)-based sleep monitor (SleepScope) were compared in order to examine their reliability for the assessment of sleep quality. Methods: Twenty healthy adults were recruited for this study. First, data from daily activity recorded by Actiwatch and MTN-210 were compared to determine whether MTN-210, a more affordable device, could yield data similar to Actiwatch, the de facto standard. In addition, sleep detection ability was examined using data obtained by polysomnography as reference. One simple analysis included comparing the sleep/wake detection ability of Actiwatch, MTN-210, and SleepScope. Furthermore, the fidelity of sleep stage determination was examined using SleepScope in finer time resolution. Results: The results indicate that MTN-210 demonstrates an activity pattern comparable to that of Actiwatch, although their sensitivity preferences were not identical. Moreover, MTN-210 provides assessment of sleep duration comparable to that of the wrist-worn Actiwatch when MTN-210 was attached to the body. SleepScope featured superior overall sleep detection performance among the three methods tested. Furthermore, SleepScope was able to provide information regarding sleep architecture, although systemic bias was found. Conclusion: The present results suggest that single-channel EEG-based sleep monitors are the superior option for the examination of naturalistic sleep. The current results pave a possible future use for reliable portable sleep assessment methods in an ambulatory rather than a laboratory setting.

All these studies were in controlled laboratory-tasks in which the task designed to induce the studied learning mechanism. Interestingly, these studies reported opposing dynamics of the PMBR magnitude over learning for the error-based and reward-based tasks (increase vs. decrease, respectively). Here, we explored the PMBR dynamics during real-world motor-skill-learning in a billiards task using mobile-brain-imaging. Our EEG recordings highlight the opposing dynamics of PMBR magnitudes (increase vs. decrease) between different subjects performing the same task. The groups of subjects, defined by their neural dynamics, also showed behavioral differences expected for different learning mechanisms. Our results suggest that when faced with the complexity of the real-world different subjects might use different learning mechanisms for the same complex task. We speculate that all subjects combine multi-modal mechanisms of learning, but different subjects have different predominant learning mechanisms.	[Haar, Shlomi; Faisal, A.

A Comparison of Mental Workload in Individuals with Transtibial and Transfemoral Lower Limb Loss during Dual-Task Walking under Varying Demand	JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Mental load; EEG dynamics; Spectral power; Amputation levels; Alpha and theta bands; Prosthesis; Concurrent secondary task; Locomotion	FRONTAL MIDLINE THETA; COGNITIVE WORKLOAD; CORTICAL DYNAMICS; BRAIN; LOAD; MODULATION; AMPUTATION; RHYTHMS; LEVEL; ALPHA	Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the influence of lower limb loss (LL) on mental workload by assessing neurocognitive measures in individuals with unilateral transtibial (TT) versus those with transfemoral (TF) LL while dual-task walking under varying cognitive demand. Methods: Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded as participants performed a task of varying cognitive demand while being seated or walking (i.e., varying physical demand). Results: The findings revealed both groups of participants (TT LL vs. TF LL) exhibited a similar EEG theta synchrony response as either the cognitive or the physical demand increased. Also, while individuals with TT LL maintained similar performance on the cognitive task during seated and walking conditions, those with TF LL exhibited performance decrements (slower response times) on the cognitive task during the walking in comparison to the seated conditions. Furthermore, those with TF LL neither exhibited regional differences in EEG low-alpha power while walking, nor EEG high-alpha desynchrony as a function of cognitive task difficulty while walking. This lack of alpha modulation coincided with no elevation of theta/alpha ratio power as a function of cognitive task difficulty in the TF LL group. Conclusions: This work suggests that both groups share some common but also different neurocognitive features during dual-task walking. Although all participants were able to recruit neural mechanisms critical for the maintenance of cognitive-motor performance under elevated cognitive or physical demands, the observed differences indicate that walking with a prosthesis, while concurrently performing a cognitive task, imposes additional cognitive demand in individuals with more proximal levels of amputation.

Case report	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR CASE REPORTS			English	Article						Deja vu; Epilepsy; Ambulatory EEG monitoring		Background: Deja vu ( DV, from French deja vu - "already seen") is an aberration of psychic activity associated with transitory erroneous perception of novel circumstances, objects, or people as already known. Objective: This study aimed to record the EEG pattern of deja vu. Methods: The subjects participated in a survey concerning deja vu characteristics and underwent ambulatory EEG monitoring (12- 16 h). Results: In patients with epilepsy, DV episodes began with polyspike activity in the right temporal lobe region and, in some cases, ended with slow-wave theta-delta activity over the right hemisphere. There were no epileptic discharges in healthy respondents during DV. Conclusion: Two types of deja vu are suggested to exist: "pathological-epileptic" deja vu, characteristic of patients with epilepsy and equivalent to an epileptic seizure, and " nonpathological-nonepileptic" deja vu, which is characteristic of healthy people and psychological phenomenon.

Methods: Detection of interictal epileptiform abnormalities (IEAs) and rating of mean spike index (number of interictal discharges/minute) values for different sleep stages (NREM stages 1-2 and 3-4 and REM sleep) in standard EEG (S-EEG) and 24-h ambulatory EEG (A-EEG) at first referral in three groups of thirty consecutive outpatients [aged 20-39 (young), 40-59 (adults) and >= 60 years (elderly)], retrospectively selected according to a subsequent diagnosis of focal epilepsy of unknown cause, no sleep disorders or drugs or comorbidities affecting sleep and EEG. Results: Elderly subjects showed a lower rate of IEAs on S-EEG (p < 0.01) but a higher propensity for spiking during deep NREM sleep, 11/30 showing IEAs exclusively during stages 3-4. Mean spike index showed a significant increase in IEAs between sleep stages 1-2 and 3-4 in the elderly subjects (p < 0.001). Conclusions: A significant association emerged between IEAs during deep sleep and age (p < 0.001). Significance: EEG recordings covering deep NREM sleep should be recommended when IEAs detection is needed to support a diagnosis of epilepsy in elderly subjects.

This review provides an overview of this developing area, and examines the disease-specific mechanisms underlying walking or balance deficits. Medline, PubMed, PsychInfo and Scopus databases were searched. Articles that described cortical activity during walking and balance tasks in older adults and in those with PD were screened by the reviewers. Thirty-seven full-text articles were included for review, following an initial yield of 566 studies. This review summarizes study findings, where increased cortical activity appears to be required for older adults and further for participants with PD to perform walking and balance tasks, but specific activation patterns vary with the demands of the particular task. Studies attributed cortical activation to compensatory mechanisms for underlying age- or PD-related deficits in automatic movement control. However, a lack of standardization within the reviewed studies was evident from the wide range of study protocols, instruments, regions of interest, outcomes and interpretation of outcomes that were reported. Unstandardized data collection, processing and reporting limited the clinical relevance and interpretation of study findings. Future work to standardize approaches to the measurement of cortical activity during walking and balance tasks in older adults and people with PD with fNIRS and EEG systems is needed, which will allow direct comparison of results and ensure robust data collection/reporting. Based on the reviewed articles we provide clinical and future research recommendations.

These algorithms have translational potential in responsive neurostimulation devices and in automatic parsing of continuous intracranial electroencephalography data. An important barrier to developing accurate, validated algorithms for seizure detection is limited access to high-quality, expertly annotated seizure data from prolonged recordings. To overcome this, we hosted a kaggle.com competition to crowdsource the development of seizure detection algorithms using intracranial electroencephalography from canines and humans with epilepsy. The top three performing algorithms from the contest were then validated on out-of-sample patient data including standard clinical data and continuous ambulatory human data obtained over several years using the implantable NeuroVista seizure advisory system. Two hundred teams of data scientists from all over the world participated in the kaggle.com competition. The top performing teams submitted highly accurate algorithms with consistent performance in the out-of-sample validation study. The performance of these seizure detection algorithms, achieved using freely available code and data, sets a new reproducible benchmark for personalized seizure detection. We have also shared a 'plug and play' pipeline to allow other researchers to easily use these algorithms on their own datasets. The success of this competition demonstrates how sharing code and high quality data results in the creation of powerful translational tools with significant potential to impact patient care.

Ring and peg electrodes for minimally-Invasive and long-term sub-scalp EEG recordings	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						Long-term EEG; Epilepsy; Sub-scalp electrode; Minimally-invasive; Stable; Removable	EPILEPSY; MISDIAGNOSIS; SHEEP	Objective: Minimally-invasive approaches are needed for long-term reliable Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings to assist with epilepsy diagnosis, investigation and more naturalistic monitoring. This study compared three methods for long-term implantation of sub-scalp EEG electrodes. Methods: Three types of electrodes (disk, ring, and peg) were fabricated from biocompatible materials and implanted under the scalp in five ambulatory ewes for 3 months. Disk electrodes were inserted into sub-pericranial pockets. Ring electrodes were tunneled under the scalp. Peg electrodes were inserted into the skull, close to the dura. EEG was continuously monitored wirelessly. High resolution CT imaging, histopathology, and impedance measurements were used to assess the status of the electrodes at the end of the study. Results: EEG amplitude was larger in the peg compared with the disk and ring electrodes (p < 0.05). Similarly, chewing artifacts were lower in the peg electrodes (p < 0.05). Electrode impedance increased after long-term implantation particularly for those within the bone (p < 0.01). Micro-CT scans indicated that all electrodes stayed within the sub-scalp layers. All pegs remained within the burr holes as implanted with no evidence of extrusion. Eight of 10 disks partially eroded into the bone by 1.0 mm from the surface of the skull. The ring arrays remained within the sub-scalp layers close to implantation site. Histology revealed that the electrodes were encapsulated in a thin fibrous tissue adjacent to the pericranium. Overlying this was a loose connective layer and scalp. Erosion into the bone occurred under the rim of the sub-pericranial disk electrodes. Conclusions: The results indicate that the peg electrodes provided high quality EEG, mechanical stability, and lower chewing artifact. Whereas, ring electrode arrays tunneled under the scalp enable minimal surgical techniques to be used for implantation and removal.	[Benovitski, Y. B.; McGowan, C.

J	Ehinger, BV; Dimigen, O				Ehinger, Benedikt, V; Dimigen, Olaf			Unfold: an integrated toolbox for overlap correction, non-linear modeling, and regression-based EEG analysis	PEERJ			English	Article						Overlap correction; Generalized additive model; Non-linear modeling; Regression splines; Regularization; Regression-ERP; Linear modeling of EEG; ERP; EEG; Open source toolbox	FREE CLUSTER-ENHANCEMENT; WAVE-FORMS; ERP; DECONVOLUTION; DECOMPOSITION; LOCALIZATION; DYNAMICS; STIMULUS	Electrophysiological research with event-related brain potentials (ERPs) is increasingly moving from simple, strictly orthogonal stimulation paradigms towards more complex, quasi-experimental designs and naturalistic situations that involve fast, multisensory stimulation and complex motor behavior. As a result, electrophysiological responses from subsequent events often overlap with each other. In addition, the recorded neural activity is typically modulated by numerous covariates, which influence the measured responses in a linear or non-linear fashion. Examples of paradigms where systematic temporal overlap variations and low-level confounds between conditions cannot be avoided include combined electroencephalogram (EEG)/eye-tracking experiments during natural vision, fast multisensory stimulation experiments, and mobile brain/body imaging studies. However, even "traditional," highly controlled ERP datasets often contain a hidden mix of overlapping activity (e.g., from stimulus onsets, involuntary microsaccades, or button presses) and it is helpful or even necessary to disentangle these components for a correct interpretation of the results. In this paper, we introduce unfold, a powerful, yet easy-to-use MATLAB toolbox for regression-based EEG analyses that combines existing concepts of massive univariate modeling ("regression-ERPs"), linear deconvolution modeling, and non-linear modeling with the generalized additive model into one coherent and flexible analysis framework. The toolbox is modular, compatible with EEGLAB and can handle even large datasets efficiently. It also includes advanced options for regularization and the use of temporal basis functions (e.g., Fourier sets). We illustrate the advantages of this approach for simulated data as well as data from a standard face recognition experiment. In addition to traditional and non-conventional EEG/ERP designs, unfold can also be applied to other overlapping physiological signals, such as pupillary or electrodermal responses.

Closed-Loop Acoustic Stimulation During Sedation with Dexmedetomidine (CLASS-D): Protocol for a Within-Subject, Crossover, Controlled, Interventional Trial with Healthy Volunteers	NATURE AND SCIENCE OF SLEEP			English	Article						sleep; anesthesia; consciousness; dexmedetomidine; electroencephalography; acoustic stimulation	SLEEP SLOW WAVES; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; RECOVERY	Introduction: The relative power of slow-delta oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG), termed slow-wave activity (SWA), correlates with level of unconsciousness. Acoustic enhancement of SWA has been reported for sleep states, but it remains unknown if pharmacologically induced SWA can be enhanced using sound. Dexmedetomidine is a sedative whose EEG oscillations resemble those of natural sleep. This pilot study was designed to investigate whether SWA can be enhanced using closed-loop acoustic stimulation during sedation (CLASS) with dexmedetomidine. Methods: Closed-Loop Acoustic Stimulation during Sedation with Dexmedetomidine (CLASS-D) is a within-subject, crossover, controlled, interventional trial with healthy volunteers. Each participant will be sedated with a dexmedetomidine target-controlled infusion (TCI). Participants will undergo three CLASS conditions in a multiple crossover design: in-phase (phase-locked to slow-wave upslopes), anti-phase (phase-locked to slow-wave downslopes) and sham (silence). High-density EEG recordings will assess the effects of CLASS across the scalp. A volitional behavioral task and sequential thermal arousals will assess the anesthetic effects of CLASS. Ambulatory sleep studies will be performed on nights immediately preceding and following the sedation session. EEG effects of CLASS will be assessed using linear mixed-effects models. The impacts of CLASS on behavior and arousal thresholds will be assessed using logistic regression modeling. Parametric modeling will determine differences in sleepiness and measures of sleep homeostasis before and after sedation. Results: The primary outcome of this pilot study is the effect of CLASS on EEG slow waves. Secondary outcomes include the effects of CLASS on the following: performance of a volitional task, arousal thresholds, and subsequent sleep. Discussion: This investigation will elucidate 1) the potential of exogenous sensory stimulation to potentiate SWA during sedation; 2) the physiologic significance of this intervention; and 3) the connection between EEG slow-waves observed during sleep and sedation.

The virtual immediate localization of Tc-99m HMPAO to cerebral and cerebellar tissue provides an index of blood perfusion, and its absence denotes brain death. Other methods for assessing brain death include cerebral angiography, MRI, CT imaging after inhalation of stable xenon, electroencephalography, and clinical examination. The contrast material used for angiography may damage harvested organs, and the other studies have significant errors. MRI, CT imaging, and angiography are unsuitable for bedside use. Methods: Twenty-three patients, who presented with head trauma, prolonged anoxia or intrinsic brain disease (e.g., glioblastoma multiforme) and who were brain-dead by clinical examination criteria, were referred to the nuclear medicine division for verification of brain death. For adults, approximately 25 mCi Tc-99m hexamethylpropylene amineoxime (HMPAO) was administered intravenously. All patients but one were imaged using a mobile scintillation camera at the bedside. Results: We demonstrated (1) both cerebral and cerebellar perfusion, (2) neither cerebral nor cerebellar perfusion, (3) cerebral without cerebellar perfusion, and (4) cerebellar without cerebral perfusion. Patients without cerebral perfusion were diagnosed as brain-dead. The significance of a viable cerebellum in the absence of cerebral viability was not fully appreciated, although organs were harvested from such patients. We determined how well the clinical examination criteria held up in the diagnosis of brain death against the new gold standard of Tc-99m HMPAO scintigraphy: Clinical examination criteria correctly predicted brain death only 83% of the time compared with HMPAO scintigraphy. Conclusions: Brain death assessment by Tc-99m HMPAO scintigraphy has proved to be a reliable, safe, and cost-effective bedside method and may have practical application in the assessment of brain death in potential cadaveric donors.

J	Shin, J; Talnov, A				Shin, J; Talnov, A			A single trial analysis of hippocampal theta frequency during nonsteady wheel running in rats	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						hippocampus; theta rhythm; locomotion; nonsteady wheel running	RHYTHM; EEG; LOCOMOTION; BEHAVIOR; STIMULATION; PATTERNS; CATS	It has been suggested that hippocampal theta rhythm codes some aspects of motor behavior, but previous studies of the correlation between theta frequency and steady whole body locomotion speed using both linear tracks and wheels have provided inconsistent if not contradictory results. Because the relationship between temporal dynamics of theta frequency and non-steady (or dynamic) whole body locomotion speed can help clarify this issue, single trials of hippocampal EEG were analyzed together with nonsteady wheel running speed recorded during rats perform spontaneous normal locomotion in a wheel. Changes in theta frequency within single trials show positive or negative correlation with nonsteady wheel running speed. As the mean running speed increases and the standard deviation of running speed decreases in a single trial, the correlation between temporal dynamics of theta frequency and nonsteady wheel running speed within the single trial tends to be positive. In addition, we found that the amount of deceleration is also related to the polarity of the correlation coefficients. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We hypothesize that a BCI system that can be used at any time and place will improve current training methods and will thus accelerate the realization of a human's potential towards controlling an external device. For this reason, we have developed an ambulatory BCI (ABCI) training system. It consists of a microcontroller-based circuit that acquires, digitizes, and processes up to two amplified EEG signals and then transmits the bandpass-limited power to a PDA for classification, translation, and training game control. The game allows the user to train by providing a visual feedback signal that is to be cognitively controlled in a task-oriented challenge. Evaluation of the ABCI shows that the accuracy and response time are equivalent to a desktop BCI system. The ABCI can therefore be used chronically and away from any training site, thus removing barriers inherent in traditional BCI systems. This should allow more advanced training protocols to be developed and implemented in order to more effectively study the ability of the brain to adapt and control augmentative devices.

Prehospital patients with suspected LVO stroke should be triaged directly to specialized stroke centers for endovascular therapy. This review describes advances in LVO detection among prehospital suspected stroke patients. Recent Findings Clinical prehospital stroke severity tools have been validated in the prehospital setting. Devices including EEG, SSEPs, TCD, cranial accelerometry, and volumetric impedance phase-shift-spectroscopy have recently published data regarding LVO detection in hospital settings. Mobile stroke units bring thrombolysis and vessel imaging to patients. The use of a prehospital stroke severity tool for LVO triage is now widely supported. Ease of use should be prioritized as there are no meaningful differences in diagnostic performance amongst tools. LVO diagnostic devices are promising, but none have been validated in the prehospital setting. Mobile stroke units improve patient outcomes and cost-effectiveness analyses are underway.

This paper describes the implementation of REACT on a commercial DSP microprocessor; the Analog Devices Blackfin (R). The primary aim of this work is to develop a prototype system for use in ambulatory or in-ward automated EEG analysis. Furthermore, the complexity of the various stages of the REACT algorithm on the Blackfin processor is analysed; in particular the EEG feature extraction stages. This hardware profile is used to select a reduced, platform-aware feature set, in order to evaluate the seizure classification accuracy of a lower-complexity, lower-power REACT system.

Single-trial classification of gait and point movement preparation from human EEG	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; gait intent; point intent; brain-computer interface	MOTOR IMAGERY; TREADMILL WALKING; INITIATION; MU; LOCOMOTION; RHYTHMS	Neuroimaging studies provide evidence of cortical involvement immediately before and during gait and during gait-related behaviors such as stepping in place or motor imagery of gait. Here we attempt to perform single trial classification of gait intent from another movement plan (point intent) or from standing in place. Subjects walked naturally from a starting position to a designated ending position, pointed at a designated position from the starting position, or remained standing at the starting position. The 700 ms of recorded electroencephalography (EEG) before movement onset was used for single trial classification of trials based on action type and direction (left walk, forward walk, right walk, left point, right point, and stand) as well as action type regardless of direction (stand, walk, point). Classification using regularized LDA was performed on a principal components analysis (RCA) reduced feature space composed of coefficients from levels 1 to 9 of a discrete wavelet decomposition using the Daubechies 4 wavelet. We achieved significant classification for all conditions, with errors as low as 17% when averaged across nine subjects. LDA and RCA highly weighted frequency ranges that included movement related potentials (MRPs), with smaller contributions from frequency ranges that included mu and beta idle motor rhythms. Additionally, error patterns suggested a spatial structure to the EEG signal. Future applications of the cortical gait intent signal may include an additional dimension of control for prosthetics, preemptive corrective feedback for gait disturbances, or human computer interfaces (HCl).

Neuromonitoring in the ambulatory anesthesia setting: a pro-con discussion	CURRENT OPINION IN ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Review						ambulatory surgery; anesthesia; electroencephalography; monitoring; standard of care	AUDIT PROJECT NAP5; INTRAOPERATIVE AWARENESS; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; BISPECTRAL INDEX; POSTOPERATIVE DELIRIUM; ACCIDENTAL AWARENESS; OPERATING-ROOM; RECALL; SUPPRESSION; PREVENTION	Purpose of review Various neurologically focused monitoring modalities such as processed electroencephalography (pEEG), tissue/brain oxygenation monitors (SbO2), and even somatosensory evoked responses have been suggested as having the potential to improve the well tolerated and effective delivery of care in the setting of outpatient surgery. The present article will discuss the pros and cons of such monitors in this environment. Recent findings There is a paucity of evidence from rigorous, well designed clinical trials demonstrating that the routine use of any neuromonitoring technique in an ambulatory surgery setting leads to meaningful cost savings or a reduction in morbidity or mortality. The use of advanced neuromonitoring techniques (primarily pEEG) may be considered reasonable in two instances: for the prevention of intraoperative awareness during the administration of total intravenous anesthesia coupled with the use of a neuromuscular blocking drug, and for the prevention of relative drug overdose (and possibly postoperative delirium) in the elderly.

In particular, recent advances in EEG monitoring technologies pave the way for wearable, wireless EEG monitoring devices. Here, a low-power wireless EEG sensor platform that measures 8-channels of EEG, is described. The platform is integrated into a wearable headset for ambulatory monitoring of EEG. While using standard EEG electrodes without conductive gel, a first evaluation shows the wireless headset is comparable to the reference system when looking at alpha wave discrimination. This device combines low-noise, and low-power functionality into an easy-to-use wireless headset, providing a first step towards a fully integrated, fully functional wearable wireless EEG monitoring system.

Video-EEG monitoring is an important diagnostic innovation that may be used to confirm the diagnosis of a seizure disorder and classify seizure type. The methodologies and clinical applications of video-EEG monitoring are reviewed. Long-term EEG recordings may be performed as an outpatient or in an epilepsy monitoring unit. Potential techniques for video-EEG monitoring include prolonged conventional routine EEG, ambulatory EEG, and computer-assisted EEG recordings. Periictal SPECT studies performed during long-term EEG recordings in the epilepsy monitoring unit may increase the diagnostic yield of a presurgical evaluation. Video-EEG monitoring is essential for surgical localization in patients with intractable partial epilepsy being considered for a focal cortical resection. The studies may also be necessary to confirm the presence of nonepileptical clinical episodes.

In this paper, we present an integrated recorder chip that is part of a wireless system to record and process sub-scalp electroencephalography (EEG) data for seizure detection and treatment. The recorder is designed based on a novel frequency-shaping architecture that offers competitive circuit specifications on power, noise, precision, and chronic stability. The design is fabricated in a 0.13 mu m CMOS process. When measured at a 2.5kHz clock and 1.0V supply, the recorder can be switched between two bandwidths, where the lower bandwidth (50Hz) is for recording regular EEG data and the higher bandwidth (500Hz) is for recording high frequency oscillations [1]. The recorder is designed with a wide data dynamic range in order to avoid saturation from 50mV ambulatory motion artifacts when the gain of the active filter is set to 2V/V. The total power consumption is under 2.5 mu W/ch and the input-referred noise is 0.8 mu V from 150Hz and 1.4 mu V from 1-500Hz. A proof-of-concept prototype has been also developed to demonstrate that the recorder is insensitive to ambient interferences and movement artifacts in experiments.

SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY			English	Article						Home video telemetry; Ambulatory EEG; Epilepsy; Non-epileptic attack disorder; Parasomnias	NONEPILEPTIC SEIZURES; DIAGNOSIS; EPILEPSY; HOME	Purpose: Video ambulatory EEG (V-AEEG) is a new technique which could add increased capacity for long term EEG monitoring to overstretched inpatient video telemetry (IPVT) services. We compare V-AEEG and IPVT for diagnostic efficacy, recording quality, patient acceptability and technologist time required. Methods: Forty-one V-AEEG and 64 IPVT adult patients were included. Patients were investigated to diagnose attacks or to obtain polysomnography (PSG) prior to multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). Number of attacks recorded, whether the diagnostic question was answered, quality of video and EEG recording and patients' preference for investigation at home or in hospital were noted. For V-AEEG patients, ease of procedure and extra technologist time required were recorded. Results: Of patients investigated for diagnosis of attacks, 74% V-AEEG patients and 62% IPVT had typical attacks during the investigation. All PSGs were useful in interpreting the MSLTs. Diagnostic questions were answered by 73% V-AEEGs and 73% IPVTs. Quality of EEG and video recording was similar using V-AEEG and IPVT. Four patients had difficulty using V-AEEG equipment but diagnostic information was lost in only one. 5% of V-AEEG patients would have preferred hospital investigation but 45% of IPVT patients would have preferred home investigation. Extra technologist time for home visits (mean 2 h) was required only for the first 7 patients. Conclusion: Video EEG recording quality and diagnostic efficacy from V-AEEG are similar to IPVT. V-AEEG is acceptable to most patients and does not require additional technical time. Hence, V-AEEG offers a convenient, economical alternative to IPVT. (C) 2017 British Epilepsy Association.

It motivates to build estimator for revealing the human cognitive behaviours for different environments. In this work, we present an operational human cognitive behaviour detection system based on ambulatory EEG signal analysis. A novel event driven environment is created using external stimuli to collect those signals. They are captured using 14 channel Emotiv neuro-headset. Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) is a very popular feature extraction method in acoustic signal processing. In spite of it's popularity, it has not been explored much when it comes to EEG signals. This paper proposes a novel technique of applying MFCC feature extraction method for ambulatory EEG signals and the results are found to be promising. Besides other feature extraction methods such as: Power Spectral Density (PSD), Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) are used to extract intrinsic features from EEG signal. A statistical technique, Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR) is applied on them to evaluate the robustness of each feature. A higher FDR value is observed from MFCC features which demonstrate its discriminative power during classification. Different machine learning techniques such as Probabilistic neural network (P-NN), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), multi-class support vector machine (MCSVM) are applied for training, testing and validating the extracted features. A comparative analysis is discussed for each classifier coupled with each feature. It is found that P-NN with MFCC feature produces the maximum accuracy of 92.61% amongst all the remaining classifiers.

Recent technology has demonstrated that closed-loop responsive neurostimulation therapy is a realistic treatment for epileptic patients. However, ambulatory care of epileptic patients requires a highly accurate automated seizure detection algorithm. In this research, we implement a method for epileptic seizure detection based on nonlinear phase space analysis and deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). The underlying dynamics of scalp electroencephalography (sEEG) are extracted through time delay embedding and phase-space reconstruction. These features are used for training a CNN with a regression output to predict time until seizure. In experiments using EEG data collected in clinical environments from forty patients, our deep learning approach achieved high accuracy in predicting time until seizure onset, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 14.1 minutes and adjusted R-squared of.95 on out of sample testing data.

As yet, there is a dearth of suitable objective markers for measuring schizotypy. Frontal alpha asymmetry, characterised by reduced left versus right frontal region activity, reflects trait-like diminished approach-related systems and has been found in schizophrenia. Methods:The present study used electroencephalography (EEG) recorded on a consumer-grade mobile headset to examine asymmetric resting-state frontal alpha, beta, and gamma power within the multidimensional schizotypy (e.g. positive, negative, disorganised) during a three-minute "eyes closed" resting period in college undergraduates (n=49). Results:Findings suggest that schizotypy was exclusively related to reduced left versus right-lateralised power in the alpha frequency (8.1-12.9 Hz.,R-2= .16). Follow-up analysis suggested that positive schizotypy was uniquely associated with increased right alpha activity, indicating increased withdrawal motivation. Conclusions:Frontal asymmetry is a possible ecologically valid objective marker for schizotypy that may be detectable using easily accessible, consumer-grade technology.

The aim of this study was to compare spike index (SI) in full-night recordings with SI in sleep-deprived EEGs in the morning; EEGs were obtained over 24 hours using ambulatory equipment. Sixteen children between the ages of 7 and 12 years were included in the study. They had to wake up at 3:00 AM and go to sleep again at 7:30 AM. Epileptiform activity was quantified, and SIs of full-night and morning recordings were compared. Two patients did not fall asleep. In one recording there was a technical problem that made calculations impossible. SIs calculated from EEGs obtained during a short nap in the morning were comparable to those calculated from full-night recordings. There seems to be a higher failure rate during morning recordings because of patients not falling asleep. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Aiming to overcome maladaptive changes in cortical lateralization patterns we presented a visual feedback, representing the degree of contralateral sensorimotor cortical activity and the degree of sensorimotor cortex lateralization. Three stroke patients practiced every other day, over a period of 4 weeks. Training-related changes were evaluated on behavioral, functional, and structural levels. All 3 patients indicated that they enjoyed the training and were highly motivated throughout the entire training regime. EEG activity induced by MI of the affected hand became more lateralized over the course of training in all three patients. The patient with a significant functional change also showed increased white matter integrity as revealed by diffusion tensor imaging, and a substantial clinical improvement of upper limb motor functions. Our study provides evidence that regular, home-based practice of MI neurofeedback has the potential to facilitate cortical reorganization and may also increase associated improvements of upper limb motor function in chronic stroke patients.

The most popular applications are general-purpose (e.g., games, sports, daily-life, etc.). However, clinical usefulness of mBCIs is still an open question. In this paper we present a low-cost mobile BCI application and demonstrate its potential utility in clinical practice. In particular, we conducted a study in which visual evoked potentials (VEP) of two subjects were analyzed using our mBCI application, under different conditions: inside a laboratory, walking and traveling in a car. The results show that the features of our system (level of synchronization, robustness and signal quality) are acceptable for the demanding standard required for the electrophysiological evaluation of vision. In addition, the mobile recording and cloud computing of VEPs offers a number of advantages over traditional in-lab systems. The presented mobile application could be used for visual impairment screening, for ubiquitous, massive and low-cost evaluation of vision, and as ambulatory diagnostic tool in rural or undeveloped areas.

The objective was to investigate short-term seizure clustering, which we have termed bursting, and consider implications for patient care, seizure prediction, and evaluating therapies. Methods: Chronic ambulatory intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) data collected for the purpose of seizure prediction were annotated to identify seizure events. A detection algorithm was used to identify bursts of events. Burst events were compared to nonburst events to evaluate event dispersion, duration and dynamics. Results: Bursts of seizures were present in 6 of 15 subjects, and detections were consistent over long-term monitoring (>2 years). Subjects with bursts of seizures had highly overdispersed seizure rates, compared to other subjects. There was a complicated relationship between bursts and clinical seizures, although bursts were associated with multimodal distributions of seizure duration, and poorer predictive outcomes. For three subjects, bursts demonstrated distinctive preictal dynamics compared to clinical seizures. Significance: We have previously hypothesized that there are distinct physiologic pathways underlying short-and long-duration seizures. Herein we show that burst seizures fall almost exclusively within the short population of seizure durations; however, a short duration event was not sufficient to induce or imply bursting. Wecan therefore conclude that in addition to distinct mechanisms underlying seizure duration, there are separate factors regulating bursts of seizures. We show that bursts were a robust phenomenon in our patient cohort, which were consistent with overdispersed seizure rates, suggesting long-memory dynamics.

Vigabatrin increased the percentage of time that rats spent being immobile. During spontaneous walking in the open field, the speed of locomotion was increased by vigabatrin, while theta peak frequency was decreased. Vigabatrin also reduced the theta peak frequency during forced (speed controlled) walking. There was only a weak positive correlation (r = 0.22) between theta peak frequency and locomotor speed for the saline condition. Furthermore, vigabatrin abolishes the weak relationship between speed of locomotion and theta peak frequency. Vigabatrin and saline did not differ in the slope of the regression line, but showed different offset points at the theta peak frequency axis. Thus, other factors than speed of locomotion seem to be involved in determination of the theta peak frequency. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Gwin, JT; Ferris, DP				Gwin, Joseph T.; Ferris, Daniel P.			An EEG-based study of discrete isometric and isotonic human lower limb muscle contractions	JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; ARTIFACTS; FOOT; CLASSIFICATION; SPECTROSCOPY; POTENTIALS; ACTIVATION; SEPARATION	Background: Electroencephalography (EEG) combined with independent component analysis enables functional neuroimaging in dynamic environments including during human locomotion. This type of functional neuroimaging could be a powerful tool for neurological rehabilitation. It could enable clinicians to monitor changes in motor control related cortical dynamics associated with a therapeutic intervention, and it could facilitate noninvasive electrocortical control of devices for assisting limb movement to stimulate activity dependent plasticity. Understanding the relationship between electrocortical dynamics and muscle activity will be helpful for incorporating EEG-based functional neuroimaging into clinical practice. The goal of this study was to use independent component analysis of high-density EEG to test whether we could relate electrocortical dynamics to lower limb muscle activation in a constrained motor task. A secondary goal was to assess the trial-by-trial consistency of the electrocortical dynamics by decoding the type of muscle action. Methods: We recorded 264-channel EEG while 8 neurologically intact subjects performed isometric and isotonic, knee and ankle exercises at two different effort levels. Adaptive mixture independent component analysis (AMICA) parsed EEG into models of underlying source signals. We generated spectrograms for all electrocortical source signals and used a nave Bayesian classifier to decode exercise type from trial-by-trial time-frequency data. Results: AMICA captured different electrocortical source distributions for ankle and knee tasks. The fit of single-trial EEG to these models distinguished knee from ankle tasks with 80% accuracy. Electrocortical spectral modulations in the supplementary motor area were significantly different for isometric and isotonic tasks (p < 0.05). Isometric contractions elicited an event related desynchronization (ERD) in the alpha-band (8-12 Hz) and beta-band (12-30 Hz) at joint torque onset and offset. Isotonic contractions elicited a sustained alpha- and beta-band ERD throughout the trial. Classifiers based on supplementary motor area sources achieved a 4-way classification accuracy of 69% while classifiers based on electrocortical sources in multiple brain regions achieved a 4-way classification accuracy of 87%. Conclusions: Independent component analysis of EEG reveals unique spatial and spectro-temporal electrocortical properties for different lower limb motor tasks. Using a broad distribution of electrocortical signals may improve classification of human lower limb movements from single-trial EEG.

MethodsWe report a case series of monitored definite and probable SUDEP where no electroclinical evidence of underlying seizures was found preceding death. ResultsThree patients (two definite and one probable) had SUDEP. They had a typical high SUDEP risk profile with longstanding intractable epilepsy and frequent generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). All patients had varying patterns of respiratory and bradyarrhythmic cardiac dysfunction with profound electroencephalography (EEG) suppression. In two patients, patterns of cardiorespiratory failure were similar to those seen in some patients in the Mortality in Epilepsy Monitoring Units Study (MORTEMUS). SignificanceSUDEP almost always occur postictally, after GTCS and less commonly after a partial seizure. Monitored SUDEP or near-SUDEP cases without a seizure have not yet been reported in literature. When nonmonitored SUDEP occurs in an ambulatory setting without an overt seizure, the absence of EEG information prevents the exclusion of a subtle seizure. These cases confirm the existence of nonseizure SUDEP; such deaths may not be prevented by seizure detection-based devices. SUDEP risk in patients with epilepsy may constitute a spectrum of susceptibility wherein some are relatively immune, death occurs in others with frequent GTCS with one episode of seizure ultimately proving fatal, while in others still, death may occur even in the absence of a seizure. We emphasize the heterogeneity of SUDEP phenomena.

Elucidation of EEG Characteristics of Fuzzy Reasoning-Based Heuristic BCI and Its Application to Patient With Brain Infarction	FRONTIERS IN NEUROROBOTICS			English	Article						ankle rehabilitation; brain-computer interface (BCI); EEG; fuzzy template matching; neurorehabilitation		Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on common electroencephalography (EEG) are limited to specific instrumentation sites and frequency bands. These BCI induce certain targeted electroencephalographic features of cognitive tasks, identify them, and determine BCI's performance, and use machine-learning to extract these electroencephalographic features, which makes them enormously time-consuming. In addition, there is a problem in which the neurorehabilitation using BCI cannot receive ambulatory and immediate rehabilitation training. Therefore, we proposed an exploratory BCI that did not limit the targeted electroencephalographic features. This system did not determine the electroencephalographic features in advance, determined the frequency bands and measurement sites appropriate for detecting electroencephalographic features based on their target movements, measured the electroencephalogram, created each rule (template) with only large "High" or small "Low" electroencephalograms for arbitrarily determined thresholds (classification of cognitive tasks in the imaginary state of moving the feet by the size of the area constituted by the power spectrum of the EEG in each frequency band), and successfully detected the movement intention by detecting the electroencephalogram consistent with the rules during motor tasks using a fuzzy inference-based template matching method (FTM). However, the electroencephalographic features acquired by this BCI are not known, and their usefulness for patients with actual cerebral infarction is not known. Therefore, this study clarifies the electroencephalographic features captured by the heuristic BCI, as well as clarifies the effectiveness and challenges of this system by its application to patients with cerebral infarction.

Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have demonstrated that based on the high inter-individual variability of brain structure and function, it is possible to identify individuals with high accuracy. Otherwise, there is the common belief that electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded at the surface of the scalp are too noisy for identification purposes with a comparably high hit rate. In the present work, we compared BI quality (F1-scores, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) between different types of functional (instantaneous, lagged, and total coherence, phase synchronization, correlation, and mutual information) and effective (Granger causality, phase synchronization, and coherence) connectivity measures. Results revealed that across functional connectivity metrics, identification accuracy was in the range of 0.98-1, whereas sensitivity and Fl-scores were between 0.00 and 1 and specificity was between 0.99 and 1. BI was higher for the connectivity metrics that are contaminated by volume conduction (instantaneous connectivity) compared to those that are unaffected by this variable (lagged connectivity). Support vector machine and neural network algorithms yielded the highest BI, followed by random forest and weighted k-nearest neighborhood, whereas linear discriminant analysis was less accurate. These results provide cross-validated counterevidence to the belief that EEG data are too noisy for identification purposes and demonstrate that functional and effective connectivity metrics are particularly suited for BI applications with comparable accuracy to MRI. Our results have important implications for fast, low-cost, and mobile BI applications.

This may prove very useful for the epileptic patients especially when the patient develops occasional problems related to his neural activities; bedside monitoring is not feasible both physically and economically. Under such conditions, Ambulatory Electroencephalographic monitoring provides an efficient and effective solution for this problem. This unit is equipped with a sophisticated hardware to acquire, amplify and transmit EEG and receive them through an interface unit and a software module to denoise and analyse them with epileptic seizure and spike detection algorithms coded with Discrete Wavelet Transformation technique.

A total of 94 child patients who were clinically diagnosed with viral encephalitis in Yantaishan Hospital of Yantai from May 2010 to July 2014, was examined with AEEG and REEG, respectively and randomly divided into AEEG group (n=47) and REEG group (n=47). The probabilities of detecting abnormal electroencephalographic activities with two examination methods were compared. The detection rates of abnormal electroencephalographic activities with AEEG and REEG were 80.0 and 65.0%, respectively, with significant differences (P<0.05); the probabilities of detecting epileptiform discharge with AEEG and REEG were 42.5 and 6.3%, respectively, with significant differences (P<0.05). The hospitalization time and time of electroencephalogram (EEG) restoring to normal of child patients with encephalitis in the REEG group were significantly longer than those of child patients with encephalitis in the AEEG group, with statistically significant differences (P<0.05). Among child patients in the AEEG group, the incidence rate of severe illness was 2.1%, and both the incidence rates of clinical recurrence and of sequela were 0. Among child patients in the REEG group, the incidence rate, clinical recurrence rate and incidence rate of sequela were 8.5, 12.7 and 8.5%, respectively, with statistically significant differences (P<0.05). To some extent, the EEG abnormality reflects the disorder degree of brain environment of child patients with viral encephalitis. The treatment effect and prognosis of child patients with viral encephalitis can be clinically evaluated based on EEG monitoring results of child patients, which has a certain clinical guiding significance. AEEG has important significance to the auxiliary diagnosis of viral encephalitis, with higher sensitivity than REEG.

While invasive studies allow investigating heading computation in moving animals, established non-invasive analyses of human brain dynamics are restricted to stationary setups. To investigate the role of the RSC in heading computation of actively moving humans, we used a Mobile Brain/Body Imaging approach synchronizing electroencephalography with motion capture and virtual reality. Data from physically rotating participants were contrasted with rotations based only on visual flow. During physical rotation, varying rotation velocities were accompanied by pronounced wide frequency band synchronization in RSC, the parietal and occipital cortices. In contrast, the visual flow rotation condition was associated with pronounced alpha band desynchronization, replicating previous findings in desktop navigation studies, and notably absent during physical rotation. These results suggest an involvement of the human RSC in heading computation based on visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive input and implicate revisiting traditional findings of alpha desynchronization in areas of the navigation network during spatial orientation in movement-restricted participants.

Measurement of attentional reserve and mental effort for cognitive workload assessment under various task demands during dual-task walking	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Attentional reserve; Mental effort and workload; Event-related potentials; Spectral power; Locomotion; Ecologically valid human performance	ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; MOTOR INTERFERENCE; THETA OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL DYNAMICS; HEALTHY OLDER; EEG; BRAIN; PERFORMANCE	Previous work focused on cognitive workload assessment suggests EEG spectral content and component amplitudes of the event-related potential (ERP) waveform may index mental effort and attentional reserve, respectively. Although few studies have assessed attentional reserve and mental effort during upper-extremity performance, none have employed a combined approach to measure cognitive workload during locomotion. Therefore, by systematically considering ERPs, spectral content and importantly their combination, this study aimed to examine whether concurrent changes in spectral content and ERPs could collectively serve as an index of cognitive workload during locomotion. Specifically, ERP and EEG biomarkers were assessed as participants performed a cognitive task under two levels of difficulty (easy or hard) and two conditions (seated or walking). Changes in attentional reserve and mental effort appeared to collectively index cognitive workload under varying demands due to changes in task difficulty or performance conditions. This work can inform cognitive workload assessment in patient populations with gait deficiencies for future applications.

This study presents the development of a wireless and wearable EEG acquisition system for ambulatory monitoring. The platform comprises 32 active dry electrodes, an analog-to-digital conversion unit with 24 bit resolution, 1 ksps sampling frequency per channel and a module for acquisition, processing and wireless transmission based on IGEP COM embedded system development platform under a Linux TM operative system. The base operating system consists of two software frameworks which interact to ensure the real-time requirements of the acquired signals and parallel recording, processing and data transmission. In order to control the analog-to-digital converters and the synchronous reception of converted data, a Linux TM kernel driver was developed. It was also developed an userspace application for data saving, digital processing and wireless transmission via socket TCP-IP on a 802.11 b/g network topology. An application based on C# from .NET development environment was also developed for PC data reception and visualization. This application consists of a TCP socket server for data reception and a graphic environment for signal's visualization. For signal plotting, it was used the open source ZedGraph library. The proposed system may operate on data streaming or event detection modes and presents feasible performance on EEG monitoring of both epileptic inpatients and outpatients.	[Pinho, F.; Correia, J.

ACT-S1 allows for a fully automatic identification of sleep period time (SPT) and within the identified sleep period, the sleep-wake classification. SPT detected by ACT-S1 did not differ statistically from using PSG-EEG (bias = -9.98 min; correlation 0.89). In sleep-wake classification on 30-s epochs within the identified sleep period, the new ACT-S1 presented similar or slightly higher accuracy (83-87%), precision (86-89%) and F1 score (90-92%), significantly higher specificity (39-40%), and significantly lower, but still high, sensitivity (96-97%) compared to Sadeh's algorithm, which achieved 99% sensitivity as the only measure better than ACT-S1's. Total sleep times (TST) estimated with ACT-S1 and Sadeh's algorithm were higher, but still highly correlated to PSG-EEG's TST. Sleep quality metrics of sleep period efficiency and wake-after-sleep-onset computed by ACT-S1 were not significantly different from PSG-EEG, while the same sleep quality metrics derived by Sadeh's algorithm differed significantly from PSG-EEG. Agreement between ACT-S1 and PSG-EEG reached was highest when analyzing the subset of subjects with least disrupted sleep (N = 28). These results provide evidence of promising performance of a full-automation of the sleep tracking procedure with ACT-S1 on older adults. Future longitudinal validations across specific medical conditions are needed. The algorithm's performance may further improve with integrating multi-sensor information.

Not only can it confirm the diagnosis, but it can also clarify the type of epilepsy. There are many different types of EEG recordings depending on duration, the presence of video, and inpatient or outpatient setting, each with its pros and cons. Interictal epileptiform abnormalities are very specific to epilepsy, but they can be over-interpreted by inexperienced readers. In addition to diagnosis of epilepsy, EEG also has a role in the decision to discontinue treatment in seizure-free patients, and in assessing critically ill patients for possible status epilepticus and encephalopathies. EEG reports should be relatively standardized and clear to the clinician who requested the EEG.

We designed this study to evaluate the actual frequency of TEA in a real-life scenario and to highlight the features that can help clinicians distinguishing it from TGA. Methods: We retrospectively collected clinical data of 83 patients who accessed our emergency ward for an abrupt onset of amnesic disorder, initially interpreted as TGA. All patients underwent neurological evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, and standard 21-channel scalp electroencephalography (EEG) recording (standard EEG [st-EEG]). Moreover, patients with borderline epileptiform abnormalities on st-EEG or with normal st-EEG but high clinical suspicion for TEA underwent a 16-channel 24-hour ambulatory EEG (24-h EEG). Clinical features, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging data were analyzed and compared in the two groups (TEA and TGA). Results: Diagnosis of TEA. according to Zeman's criteria, was made in 15 patients (18%). From a clinical point of view recurrence (p < .001) and atypical symptoms such as confusion or language disorder (TGA plus manifestations), appear to be key elements in order to discriminate between TEA and TGA (80% of patients with TEA vs 7.8% of patients with TGA: p < .001). In our sample, duration of the episodes did not significantly differ between TGA and TEA, even though it is usually described as shorter for TEA. This result could be related with a prolonged postictal state in these patients. The analysis of st-EEG results evidenced low sensitivity for interictal epileptiform abnormalities (IEAs) detection (52.3%), with not conclusive data in distinguishing TEA from TGA. On the contrary, 24-h EEG showed IEAs in all patients with epilepsy, mostly during sleep, suggesting an essential diagnostic role of long-lasting EEG recording for TEA. Finally, structural abnormalities were more frequent in patients with TEA (26.6%). In the group with TGA, the only imaging alteration found was diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) hippocampal hyperintensity. Conclusion: Our findings show that in a real-life clinical scenario, TEA is frequent but often overlooked. However, simple clinical data and widely available neurophysiological examinations can truly help to effectively distinguish TEA from TGA. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Yet, previous studies on human brain activity during navigation focus on stationary setups, neglecting vestibular and kinesthetic feedback. The aim of our work is to uncover the influence of those sensory modalities on cortical processing. We developed a fully immersive virtual reality setup combined with high density mobile electroencephalography (EEG). Participants traversed one leg of a triangle, turned on the spot, continued along the second leg, and finally indicated the location of their starting position. Vestibular and kinesthetic information was provided either in combination, as isolated sources of information, or not at all within a 2x2 full factorial intra subjects design. EEG data were processed by clustering independent components, and time-frequency spectrograms were calculated. In parietal, occipital, and temporal clusters, we detected alpha suppression during the turning movement, which is associated with a heightened demand of visuo-attentional processing and closely resembles results reported in previous stationary studies. This decrease is present in all conditions and therefore seems to generalize to more natural settings. Yet, in incongruent conditions, when different sensory modalities did not match, the decrease is significantly stronger. Additionally, in more anterior areas we found that providing only vestibular but no kinesthetic information results in alpha increase. These observations demonstrate that stationary experiments omit important aspects of sensory feedback. Therefore, it is important to develop more natural experimental settings in order to capture a more complete picture of neural correlates of spatial navigation.

A detailed comparison of methods for reducing the amount of AEEG data is presented. It is concluded that a discontinuous recording scheme can alleviate both of the above problems. Discontinuous monitoring introduces data interpretation and practical issues which are discussed. With suitable low power algorithm implementations and realistic system expectations such systems are deemed to be feasible.

EEG-based methods play a key role in the diagnostic workup of seizure disorders. Especially, routine EEG has kept its importance as a cost effective examination with a high specificity of interictal epileptiform discharges. However, its sensitivity is insufficient. On the other hand, intensive video/EEG monitoring is the diagnostic gold standard for seizure recording. It remains reserved to patients with high seizure frequencies or requires a reduction of medication for seizure provocation. Moreover, it is expensive mainly due to a continuous surveillance by trained staff. Ambulatory EEG (AEEG) allows EEG recordings on portable recorders hardly restricting the mobility of the patient. It fills the diagnostic gap between routine EEG and intensive EEG/Video monitoring in the epilepsy evaluation. Technological advances of the last two to three years, mainly in the field of miniature storage capacity, have enabled the continuous, uninterrupted recording of all electrodes of the 10 - 20 system for at least 24 hours. Moreover, the quality of these recordings are up to the technical standards of routine EEG and other forms of digital EEG with respect to number of channels, bandwidth, and signal to noise ratio. The indications for an AEEG have not essentially changed since the first generations of AEEG recorders: Either seizure recordings are intended to prove the diagnosis of epilepsy, to localize the primary epileptogenic area during presurgical evaluation, or to quantify seizure frequency. or interictal recordings aim at detecting and characterizing epileptiform activity. These questions can now be answered at much higher surety yielding clinical information that other methods either cannot obtain or only at much higher costs.

Sleep recording is performed by means of five electrodes: two temporal, two frontal and a reference. This configuration enables to avoid the chin area to enhance the quality of the muscular signal and the hair region for patient convenience. The electroencephalopgram (EEG), eletromyogram (EMG), and elctrooculogram (EOG) signals are separated using the Independent Component Analysis approach. The system is compared to a standard sleep analysis system using polysomnographic recordings of 14 patients. The overall concordance of 67.2% is achieved between the two systems. Based on the validation results and the computational efficiency we recommend the clinical use of the proposed system in a commercial sleep analysis platform.

The Cognitive Demands of Gait Retraining in Runners: An EEG Study	JOURNAL OF MOTOR BEHAVIOR			English	Article						cognitive load; gait; learning; mobile brain; body imaging (MoBI)	PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; STRESS-FRACTURES; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; TREADMILL WALKING; DISTANCE RUNNERS; INJURIES; INHIBITION; SYNCHRONIZATION; INCREASES; PREMOTOR	High impact forces during running have been associated with tibial stress injuries. Previous research has demonstrated increasing step rate will decrease impact forces during running. However, no research has determined the cognitive demand of gait retraining. The primary purpose was to determine the cognitive demand and effectiveness of field-based gait retraining. We hypothesized that in-field gait retraining would alter running mechanics without increasing cognitive workload as measured by EEG following learning. Runners with a history of tibial injury completed a gait retraining protocol which included a baseline run, retraining phase, practice phase, and re-assessment following retraining protocol. Results demonstrated an increase in the theta, beta, and gamma power within prefrontal cortex during new learning and corresponding return to baseline following skill acquisition and changes across alpha, beta, gamma, mu, and theta in the motor cortex (p < .05). In the midline superior parietal cortex, spectral power was greater for theta activity during new learning with a corresponding alpha suppression. Overall, the results demonstrated the use of EEG as an effective tool to measure cognitive demand for implicit motor learning and the effectiveness of in-field gait retraining.

However, recent studies have suggested that the extent of cortical involvement during walking actually varies depending on the environmental conditions. To determine the impact of environmental conditions on cortical engagement in freely walking rats, we recorded limb kinematics and signals from implanted electroencephalography arrays in rats performing a series of natural behaviors. We found that rat gaits were significantly different across various locomotion terrains (e.g. walking on an upslope vs. downslope). Further, rat forelimbs and hindlimbs showed similar patterns of motion. The results also suggested that rat cortical engagement during walking varied across environmental conditions. Specifically, a band power significantly increased during 30 degrees downslope walking in the posterior parietal, left secondary motor, and left somatosensory clusters. Additionally, during 30 degrees upslope walking, the beta band power was greater in the left primary motor and left and right secondary motor sources. Further, rats walking on up- or downslopes of varying steepness were found to have different cortical activities. Compared with 10. downslope walking, a band power was greater during 30 degrees downslope locomotion in the left primary motor and somatosensory sources. These findings support the hypothesis that cortical contribution during walking in rats is influenced by environmental conditions, underlining the importance of goal-directed behaviors for motor function rehabilitation and neuroprosthetic control in brain-machine interfaces.

Ambulatory seizure forecasting with a wrist-worn device using long-short term memory deep learning	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							EPILEPSY; PREDICTION; EFFICACY; SURGERY; SAFETY	The ability to forecast seizures minutes to hours in advance of an event has been verified using invasive EEG devices, but has not been previously demonstrated using noninvasive wearable devices over long durations in an ambulatory setting. In this study we developed a seizure forecasting system with a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithm, using a noninvasive wrist-worn research-grade physiological sensor device, and tested the system in patients with epilepsy in the field, with concurrent invasive EEG confirmation of seizures via an implanted recording device. The system achieved forecasting performance significantly better than a random predictor for 5 of 6 patients studied, with mean AUC-ROC of 0.80 (range 0.72-0.92). These results provide the first clear evidence that direct seizure forecasts are possible using wearable devices in the ambulatory setting for many patients with epilepsy.

A randomized pilot controlled trial	JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						Brain activity; Cortical activation; Electroencephalography; Reflex locomotion; Tactile stimulation; Vojta therapy	SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; BASAL GANGLIA; PRESSURE STIMULATION; ACTIVATION PATTERNS; HUMAN BRAIN; EEG; CEREBELLUM; MOVEMENT; WAKEFULNESS; PERCEPTION	BackgroundBrain's is stimulated by Vojta Therapy through selected body areas activating stored innate motor programs which are exported as coordinate movement and muscle contractions to trunk and limbs. The aim of this pilot study is to know the responses at cortical level to a specific tactile input, assessed by electroencephalography (EEG), compared to a sham stimulation, in healthy subjects.MethodsA randomized-controlled trial was conducted. Participants were randomly distributed into two groups: a non-specific tactile input-group (non-STI-group) (n=20) and a Vojta specific tactile input-group (V-STI-group) (n=20). The non-STI-group was stimulated in a non specific area (quadriceps distal area) and V-STI-group was stimulated in a specific area (intercostal space, at the mammillary line between the 7th and 8th ribs) according to the Vojta therapy. Recording was performed with EEG for 10 min considering a first minute of rest, 8 min during the stimulus and 1 min after the stimulus. EEG activity was recorded from 32 positions with active Ag/AgCl scalp electrodes following the 10-20 system. The continuous EEG signal was split into consecutive segments of one minute.ResultsThe V-STI-group showed statistically significant differences in the theta, low alpha and high alpha bands, bilaterally in the supplementary motor (SMA) and premotor (PMA) areas (BA6 and BA8), superior parietal cortex (BA5, BA7) and the posterior cingulate cortex (BA23, BA31). For the V-STI-group, all frequency bands presented an initial bilateral activation of the superior and medial SMA (BA6) during the first minute. This activation was maintained until the fourth minute. During the fourth minute, the activation decreased in the three frequency bands. From the fifth minute, the activation in the superior and medial SMA rose again in the three frequency bandsConclusionsOur findings highlight that the specific stimulation area at intercostal space, on the mammillary line between 7 and 8th ribs according to Vojta therapy differentially increased bilateral activation in SMA (BA6) and Pre-SMA (BA8), BA5, BA7, BA23 and BA31 in the theta, low and high alpha bands in healthy subjects. These results could indicate the activation of innate locomotor circuits during stimulation of the pectoral area according to the Vojta therapy.Trial registration Retrospectively registered. This randomized controlled trial has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04317950 (March 23, 2020).

Ambulatory EEG Monitoring, Reviewing, and Interpreting	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						Ambulatory EEG; Qualifications for interpreting; Technical requirements; Clinical utility	VIDEO-EEG; EPILEPSY; DIAGNOSIS; TELEMETRY; REQUIREMENTS; MANAGEMENT; SEIZURES; UTILITY	This section of this volume of the Journal of Neurophysiology's review of ambulatory EEG (aEEG) is an overview of the uses of the technique, the clinicians who most often use it, and why they use it. It looks at the use of aEEG from the perspectives of the "generalist" and the "specialist" and discusses where they have similar interests and where their interest may diverge. It compares the use of aEEG to the more classic inpatient-based epilepsy monitoring unit service and compares the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches (aEEG vs. epilepsy monitoring unit). This section then reviews how aEEGs are clinically interpreted based on a best practices approach and how aEEGs can be modified to address recording problems that, until recently, have been approached only in an epilepsy monitoring unit environment. Finally, this section addresses the qualifications necessary for the proper interpretation and reporting of aEEG studies. At the end of this section, there are five case examples using aEEG techniques that demonstrate various aspects covered in this section. These case reports demonstrate not only the utility of aEEG but also show how aEEG recordings can be integrated into the care of complex clinical situations that are frequently encountered not only by the practicing generalists but also by epilepsy specialists who practices out of a comprehensive epilepsy program.

To address this question, all young children (under 5 years of age) referred for an initial assessment to ambulatory pediatric neurology or developmental pediatric clinics at a tertiary university center over an 18-month period for a suspected developmental delay were prospectively identified. Specific diagnostic testing was left to the discretion of the evaluating physician. In all, 50 children with an autistic spectrum disorder were assessed. Detailed history or physical examination was informative with respect to suggesting the possibility of an underlying etiology in a minority (10/50, 20%). Genetic studies (FMR-1, karyotype), electroencephalography (EEG), and neuroimaging were carried out in a majority (42/50, 34/50, and 33/50, respectively) of the children, for the most part on a screening rather than an indicated basis (31/42, 34/34, and 28/33, respectively). Etiologic yield was low (1/50, 2%), with only a single child identified with a possible Landau-Kleffner variant on sleep EEG tracing. The results suggest an evaluation paradigm with reference to etiologic determination for young children with autistic spectrum disorder that does not presently justify metabolic or neuroimaging on a screening basis. Recurrence risk and treatment implications, however, suggest that strong consideration be given to genetic (FMR-1, karyotype) testing and EEG study despite a relatively low yield.

Therefore, this paper presents the implementation of a complete EEG acquisition ASIC tailored towards the needs of such applications, i.e., high-signal quality, low-power dissipation and ease of use. The presented ASIC includes eight readout front-end channels and an 11-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The key to its high performance and low-power dissipation is the new AC coupled chopper stabilized instrumentation amplifier (ACCIA) implementation that uses a coarse-fine servoloop and reaches more than 120 dB CMRR, consumes only 2.3 mu A, and achieves a noise-efficiency factor (NEF) of 4.3. Furthermore, the ease of use of the ASIC is realized by incorporating Calibration and Electrode Impedance Measurement Modes to the ASIC. Therefore, the former can be used to check the functionality of the ASIC, as well as, to calibrate the gain matching of the channels, where as the latter can be used to track the quality of the biopotential electrode. The ASIC is implemented in 0.5 mu m CMOS process and the total current consumption is 66 mu A from 3 V.

Aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of levetiracetam (LEV) on EDs, monitored with ambulatory EEG (A/EEG), in a limited series of patients with generalized epilepsy. Methods: We performed 24 h A/EEG recording in basal condition and at follow-up after LEV therapy in 21 adult epileptic patients. Eleven received LEV as monotherapy and 10 as add-on. For each patient we quantified total epileptic activity considering the following parameters: total number, total duration, maximal duration and median duration Of EDs. self-reported information on the effect of LEV on clinical seizures was also collected, to determine the electro-clinical Correlation. Results: A high variability of the response to LEV was observed in the monotherapy group, without statistical differences for all the parameters investigated. A significant reduction of the total number of seizures (113.6 vs. 41.2; p =.01) was observed in patients in add-on therapy. The modifications of epileptiform EEG abnormalities did not necessarily correlate with the self-reported clinical impressions. Discussion: The quantification of EDs monitored by A/EEG provides a useful objective support for evaluating the neurophysiologic profile and the real efficacy of an antiepileptic treatment. In our patients LEV was able to significantly reduce the EDs only in add-on therapy. Further larger studies are necessary to clarify the effects of LEV on electro-clinical features of generalized epilepsy. (c) 2008 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

EEG during pedaling: Evidence for cortical control of locomotor tasks	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Pedaling; Brain activity	TIBIALIS ANTERIOR MUSCLE; SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; SPINAL-CORD LESIONS; MOTOR IMAGERY; HUMAN WALKING; POSTSTROKE HEMIPARESIS; PATHWAY CONTRIBUTES; STRETCH REFLEXES; BRAIN ACTIVATION; HUMAN BIPEDALISM	Objective: This study characterized the brain electrical activity during pedaling, a locomotor-like task, in humans. We postulated that phasic brain activity would be associated with active pedaling, consistent with a cortical role in locomotor tasks. Methods: Sixty four channels of electroencephalogram (EEG) and 10 channels of electromyogram (EMG) data were recorded from 10 neurologically-intact volunteers while they performed active and passive (no effort) pedaling on a custom-designed stationary bicycle. Ensemble averaged waveforms, 2 dimensional topographic maps and amplitude of the beta (13-35 Hz) frequency band were analyzed and compared between active and passive trials. Results: The peak-to-peak amplitude (peak positive-peak negative) of the EEG waveform recorded at the Cz electrode was higher in the passive than the active trials (p < 0.01). beta-band oscillations in electrodes overlying the leg representation area of the cortex were significantly desynchronized during active compared to the passive pedaling (p < 0.01). A significant negative correlation was observed between the average EEG waveform for active trials and the composite EMG (summated EMG from both limbs for each muscle) of the rectus femoris (r = -0.77, p < 0.01) the medial hamstrings (r = -0.85, p < 0.01) and the tibialis anterior (r = -0.70, p < 0.01) muscles. Conclusions: These results demonstrated that substantial sensorimotor processing occurs in the brain during pedaling in humans. Further, cortical activity seemed to be greatest during recruitment of the muscles critical for transitioning the legs from flexion to extension and vice versa. Significance: This is the first study demonstrating the feasibility of EEG recording during pedaling, and owing to similarities between pedaling and bipedal walking, may provide valuable insight into brain activity during locomotion in humans.

Methods: We studied 24-hour ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of patients with GGE, diagnosed and classified according to the International League against Epilepsy criteria. We manually coded the type of discharge, time of occurrence, duration, and arousal state of each ED. We employed mixed effects Poisson regression modeling to study the temporal distribution of epileptiform discharges. Additionally, we used multinomial regression analysis to explore the significance of the relationship between different states of arousal and types of epileptiform discharges. Results: We analyzed 6923 EDs from 105 abnormal 24-hour EEGs. Mixed effects Poisson regression analysis demonstrated significant changes in ED counts across time blocks. This distribution was largely influenced by the state of arousal. Generalized fragments (duration < 2 s) and focal discharges were more frequent during non-REM sleep while paroxysms (duration 2 s) were more frequent in wakefulness. Overall, 67% of epileptiform discharges occurred in non-REM sleep and only 33% occurred in wakefulness. Twenty-four patients (23%) had ED exclusively in sleep. Epileptiform discharges peaked from 23:00 through 07:00 h. Significance: There is a time-of-day dependency of ED with a significant influence exerted by the state of arousal. Our observations suggest that the generation of epileptiform discharges is not a random process but is the result of complex interactions among biological rhythms such as the sleep-wake cycle and the intrinsic circadian pacemaker. High density of ED in sleep suggests that 24-hour EEG recording with the capture of natural sleep may be more useful than routine EEG to diagnose GGE. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This technology provides severely disabled people with an alternative mean to communicate or control any electric device. On the other hand, BCI applications are more and more dedicated to healthier people, with the aim of giving them access to augmented reality or new rehabilitation tools. As it is noninvasive, light and relatively cheap, electroencephalography (EEG) is the most used acquisition technique to record cerebral activity of the BCI users. However, when using such type of BCI, user movements are likely to provoke motions of the measuring electrodes which can severely damage the EEG quality. Thus, current BCI technology requires that the user sits and performs as little movements as possible. This is of course a strong limitation of BCI for use in ordinary life. Very recently, preliminary studies have been published in the literature and suggest that BCI applications can be realized even in the physically moving context. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the possibility to develop a P300-based BCI system in ambulatory condition. The study is based on experimental data recorded with seven subjects executing a visual P300 speller-like discrimination task while simultaneously walking at different speeds on a treadmill. It is demonstrated that a P300-based BCI is definitely feasible in such conditions. Different artifact correction methods are described and discussed in detail. To conclude, a recommended approach is given for the development of a real-time application.

Ambulatory EEG NeuroMonitor platform for engagement studies of children with development delays	SMART BIOMEDICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL SENSOR TECHNOLOGY X	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Smart Biomedical and Physiological Sensor Technology X	MAY 01-02, 2013	Baltimore, MD	SPIE		Autism Spectrum Disorder; Electroencephalography; Embedded system; Programmable System on Chip	SYSTEM; DESIGN	Engagement monitoring is crucial in many clinical and therapy applications such as early learning preschool classes for children with developmental delays including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or cerebral palsy; as it is challenging for the instructors to evaluate the individual responses of these children to determine the effectiveness of the teaching strategies due to the diverse and unique need of each child who might have difficulty in verbal or behavioral communication. This paper presents an ambulatory scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) NeuroMonitor platform to study brain engagement activities in natural settings. The developed platform is miniature (size: 2.2 '' x 0.8 '' x 0.36 '', weight: 41.8 gm with 800 mAh Li-ion battery and 3 snap leads) and low-power (active mode: 32 mA low power mode: under 5mA) with 2 channels (Fp1, Fp2) to record prefrontal cortex activities of the subject in natural settings while concealed within a headband. The signals from the electrodes are amplified with a low-power instrumentation amplifier; notch filtered (f(c) = 60Hz), then band-passed by a 2nd-order Chebyshev-I low-pass filter cascaded with a 2nd-order low-pass (f(c) = 125Hz). A PSoC ADC (16-bit, 256 sps) samples this filtered signal, and can either transmit it through a Class-2 Bluetooth transceiver to a remote station for real-time analysis or store it in a microSD card for offline processing. This platform is currently being evaluated to capture data in the classroom settings for engagement monitoring of children, aimed to study the effectiveness of various teaching strategies that will allow the development of personalized classroom curriculum for children with developmental delays.

Seizures were the generalized myoclonic and tonic-clonic type. Phenobarbital was initiated and maintained; however, seizures were not controlled. Other anti-seizure drugs, including levetiracetam, zonisamide, and diazepam, also provided insufficient seizure control with seizures occurring hourly to daily. By 8 months of age, the cat displayed non-ambulatory tetraparesis and deep somnolence. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and pre- and post-prandial total bile acid analyses were unremarkable. Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) revealed central dominant but generally synchronized spikes and multiple spikes. The cat was diagnosed with drug-resistant epilepsy of unknown cause and was included in a clinical trial of epilepsy surgery. Given the unremarkable MRI and bilateral synchronized EEG abnormalities, a corpus callosotomy was performed at 12 months of age, and partial desynchronization of spikes was confirmed on EEG. Incomplete transection was found in the genu of the corpus callosum on postoperative MRI. After surgery, the mental status and ambulation clearly improved, and seizure frequency and duration were remarkably reduced. Recheck with follow-up EEG and MRI were performed at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. Scores of activities of daily living and visual analog scales including cat's and owner's quality of life had also improved considerably. This case report is the first documentation of the one-year clinical outcome of corpus callosotomy in a clinical feline case with drug-resistant epilepsy.

To investigate whether musical engagement can be monitored, we developed an experimental protocol using the mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) paradigm in which participants make expressive rhythmic arm gestures to encourage and/or index musical engagement. Participants communicate the feeling pulse of music they are hearing via simple rhythmic U-shaped back-and-forth hand/arm 'conducting' gesture cycles that animate, in real time, the mirroring movement of a spot of light on a video display in front of them. Participants are asked to imagine that this display is also being viewed remotely by a deaf friend to whom they are attempting to communicate the feeling of the music they are hearing. In an Engaged condition, listeners are encouraged to fully engage themselves in this musical/emotional communication task. In a Not Engaged condition, a concurrent internal arithmetic distractor task is introduced to induce less fully engaged listening. Here, we report results of training a classifier using a frequency-based common spatial patterns (FBCSP) approach to correctly distinguish Engaged and Not Engaged conditions from concurrently recorded EEG data. Here the approach gave 67% classification accuracy across subjects (versus 50% chance), and 85% accuracy within subjects, cross-validated using a blockwise paradigm.

Novel hybrid bioelectrodes for ambulatory zero-prep EEG measurements using multi-channel wireless EEG system	FOUNDATIONS OF AUGMENTED COGNITION, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Foundation of Augmented Cognition	JUL 22-27, 2007	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA			EEG; biosensors; high impedance; wireless		This paper describes a wireless multi-channel system for zero-prep electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements in operational settings. The EEG sensors are based upon a novel hybrid (capacitive/resistive) bioelectrode technology that requires no modification to the skin's outer layer. High impedance techniques developed for QUASAR's capacitive electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors minimize the sensor's susceptibility to common-mode (CM) interference, and permit EEG measurements with electrode-subject impedances as large as 107 Omega. Results for a side-by-side comparison between the hybrid sensors and conventional wet electrodes for EEG measurements are presented. A high level of correlation between the two electrode technologies (> 99% for subjects seated) was observed. The electronics package for the EEG system is based upon a miniature, ultra-low power microprocessor-controlled data acquisition system and a miniaturized wireless transceiver that can operate in excess of 72 hours from two AAA batteries.

First, the design, VLSI implementation, and experimental validation of a resource-optimized machine learning algorithm for epilepsy seizure detection are described. Next, the development of a mini-PCB that integrates a low-power wireless data transceiver and a programmable processor for hosting the seizure detection algorithm is discussed. The algorithm uses only EEG signals from the frontal lobe electrodes while yielding a seizure detection sensitivity and specificity competitive to the standard full EEG systems. The experimental validation of the algorithm VLSI implementation proves the possibility of conducting accurate seizure detection using quickly-mountable dry-electrode headsets without the need for uncomfortable/painful through-hair electrodes or adhesive gels. Details of design and optimization of the algorithm, the VLSI implementation, and the mini-PCB development are presented and resource optimization techniques are discussed. The optimized implementation is uploaded on a low-power Microsemi Igloo FPGA, requires 1237 logic elements, consumes 110 $\mu$W dynamic power, and yields a minimum detection latency of 10.2 $\mu$s. The measurement results from the FPGA implementation on data from 23 patients (198 seizures in total) shows a seizure detection sensitivity and specificity of 92.5 and 80.1, respectively. Comparison to the state of the art is presented from system integration, the VLSI implementation, and the wireless communication perspectives.

Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Embase, PsyclNFO, and the Web of Science Core Collection databases using the keywords 'genetic generalized epilepsy', 'antiepileptic drugs and 'epileptiform discharge'. Primary human studies published in English that reported the effect of AEDs on EDs captured on electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of at least 24 h in duration in patients with GGE were included. Results: Six studies published between 1984 and 2017, which reported the effect of AEDs on EDs, involving a total of 116 patients with GCE, were analyzed. Our systematic review found a tendency for AEDs to reduce ED density, frequency, cumulative duration, and burst duration in GGE. Furthermore, we found evidence that the AED-mediated reduction in ED burden was associated with improved seizure control and cognitive outcomes. Conclusions: Antiepileptic drugs tend to reduce ED burden in GCE, but the significance of this association remains uncertain. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It would be ideal if both EEG and ECG can be obtained with one measurement. We introduce an algorithm combining the wavelet shrinkage and signal averaging techniques to extract the EEG and ECG components from an EEG lead signal to a noncephalic reference (NCR).

J	King, JL				King, Juliet L.			Summary of Twenty-First Century Great Conversations in Art, Neuroscience and Related Therapeutics	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						art; neuroscience; creative arts therapies; art therapy; mobile brain body imaging; neuroaesthetics	QUANTITATIVE EEG; THERAPY; BRAIN	Transdisciplinary collaboration is the future of knowledge making in advanced post-industrial societies and there is a growing awareness that the most vexing problems we face cannot be solved by any single discipline. Best practices for complex and challenging physical and mental disorders require a multi-disciplinary approach, yet there is a void in bridging the gap between the most contemporary models. It is in this capacity that the Twenty-First Century Great Conversations in Art, Neuroscience, and Related Therapeutics serves as a missing link. It was with active minds and a collective spirit that artists, scientists, therapists, physicians, engineers, technology experts, healthcare practitioners, and researchers from across the globe transcended historical silos to explore the capacities for collaborative partnerships to influence the health of patients and the amelioration of disease. Hosted at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), presenters shared insights through didactic sessions and panel discussions aligned with three tracks led by prominent experts in their respective fields: (1) Neuroaesthetics, Anjan Chatterjee, MD; (2) Creativity and Consciousness, Arne Dietrich, PhD; and (3) Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI), Klaus Gramann, PhD. The goals for this symposium were developed from a vision which embraces cross-disciplinary intersectionality, a merging of viewpoints, and active dialogue surrounding the development of a common language with which to advance the Creative Arts Therapies and neurosciences. The goal was also to contribute to the development of a simplified roadmap to enhance and enrich the CATs with a greater understanding of neuroscience and the available technologies that can assist in research.

Acquisition technology research of EEG and related physiological signals under +Gz acceleration	IRISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						+Gz; EEG; ECG; Ambulatory blood pressure; Ear pulse; Acquisition technology	BLOOD-PRESSURE-MEASUREMENT; SYSTEM	Background With the continuous improvement of maneuvering performance of modern high-performance aircraft, the protection problem of flight personnel under high G acceleration, the development as well as research on monitoring system and the equipment for human physiological signals processing which include electroencephalogram (EEG) have become more and more important. Due to the particularity of +Gz experimental conditions, the high-risk of human experiments and the great difficulty of dynamic measurement, there is little research on the synchronous acquisition technology of EEG and related physiological signals under +Gz acceleration environment. Methods We propose a framework to execute human experiments using the three-axial high-performance human centrifuge, develop reasonable operation mode and design a new experimental research method for EEG signal acquisition and variation characteristics on three-axial high-performance human centrifuge under the environment of +Gz acceleration. We also propose to build the synchronous real-time acquisition plan of EEG, electrocardiogram, brain blood pressure, ear pulse and related physiological signals under centrifuge +Gz acceleration with different equipments and methods. Results The good profiles of EEG, heart rate, brain blood pressure and ear pulse are obtained and analyzed comparatively. In addition, the FMS hop-by-hop continuous blood pressure and hemodynamic measurement system Portapres are successfully applied to the ambulatory blood pressure measure under centrifuge +Gz acceleration environment. Conclusions The proposed methods establish the basis and have an important guiding significance for follow-up experiment development, EEG features spectral analysis and correlation research of all signals.

The aim of our study was to identify possible clinical/EEG peculiarities suggesting the immune-mediated origin of late-onset seizures. Methods: Thirty patients diagnosed with AE (19 men, median age 68 years, 18 seronegative) were included. Overall 212 video-electroencephalographic (EEG) and 31 24-h ambulatory EEG (AEEG) recordings were retrospectively reviewed. Posterior dominant rhythm, interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), clinical (CSs) and subclinical seizures (SCSs) were analyzed. Results: Six-hundred-nineteen ictal events were recorded in 19/30 subjects, mostly (568/619) during AE acute stage. Among ten patients with CSs other than faciobrachial dystonic seizures, 7 showed prominent autonomic and emotional manifestations. SCSs were detected in 11 subjects, mainly via AEEG (260/287 SCSs vs 150/332 CSs, p < 0.001). Eight patients presented seizures during hyperventilation. IEDs, documented in 21 cases, were bilateral in 14 and focal temporal in 13. Multiple ictal EEG patterns were detected in 9/19 patients, 6 of whom had both CSs and SCSs, bilateral asynchronous seizures and ictal activities arising from temporal and extratemporal regions. No correlation was found between the lateralization of MRI alterations and that of EEG findings. Conclusion: Our study confirms that adult-onset, high frequency focal seizures with prominent autonomic and emotional manifestations should be investigated for AE. Multiple ictal EEG patterns could represent a 'red flag', reflecting a widespread neuronal excitability related to the underlying immune-mediated process. Finally, our work enhances the crucial role of long-lasting EEG monitoring in revealing subclinical and relapsing seizures.

Past, Present and Future of Home video-electroencephalographic telemetry: A review of the development of in-home video-electroencephalographic recordings	EPILEPSIA			English	Review						EMU; epilepsy; home video-EEG telemetry; HVET; remote monitoring; video-EEG	AMBULATORY EEG; LONG-TERM; EPILEPSY; DIAGNOSIS; IMPLEMENTATION; UTILITY	Video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring is an essential tool in epileptology, conventionally carried out in a hospital epilepsy monitoring unit. Due to high costs and long waiting times for hospital admission, coupled with technological advances, several centers have developed and implemented video-EEG monitoring in the patient's home (home video-EEG telemetry [HVET]). Here, we review the history and current status of three general approaches to HVET: (1) supervised HVET, which entails setting up video-EEG in the patient's home with daily visiting technologist support; (2) mobile HVET (also termed ambulatory video-EEG), which entails attaching electrodes in a health care facility, supplying the patient and carers with the hardware and instructions, and then asking the patient and carer to set up recording at home without technologist support; and (3) cloud-based HVET, which adds to either of the previous models continuous streaming of video-EEG from the home to the health care provider, with the option to review data in near real time, troubleshoot hardware remotely, and interact remotely with the patient. Our experience shows that HVET can be highly cost-effective and is well received by patients. We note limitations related to long-term electrode attachment and correct camera placing while the patient is unsupervised at home, and concerns related to regulations regarding data privacy for cloud services. We believe that HVET opens significant new opportunities for research, especially in the field of understanding the many influences in seizure occurrence. We speculate that in the future HVET may merge into innovative new multisensor approaches to continuously monitoring people with epilepsy.

J	Maddirala, AK; Shaik, RA				Maddirala, Ajay Kumar; Shaik, Rafi Ahamed			Motion artifact removal from single channel electroencephalogram signals using singular spectrum analysis	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD); Canonical correlation analysis (CCA); Singular value decomposition (SVD); Singular spectrum analysis (SSA)	EMPIRICAL-MODE DECOMPOSITION; BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION	In ambulatory electroencephalogram (EEG) health care systems, recorded EEG signals often contaminated by motion artifacts. In this paper, we proposed a singular spectrum analysis (SSA) technique with new grouping criteria to remove the motion artifact from a single channel EEG signal. In order to remove the motion artifactfrom a single channel EEG signal, we considered the eigenvectors (basis vectors) corresponding to motion artifact are grouped or identified based on their local mobility, which is a signal complexity measure. However, as the local mobility of eigenvectors associated to the motion artifact are small, a threshold of 0.1 is set to identify them. The motion artifact signal is estimated using the identified eigenvectors and subtracted from the contaminated EEG signal to obtain the corrected EEG signal. The proposed technique is tested on 21 single channel real EEG signals contaminated by motion artifact and compared the results with the existing combined ensemble empirical mode decomposition and canonical correlation analysis (EEMD-CCA) technique. The simulation results show that the proposed modified SSA enjoys an improvement in the signal to noise ratio and the percentage reduction in artifact. Moreover, as the ambulatory EEG systems are battery operated, use of high computational signal processing techniques will reduce the battery lifetime. Hence, low computational signal processing techniques are greatly demanded in such applications. Thus, we have also evaluated the computational complexity of the proposed technique and compared with EEMD-CCA. We found that the proposed modified SSA technique significantly reduces the computational complexity and thereby lower power consumption compared to the EEMD-CCA. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous research has aimed at linking these impairments with altered sleep architecture, but results were inconclusive. One plausible explanation is that only a few studies recorded markers of autonomic nervous system activity. For the first time, this study collected such markers under ecologically valid conditions with ambulatory assessment. In 19 individuals with frequent nightmares (>= 1 nightmare/week) and 19 healthy control participants (<1 nightmare/month), measures indicating autonomic activation (heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration cycle length, electrodermal fluctuations, EEG arousals, saliva cortisol, REM density) were collected while applying ambulatory polysomnographic assessment during 3 consecutive nights. When nightmare participants reported a nightmare, we analyzed the last 5 min of REM sleep before awakening and compared these data to their non-nightmares as well as to the dream episodes of control participants. Overall, there were no general differences in autonomic activation of nightmare sufferers compared to control participants. However, when nightmare participants experienced nightmares, autonomic activation was markedly increased compared to their own non-nightmares and, to some extent, to control participant's dreams. Significant intraindividual differences were found for all autonomic measures except in participant's EEG arousals and cortisol levels. Group differences were found in EEG arousals and heart rate. In conclusion, ambulatory polysomnography demonstrates that nightmares are accompanied by increased autonomic activation. Results support the notion of impaired self-reported sleep quality caused by one's autonomic response rather than altered sleep pattern.

Methods: Centrotemporal spikes were visually evaluated based on 24-h ambulatory EEG studies to determine the total, left, right, and bilateral centrotemporal spikes patients were awake and asleep. These spike rates were then used to compare the entire night of sleep to the first 2 h of sleep, the repeatability of spike frequency over two recordings (done within days to weeks), and longitudinal changes in spike rate over 6 and 12 months. Results: Nineteen children with newly diagnosed and untreated BECTS were included in this analysis. An excellent correlation was found between the centrotemporal spike rate during the entire duration of sleep and the first 2 h of sleep (intraclass correlation [ICC] 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67-0.95). In addition, an excellent correlation was found between two recordings completed an average of 23 days apart while patients were asleep (ICC 0.92, 95% CI 0.80-0.97) and good correlation while patients were awake (ICC 0.70, 95% CI 0.39-0.87). The average change in spike rate between recordings at baseline and at 6 months was a decrease of 64.7% (range -100% to +51.5%, p = 0.01) and the average change in rate between recordings at baseline and at 12 months was a decrease of 57.7% (range -100% to +29.1%, p = 0.01). In addition, within 6 months, most children had decreased centrotemporal rates, with 30% of children being spike-free. This absence of spikes did not continue in all children, since the majority (60%) had some spikes at 1 year following diagnosis. Significance: Centrotemporal spike rates during sleep are stable when compared over days to weeks; however, when comparing spike rates over months there is a larger degree of variability.

Mobile steady-state evoked potential recording: Dissociable neural effects of real-world navigation and visual stimulation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						SSVEP; Mobile EEG; Lateralization; Vestibular cognition; Locomotion; Navigation	BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; EEG; SPACE; COST	Background: The ability to record brain activity in humans during movement, and in real world environments, is an important step towards understanding cognition. Electroencephalography (EEG) is well suited to mobile applications but suffers from the problem of artefacts introduced into the signal during movement. Steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) give an excellent signal-to-noise ratio and averaging a sufficient number of trials will eventually remove any noise not phase locked to the visual flicker. New Method: Here we present a method for producing SSVEPs of real world environments using modified LCD shutter glasses, which are commonly used for 3D TV, by adapting the glass to flicker at neurophysiologically relevant frequencies (alpha band). Participants viewed a room whilst standing and walking. Either the left or right side of the room was illuminated, to test if it is possible to recover the resulting SSVEPs when walking, as well as to probe the effect of walking on neural activity. Additionally, by using a signal generator to produce "simulated SSVEPs" on the scalp we can demonstrate that this method is able to accurately recover evoked neural responses during walking. Results: The amplitude of SSVEPs over right parietal cortex was reduced by walking. Furthermore, the waveform and phase of the SSVEPs is highly preserved between walking and standing, but was sensitive to whether the left or right side of the room was illuminated. Conclusions: This method allows probing neural responses during natural movements within real environments, potentially at a wide range of frequencies.

Therefore, it would be desirable if one can acquire both EEG and ECG signals with a single measurement. One of the key techniques in such kind of application is to separate EEG and ECG using signal processing techniques. In our study, we have confirmed that by applying non-cephalic reference electrode in the EEG recording, it is possible to obtain ECG signals available for signal processing. We also improved the wavelet shrinkage algorithm by performing window operations in approximation level five of wavelet components to successfully separate the EEG components from the ECG signal. Our results showed that the improved normalized power spectrum were accurate in all frequency bands for the EEG components, while the R peak detection for the ECG were 100 % successful in this study.

Circadian and multiday seizure periodicities, and seizure clusters in canine epilepsy	BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						EEG; epilepsy; animal models; intracranial EEG; ambulatory EEG; seizure prediction	STATUS EPILEPTICUS; IMPLANTED DEVICE; LONG-TERM; PHARMACOKINETICS; STIMULATION; CIRCASEPTAN; PREDICTION; FREQUENCY; NUCLEUS; PLACEBO	Advances in ambulatory intracranial EEG devices have enabled objective analyses of circadian and multiday seizure periodicities, and seizure clusters in humans. This study characterizes circadian and multiday seizure periodicities, and seizure clusters in dogs with naturally occurring focal epilepsy, and considers the implications of an animal model for the study of seizure risk patterns, seizure forecasting and personalized treatment protocols. In this retrospective cohort study, 16 dogs were continuously monitored with ambulatory intracranial EEG devices designed for humans. Detailed medication records were kept for all dogs. Seizure periodicity was evaluated with circular statistics methods. Circular non-uniformity was assessed for circadian, 7-day and approximately monthly periods. The Rayleigh test was used to assess statistical significance, with correction for multiple comparisons. Seizure clusters were evaluated with Fano factor (index of dispersion) measurements, and compared to a Poisson distribution. Relationships between interseizure interval (ISI) and seizure duration were evaluated. Six dogs met the inclusion criteria of having at least 30 seizures and were monitored for an average of 65 weeks. Three dogs had seizures with circadian seizure periodicity, one dog had a 7-day periodicity, and two dogs had approximately monthly periodicity. Four dogs had seizure clusters and significantly elevated Fano factor values. There were subject-specific differences in the dynamics of ISI and seizure durations, both within and between lead and clustered seizure categories. Our findings show that seizure timing in dogs with naturally occurring epilepsy is not random, and that circadian and multiday seizure periodicities, and seizure clusters are common. Circadian, 7-day, and monthly seizure periodicities occur independent of antiseizure medication dosing, and these patterns likely reflect endogenous rhythms of seizure risk.

To integrate the brain's holistic motion intention with sEMG's control reliability for lower-limb motion neurorehabilitation with the exoskeleton, an ingenious hierarchical fusion strategy based on EEG and sEMG for ambulation with obstacle crossing task was proposed. Specifically, EEG delivers senior task-specific commands to execute refined locomotion while the specific implementation is determined by sEMG. The practical feasibility of ridge regression-based EEG decoding was proved firstly via offline and online methods involving 3 subjects, with subsequent online verification of the proposed strategy yielding higher than 85% of average accuracy. Furthermore, one subject was invited to wear the exoskeleton for the practical application of the strategy.

J	Arad, E; Bartsch, RP; Kantelhardt, JW; Plotnik, M				Arad, Evyatar; Bartsch, Ronny P.; Kantelhardt, Jan W.; Plotnik, Meir			Performance-based approach for movement artifact removal from electroencephalographic data recorded during locomotion	PLOS ONE			English	Article							WALKING; EEG; GAIT; BRAIN; HEAD	The appreciation for the need to record electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from humans while walking has been steadily growing in recent years, particularly in relation to understanding gait disturbances. Movement artefacts (MA) in EEG signals originate from mechanical forces applied to the scalp electrodes, inducing small electrode movements relative to the scalp which, in turn, cause the recorded voltage to change irrespectively of cortical activity. These mechanical forces, and thus MA, may have various sources (e.g., ground reaction forces, head movements, etc.) that are inherent to daily activities, notably walking. In this paper we introduce a systematic, integrated methodology for removing MA from EEG signals recorded during treadmill (TM) and over-ground (OG) walking, as well as quantify the prevalence of MA in different locomotion settings. In our experiments, participants performed walking trials at various speeds both OG and on a TM while wearing a 32-channel EEG cap and a 3-axis accelerometer, placed on the forehead. Data preprocessing included separating the EEG signals into statistically independent additive components using independent component analysis (ICA). We observed an increase in electro-physiological signals (e.g., neck EMG activations for stabilizing the head during heel-strikes) as the walking speed increased. These artefact independent-components (ICs), while not originating from electrode movement, still exhibit a similar spectral pattern to the MA ICs-a peak at the stepping frequency. MA was identified and quantified in each component using a novel method that utilizes the participant's stepping frequency, derived from a forehead-mounted accelerometer. We then benchmarked the EEG data by applying newly established metrics to quantify the success of our method in cleaning the data. The results indicate that our approach can be successfully applied to EEG data recorded during TM and OG walking, and is offered as a unified methodology for MA removal from EEG collected during gait trials.

Indeterminate EMU admissions: Does repeating the admission help?	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Epilepsy monitoring unit; Long-term monitoring; Seizure classification	EPILEPSY; LONG; EEG	Epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) admissions during 2007-2009 at Mayo Clinic Hospital Arizona were reviewed. Of the 106 indeterminate admissions, 13 (12%) went on to have a second admission. During the second admission, 8 (62%) were diagnosed. Five patients went on to have a third or fourth admission, with none of them receiving a diagnosis. Nineteen (18%) patients had ambulatory EEG monitoring after an indeterminate admission, with only one (5%) receiving a diagnosis after ambulatory EEG monitoring. Even in patients who were initially indeterminate, medication management changed 37% of the time. Admission to the EMU was helpful for spell classification, with 80% of the patients receiving a diagnosis after the first admission. Based on this study, a second admission should be considered if no diagnosis is reached after the first admission. If no diagnosis is made after the second EMU admission, subsequent admissions are unlikely to produce a definitive diagnosis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The proposed method consists of emphasis of QRS complex from EEG using least squares acceleration (LSA) filter, generation of synchronized pulse with R-peak and ECG artifacts estimation and elimination using adaptive filter. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using simulated and real EEG recordings, we found that the ECG artifacts were successfully estimated and eliminated in comparison with the conventional multi-channel techniques, which are independent component analysis (ICA) and ensemble average (EA) method. From this we can conclude that the proposed method is useful for the detecting and eliminating the ECG artifacts from single channel EEG and simple to use for ambulatory/portable EEG monitoring system.

Previous studies focusing on visual processing of biological motion mainly presented point light walker that were fixed on a spot, thus removing the net translation toward a goal that yet remains a critical feature of locomotor behavior. We hypothesized that if biological motion recognition relies on the transformation of seeing in doing and its expected sensory consequences, a significant effect of translation compared to centered displays on sensorimotor cortical activity is expected. To this aim, we explored whether EEG activity in the theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta 1 (14-20 Hz) and beta 2 (20-32 Hz) frequency bands exhibited selectivity as participants viewed four types of stimuli: a centered walker, a centered scrambled, a translating walker and a translating scrambled. We found higher theta synchronizations for observed stimulus with familiar shape. Higher power decreases in the beta 1 and beta 2 bands, indicating a stronger motor resonance was elicited by translating compared to centered stimuli. Finally, beta bands modulation in Superior Parietal areas showed that the translational component of locomotion induced greater motor resonance than human shape. Using a Multinomial Logistic Regression classifier we found that Dorsal-Parietal and Inferior-Frontal regions of interest (ROIs), constituting the core of action-observation system, were the only areas capable to discriminate all the four conditions, as reflected by beta activities. Our findings suggest that the embodiment elicited by an observed scenario is strongly mediated by horizontal body displacement.

Presurgical evaluation of temporal lobe epilepsy: Is an outpatient prolonged ambulatory EEG study sufficient to recommend a surgical resection?	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR REPORTS			English	Article						Epilepsy surgery; Refractory temporal lobe epilepsy	INPATIENT VIDEO-EEG; SURGERY; UTILITY	Purpose: Inpatient Video EEG Monitoring (VEM) is the typical study performed in presurgical evaluations. It is expensive and not widely available in developing countries. Recent studies suggested that in selected patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy secondary to unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), the recording of unilateral interictal epileptiform activity ipsilateral to the MTS may yield sufficient presurgical EEG data. Outpatient prolonged ambulatory EEG (AEEG) could be an alternative in these cases. The purpose of this study was to compare the post-surgical seizure outcome and costs between patients evaluated with AEEG versus VEM. Methods: Thirty patients with TLE were included: 21 evaluated with VEM and 9 with AmbEEG and underwent surgery between 2011 and 2017. The minimum, post-surgical follow-up period was 1 year. Results: Seven of nine patients who underwent AEEG had seizures ipsilateral to MTS. In two patients only unilateral interictal activity ipsilateral to the lesion was recorded. All patients were free of disabling seizures (Engel Class I) at last follow-up. The mean cost per patient of AEEG was $980 and was $4680 for VEM. Conclusion: AEEG may be used to identify candidates for temporal lobectomy in selected patients with unilateral lesional mesial TLE. This approach to EEG monitoring could make epilpesy surgery more affordable to some patients in developing countries. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.

EEG recordings of an epileptic patient obtained from `ambulatory recording systems' contain a large volume of EEG data. A time consuming analysis of the entire length of EEG data by an expert is required to detect the epileptic activity. This paper discusses an automated diagnostic method using artificial neural networks for the detection of epilepsy. Experimental results obtained with four different types of neural networks, namely, multi-layer perceptron, Elman network, probabilistic neural network and learning vector quantization are presented. It is found that the Elman network performs better than the other three neural networks. It is also shown that the performance of the Elman network with a single attribute as the input is almost identical to that of the recently reported LAMSTAR network which uses two attributes as inputs.

Despite high noise in scalp EEG, PSDM yield consistently superior performance over traditional nonlinear indicators, such as Kolmogorov entropy Lyapunov exponents, and correlation dimension. However, blind Application of PSDM may result in channel inconsistency, Whereby multiple datasets from the same patient yield conflicting forewarning indications in the same channel. This paper presents a first attempt to solve this problem.

EEG signals are analysed in order to study the cognitive mechanisms related to self-adjustments or attention during walking and to decode the locomotion. Moreover, a group of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) are used to know the gait kinematics and to a better understanding of correlation between electrophysiological and biomechanical data.

The main effect of tDCS is to modulate cortical excitability depending on the polarity of the applied current. However, the underlying mechanism of neuromodulation is not well understood. A new generation of functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) systems is described that are miniaturized, portable, and include wearable sensors. These developments provide an opportunity to couple fNIRS with tDCS, consistent with a neuroergonomics approach for joint neuroimaging and neurostimulation investigations of cognition in complex tasks and in naturalistic conditions. The effects of tDCS on complex task performance and the use of fNIRS for monitoring cognitive workload during task performance are described. Also explained is how fNIRS + tDCS can be used simultaneously for assessing spatial working memory. Mobile optical brain imaging is a promising neuroimaging tool that has the potential to complement tDCS for realistic applications in natural settings.

There were claims of the potential association of some neurophysiological disorders with the exposure, but the mechanism is yet to be established. The wireless networks, recently, experience a transition from the 4th generation (4G) to 5th generation (5G), while 4G long-term evolution (LTE) is still the frequently used signal in wireless communication. In the study, exposure experiments were conducted using the LTE signal. The subjects were divided into sham and real exposure groups. Before and after the exposure experiments, they underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Within-session and between-session comparisons have been executed for functional connectivity and network properties. Individual specific absorption rate (SAR) was also calculated. The results indicated that acute LTE exposure beneath the safety limits modulated both the functional connection and graph-based properties. To characterize the effect of functional activity, SAR averaged over a certain tissue mass was not an appropriate metric. The potential neurophysiological effect of 5G exposure has also been discussed in the study.

Seizure Diaries and Forecasting With Wearables: Epilepsy Monitoring Outside the Clinic	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Review						wearable devices; seizure detection; seizure forecasting; multidian cycles; machine learning; epilepsy	BRAIN-STIMULATION; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; AUTOMATED SEIZURE; DETECTION SYSTEMS; SELF-PREDICTION; RISK-FACTOR; LONG-TERM; PATIENT; ADULTS; EEG	It is a major challenge in clinical epilepsy to diagnose and treat a disease characterized by infrequent seizures based on patient or caregiver reports and limited duration clinical testing. The poor reliability of self-reported seizure diaries for many people with epilepsy is well-established, but these records remain necessary in clinical care and therapeutic studies. A number of wearable devices have emerged, which may be capable of detecting seizures, recording seizure data, and alerting caregivers. Developments in non-invasive wearable sensors to measure accelerometry, photoplethysmography (PPG), electrodermal activity (EDA), electromyography (EMG), and other signals outside of the traditional clinical environment may be able to identify seizure-related changes. Non-invasive scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and minimally invasive subscalp EEG may allow direct measurement of seizure activity. However, significant network and computational infrastructure is needed for continuous, secure transmission of data. The large volume of data acquired by these devices necessitates computer-assisted review and detection to reduce the burden on human reviewers. Furthermore, user acceptability of such devices must be a paramount consideration to ensure adherence with long-term device use. Such devices can identify tonic-clonic seizures, but identification of other seizure semiologies with non-EEG wearables is an ongoing challenge. Identification of electrographic seizures with subscalp EEG systems has recently been demonstrated over long (> 6 month) durations, and this shows promise for accurate, objective seizure records. While the ability to detect and forecast seizures from ambulatory intracranial EEG is established, invasive devices may not be acceptable for many individuals with epilepsy. Recent studies show promising results for probabilistic forecasts of seizure risk from long-term wearable devices and electronic diaries of self-reported seizures. There may also be predictive value in individuals' symptoms, mood, and cognitive performance. However, seizure forecasting requires perpetual use of a device for monitoring, increasing the importance of the system's acceptability to users. Furthermore, long-term studies with concurrent EEG confirmation are lacking currently. This review describes the current evidence and challenges in the use of minimally and non-invasive devices for long-term epilepsy monitoring, the essential components in remote monitoring systems, and explores the feasibility to detect and forecast impending seizures via long-term use of these systems.

Little is known about the neural representation of DT performance while walking in this target group compared to healthy controls or younger adults. Therefore, utilizing the Mobile Brain/Body Imaging approach (MoBI), we aim at gaining deeper insights into the brain dynamics underlying the interaction of cognitive and motor processes during different DT conditions (visual and auditory) controlling for age and the potential performance decrements of older adults with hearing impairments.Methods: The cross-sectional study integrates a multifactorial mixed-measure design. Between-subject factors grouping the sample will be age (younger vs. older adults) and hearing impairment (mild vs. not hearing impaired). The within-subject factors will be the task complexity (single- vs. DT) and cognitive task modality (visual vs. auditory). Stimuli of the cognitive task will vary according to the stimulus modality (visual vs. auditory), presentation side (left vs. right), and presentation-response compatibility (ipsilateral vs. contralateral). Analyses of DT costs and underlying neuronal correlates focus either on gait or cognitive performance. Based on an a priori sample size calculation 96 (48 healthy and 48 mildly hearing impaired) community-dwelling older adults (50-70 years) and 48 younger adults (20-30 years) will be recruited. Gait parameters of speed and rhythm will be captured. EEG activity will be recorded using 64 active electrodes.Discussion: The study evaluates cognitive-motor interference (CMI) in groups of young and older adults as well as older adults with hearing impairment. The underlying processes of the interaction between motor and cognitive tasks will be identified at a behavioral and neurophysiological level comparing an auditory or a visual secondary task. We assume that performance differences are linked to different cognitive-motor processes, i.e., stimulus input, resource allocation, and movement execution. Moreover, for the different DT conditions (auditory vs. visual) we assume performance decrements within the auditory condition, especially for older, hearing-impaired adults. Findings will provide evidence of general mechanisms of CMI (ST vs. DT walking) as well as task-specific effects in dual-task performance while over ground walking.

Selecting an optimal subset of the EEG channels instead of using all of them is especially important for ambulatory EEG where the user is mobile due to reduced data communication and computational load requirements. In addition, elimination of irrelevant sensors improves the robustness of the classification system by reducing dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a filter approach for EEG channel selection using mutual information (MI) maximization. This method ranks the EEG channels, such that the MI between the selected sensors and class labels is maximized. This selection criterion is known to reduce classification error. We employ a computationally efficient approach for MI estimation and EEG channel ranking. This approach is illustrated on EEG data recorded from three subjects performing two mental tasks. Experiment results show that the proposed approach works well and the position of the selected channels using the proposed method is consistent with the expected cortical areas for the mental tasks.

Since patients have to wear the electrodes all the time, it is desirable to use the minimum number of electrodes needed to achieve good performance. In this paper, we describe a method that uses Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to design detectors that use small numbers of electrodes. We also present results that indicate that the appropriate number of electrodes varies across patients. It is frequently the case that a surprisingly small number of electrodes, sometimes as few as two, suffices to construct a detector with expected performance comparable to that of detectors that use a full twenty-one-channel montage.

We argue that seizure prediction is possible; however, most previous attempts have used data with an insufficient amount of information to solve the problem. The review discusses four methods for gaining more information above standard clinical electrophysiological recordings. We first discuss developments in obtaining long-term data that enables better characterisation of signal features and trends. Then, we discuss the usage of electrical stimulation to probe neural circuits to obtain robust information regarding excitability. Following this, we present a review of developments in high-resolution micro-electrode technologies that enable neuroimaging across spatial scales. Finally, we present recent results from data-driven model-based analyses, which enable imaging of seizure generating mechanisms from clinical electrophysiological measurements. It is foreseeable that the field of seizure prediction will shift focus to a more probabilistic forecasting approach leading to improvements in the quality of life for the millions of people who suffer uncontrolled seizures. However, a missing piece of the puzzle is devices to acquire long-term-high-quality data. When this void is filled, seizure prediction will become a reality.

The work builds upon recent studies testing the applicability of real-world tasks while obtaining electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. Participants performed a response inhibition GO/NOGO task designed to evoke a P3 component for correct response inhibitions and an error-related negativity (ERN) for incorrect commission errors - while speed of walking was experimentally manipulated. Robust P3 and ERN components were obtained under all experimental conditions - while participants were sitting, walking at moderate speed (2.4 km/hour), or walking rapidly (5 km/hour). Signal-to-noise ratios were remarkably similar across conditions, pointing to the feasibility of high-fidelity ERP recordings under relatively vigorous activity regimens. There is considerable research and clinical motivation to obtain high quality neurophysiological measures under more naturalistic environmental settings such as these. Strong links between cognitive load and gait abnormalities are seen in a number of clinical populations and these MoBI technologies provide highly promising methods for gaining insights into the underlying pathophysiology.

Ten healthy adults (21-36 years) were asked to walk overground in three different conditions: (1) normal walking in a straight path (NW); (2) walking in a pre-defined pathway forcing variation in step width and length by stepping on green marks on the floor (only one color: W1C), and (3) walking in the same pre-defined W1C pathway while evaluating different combinations among the colors green, yellow and red, in which only one color was the footfall target (evaluating two colors: W2C). Walking speed, stride duration and scalp electroencephalography (EEG) were recorded from all conditions. Event-related spectral perturbation was calculated for channels Fz, Cz, C3, C4, Pz and Oz in each condition, which were all time-normalized in relation to the gait cycle. The results showed that walking speed was reduced and stride duration was increased for W2C when compared to both NW and W1C (p < 0.01). Moreover, Event-related spectral perturbation analysis revealed significant changes (p < 0.05) during mid-stance in the frontal lobe and motor/sensorimotor regions, a phase in the gait cycle in which participants define the correct foot placement for the next step. These results suggest that greater cognitive demands during precision stepping influences electrocortical dynamics especially towards step transitions. Therefore, increased electrocortical activity in cognitive, motor and sensorimotor areas may be relevant to produce patterned and safe locomotion through challenging paths.

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether acute long-term evolution (LTE) EMF exposure could modulate brain functional connectivity using regional homogeneity (ReHo) method and seed-based analysis on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We performed the LTE-EMF exposure experiment and acquired the resting-state brain activities before and after EMF exposure. Then we applied ReHo index to characterize the localized functional connectivity and seed-based method to evaluate the inter-regional functional connectivity. Statistical comparisons were conducted to identify the possible evidence of brain functional connectivity modulation induced by the acute LTE-EMF exposure. We found that the acute LTE-EMF exposure modulated localized intra-regional connectivity (p < 0.05, AlphaSim corrected, voxel size >= 18) and inter-regional connectivity in some brain regions (p < 0.05, AlphaSim corrected, voxel size >= 18). Our results may indicate that the approaches relying on network-level inferences could provide deeper insight into the acute effect on human functional activity induced by LTE-EMF exposure.

Vortioxetine, a multimodal antidepressant acting through serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) inhibition, 5-HT3, 5-HT7 and 5-HT1D receptor antagonism, 5-HT1B receptor partial agonism, and 5-HT1A receptor agonism, had fewer incidences of sleep-related adverse events reported in depressed patients. In the accompanying paper a polysomnographic electroencephalography (sleep-EEG) study of vortioxetine and paroxetine in healthy subjects indicated that at low/intermediate levels of SERT occupancy, vortioxetine affected rapid eye movement (REM) sleep differently than paroxetine. Here we investigated clinically meaningful doses (80-90% SERT occupancy) of vortioxetine and paroxetine on sleep-EEG in rats to further elucidate the serotoninergic receptor mechanisms mediating this difference. Cortical EEG, electromyography (EMG), and locomotion were recorded telemetrically for 10 days, following an acute dose, from rats receiving vortioxetine-infused chow or paroxetine-infused water and respective controls. Sleep stages were manually scored into active wake, quiet wake, and non-REM or REM sleep. Acute paroxetine or vortioxetine delayed REM onset latency (ROL) and decreased REM episodes. After repeated administration, vortioxetine yielded normal sleep-wake rhythms while paroxetine continued to suppress REM. Paroxetine, unlike vortioxetine, increased transitions from non-REM to wake, suggesting fragmented sleep. Next, we investigated the role of 5-HT3 receptors in eliciting these differences. The 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron significantly reduced paroxetine's acute effects on ROL, while the 5-HT3 receptor agonist SR57227A significantly increased vortioxetine's acute effect on ROL. Overall, our data are consistent with the clinical findings that vortioxetine impacts REM sleep differently than paroxetine, and suggests a role for 5-HT3 receptor antagonism in mitigating these differences.

Though, it has been well established that the brain activities are significantly modulated by the behavioural state (such as locomotion), how the ASSR is affected remains unclear. Methods We investigated the effect of locomotion by recording local field potential (LFP) evoked by 40-Hz click-train from multiple brain areas: auditory cortex (AC), medial geniculate body (MGB), hippocampus (HP) and prefrontal cortex (PFC), in head-fixed mice free to run on a treadmill. Comparisons were conducted on the LFPs during spontaneous movement and stationary conditions. Results We found that in both the auditory (AC and MGB) and non-auditory areas (HP and PFC), locomotion reduced the initial negative deflection of LFP (early response during 0-100 ms from stimulus onset), and had no significant effect on the ASSR phase-locking to the late stimulus (100-500 ms). Conclusions Our results suggest that different neural mechanisms contribute to the early response and ASSR, and the ASSR is a more robust biomarker to investigate the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Currently, there is no feasible volitional triggering method to adapt the prosthetic device to user's intention to accelerate during walking. Therefore, real-time prediction of human acceleration intention from the pre-acceleration electroencephalogram (EEG), and subsequent adaptation of the prosthetic device's control parameters for seamless transition remains a daunting research area. In that aspect, this study investigates the neural changes responsive to human intention to accelerate during walking. Furthermore, this study also explores whether the acceleration intention can be predicted from real-time EEG to subsequently enable parametric adaptation for an external prosthetic device. EEG, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and ground reaction force (GRF) signals were collected from one healthy subject during walking with self-paced speed changes. A set of classifiers were explored to classify between constant speed and acceleration. The classifiers showed promising classification performance well above chance level in offline, pseudo-online and real-time scenarios. An accuracy of 85.9 +/- 2.9% was achieved in offline scenario, while pseudo-online classification resulted in a true positive rate (TPR) of 81.9 +/- 7.4% with 7.7 +/- 0.8 false positives/ min and a detection latency of -844 +/- 572 ms. In real-time scenario, 9 out of 12 acceleration events were predicted successfully with only 3 false predictions at an average latency of -741 ms. Moreover, offline data analysis suggested suppression of mu and beta rhythms related to gait acceleration between 2 seconds before and 1.5 seconds after the onset of acceleration. A slow increase in negative amplitude was also observed in near DC frequencies of EEG data acquired from the sensorimotor cortex. The findings of this study portray inspiring results in retrieving gait acceleration-associated neural changes for facilitating natural control of assistive devices.	[Hasan, S. M.

J	Brigo, F				Brigo, Francesco			An evidence-based approach to proper diagnostic use of the electroencephalogram for suspected seizures	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Review						Diagnosis; EEG; Epilepsy; Seizure; Sensitivity; Specificity	INTERICTAL EEG; EPILEPSY; DISCHARGES; ADULTS; MISDIAGNOSIS	The EEG has strengths and limitations, which must be known to use it properly. An important reason to order an EEG is to help differentiate seizures from other etiologies of paroxysmal events that may or may not be associated with loss of consciousness. Like any other diagnostic test, the EEG refines the probability of a condition, and is normally used to support the clinical diagnosis of seizures, which relies mainly on a patient's history. The EEG itself neither proves nor excludes a diagnosis of seizures, but is nevertheless essential in the diagnostic workup and proper classification of epileptic seizures and syndromes. On the basis of the most relevant articles available in the literature, this article describes an evidence-based approach to proper use of the EEG in the diagnosis of seizures in an ambulatory care setting and presents concepts such as pretest and posttest probability and sensitivity and specificity with respect to EEG as a diagnostic test.

A prolonged EEG with synchronized video (video-EEG) overcomes some of these limitations by improving the sensitivity, specificity and the diagnostic yield by attempting to record the habitual events when they are frequent and when indicated. Video-EEG is employed commonly for the diagnosis and classification of epilepsy/epilepsy syndromes, to distinguish between seizures and seizures mimickers, for pre-surgical evaluation and in the management of critically ill children. The duration of recording would vary depending on the indication and frequency of events. Ambulatory EEG is another cost effective and convenient alternative in certain circumstances. However, availability of the machines and expertise, accessibility, affordability and labor intensive nature of the procedure limit widespread use in India. This review explores the role of video-EEG in the management of children with epileptic and non-epileptic paroxysmal events with respect to routine clinical practice in India.

We sought to study atypical EEG abnormalities in a systematic way based on 24-h ambulatory EEG recordings. Methods: The diagnosis of GGE was validated and classified into syndromes according to the International League against Epilepsy criteria. All participants underwent 24-h ambulatory EEG recording. Epileptiform discharges were counted and detailed information was entered into an electronic database. Amplitude asymmetry, focal onset/offset of paroxysms, focal discharges, atypical morphology and generalized paroxysmal fast rhythm were defined as atypical abnormalities. Results: Of the total of 120 patients, 107 had abnormal EEGs, of which 66.4% had at least one atypical epileptiform abnormality on EEG. Atypical morphology was the most frequent abnormality in 93.4% of patients, followed by amplitude asymmetry (28.0%), focal discharges (21.5%), focal onset of paroxysms (13.1%), focal offset of paroxysms (8.2%) and generalized paroxysmal fast rhythm (1.9%). The analysis of individual discharges revealed that 76% of paroxysms were of atypical morphology. Significant associations were found between (a) amplitude asymmetry and state of arousal (p < 0.001) as well as seizure-free duration (p 0.013); (b) atypical morphology and state of arousal (p < 0.001). Conclusion: In GGE, there are both common and rare atypical epileptiform EEG abnormalities that may vary according to the state of arousal and seizure-free duration.

The presence of motion artifacts is the major obstacle in applying dry sensors for long-term EEG monitoring. In this paper we assess the impact of external forces applied on a dry EEG electrode as well as the impact of head and body movements on the electrode-tissue contact impedance and the EEG signal. The data collection method and the preliminary correlation analysis are presented. The analysis demonstrates that the impedance magnitude and EEG changes are highly correlated when artifacts are induced by the application of force or head and body movements, only in case these artifacts are short (less than 3s) and exhibit regular pattern. The correlation between the EEG and impedance magnitude is lower for longer artifact segments, especially the ones containing artifacts with irregular movements or large variations in the applied force. This indicates a time-dependent, non-linear relation between the artifact-related phenomena, impedance magnitude, and EEG.

In some patients, inpatient video-EEG may be performed to increase the likelihood of finding abnormalities. Although many agree that home EEG recordings may provide a cost-effective alternative to these recordings, their use is still not introduced everywhere. We surveyed Dutch neurologists and patients and evaluated a novel mobile EEG device (Mobita, TMSi). Key specifications were compared with three other current mobile EEG devices. We shortly discuss algorithms to assist in the review process. Thirty percent (33 out of 109) of Dutch neurologists reported that home EEG recordings are used in their hospital. The majority of neurologists think that mobile EEG can have additional value in investigation of unclear paroxysms, but not in the initial diagnosis after a first seizure. Poor electrode contacts and signal quality, limited recording time and absence of software for reliable and effective assistance in the interpretation of EEGs have been important constraints for usage, but in recent devices discussed here, many of these problems have been solved. The majority of our patients were satisfied with the home EEG procedure and did not think that our EEG device was uncomfortable to wear, but they did feel uneasy wearing it in public.

Brain-machine interfaces (BMI) can be used as a natural control method for such technologies. BMI provides a continuous association between the brain activity and peripheral stimulation, with the potential to induce plastic changes in the nervous system. Paraplegic patients, and especially the ones with incomplete injuries, constitute a potential target population to be rehabilitated with brain-controlled robotic systems, as they may improve their gait function after the reinforcement of their spared intact neural pathways. This paper proposes a closed-loop BMI system to control an ambulatory exoskeleton without any weight or balance support for gait rehabilitation of incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) patients. The integrated system was validated with three healthy subjects, and its viability in a clinical scenario was tested with four SCI patients. Using a cue-guided paradigm, the electroencephalographic signals of the subjects were used to decode their gait intention and to trigger the movements of the exoskeleton. We designed a protocol with a special emphasis on safety, as patients with poor balance were required to stand and walk. We continuously monitored their fatigue and exertion level, and conducted usability and user-satisfaction tests after the experiments. The results show that, for the three healthy subjects, 84.44 +/- 14.56% of the trials were correctly decoded. Three out of four patients performed at least one successful BMI session, with an average performance of 77.6 1 +/- 14.72%. The shared control strategy implemented (i.e., the exoskeleton could only move during specific periods of time) was effective in preventing unexpected movements during periods in which patients were asked to relax. On average, 55.22 +/- 16.69% and 40.45 +/- 16.98% of the trials (for healthy subjects and patients, respectively) would have suffered from unexpected activations (i.e., false positives) without the proposed control strategy. All the patients showed low exertion and fatigue levels during the performance of the experiments. This paper constitutes a proof-of-concept study to validate the feasibility of a BMI to control an ambulatory exoskeleton by patients with incomplete paraplegia (i.e., patients with good prognosis for gait rehabilitation).

We set out to determine the reproducibility of 4 different sleep-assessment methods (3 manual and 1 computer-based) for ventilator-supported critically ill patients and also to quantify the extent to which the reproducibility of the manual methods for measuring sleep differed between critically ill and ambulatory (control) patients. Design: Observational methodologic study. Setting: Academic center. Patients: Critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation and age-matched controls underwent polysomnography. Interventions: None. Measurements and Results: Reproducibility for the computer-based method (spectral analysis of electroencephalography [EEG]) was better than that for the manual methods: R&K methodology and sleep-wakefulness organization pattern (P = 0.03). In critically ill patients, the proportion of misclassifications for measurements using spectral analysis, sleep-wakefulness organization pattern, and R&K methodology were 0%, 36%, and 53%, respectively (P < 0.0001). The EEG pattern of burst suppression was not observed. Interobserver and intraobserver reliability of the manual sleep-assessment methods for critically ill patients (kappa = 0.52 +/- 0.23) was worse than that for control patients (kappa = 0.89 +/- 0.13; P = 0.03). In critically ill patients, the overall reliability of the R&K methodology was relatively low for assessing sleep (kappa = 0.19), but detection of rapid eye movement sleep revealed good agreement (kappa = 0.70). Conclusions: Reproducibility for spectral analysis of EEG was better than that for the manual methods: R&K methodology and sleep-wakefulness organization pattern, For assessment of sleep in critically ill patients, the use of spectral analysis, sleep-wakefulness organization state, or rapid eye movement sleep alone may be preferred over the R&K methodology.

Because the associated cognitive/behavioral disturbances relate more to the amount of spike activity than of seizures, methods of spike quantification gained relevance in diagnosis and monitoring treatment. The conventional methodology for quantification of spike index (SI) relies on repeated full 10-20 long-term ambulatory electroencephalography (aEEG), which is both expensive and poorly tolerated. Objective: The objectives of this study were to demonstrate the clinical value of repeated SI assessments in CSWS and to build and validate a wearable device allowing inexpensive and well-tolerated, repeated quantifications. Methods: A group of N = 38 patients with CSWS were submitted to repeated SI quantifications based on aEEG, as seen fit by the medical clinical assistant. Responses to therapy with corticosteroids (N = 10), sulthiame (N = 7), and the ketogenic diet (N = 3) were monitored. We used a conventional method based on a semiautomatic template match spike search. The individual variability in time spans of days (N = 4) or months (N = 10) was assessed and used to determine the meaningful neurophysiological responses to the diverse therapies. A wearable device capable of recording 2 bipolar EEG channels for 24 h was used to simplify SI quantification. Results: Corticosteroids produced the most powerful SI reduction, but a large individual variability in both amount and time of onset of clinical response with some patients exhibiting recurrence shortly after therapy. A more frequent sampling of SI would provide a more accurate follow-up, with clinical benefit. The comparison of the SI obtained from standard 10-20 electrodes and 2 bipolar EEG channel subsets in aEEG or between the 10-20 and simultaneous wearable recordings, demonstrated that the new method provides an accurate SI quantification. Conclusions: A wearable EEG device with 2 bipolar channels simplifies the process of obtaining repeated SI quantification allowing a more accurate follow-up of spike activity in the clinical setting.

J	Chen, X; He, C; Peng, H				Chen, Xun; He, Chen; Peng, Hu			Removal of Muscle Artifacts from Single-Channel EEG Based on Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition and Multiset Canonical Correlation Analysis	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; SIGNALS	Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings are often contaminated with muscle artifacts. This disturbing muscular activity strongly affects the visual analysis of EEG and impairs the results of EEG signal processing such as brain connectivity analysis. If multichannel EEG recordings are available, then there exist a considerable range of methods which can remove or to some extent suppress the distorting effect of such artifacts. Yet to our knowledge, there is no existing means to remove muscle artifacts from single-channel EEG recordings. Moreover, considering the recently increasing need for biomedical signal processing in ambulatory situations, it is crucially important to develop single-channel techniques. In this work, we propose a simple, yet effective method to achieve the muscle artifact removal from single-channel EEG, by combining ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) with multiset canonical correlation analysis (MCCA). We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method through numerical simulations and application to real EEG recordings contaminated with muscle artifacts. The proposed method can successfully remove muscle artifacts without altering the recorded underlying EEG activity. It is a promising tool for real-world biomedical signal processing applications.

We report a case in which EN was first noted in an 8 year-old boy. Neuro-imaging was normal. Sharp waves from the left occipital lobe characterised the interictal EEG. Ictal video-EEG showed the aspects of electric seizures during clinical manifestations e.g. nystagmus. Ambulatory EEG displayed numerous diurnal and nocturnal seizures, but exclusively in REM sleep. After two weeks of sodium valproate treatment, the seizures, EEG focus spikes and nystagmus, as well as the squint, disappeared. During a two-year follow-up the child had no further seizures, EEG was normal and the school performance was unaffected. This case has the main features of benign epilepsy, although there are unusual features such as epileptic nystagmus, permanent squint, reduction of EEG paroxysmal abnormalities during NREM, and the presence of seizures during BEM sleep. The observation and the significance of EN are discussed with reference to the literature.

To realize more appropriate anesthesia, we have developed a hypnosis control system, which administers propofol as an anesthetic drug to regulate the bispectral index (BIS), an electroencephalography (EEG)-derived index reflecting the hypnosis of a patient. This system consists of three functions: 1) a feedback controller using a model-predictive control method, which can adequately accommodate the effects of time delays; 2) a parameter estimation function of individual differences; and 3) a risk control function for preventing undesirable states such as drug overinfusion or intraoperative arousal. With the approval of the ethics committee of our institute, 79 clinical trials took place since July 2002. The results show that our system can reduce the total amount of propofol infusion and maintain the BIS more accurately than anesthesiologist's manual adjustment.

First, the author describes the sources that introduce EOG artifacts and briefly reviews the existing algorithms for EOG artifacts removal in EEG signals. Two selected algorithms-recursive least square (RLS) and blind source separation (BSS) are discussed in details. The algorithms were chosen either for its good performance or for its low computational charge to be used in ambulatory monitoring devices that are developed within our research program. In the third part, the experimental protocol to collect EOG and EEG measurements are described. The forth part summarizes the results after applying two algorithms to the collected EEG signals. From these results, we draw conclusions on the performance of these selected algorithms. Several possible improvements or challenges are proposed in the discussion.

A physiological signal, Electroencephalogram (EEG) is analyzed to detect human emotion with promising results. The cost of information gathering and lack of number of participants incur a limitation on the size of EEG data set. The deficiency in acquired EEG data set makes it difficult to estimate mental states with deep learning models as it requires a larger size of the training data set. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation method to address challenges due to scarcity of EEG data for training deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Network - Long Short Term Memory (RNN-LSTM). To find the performance of mental state estimator such models are applied before and after proposed data augmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that data augmentation improves the performance of mental state estimator with an accuracy of 98%.

Despite the importance of walking, methodological limitations mean that surprisingly little is known about the neural and cognitive processes that support ambulatory motor control. Here, we report mobile EEG data recorded from 32 healthy young adults during real-world ambulatory obstacle avoidance. Participants walked along a path while stepping over expected and unexpected obstacles projected on the floor, allowing us to capture the dynamic oscillatory response to changes in environmental demands. Compared to obstacle-free walking, time-frequency analysis of the EEG data revealed clear neural markers of proactive and reactive forms of movement control (occurring before and after crossing an obstacle), visible as increases in frontal theta and centro-parietal beta power respectively. Critically, the temporal profile of changes in frontal theta allowed us to arbitrate between early selection and late adaptation mechanisms of proactive control. Our data show that motor plans are updated as soon as an upcoming obstacle appears, rather than when the obstacle is reached. In addition, regardless of whether motor plans required updating, a clear beta rebound was present after obstacles were crossed, reflecting the resetting of the motor system. Overall, mobile EEG recorded during real-world walking provides novel insight into the cognitive and neural basis of dynamic motor control in humans, suggesting new routes to the monitoring and rehabilitation of motor disorders such as dyspraxia and Parkinson's disease.

A patient-specific approach is used to identify anomalous data with potential seizure activity. We use a combination of a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter to smooth out the signal and a signal thresholding step to determine whether the analyzed data segment is normal or abnormal. The algorithm has been tested on seven subjects each with more than 25 hours of recorded data, resulting in an average sensitivity of 97% and a false positive rate of 0.25 per hour. The proposed algorithm finds applications in the automated support systems for ambulatory patients to reduce storage requirements by eliminating data that is neither in the pre-ictal nor in the post-ictal states. Also, it enables real time data analysis of EEG signals.

This algorithm is composed of four steps. Step 1, active wakefulness, is specified when activity is detected by monitoring the animal with an infrared locomotion sensor. Step 2, NREM, is decided by an EEG delta power greater than the threshold. Step 3, REM, is specified by a higher EEG theta/(delta + theta) ratio and a lower EMG integral than the threshold values and Step 4, an undefined epoch, is classified as a state of quiet wakefulness. This algorithm was found to be in > 90% agreement with the waveform recognition procedure and decreased processing time to 40 min for 24-h recording data from eight animals. New software, SleepSign ver. 3, was designed to calculate automatically the three threshold values based on percentage of time spent in each sleep stage thus far reported in rodents.

To date, many attempts have been made to reveal the underlying mechanisms of humans' gait. However, decoding cortical processes associated with different walking conditions using EEG signals for gait-pattern classification is a less-explored research area. In this paper, we design an EEG-based experiment with four walking conditions (i.e., free walking, and exoskeleton-assisted walking at zero, low, and high assistive forces by the use of a unilateral exoskeleton to right lower limb). We proposed spatio-spectral representation learning (SSRL), a deep neural network topology with shared weights to learn the spatial and spectral representations of multi-channel EEG signals during walking. Adoption of weight sharing reduces the number of free parameters, while learning spatial and spectral equivariant features. SSRL outperformed state-of-the-art methods in decoding gait patterns, achieving a classification accuracy of 77.8%. Moreover, the features extracted in the intermediate layer of SSRL were observed to be more discriminative than the hand-crafted features. When analyzing the weights of the proposed model, we found an intriguing spatial distribution that is consistent with the distribution found in well-known motor-activated cortical regions. Our results show that SSRL advances the ability to decode human locomotion and it could have important implications for exoskeleton design, rehabilitation processes, and clinical diagnosis.

An aim of the study was to investigate EEG characteristics of DV in patients with epilepsy. We studied 166 people (63.2% women, mean age 25.17 +/- 9.19 years). The DV phenomenon was studied in patients (27 people) and in a control group (139 healthy people). Patients were interviewed for DV characteristics and underwent a long (12-16 h) ambulatory EEG-monitoring study. In EEG, DV episodes in patients began with polyspike activity in the right temporal lobe and, in some cases, ended with the slow-wave theta-delta activity in the right hemisphere.	[Vlasov, P.

J	Nenna, F; Do, CT; Protzak, J; Gramann, K				Nenna, Federica; Do, Cao Tri; Protzak, Janna; Gramann, Klaus			Alteration of brain dynamics during dual-task overground walking	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cognitive-motor interference; EEG; MoBI; natural cognition; virtual reality	COGNITIVE-MOTOR INTERFERENCE; HEALTHY OLDER; GAIT; P300; EEG; PERFORMANCE; PERCEPTION; RESOURCES; ARTIFACT; VISION	When walking in our natural environment, we often solve additional cognitive tasks. This increases the demand of resources needed for both the cognitive and motor systems, resulting in Cognitive-Motor Interference (CMI). A large portion of neurophysiological investigations on CMI took place in static settings, emphasizing the experimental rigor but overshadowing the ecological validity. As a more ecologically valid alternative to treadmill and desktop-based setups to investigate CMI, we developed a dual-task walking scenario in virtual reality (VR) combined with Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI). We aimed at investigating how brain dynamics are modulated by dual-task overground walking with an additional task in the visual domain. Participants performed a visual discrimination task in VR while standing (single-task) and walking overground (dual-task). Even though walking had no impact on the performance in the visual discrimination task, a P3 amplitude reduction along with changes in power spectral densities (PSDs) were observed for discriminating visual stimuli during dual-task walking. These results reflect an impact of walking on the parallel processing of visual stimuli even when the cognitive task is particularly easy. This standardized and easy to modify VR paradigm helps to systematically study CMI, allowing researchers to control for the impact of additional task complexity of tasks in different sensory modalities. Future investigations implementing an improved virtual design with more challenging cognitive and motor tasks will have to investigate the roles of both cognition and motion, allowing for a better understanding of the functional architecture of attention reallocation between cognitive and motor systems during active behavior.

Most importantly, motion-related artifacts present a major challenge hindering the clean acquisition of EEG data as they spread all over the scalp and across all frequency bands. This leads to additional complexity in the development of neurologically-oriented mobile health solutions. Among the top five most common neurological disorders, epilepsy has increasingly relied on EEG for diagnosis. Separate methods have been used to classify EEG segments in the context of epilepsy while reducing the existing mobility artifacts. This work specifically devises an approach to remove motion-related artifacts in the context of epilepsy. The proposed approach first includes the recording of EEG signals using a wearable EEG headset. The recorded signals are then colored by some motion artifacts generated in a lab-controlled experiment. This stage is followed by temporal and spectral characterization of the signals and artifact removal using independent component analysis (ICA). The proposed approach is tested using real clinical EEG data and results showed an average increase in accuracy of similar to 9% in seizure detection and similar to 24% in prediction.

J	Iranmanesh, S; Rodriguez-Villegas, E				Iranmanesh, Saam; Rodriguez-Villegas, Esther			A 950 nW Analog-Based Data Reduction Chip for Wearable EEG Systems in Epilepsy	IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS			English	Article						Continuous wavelet transform (CWT); data reduction; electroencephalogram (EEG); epilepsy; epileptic spike detection; long-term EEG monitoring; low-power electronics; spikes; wearable EEG (WEEG)	AUTOMATIC DETECTION; ACQUISITION SOC; WIRELESS; CLASSIFICATION; TRANSCEIVER; PROCESSOR; ENERGY; NOISE	Long-term electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring is an important tool used for the diagnosis of epilepsy. Truly Wearable EEG can be considered as the future of ambulatory EEG units, which are the current standard for long-term EEG monitoring. Replacing these short lifetime, bulky units with long-lasting miniature and wearable devices which can be easily worn by patients will result in more EEG data being acquired for longer monitoring periods. This paper presents an analog-based data reduction integrated circuit that would reduce the amount of power required to transmit EEG data by identifying the sections of data that are interesting for diagnostic purposes while discarding the background activity. Using the data reduction system as part of a miniature wireless, EEG monitoring unit would yield significant reductions in power consumption since the transmitter will only be switched ON based on the data reduction system output. A system prototype chip has been fabricated in a 0.35 mu m CMOS process. The system consumes 760 nA from a 1.25 V supply and is able to achieve a sensitivity of 87%, while transmitting 45% of the overall EEG data.

J	Seneviratne, U; Cook, M; D'Souza, W				Seneviratne, Udaya; Cook, Mark; D'Souza, Wendyl			Consistent topography and amplitude symmetry are more typical than morphology of epileptiform discharges in genetic generalized epilepsy	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Generalized epilepsy; Spike-wave; Seizure; Topography; Morphology	JUVENILE MYOCLONIC EPILEPSY; ABSENCE SEIZURES; EEG; FEATURES; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; PHOTOSENSITIVITY; PITFALLS	Objective: To provide a quantitative evaluation of typical electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities in genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE). Methods: We prospectively performed 24-h ambulatory EEG recordings in a cohort of patients with GGE. The diagnosis was established according to the International League Against Epilepsy criteria. Details of all epileptiform discharges across the 24-h time scale were entered into an electronic database. We carried out descriptive statistics to provide a quantitative breakdown of typical EEG abnormalities. Results: A total of 6923 epileptiform discharges from 105 abnormal 24-h ambulatory EEGs were analyzed. 96% of discharges were symmetric in amplitude with fronto-central maximum topographically. Only 24% of the paroxysms had typical morphology while 43% were regular. Photoparoxysmal response, eye-closure sensitivity and hyperventilation-induced generalized paroxysms were less common in around 10%, whereas occipital intermittent rhythmic delta activity was very rare (2%). Conclusion: Our results indicate that generalized discharges with symmetric amplitude and fronto-central maxima are the most consistent findings in GGE, and other features are observed less frequently. Significance: Epileptiform discharges displaying highly consistent amplitude symmetry coupled with fronto-central topography should provoke consideration of GGE. Recognition of variations from typical abnormalities is important to avoid the risk of misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis.

Because EEG recording and monitoring is relatively safe for the patients in deep coma, it is believed to be valuable for either reducing the risk of brain death diagnosis (while comparing other tests such as the apnea) or preventing mistaken diagnosis. The objective of this paper is to study several statistical methods for quantitative EEG analysis in order to help bedside or ambulatory monitoring or diagnosis. We apply signal processing and quantitative statistical analysis for the EEG recordings of 32 adult patients. For EEG signal processing, independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to separate the independent source components, followed by Fourier and time-frequency analysis. For quantitative EEG analysis, we apply several statistical complexity measures to the EEG signals and evaluate the differences between two groups of patients: the subjects in deep coma, and the subjects who were categorized as brain death. We report statistically significant differences of quantitative statistics with real-life EEG recordings in such a clinical study, and we also present interpretation and discussions on the preliminary experimental results.

In this BCI system, while the bipedal NMS system realizes bipedal locomotion through internal entrainment among neural oscillators and a musculoskeletal system, the locomotion of the system is controlled via external entrainment of the neural oscillators to the external input of EEG signals. As the first step in developing the neural oscillator-based BCI controlling a bipedal NMS model, exploratory numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the behavior of the proposed BCI when sinusoidal waves and alpha waves were inputted. The following tendencies were observed: (a) inputting sinusoidal waves with small amplitudes and high frequencies did not affect the natural walking behavior of the bipedal NMS model that was generated by including only offset values in the external input, (b) inputting sinusoidal waves with small amplitudes and low frequencies disturbed and decelerated the walking behavior, (c) inputting sinusoidal waves with large amplitudes accelerated the walking behavior, (d) inputting sinusoidal waves with large amplitudes and a particular frequency changed walking behavior to running behavior, (e) changing the external input of alpha waves between an eyes-open condition and an eyes-closed condition successfully changed the walking behavior. The eyes-open condition led to faster walking compared with the eyes-closed condition.

Assessment of hairline EEG as a screening tool for nonconvulsive status epilepticus	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						hairline EEG; emergency EEG; screening EEG; nonconvulsive status epilepticus	INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; AMBULATORY CASSETTE EEG; ABNORMALITIES; SEIZURES	Purpose: Because of the high incidence of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), the attraction of a "quick and easy" screening electroencephalogram (EEG) is obvious. Previous studies have shown utility of hairline EEG in diagnosing epilepsy. However, this technique has not been evaluated as a screening tool for NCSE. We wanted to provide proof of principle that a screening hairline EEG has sufficient sensitivity to use as a screening tool for diagnosing NCSE. Methods: A total of 120, 2- to 3-min EEG samples of normal and various abnormal digital EEG studies were reformatted in three six-channel montages (A, longitudinal bipolar; B, referential to ipsilateral ear; C, referential to contralateral ear) that mimicked a hairline recording and were interpreted by five neurophysiologists. The test data interpretation was compared with the original EEG interpretation. Results: Performance was best with montages A and B; 71% and 70.5% of the samples were interpreted correctly by using these montages. Only 65% of the samples were correctly interpreted by using montage C. With the best montage (A), the sensitivities ranged from 91% for normal EEG to 54% for periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs). The sensitivity for seizures was only 72%. Seizures were frequently misinterpreted as more benign patterns such as normal and diffuse slowing. Conclusions: EEG data reformatted to resemble a hairline EEG had low sensitivity for detecting seizures. As a result, we do not recommend further pursuit of hairline EEG as a "quick and easy" screening tool for NCSE.

This article presents the development of a real-time locomotion system of a hexapod robot with bio-inspired movement dynamics inspired in the stick insect and tele-operated by cognitive activities of motor imagination. Brain signals are acquired using only four electrodes from a BCI device and sent to computer equipment for processing and classification by the iQSA method based on quaternion algebra. A structure consisting of three main stages are proposed: (1) signal acquisition, (2) data analysis and processing by the iQSA method, and (3) bio-inspired locomotion system using a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) with twelve neurons. An off-line training stage was carried out with data from 120 users to create the necessary decision rules for the iQSA method, obtaining an average performance of 97.72%. Finally, the experiment was implemented in real-time to evaluate the performance of the entire system. The recognition rate to achieve the corresponding gait pattern is greater than 90% for BCI, and the time delay is approximately from 1 to 1.5 seconds. The results show that all the subjects could generate their desired mental activities, and the robotic system could replicate the gait pattern in line with a slight delay.

The unexpected finding of the investigations was that intracerebral, high frequency (50 Hz) electrical stimulation (HFS) triggered the emergence of automatic and involuntary forward-backward locomotion during a focal seizure while the boy was standing. This clinical manifestation was different from the chaotic motor activity described during epileptic wanderings. The stimulation of the same fronto-lateral region, while the patient was lying, produced only the subjective sensation that the legs were moving, although there was no physical manifestation of this. Human locomotion is an innate motor behavior that is normally due to the activation of the spinal network for locomotion (central pattern generator). The emergence of different stereotyped motor behaviors during focal epileptic seizures or sleep disorders has recently been interpreted as a release of subcortical central pattern generators (Tassinari et al. 2005). In view of this, we hypothesize that the involuntary and robot-like locomotion of our patient could be the ictal expression of the release of subcortical locomotor CPGs.

The main challenge in this area is to achieve real-time and accurate bio-signal processing for pattern recognition, especially in Motor Imagery (MI). The significant interaction between brain signals and controllable machines requires instantaneous brain data decoding. In this study, an embedded BCI system based on fist MI signals is developed. It uses an Emotiv EPOC+ Brainwear(R), an Altera SoCKit(R) development board, and a hexapod robot for testing locomotion imagery commands. The system is tested to detect the imagined movements of closing and opening the left and right hand to control the robot locomotion. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals associated with the motion tasks are sensed on the human sensorimotor cortex. Next, the SoCKit processes the data to identify the commands allowing the controlled robot locomotion. The classification of MI-EEG signals from the F3, F4, FC5, and FC6 sensors is performed using a hybrid architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This method takes advantage of the deep learning recognition model to develop a real-time embedded BCI system, where signal processing must be seamless and precise. The proposed method is evaluated using k-fold cross-validation on both created and public Scientific-Data datasets. Our dataset is comprised of 2400 trials obtained from four test subjects, lasting three seconds of closing and opening fist movement imagination. The recognition tasks reach 84.69% and 79.2% accuracy using our data and a state-of-the-art dataset, respectively. Numerical results support that the motor imagery EEG signals can be successfully applied in BCI systems to control mobile robots and related applications such as intelligent vehicles.

Although it has been reported that the theta activity is modulated by various sensory stimuli, the contribution of the visual feedback has not fully understood. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between the locomotion speed and the hippocampal theta activity of freely behaving mice in a virtual environment. It was found that the frequency and the amplitude of the theta activity were correlated with the locomotion speed of the mouse in the virtual space as well as in the real open field. When the visual feedback was switched-off, the frequency and the amplitude of the theta activity were slightly decreased without changing the proportionality constant of the locomotion speed. These data indicate the contribution of the visual feedback to the hippocampal theta activity.

Methods: Through a systematic literature review, 36 wireless SDDs featured in published device validation studies were identified. Each device's seizure detection capabilities that addressed ASM clinical trial primary endpoint measurement needs were cataloged. Results: The two most common types of seizures targeted by ASMs in clinical trials are generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures and focal with impaired awareness (FIA) seizures. The Brain Sentinel SPEAC achieved the highest performance for the detection of GTC seizures (F-1-score = 0.95). A non-commercial wireless EEG device achieved the highest performance for the detection of FIA seizures (F-1-score = 0.88). Discussion: A preliminary assessment of device capabilities for measuring selected ASM clinical trial secondary endpoints was performed. The need to address key limitations in validation studies is highlighted in order to support future assessments of SDD fitness for ASM clinical trial use. In tandem, a stepwise framework to streamline device testing is put forth. These suggestions provide a starting point for establishing SDD reporting requirements before device integration into ASM clinical trials.

Brain stimulation outside a highly equipped, clinical setting requires the use of a low-cost, ambulatory miniature system. The purpose of this double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled study is to quantify the physiological biomarkers of the neural and cardiovascular systems induced by a microwave brain stimulation (MBS) device. We investigated the effect of an active MBS and a sham device on the cardiovascular and neurological responses of ten volunteers (mean age 26.33 years, 70% male). Electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) were recorded in the initial resting-state, intermediate state, and the final state at half-hour intervals using a portable sensing device. During the experiment, the participants were engaged in a cognitive workload. In the active MBS group, the power of high-alpha, high-beta, and low-beta bands in the EEG increased, and the power of low-alpha and theta waves decreased, relative to the sham group. RR Interval and QRS interval showed a significant association with MBS stimulation. Heart rate variability features showed no significant difference between the two groups. A wearable MBS modality may be feasible for use in biomedical research; the MBS can modulate the neurological and cardiovascular responses to cognitive workload.

However, as a small recording requires large memory for storage, and this makes EEG data storage an arduous task. Moreover, classification of EEG for extraction of relevant information is relatively challenging, and selective data retrieval depends on task at hand. Consequently, EEG data storage and classification need to be computationally efficient. This paper presents a combined scheme, for the simultaneous compression and classification of EEG data, which not only decreases the overall computational effort, but also allows selective archiving and retrieval of data. Huffman and Arithmetic coding techniques are employed on CHB-MIT scalp EEG database and the results are presented in form of compression ratio (CR) and percentage root mean square distortion (PDR). For classification, Intelligent Neurologist Support System (INSS), has been used. The classifier output apart from being stored as data, is also used for intelligent data reduction, when only specific information is required, resulting in increased CR and decreased PDR, which is desired. Hence, the results show intelligent compression and reduction of data results in efficient management of EEG data. The signal undergoes state-of-the-art compression such that on reconstruction it almost maintains the same classification accuracy as the original one.

The platform collects and processes data for study administrators, clinicians and data scientists, who use it to create models to detect seizures. For that purpose, all data collected from the wearable devices is additionally synchronized with the hospital EEG and video, with gold-standard seizure labels provided by trained clinicians. Data collected by wearable devices shows potential for seizure detection in out-of-hospital based and ambulatory settings.

In addition to seizures, epileptic patients exhibit interictal spikes far more frequently than seizures, often, but not always observed in the same brain areas. The exact relationship between spiking and seizures as well as their respective effects on behavior are not well understood. In fact, spiking without overt seizures is seen in various psychiatric conditions including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Methods: In order to study the effects of spiking and seizures on behavior in an epileptic animal model, we used long-term video-electroencephalography recordings at six cortical recording sites together with behavioral activity monitoring. Animals received unilateral injections of tetanus toxin into either the somatosensory or motor cortex. Results: Somatosensory cortex-injected animals developed progressive spiking ipsilateral to the injection site, while those receiving the injection into the motor cortex developed mostly contralateral spiking and spontaneous seizures. Animals with spiking but no seizures displayed a hyperactive phenotype, while animals with both spiking and seizures displayed a hypoactive phenotype. Not all spikes were equivalent as spike location strongly correlated with distinct locomotor behaviors including ambulatory distance, vertical movements, and rotatory movement. Conclusions: Together, our results demonstrate relationships between brain region-specific spiking, seizures, and behaviors in rodents that could translate into a better understanding for patients with epileptic behavioral comorbidities and other neuropsychiatric disorders.

J	Cao, LY; Handel, B				Cao, Liyu; Haendel, Barbara			Walking enhances peripheral visual processing in humans	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							CENTER-SURROUND INTERACTIONS; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; PERCEIVED CONTRAST; LOCOMOTION; EEG; SUPPRESSION; ATTENTION; RESPONSES; MOTION; STATE	Cognitive processes are almost exclusively investigated under highly controlled settings during which voluntary body movements are suppressed. However, recent animal work suggests differences in sensory processing between movement states by showing drastically changed neural responses in early visual areas between locomotion and stillness. Does locomotion also modulate visual cortical activity in humans, and what are the perceptual consequences? Our study shows that walking increased the contrast-dependent influence of peripheral visual input on central visual input. This increase is prevalent in stimulus-locked electroencephalogram (EEG) responses (steady-state visual evoked potential [SSVEP]) alongside perceptual performance. Ongoing alpha oscillations (approximately 10 Hz) further positively correlated with the walking-induced changes of SSVEP amplitude, indicating the involvement of an altered inhibitory process during walking. The results predicted that walking leads to an increased processing of peripheral visual input. A second study indeed showed an increased contrast sensitivity for peripheral compared to central stimuli when subjects were walking. Our work shows complementary neurophysiological and behavioural evidence corroborating animal findings that walking leads to a change in early visual neuronal activity in humans. That neuronal modulation due to walking is indeed linked to specific perceptual changes extends the existing animal work.

EEG may be highly heterogeneous, varying from the 3 to 3.5 Hz spike-wave discharges typical of idiopathic generalized epilepsy to asymmetric irregular sharp and slow wave complexes. We report the clinical and neurophysiologic 14 years follow-up of a now 86 years-old woman, in whom we observed - at the age of 72 - an idiopathic late-onset ASE, with a good clinical response to lamotrigine monotherapy, but with the persistence over years of the same interictal 3-3.5 Hz spike-wave epileptic activity at EEG. This case is singular because, with the available long follow-up, indicates that idiopathic generalized epilepsy may also occur in the elderly, with a late-onset ASE presentation. In this condition, it is particularly important to underline the essential role of EEG (urgent and ambulatory) for the diagnosis, management and monitoring of the disease.

In a cohort of patients diagnosed with GGE, 24-h ambulatory EEG recordings were performed prospectively. We then tabulated durations, IDI, and vigilance state in relation to all EDs captured on EEGs. We used K-means cluster analysis and finite mixture modeling to quantify and characterize the groups of ED duration and IDI. To investigate the influence of sleep, we calculated the mean, median, and SEM in each population from all subjects for sleep state and wakefulness separately, followed by the Kruskal-Wallis test to compare the groups. We analyzed 4,679 EDs and corresponding IDI from 23 abnormal 24-h ambulatory EEGs. Our analysis defined two populations of ED durations and IDI: short and long. In all populations, both ED durations and IDI were significantly longer in wakefulness. Our results highlight different characteristics of ED populations in GGE and the influence by the sleep-wake cycle.

J	Lin, YP; Wang, YJ; Wei, CS; Jung, TP				Lin, Yuan-Pin; Wang, Yijun; Wei, Chun-Shu; Jung, Tzyy-Ping			Assessing the quality of steady-state visual-evoked potentials for moving humans using a mobile electroencephalogram headset	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; BCI; mobile EEG system; SSVEP; moving humans	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; EEG; ATTENTION; DRY; DESIGN	Recent advances in mobile electroencephalogram (EEG) systems, featuring non-prep dry electrodes and wireless telemetry, have enabled and promoted the applications of mobile brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in our daily life. Since the brain may behave differently while people are actively situated in ecologically-valid environments versus highly-controlled laboratory environments, it remains unclear how well the current laboratory-oriented BCI demonstrations can be translated into operational BCIs for users with naturalistic movements. Understanding inherent links between natural human behaviors and brain activities is the key to ensuring the applicability and stability of mobile BCIs. This study aims to assess the quality of steady-state visual-evoked potentials (SSVEPs), which is one of promising channels for functioning BCI systems, recorded using a mobile EEG system under challenging recording conditions, e.g., walking. To systematically explore the effects of walking locomotion on the SSVEPs, this study instructed subjects to stand or walk on a treadmill running at speeds of 1, 2, and 3 mile (s) per hour (MPH) while concurrently perceiving visual flickers (11 and 12 Hz). Empirical results of this study showed that the SSVEP amplitude tended to deteriorate when subjects switched from standing to walking. Such SSVEP suppression could be attributed to the walking locomotion, leading to distinctly deteriorated SSVEP detectability from standing (84.87 +/- 13.55%) to walking (1 MPH: 83.03 +/- 13.24%, 2 MPH: 79.47 +/- 13.53%, and 3 MPH: 75.26 +/- 1789%). These findings not only demonstrated the applicability and limitations of SSVEPs recorded from freely behaving humans in realistic environments, but also provide useful methods and techniques for boosting the translation of the BCI technology from laboratory demonstrations to practical applications.

These artifacts make subsequent EEG analysis inaccurate and prevent practical usage. Recently, the use of wearable EEG devices in ambulatory systems has been developed. For practical reasons, these systems usually contain a single EEG channel. Several studies have proposed to combine single-channel decomposition methods with blind source separation (BSS) methods to denoise the single-channel EEG. However, the existing methods have their own limitations since most of them only focus on removing one single kind of artifacts. Unfortunately, the EEG is prone to be contaminated by various kinds of artifacts simultaneously. Yet to our knowledge, there are no existing methods to remove diverse artifacts simultaneously from the single-channel EEG. To address this issue, we propose an effective method to remove diverse artifacts simultaneously for the single-channel EEG case. This method is a combination of singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and second-order blind identification (SOBI) method. We conduct a semi-simulated study to investigate all possible cases of the single-channel EEG been contaminated by EMG, EOG, and ECG artifacts. The results show that the proposed method can successfully remove diverse artifacts from the single-channel EEG. It is a promising tool for biomedical signal processing applications.

These recordings are however more exposed to noise and artifacts compared to clinically recorded EEG. An automatic artifact detection and classification algorithm for singlechannel EEG is proposed to help identifying these artifacts. Features are extracted from the EEG signal and wavelet subbands. Subsequently a selection algorithm is applied in order to identify the best discriminating features. A non-linear support vector machine is used to discriminate among different artifact classes using the selected features. Single-channel (Fp1 - F7) EEG recordings are obtained from experiments with 12 healthy subjects performing artifact inducing movements. The dataset was used to construct and validate the model. Both subject-specific and generic implementation, are investigated. The detection algorithm yield an average sensitivity and specificity above 95% for both the subject-specific and generic models. The classification algorithm show a mean accuracy of 78 and 64% for the subject-specific and generic model, respectively. The classification model was additionally validated on a reference dataset with similar results.	[Olund, Thomas; Sorensen, Helge B.

We performed 18-channel COEEG in 84 children and adolescents with diagnosed (group 1, n = 49) or suspected (group 2, n = 35) epilepsy. Mean recording time was 1.4 days. Overall, COEEG was useful in 87% of patients. In group i, events were recorded in 73% of patients and were electrographic seizures in 45%. In group 2, events were detected in 86% of patients and were electrographic seizures in 17%. Nocturnal and partial seizures predominated. Seizure diagnosis and classification by COEEG was concordant with interictal EEG findings in 19% and discordant in 63% of patients. COEEG is a useful technique for the diagnosis of epileptic and nonepileptic events among selected children and adolescents. When compared to routine interictal EEG, COEEG could offer additional accuracy in the classification of seizures in pediatric patients.

First, the sources that introduce EOG artifacts are explained and the authors briefly review the existing algorithms for EOG artifacts removal in EEG signals. Two selected algorithms-recursive least square and blind source separation are discussed in details. These two algorithms were chosen either for their good performance or for their low computational charge to be used in ambulatory monitoring devices. In the third part, the experimental protocol to collect EOG and EEG measurements are described. In the fourth part, the authors summarize the results after applying two algorithms to the collected real EEG data. From these results, conclusions are drawn on the performances of these selected algorithms. Several possible improvements or challenges are proposed in the discussion section.

Although telemedicine is one of the solutions to avoid people insti-tutionalization, it has severe limitations and not all medical services can be of-fered. While few years ago the electrical complexity and cost of EEG systems prevented execution of clinical EEG tests out of hospital, now services such as home-based video-EEG are possible. Conversely, some important clinical tests such as event-related potentials cannot be executed remotely. The reason for that is the accurate synchrony between local stimulus onset and remote starting of EEG acquisition. In hospital, synchrony is guaranteed by means of a wired connection between stimulus display that triggers EEG recording while in home-based testing this link normally does not exist. In this study we show an effective way to execute event-related potentials based on asynchronous EEG data transmission. We executed a dichotic listening paradigm with forced-attention modality. The user goal was to detect the attended audio sentence from the analysis of evoked auditory event-related potentials. The rate of successful detection in both synchronous and asynchronous modalities was compared and results revealed no significant difference. Our asynchronous approach can be used in on-line acquisition of home-based event-related potentials with remote processing.	[Lopez-Gordo, M.

Several studies showed that active contribution to the movement is critical for the encoding of motor memory. We propose to use brain monitoring techniques during gait training to encourage active participation in the movement. We investigated the spectral patterns in the electroencephalogram (EEG) that are related to active and passive robot assisted gait. Fourteen healthy participants were considered. Infomax independent component analysis separated the EEG into independent components representing brain, muscle, and eye movement activity, as well as other artifacts. An equivalent current dipole was calculated for each independent component. Independent components were clustered across participants based on their anatomical position and frequency spectra. Four clusters were identified in the sensorimotor cortices that accounted for differences between active and passive walking or showed activity related to the gait cycle. We show that in central midline areas the mu (8-12 Hz) and beta (18-21 Hz) rhythms are suppressed during active compared to passive walking. These changes are statistically significant: mu (F(1, 13) = 11.2 p <= 0.01) and beta (F(1, 13) = 7.7, p <= 0.05). We also show that these differences depend on the gait cycle phases. We provide first evidence of modulations of the gamma rhythm in the band 25 to 40 Hz, localized in central midline areas related to the phases of the gait cycle. We observed a trend (F(1, 8) = 11.03, p <= 0.06) for suppressed low gamma rhythm when comparing active and passive walking. Additionally we found significant suppressions of the mu (F(1, 11) = 20.1 p <= 0.01), beta (F(1, 11) = 11.3 p <= 0.05) and gamma (F(1, 11) = 4.9 p <= 0.05) rhythms near C3 (in the right hand area of the primary motor cortex) during phases of active vs. passive robot assisted walking. To our knowledge this is the first study showing EEG analysis during robot assisted walking. We provide evidence for significant differences in cortical activation between active and passive robot assisted gait. Our findings may help to define appropriate features for single trial detection of active participation in gait training. This work is a further step toward the evaluation of brain monitoring techniques and brain-computer interface technologies for improving gait rehabilitation therapies in a top-down approach.

From Spinal Central Pattern Generators to Cortical Network: Integrated BCI for Walking Rehabilitation	NEURAL PLASTICITY			English	Review							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; KINEMATIC COORDINATION; HUMAN LOCOMOTION; NEURAL-NETWORK; CORD-INJURY; MOVEMENT; STIMULATION; CORTEX; IDENTIFICATION; OSCILLATIONS	Success in locomotor rehabilitation programs can be improved with the use of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Although a wealth of research has demonstrated that locomotion is largely controlled by spinal mechanisms, the brain is of utmost importance in monitoring locomotor patterns and therefore contains information regarding central pattern generation functioning. In addition, there is also a tight coordination between the upper and lower limbs, which can also be useful in controlling locomotion. The current paper critically investigates different approaches that are applicable to this field: the use of electroencephalogram (EEG), upper limb electromyogram (EMG), or a hybrid of the two neurophysiological signals to control assistive exoskeletons used in locomotion based on programmable central pattern generators (PCPGs) or dynamic recurrent neural networks (DRNNs). Plantar surface tactile stimulation devices combined with virtual reality may provide the sensation of walking while in a supine position for use of training brain signals generated during locomotion. These methods may exploit mechanisms of brain plasticity and assist in the neurorehabilitation of gait in a variety of clinical conditions, including stroke, spinal trauma, multiple sclerosis, and cerebral palsy.

Gait adaptation to visual kinematic perturbations using a real-time closed-loop brain-computer interface to a virtual reality avatar	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain computer interfaces; visuomotor adaptation; gait adaptation; BCI-VR systems	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; CHRONIC STROKE; MACHINE INTERFACES; TREADMILL WALKING; KALMAN FILTER; REHABILITATION; INDIVIDUALS; RECOVERY; POSTSTROKE; IMPACT	Objective. The control of human bipedal locomotion is of great interest to the field of lower-body brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for gait rehabilitation. While the feasibility of closed-loop BCI systems for the control of a lower body exoskeleton has been recently shown, multi-day closed-loop neural decoding of human gait in a BCI virtual reality (BCI-VR) environment has yet to be demonstrated. BCI-VR systems provide valuable alternatives for movement rehabilitation when wearable robots are not desirable due to medical conditions, cost, accessibility, usability, or patient preferences. Approach. In this study, we propose a real-time closed-loop BCI that decodes lower limb joint angles from scalp electroencephalography ( EEG) during treadmill walking to control a walking avatar in a virtual environment. Fluctuations in the amplitude of slow cortical potentials of EEG in the delta band (0.1-3 Hz) were used for prediction; thus, the EEG features correspond to time-domain amplitude modulated potentials in the delta band. Virtual kinematic perturbations resulting in asymmetric walking gait patterns of the avatar were also introduced to investigate gait adaptation using the closed-loop BCI-VR system over a period of eight days. Main results. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using a closed-loop BCI to learn to control a walking avatar under normal and altered visuomotor perturbations, which involved cortical adaptations. The average decoding accuracies ( Pearson's r values) in real-time BCI across all subjects increased from ( Hip: 0.18 +/- 0.31; Knee: 0.23 +/- 0.33; Ankle: 0.14 +/- 0.22) on Day 1 to (Hip: 0.40 +/- 0.24; Knee: 0.55 +/- 0.20; Ankle: 0.29 +/- 0.22) on Day 8. Significance. These findings have implications for the development of a real-time closed-loop EEG-based BCI-VR system for gait rehabilitation after stroke and for understanding cortical plasticity induced by a closed-loop BCI-VR system.

Forecasting epileptic seizures remains a challenging problem, but machine learning methods using intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) measures have shown promise. A machine-learning-based pipeline was developed to process iEEG recordings and generate seizure warnings. Results support the ability to forecast seizures at rates greater than a Poisson random predictor for all feature sets and machine learning algorithms tested. In addition, subject-specific neurophysiological changes in multiple features are reported preceding lead seizures, providing evidence supporting the existence of a distinct and identifiable preictal state.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the validity of the recordings and of the analysis of the proprietary software of this solution, compared to PSG and semiautomatic scoring, respectively. From thirteen healthy adults, we recorded 27 nights simultaneously with a classical EEG amplifier (NeuroScan system) and the ambulatory SOMNOwatch plus EEG. Thereafter, we performed (semi-) automatic sleep analysis in Somnolyzer 24x7 and DOMINO Light (SOMNOwatch software). AASM scoring sensitivity of SOMNOwatch plus EEG, as revealed by Somnolyzer 24x7, was 97.79%, and specificity 87.19%. Paired T tests revealed no significant differences between the recordings of the two EEG systems, with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from moderate to very good. When data were analyzed in DOMINO Light, sensitivity was 92.99% and specificity was 80.90%. Our data suggest that SOMNOwatch plus EEG might serve as a reliable instrument for recording sleep in healthy individuals, but its proprietary software, DOMINO Light, still seems to have weaknesses in terms of automatic sleep staging.

As a consequence, the number of sleep disordered events cannot be calculated exactly. QUISI is a one-channel, self-applicable ambulatory EEG recording device. The present study was designed as a prospective, non-randomized clinical trial. This investigation evaluated the results of 40 patients with primary snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea measured with level 1 PSG and QUISI simultaneously. Fifteen patients (37.5%) were primary snorers with normal sleep profiles, whereas 25 patients (62.5%) suffered from obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) with a Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI) of 38.6 +/- 23.8. The mean total sleeping time (TST) was underestimated by 4.5%, while Sleep Efficiency Index (SEI) was understimated by 4.6% by the QUISI device compared with PSG. The correlation between the QUISI and the PSG estimates for single sleep stages demonstrated only moderate correlation. The statistical significance for sleep stage 2 was r = 0.42, P = 0.002; for sleep stage 3/4, r = 0.31, P = 0.02; and for WAKE, r = 0.33, P = 0.01. Sleep stage 2 as well as sleep stage 3/4 were underestimated by QUISI substantially (difference: -5.6% and -10.3%), while WAKE was overestimated by QUISI to a larger amount (difference: +10.4%). Sensitivity and specificity of QUISI to recognize pathological sleep profiles compared with PSG/R&K were 0.92 and 0.96 respectively. QUISI is able to evaluate normal versus altered sleep profiles in patients with primary snoring and OSA. Comparing the quartile ranges, we found substantial differences between QUISI and PSG/R&K. QUISI gives an impression of sleep architecture and objective verification of a sleep disturbance in an ambulant setting but cannot replace the sleep laboratory-based PSG.

The effectiveness of tFUS on human brain has been demonstrated, but how tFUS influences the human voluntary motor processing in the brain remains unclear. Methods: We apply low-intensity tFUS to modulate the movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) originating from human subjects practicing a voluntary foot tapping task. 64-channel electroencephalograph (EEG) is recorded concurrently and further used to reconstruct the brain source activity specifically at the primary leg motor cortical area using the electrophysiological source imaging (ESI). Results: The ESI illustrates the ultrasound modulated MRCP source dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolutions. The MRCP source is imaged and its source profile is further evaluated for assessing the tFUS neuromodulatory effects on the voluntary MRCP. Moreover, the effect of ultrasound pulse repetition frequency (UPRF) is further assessed in modulating the MRCP. The ESI results show that tFUS significantly increases the MRCP source profile amplitude (MSPA) comparing to a sham ultrasound condition, and further, a high UPRF enhances the MSPA more than a low UPRF does. Conclusion: The present results demonstrate the neuromodulatory effects of the low-intensity tFUS on enhancing the human voluntary movement-related cortical activities evidenced through the ESI. Significance: This work provides the first evidence of tFUS enhancing the human endogenous motor cortical activities through excitatory modulation.

Restricted vision increases sensorimotor cortex involvement in human walking	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						walking; EEG; independent component analysis; sensory reweighting; eyes closed	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; HUMAN POSTURAL CONTROL; ELECTROCORTICAL ACTIVITY; TREADMILL WALKING; CHRONIC STROKE; BLIND SUBJECTS; GAIT EVENTS; BALANCE; DYNAMICS; MOTOR	This study aimed to determine whether there is electrocortical evidence of augmented participation of sensory brain areas in walking modulation during walking with eyes closed. Healthy subjects (n = 10) walked on a treadmill at 1 m/s while alternating 5 min of walking with the eyes open or closed while we recorded ground reaction forces (GRFs) and high-density scalp electroencephalography (EEG). We applied independent component analysis to parse EEG signals into maximally independent component (IC) processes and then computed equivalent current dipoles for each IC. We clustered cortical source ICs and analyzed event-related spectral perturbations synchronized to gait events. Our results indicated that walking with eyes closed reduced the first peak of the vertical GRFs and induced shorter stride duration. Regarding the EEG, we found that walking with eyes closed induced significantly increased relative theta desynchronization in the frontal and premotor cortex during stance, as well as greater desynchronization from theta to beta bands during transition to single support for both left and right somatosensory cortex. These results suggest a phase-specific increased participation of brain areas dedicated to sensory processing and integration when vision is not available for locomotor guidance. Furthermore, the lack of vision demands higher neural processing related to motor planning and execution. Our findings provide evidence supporting the use of eyes-closed tasks in clinical practice, such as gait rehabilitation and improvements in balance control, as there is higher demand for additional sensory integration for achieving postural control. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We measured electrocortical dynamics in sighted individuals while walking with eyes open and eyes closed to induce the participation of other sensory systems in postural control. Our findings show that walking with visual restriction increases the participation of brain areas dedicated to sensory processing, motor planning, and execution. These results confirm the essential participation of supraspinal inputs to postural control in human locomotion, supporting the use of eyes-closed tasks in clinical practice.

Here, we explored how central common drive to ankle muscles changes in relation to visually guided foot placement. Sixteen healthy adults aged 23 +/- 5 years participated in the study. Electromyography (EMG) from the Soleus (Sol), medial Gastrocnemius (MG), and the distal and proximal ends of the Tibialis anterior (TA) muscles and electroencephalography (EEG) from Cz were recorded while subjects walked on a motorized treadmill. A visually guided walking task, where subjects received visual feedback of their foot placement on a screen in real-time and were required to place their feet within narrow preset target areas, was compared to normal walking. There was a significant increase in the central common drive estimated by TA-TA and Sol-MG EMG-EMG coherence in beta and gamma frequencies during the visually guided walking compared to normal walking. EEG-TA EMG coherence also increased, but the group average did not reach statistical significance. The results indicate that the corticospinal tract is involved in modifying gait when visually guided placement of the foot is required. These findings are important for our basic understanding of the central control of human bipedal gait and for the design of rehabilitation interventions for gait function following central motor lesions.

A proposal for bio-synchronized transmission of EEG/ERP data	EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article						Wireless EEG; Brain-computer interfaces; e-health; Telemedicine; Bio-synchronization	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; MIDDLE LATENCY RESPONSES; EVOKED POTENTIALS; AMBULATORY EEG; NEUROFEEDBACK; SYSTEM; VIDEO; TELEMETRY; CHILDREN; SERVICE	Acquisition of event-related potentials (ERPs) requires a nearly perfect synchronization between the stimulus player and the EEG acquisition unit that clinical systems implement at hardware level by means of a wired link. Out of clinical context, current brain-computer interface technology offers wireless and wearable EEG headsets that provide ubiquitous EEG acquisition. However, they are not adequate for ERPs acquisition since they lack the physical wire with the stimulus player. In this paper, we propose a novel technique devoted to provide a solution to this problem by means of a bio-synchronization approach. This technique adds to the stimulus data, a tagged audio preamble for synchronization (TAP-S) that embeds a synchronization mechanism in its physiological response based on pseudo random sequences. In this way, the EEG data elicited by the preamble and the stimulus are recorded together and the stimulus onset can be directly extracted from the EEG data by preamble detection. TAP-S is tailored to work with any low-cost multimedia player and wireless EEG headsets. Our preliminary results reveal TAP-S as a first, promising, and low-cost approach that, after further improvement, could enable remote processing of ERPs with wireless acquisition with application in telemedicine, ambient assisted living, or brain-computer interfaces.

As such, little is known regarding how the temporal dynamics of cognitive processing are influenced during aerobic activity. Here, we aimed to elucidate the influence of aerobic exercise on the temporal dynamics of concurrent visual working memory (VWM) performance. Participants performed a VWM retro-cue task at rest and during aerobic exercise across two postural modalities: seated (using a stationary bicycle) and standing upright (using a treadmill). Three consecutive phases of the VWM processing pipeline were assessed by means of lateralized ERPs: access of VWM representations, response selection, and response execution. Aerobic exercise and upright posture were found to have significant effects on VWM performance, facilitating processing speed in the retro-cue task. This facilitation arose primarily at an intermediary stage between the phases of accessing VWM representations and response selection. Our findings hold implications not only for understanding the influence of aerobic activity on VWM, but also for contemporary models of VWM that are built exclusively on data recorded during stationary, seated conditions.

In this study we examined the impact of an interactive Virtual Environment (VE) feedback task on the EEG patterns during robot assisted walking. We compared walking in the VE modality to two control conditions: walking with a visual attention paradigm, in which visual stimuli were unrelated to the motor task; and walking with mirror feedback, in which participants observed their own movements. Eleven healthy participants were considered. Application of independent component analysis to the EEG revealed three independent component clusters in premotor and parietal areas showing increased activity during walking with the adaptive VE training paradigm compared to the control conditions. During the interactive VE walking task spectral power in frequency ranges 8-12, 15-20, and 23-40 Hz was significantly (p <= 0.05) decreased. This power decrease is interpreted as a correlate of an active cortical area. Furthermore activity in the premotor cortex revealed gait cycle related modulations significantly different (p <= 0.05) from baseline in the frequency range 23-40 Hz during walking. These modulations were significantly (p <= 0.05) reduced depending on gait cycle phases in the interactive VE walking task compared to the control conditions. We demonstrate that premotor and parietal areas show increased activity during walking with the adaptive VE training paradigm, when compared to walking with mirror- and movement unrelated feedback. Previous research has related a premotor-parietal network to motor planning and motor intention. We argue that movement related interactive feedback enhances motor planning and motor intention. We hypothesize that this might improve gait recovery during rehabilitation.

An Exploratory Study	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Correlation distribution; exoskeleton-assisted overground walking; electroencephalogram (EEG); electromyogram (EMG); naturalistic overground walking; power spectral density (PSD)	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; TREADMILL WALKING; MOTOR CORTEX; MECHANICAL DESIGN; MUSCLE-ACTIVITY; GAIT; OSCILLATIONS; STROKE; ROBOT; MOVEMENTS	You probably believe that a latent relationship between the brain and lower limbs exists and it varies across different walking conditions (e.g., walking with or without an exoskeleton). Have you ever thought what the distributions of measured signals are? To address this question, we simultaneously collected electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals while healthy participants were conducting four overground walking conditions without any constraints (e.g., specific speed). The EEG results demonstrated that a wide range of frequencies from delta band to gamma band were involved in walking. The EEG power spectral density (PSD) was significantly different in sensorimotor and posterior parietal areas between exoskeleton-assisted walking and non-exoskeleton walking. The EMG PSD difference was predominantly observed in the theta band and the gastrocnemius lateralis muscle. EEG-EMG PSD correlations differed among walking conditions. The alpha and beta bands were primarily involved in consistently increasing EEG-EMG PSD correlations across the walking conditions, while the theta band was primarily involved in consistently decreasing correlations as observed in the EEG involvement. However, there is no dominant frequency band as observed in the EMG involvement. Channels located over the sensorimotor area were primarily involved in consistently decreasing EEG-EMG PSD correlations and the outer-ring channels were involved in the increasing EEG-EMG PSD correlations. Our study revealed the spectral and spatial distributions relevant to overground walking and deepened the understanding of EEG and EMG representations during locomotion, which may inform the development of a more human-compatible exoskeleton and its usage in motor rehabilitation.

Methods: We analyzed 24-hour ambulatory EEG recordings of patients with GGE diagnosed and classified according to the International League Against Epilepsy criteria. We quantified epileptiform EEG abnormalities into density scores (total duration of epileptiform discharges per hour) and estimated the preceding seizure-free duration at the time of EEG recording based on the last self-reported seizure. We then employed regression analysis to quantitate the relationship between the duration of seizure freedom and EEG variables. Results: We analyzed 6,923 epileptiform discharges from 105 patients with abnormal 24-hour EEGs. In the regression analysis exploring the crude associations, we found significant correlations between 6 EEG variables and the duration of seizure freedom indicating that shorter duration of seizure freedom was associated with higher spike densities and longer paroxysms. These associations were not affected by confounders such as syndrome, age at EEG, age at epilepsy onset, sex, duration of epilepsy, or number of antiepileptic drugs. Conclusions: Higher densities and longer durations of epileptiform discharges may be retrospectively associated with a shorter duration of self-reported seizure freedom. Hence, EEG can potentially be used as a biomarker of prognosis in GGE. These findings need to be validated in a prospective study in order to define EEG markers of future seizure freedom.

Multimodal assessment of sleep in men and women during treatment for opioid use disorder	DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE			English	Article						Sleep; Ecological momentary assessment; Opioid use disorder; Buprenorphine; Methadone; Sex differences	METHADONE-MAINTENANCE; SEX-DIFFERENCES; DEPENDENT PATIENTS; BUPRENORPHINE; NALOXONE; HEALTHY; QUALITY; GENDER; APNEA; PAIN	Background: Sleep disturbance is common in patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) receiving medication for addiction treatment. Differences between patients on the two primary agonist medications-methadone and buprenorphine-are not well understood. Methods: In patients receiving either methadone or buprenorphine treatment for OUD, we examined sleep continuity and architecture using ambulatory monitoring to gather both an objective measure (daily sleep EEG; M = 5.76 days, SD = 1.46) and a subjective measure (daily sleep diary; M = 54.10 days, SD = 25.10) of sleep. Results: Patients treated with buprenorphine versus methadone did not differ on any measure of sleep continuity or architecture. Women had longer EEG-derived total sleep time than men (d = -0.68, 95 % CI -1.32 to -0.09), along with lower %N2 (d = 0.94, 95 % CI 0.34-1.64) and greater %N3 (d = -0.94, 95 % CI -1.61 to -0.32). Self-reported sleep differed from EEG-derived estimates: wake after sleep onset was greater by EEG than by diary (d = 2.58, 95 % CI 1.74-3.63), and total sleep time and sleep efficiency were lower by EEG than by diary (d for sleep time = 2.93, 95 % CI 2.06-4.14; d for efficiency = 1.69, 95 % CI 0.98-2.49). Conclusions: Patients treated with buprenorphine or methadone did not substantively differ in ambulatory measures of sleep. With both medications, there was a discrepancy between objective and subjective sleep measures. Further confirmatory evidence would inform the development of sleep-related recommendations for OUD patients undergoing agonist treatment.

Two methods of achieving this are to downsample the EEG and to perform bitwidth reduction on the data. The effect of performing both of these techniques to varying extents is investigated in this paper. Frequency, time and entropy based features are extracted from the data and used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification system. The effect of changing the overlap between successive epochs is also investigated.

Prompt and effective treatment is requested to prevent death or neurological sequelae. First-line drugs must have a favourable benefit/risk ratio. Refractory status epilepticus must be treated aggressively by second-line sedative drugs. In this situation, EEG monitoring must diagnose subtle status epilepticus by controlling the disappearance of ictal discharges. Non-convulsive generalized or partial status epilepticus is a diagnostic challenge, best solved by emergency EEG. Immediate discontinuation of anti-epileptic drugs is requested to avoid potentially serious idiosyncratic side-effects. Electroencephalographic status epilepticus in coma must be differentiated from non convulsive status epilepticus occuring in ambulatory patients. Prescriptions habits will be avoided to prevent recurrence of isolated convulsive seizures.

Brinkmann et al. report the results of an online, open-access seizure forecasting competition using intracranial EEG recordings from canines with naturally occurring epilepsy and human patients undergoing presurgical monitoring. The winning algorithms forecast seizures at rates significantly greater than chance.Accurate forecasting of epileptic seizures has the potential to transform clinical epilepsy care. However, progress toward reliable seizure forecasting has been hampered by lack of open access to long duration recordings with an adequate number of seizures for investigators to rigorously compare algorithms and results. A seizure forecasting competition was conducted on kaggle.com using open access chronic ambulatory intracranial electroencephalography from five canines with naturally occurring epilepsy and two humans undergoing prolonged wide bandwidth intracranial electroencephalographic monitoring. Data were provided to participants as 10-min interictal and preictal clips, with approximately half of the 60 GB data bundle labelled (interictal/preictal) for algorithm training and half unlabelled for evaluation. The contestants developed custom algorithms and uploaded their classifications (interictal/preictal) for the unknown testing data, and a randomly selected 40% of data segments were scored and results broadcasted on a public leader board. The contest ran from August to November 2014, and 654 participants submitted 17 856 classifications of the unlabelled test data. The top performing entry scored 0.84 area under the classification curve. Following the contest, additional held-out unlabelled data clips were provided to the top 10 participants and they submitted classifications for the new unseen data. The resulting area under the classification curves were well above chance forecasting, but did show a mean 6.54 +/- 2.45% (min, max: 0.30, 20.2) decline in performance. The kaggle.com model using open access data and algorithms generated reproducible research that advanced seizure forecasting. The overall performance from multiple contestants on unseen data was better than a random predictor, and demonstrates the feasibility of seizure forecasting in canine and human epilepsy.

The chronic behavior of seizures and the interictal bursts that sometimes initiate them is unknown. We investigate the variability of these electrographic patterns over an extended period of time using chronic intracranial recordings in canine epilepsy. MethodsContinuous, yearlong intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from four dogs with naturally occurring epilepsy were analyzed for seizures and interictal bursts. Following automated detection and clinician verification of interictal bursts and seizures, temporal trends of seizures, burst count, and burst-burst similarities were determined. One dog developed status epilepticus, the recordings of which were also investigated. ResultsMultiple seizure types, determined by onset channels, were observed in each dog, with significant temporal variation between types. The first 14 days of invasive recording, analogous to the average duration of clinical invasive recordings in humans, did not capture the entirety of seizure types. Seizures typically occurred in clusters, and isolated seizures were rare. The count and dynamics of interictal bursts form distinct groups and do not stabilize until several weeks after implantation. SignificanceThere is significant temporal variability in seizures and interictal bursts after electrode implantation that requires several weeks to reach steady state. These findings, comparable to those reported in humans implanted with the NeuroPace Responsive Neurostimulator System (RNS) device, suggest that transient network changes following electrode implantation may need to be taken into account when interpreting or analyzing iEEG during evaluation for epilepsy surgery. Chronic, ambulatory iEEG may be better suited to accurately map epileptic networks in appropriate individuals.

J	Noorbasha, SK; Sudha, GF				Noorbasha, Sayedu Khasim; Florence Sudha, Gnanou			Hybrid algorithm for multi artifact removal from single channel EEG	BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS & ENGINEERING EXPRESS			English	Article						Motion artifact; Electrooculogram; Electrocardiogram; GMETV; EEG; ICA	MUSCLE ARTIFACTS; SEPARATION; ICA	Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals recorded from the ambulatory systems are mostly contaminated by various artifacts like, electrooculogram (EOG), motion artifacts (MA) and electrocardiogram (ECG) artifacts. These artifacts limit the accuracy in further analysis of EEG in practise. So far, several existing methods have been proposed with the combination of decomposition techniques and independent component analysis (ICA) to remove single artifacts and only few methods to remove multiple artifacts from the single channel EEG. As improperly denoised EEG signals can result in wrong diagnosis, in this work, Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) and ICA are jointly combined with Generalized Moreau Envelope Total Variation (GMETV) technique to simultaneously remove combinations of different artifacts from single channel EEG. In this work, the SSA is used to decompose the contaminated single channel EEG, while the ICA is employed to separate the various hidden sources as independent components (ICs). Although the ICA is adequate in source separation, there is still, some essential EEG signal data appearing as artifact in the IC. Hence, eliminating this would allow EEG signal information to be lost. The GMETV approach is proposed in this paper, to estimate the actual artifacts in order to address these issues. The estimated actual artifacts are subtracted from the artifact ICs providing the residue of wanted component of EEG. This residue is added back to the remaining ICs, to obtain the denoised EEG. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed technique performs better compared to the existing techniques. The Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE) is reduced by 12.02% and 7.22% compared to SSA-ICA and SSA-ICA-thresholding respectively. Similarly, the Correlation Coefficient (CC) is increased by 21.48% and 8.25% with respect to SSA-ICA and SSA-ICA-thresholding respectively.

This open, randomized, explorative study of day surgical patients evaluates the ability of the Cerebral State Monitor (TM) (Danmeter AB, Odense, Denmark) of anaesthetic depth to identify loss of response (LOR) using either propofol or N2O for induction. Methods: In this open, randomized study, day surgical patients (n = 10 in each group) were studied using the Cerebral State Index Monitor (TM). After baseline measurements, induction to LOR was achieved with either repeated 30-mg boluses of propofol every second minute or with N2O (after premedication 5 min before with 30 mg propofol) increased every other minute in 15% increments (max. 75%). Sedation level was evaluated every other minute using the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale Results: Baseline values were 91 (82-98) and 94 (82-100) for N2O and propofol patients, respectively. During induction CSI (TM) decreased with increasing sedation in patients given propofol (P < 0.001) but not in patients given nitrous oxide. Median value at LOR was 56 (40-76) and 95 (87-100) for the propofol and nitrous oxide group of patients, respectively. Conclusion: The Cerebral State Index (TM) behaves as other depth of anaesthesia monitors with a progressive decrease during propofol induction but loss of consciousness with N2O results in no change in CSI (TM).

Pharmaco-electroencephalographic responses in the rat differ between active and inactive locomotor states	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						amphetamine; d-cycloserine; diazepam; DOI; ketamine	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; NMDA RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; D-CYCLOSERINE; DIZOCILPINE MK-801; FIELD POTENTIALS; MOUSE MODELS; KETAMINE; GAMMA	Quantitative electroencephalography from freely moving rats is commonly used as a translational tool for predicting drug-effects in humans. We hypothesized that drug-effects may be expressed differently depending on whether the rat is in active locomotion or sitting still during recording sessions, and proposed automatic state-detection as a viable tool for estimating drug-effects free of hypo-/hyperlocomotion-induced effects. We aimed at developing a fully automatic and validated method for detecting two behavioural states: active and inactive, in one-second intervals and to use the method for evaluating ketamine, DOI, d-cycloserine, d-amphetamine, and diazepam effects specifically within each state. The developed state-detector attained high precision with more than 90% of the detected time correctly classified, and multiple differences between the two detected states were discovered. Ketamine-induced delta activity was found specifically related to locomotion. Ketamine and DOI suppressed theta and beta oscillations exclusively during inactivity. Characteristic gamma and high-frequency oscillations (HFO) enhancements of the NMDAR and 5HT(2A) modulators, speculated associated with locomotion, were profound and often largest during the inactive state. State-specific analyses, theoretically eliminating biases from altered occurrence of locomotion, revealed only few effects of d-amphetamine and diazepam. Overall, drug-effects were most abundant in the inactive state. In conclusion, this new validated and automatic locomotion state-detection method enables fast and reliable state-specific analysis facilitating discovery of state-dependent drug-effects and control for altered occurrence of locomotion. This may ultimately lead to better cross-species translation of electrophysiological effects of pharmacological modulations.

The current study is an explorative study of the circadian dynamics of sleep spindles in relation to a polygenic score (PGS) for circadian preference towards morningness. The participants represent the 17-year follow-up of a birth cohort having both genome-wide data and an ambulatory sleep electroencephalography measurement available (N = 154, Mean age = 16.9, SD = 0.1 years, 57% girls). Based on a recent genome-wide association study, we calculated a PGS for circadian preference towards morningness across the whole genome, including 354 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Stage 2 slow (9-12.5 Hz, N = 186 739) and fast (12.5-16 Hz, N = 135 504) sleep spindles were detected using an automated algorithm with individual time tags and amplitudes for each spindle. There was a significant interaction of PGS for morningness and timing of sleep spindles across the night. These growth curve models showed a curvilinear trajectory of spindle amplitudes: those with a higher PGS for morningness showed higher slow spindle amplitudes in frontal derivations, and a faster dissipation of spindle amplitude in central derivations. Overall, the findings provide new evidence on how individual sleep spindle trajectories are influenced by genetic factors associated with circadian type. The finding may lead to new hypotheses on the associations previously observed between circadian types, psychiatric problems and spindle activity.

Hexadirectional Modulation of High-Frequency Electrophysiological Activity in the Human Anterior Medial Temporal Lobe Maps Visual Space	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							HUMAN ENTORHINAL CORTEX; THETA OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; FIELD POTENTIALS; MEMORY; HIPPOCAMPUS; NAVIGATION; BRAIN; CELLS; CODE	Grid cells are one of the core building blocks of spatial navigation [1]. Single-cell recordings of grid cells in the rodent entorhinal cortex revealed hexagonal coding of the local environment during spatial navigation [1]. Grid-like activity has also been identified in human single-cell recordings during virtual navigation [2]. Human fMRI studies further provide evidence that grid-like signals are also accessible on a macroscopic level [3-7]. Studies in both non-human primates [8] and humans [9, 10] suggest that grid-like coding in the entorhinal cortex generalizes beyond spatial navigation during locomotion, providing evidence for grid-like mapping of visual space during visual exploration-akin to the grid cell positional code in rodents during spatial navigation. However, electrophysiological correlates of the grid code in humans remain unknown. Here, we provide evidence for grid-like, hexadirectional coding of visual space by human high-frequency activity, based on two independent datasets: non-invasive magnetoencephalography (MEG) in healthy subjects and entorhinal intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in an epileptic patient. Both datasets consistently show a hexadirectional modulation of broadband high-frequency activity (60-120 Hz). Our findings provide first evidence for a grid-like MEG signal, indicating that the human entorhinal cortex codes visual space in a grid-like manner [8-10], and support the view that grid coding generalizes beyond environmental mapping during locomotion [4-6, 11]. Due to their millisecond accuracy, MEG recordings allow linking of grid-like activity to epochs during relevant behavior, thereby opening up the possibility for new MEG-based investigations of grid coding at high temporal resolution.

The modern deep learning algorithms can be used on large EEG data set after applying the data augmentation process on them. In this paper, we apply the Deep Belief Network (DBN) model based on the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) for unsupervised feature learning of EEG signals to extract salient features for classification. This DBN model provides an unsupervised taxonomy-based system without human intervention. The efficiency of this model is evaluated on the ambulatory EEG signal with other deep learning algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that DBN with Recurrent Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory (DBN-RNN-LSTM) provides an accuracy of 98.3% which is better than RNN-LSTM and other classical machine learning algorithm.

J	Nonclercq, A; Mathys, P				Nonclercq, Antoine; Mathys, Pierre			Quantification of Motion Artifact Rejection Due to Active Electrodes and Driven-Right-Leg Circuit in Spike Detection Algorithms	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Amplifying electrodes; bioelectric recordings; driven-right-leg (DRL) circuit; motion artifacts; spike detection	SKIN ABRASION; EEG	Identification of spikes in the EEG plays an important role during the diagnosis of neurological disorders, such as epilepsy. Automatic spike detection (ASD) is attractive because it reduces the diagnostic time and improves objectivity of the scoring. Unfortunately, automatic detection is sometimes confounded by artifacts, particularly motion artifacts, which can be frequent in ambulatory recording, in the ICU, when recording from restless patients or children, etc. EEG systems have recently been improved by using active electrodes and driven-right-leg circuits (DRL) to reduce motion artifacts. However, the performances of ASD algorithms, both with unimproved and improved EEG systems, are difficult to quantify in patients because of poor reproducibility of the results. In this paper, a test setup was used to evaluate the performance of active electrodes and DRL, and assess if they can be complemented or substituted by a spike detection algorithm in avoiding motion artifact. Results show that motion artifacts can largely degrade spike detection when a traditional EEG system is used, whereas an EEG fitted with active electrodes and a DRL allows high-quality detection. When using a traditional EEG, the choice of a spike detection algorithm has a large influence on detection quality.

Walsh operators were designed to formulate characteristics drawn from experimental observation, as provided by medical experts. The merits of the algorithm are: 1) in decorrelating the data to form an orthogonal basis and 2) simplicity of implementation. EEG recordings were obtained at a sampling frequency of 500 Hz using standard 10-20 electrode placements. Independent sets of EEG data recorded on 18 patients with focal epilepsy were used to train and test the algorithm. Twenty to thirty minutes of recordings were obtained with each subject awake, supine, and at rest. Spikes were annotated independently by two EEG experts. On evaluation, the algorithm identified 110 out of 139 spikes identified by either expert (True Positives = 79%) and missed 29 spikes (False Negatives = 21%). Evaluation of the algorithm revealed a Precision (Positive Predictive Value) of 85% and a Sensitivity of 79%. The encouraging preliminary results support its further development for prolonged EEG recordings in ambulatory subjects. With these results, the false detection (FD) rate is estimated at 7.2 FD per hour of continuous EEG recording.

In contrast to lossless compression techniques, lossy compression algorithms can achieve higher compression ratios and hence, higher power savings, at the expense of some degradation of the reconstructed signal. In this paper, a variant of the lossy JPEG2000 algorithm is applied to Electroencephalogram (EEG) data from the Freiburg epilepsy database. By varying compression parameters, a range of reconstructions of varying signal fidelity is produced. Although lossy compression has been applied to EEG data in previous studies, it is unclear what level of signal degradation, if any, would be acceptable to a clinician before diagnostically significant information is lost. In this paper, the reconstructed EEG signals are applied to REACT, a state-of-the-art seizure detection algorithm, in order to determine the effect of lossy compression on its seizure detection ability. By using REACT in place of a clinician, many hundreds of hours of reconstructed EEG data are efficiently analysed, thereby allowing an analysis of the amount of EEG signal distortion that can be tolerated. The corresponding compression ratios that can be achieved are also presented.

The PDA-based system's EMA methods include oral recording, questionnaire, and reaction-time-type attention testing. This report focuses on the system's unique capability of subject-administered VEP testing in the remote environment. Results reported include single-subject VEP waveforms recorded in the subject's home during the evening portion of a 24 hour period at scheduled times the subject was unaware of in advance. The VEP testing paradigm was a 100 trial, Go/NoGo type test. The visual stimuli were presented on the handheld PDA device with wireless stimulus marker trigger information being transmitted to the ambulatory EEG recording unit via a Bluetooth interface. Post-acquisition editing and analysis results demonstrate reliable ambulatory VEPs can be obtained. The system implementation is a further extension of our work investigating the identification of stress-related physiologic marker information in a primary caregiver's home environment. The demonstrated EMA-based VEP recording capabilities added to our previously reported 24-hour ambulatory data collection platform (CAMAS) open the door to new opportunities supplementing studies in fields such as ambulatory psychophysiology and cognitive-neuroscience.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 48 cases of newborns with HIE (aged 37 to 41 weeks) as the observation group and another 50 cases of fullterm infants with non-traumatic brain illness as the control group were chosen from March 2012 to March 2013. The aEEG were observed, and the continuity and sleep-wake cycle (SWC) between the two groups were compared. The relevance of aEEG monitoring results and HIE, as well as the long-term prognosis, were analyzed. RESULTS: 33.33% (16/48) of EEG results appeared to be continuous and 20.83% (10/48) of the SWC results were mature for observation group. These EEG and SWC results are conspicuously lower than the control group 100% (50/50) and differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05). The maximum voltage of observation group was 56.54 +/- 19.33 LV, notably higher than the control group (37.77 +/- 2.79 LV). The minimum voltage of the observation group was 4.26 +/- 1.25 LV, markedly lower than the control group (7.75 +/- 0.67 LV) and these differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Correlational analysis based on the Spearman approach showed that the monitoring results are positively correlated with clinical classification of HIE. After six months of follow-up, 11 of the 48 cases (22.92%) were found to be disabled (including mental retardation and cerebral palsy). CONCLUSIONS: aEEG enjoys easy operation, effective diagnosis, supports continuous monitoring and reflects the lesion degree as well as long-term prognosis of newborns with HIE and is, thus, highly recommended in clinical practices.

Unfortunately the long-term recordings obtained from 'ambulatory recording systems' contain EEG data of up to one week duration, which has introduced new problems for clinical analysis. Traditional methods, where the entire EEG is reviewed by a trained professional, are very time-consuming when applied to recordings of this length. Therefore, several automated diagnostic aid approaches were proposed in recent years, in order to reduce expert effort in analyzing lengthy recordings. The most promising approaches to automated diagnosis are based on neural networks. This paper describes a method for automated detection of epileptic seizures from EEG signals using a multistage nonlinear pre-processing filter in combination with a diagnostic (LAMSTAR) Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Pre-processing via multistage nonlinear filtering, LAMSTAR input preparation, ANN training and system performance (1.6% miss rate, 97.2% overall accuracy when considering both false-alarms and 'misses') are discussed and are shown to compare favorably with earlier approaches presented in recent literature.

In applications involving these signals, it is expected that dynamically estimating and correcting for this noise would increase the amount of useful information extracted from the signal. One such application is scalp EEG monitoring in epilepsy, where electrical activity generated by cranio-facial muscles obscure the measured brainwaves. This paper presents a data-selection algorithm based on phase congruency to identify interictal spikes from background EEG; together with a novel statistical method that allows a more comprehensive trade-off based quantitative comparison of two algorithms which have been tested at a fixed threshold in the same database. Here, traditional phase congruency has been modified to incorporate a dynamic estimate of muscle activity present in the input scalp EEG signal. The proposed algorithm achieves 50% data reduction whilst detecting more than 80% of interictal spikes. This represents a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art denoising method for phase congruency.

We investigated the relationships of periodic EEG both among various parts of the septum and with dorsal hippocampal theta recorded concurrently in freely moving rats. Most septal sites showed theta rhythm concurrent with hippocampal theta during locomotion. However, periods with theta at hippocampal but not septal sites were more frequent than the reverse. Theta waves in different parts of the septum were synchronized with each other but medial septal sites showed less frequent theta than other sites. The phase delays between medial and lateral septal sites were < 10 ms, suggesting that the hippocampus does not act as a simple relay between the two. Spectral analysis revealed periods (> 5 s) of theta at hippocampal sites co-occurring with rhythms at multiple septal sites that were slower than theta. Even slower were the 'slow septal waves' (mean 2.7 Hz), which were present in the absence of locomotion and did not 'drive' the hippocampus. Our data suggest that the pacemaker of hippocampal theta may best be thought of as a set of functionally differentiated components rather than as a single homogenous unit.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of inpatient versus daytime outpatient telemetry. The authors evaluated prospectively 73 patients with medically intractable TLE. Ninety-one telemetry sessions were performed: 35 as inpatients and 56 as outpatients. Outpatient monitoring was performed in the EEG laboratory. They used 18-channel digital EEG. Medications were not changed in the outpatient group. For analysis of the data, time was counted in periods (12 hours = I period). Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t-test and the chi(2) test. There were no differences between the two groups (outpatient versus inpatient) with respect to age and mean seizure frequency before monitoring, mean time to record the first seizure (1.1 versus 1.4 periods), mean number of seizures per period (0.6 for both groups), lateralization by interictal spiking (46% versus 57%), and lateralization by ictal EEG (59% versus 77%). Daytime outpatient video-EEG monitoring for presurgical evaluation is efficient and comparable with inpatient monitoring Therefore, the improved cost benefit of outpatient monitoring may increase the access to surgery for individuals with intractable TLE.

Functional brain MRI in patients complaining of electrohypersensitivity after long term exposure to electromagnetic fields	REVIEWS ON ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH			English	Article						electrohypersensitivity (EHS); electromagnetic field (EMF); fMRI; multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS)	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; MULTIPLE CHEMICAL-SENSITIVITY; MOBILE PHONE; HYPERSENSITIVITY; HUMANS; EEG; INTOLERANCE; DISORDER; ALPHA; PET	Introduction: Ten adult patients with electromagnetic hypersensitivity underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain scans. All scans were abnormal with abnormalities which were consistent and similar. It is proposed that fMRI brain scans be used as a diagnostic aid for determining whether or not a patient has electromagnetic hypersensitivity. Over the years we have seen an increasing number of patients who had developed multi system complaints after long term repeated exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs). These complaints included headaches, intermittent cognitive and memory problems, intermittent disorientation, and also sensitivity to EMF exposure. Regular laboratory tests were within normal limits in these patients. The patients refused to be exposed to radioactivity. This of course ruled out positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) brain scanning. This is why we ordered fMRI brain scans on these patients. We hoped that we could document objective abnormalities in these patients who had often been labeled as psychiatric cases. Materials and methods: Ten patients first underwent a regular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan, using a 3 Tesla Siemens Verio MRI open system. A functional MRI study was then performed in the resting state using the following sequences: 1. A three-dimensional, T1-weighted, gradient-echo (MPRAGE) 2. Resting state network. The echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequences for this resting state blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) scan were then post processed on a 3D workstation and the independent component analysis was performed separating out the various networks. 3. Arterial spin labeling. 4. Tractography and fractional anisotropy. Results: All ten patients had abnormal functional MRI brain scans. The abnormality was often described as hyper connectivity of the anterior component of the default mode in the medial orbitofrontal area. Other abnormalities were usually found. Regular MRI studies of the brain were mostly unremarkable in these patients. Conclusion: We propose that functional MRI studies should become a diagnostic aid when evaluating a patient who claims electrohypersensitivity (EHS) and has otherwise normal studies. Interestingly, the differential diagnosis for the abnormalities seen on the fMRI includes head injury. It turns out that many of our patients indeed had a history of head injury which was then followed sometime later by the development of EHS. Many of our patients also had a history of exposure to potentially neurotoxic chemicals, especially mold. Head injury and neurotoxic chemical exposure may make a patient more vulnerable to develop EHS.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of comprehensive, ambulatory PSG, including electroencephalography, in school-aged children in the home environment. Methods: A total of 201 children, born premature with birth weights of 500-1,250 grams, currently aged 5-12 years and living in Canada and Australia, underwent unattended ambulatory PSG. Results: PSG was initially technically satisfactory in 183 (91%) cases. Fourteen studies were satisfactory when repeated, resulting in an overall satisfactory rate of 197 (98%). Artifact-free signals were obtained for >= 75% of recording time in more than 92% of subjects, with the exception of nasal pressure, which was satisfactory for >= 75% of recording time in only 67% of subjects. However, thermistry signals were satisfactory for >= 75% of recording time in 92% of subjects, and some measure of airflow was present for >= 75% of recording time in 96% of subjects. Children slept very well, with a long total sleep time (534 +/- 73 [mean +/- SD] minutes), high sleep efficiency (92% +/- 5%), and low arousal index (9 +/- 3/h). Parents and children reported a high rate of satisfaction with the study. Conclusions: This large, international study has shown that comprehensive, unattended, ambulatory PSG is feasible, technically adequate and well-tolerated in school-aged children when performed under research conditions. Further studies regarding the cost efficacy of this approach, and generalizability of the findings to a clinical population, are warranted.

The instruments that can monitor these signals are traditionally realized by combining precision building blocks with powerful DSP modules. The growing interest toward the improvement of patients' quality of life and the use of biopotential signals in nonmedical applications such as entertainment, sports, and brain-computer interfaces requires the implementation of miniaturized and wireless biopotential acquisition systems with ultra-low power dissipation. This has dramatically changed the way of developing instruments for the extraction of biopotential signals, placing stringent constraints on the design of analog front-end circuits that can be used in ambulatory biopotential monitoring applications. In addition, the ambulatory monitoring of patients has introduced new challenges that can jeopardize the signal integrity. This chapter will focus on the design of analog-integrated circuits that can be used in ambulatory biopotential monitoring applications. Several constraints in terms of power dissipation and signal-to-noise ratio will be addressed. Later, an important challenge in ambulatory biomedical signal monitoring, namely motion artifacts, will be introduced and different strategies to tackle this problem will be explained.

Cognitive tasks and human ambulatory electrocorticography using the RNS System	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						RNS System; Memory; Navigation; Ambulatory ECoG; ECoG; Electrocorticography; Epilepsy; Cognition	RESPONSIVE NEUROSTIMULATION; INTRACRANIAL EEG; IMPEDANCE	Background: Electrocorticography studies are typically conducted in patients undergoing video EEG monitoring, but these studies are subject to confounds such as the effects of pain, recent anesthesia, analgesics, drug changes, antibiotics, and implant effects. New method: Techniques were developed to obtain electrocorticographic (ECoG) data from freely moving subjects performing navigational tasks using the RNS (R) System (NeuroPace, Inc., Mountain View, CA), a brain responsive neurostimulation medical device used to treat focal onset epilepsy, and to align data from the RNS System with cognitive task events with high precision. These subjects had not had recent surgery, and were therefore not confounded by the perioperative variables that affect video EEG studies. Results: Task synchronization using the synchronization marker technique provides a quantitative measure of clock uncertainty, and can align data to task events with less than 4 ms of uncertainty. Hippocampal ECoG activity was found to change immediately before an incorrect response to a math problem compared to hippocampal activity before a correct response. In addition, subjects were found to have variable but significant changes in theta band power in the hippocampus during navigation compared to when subjects were not navigating. We found that there is theta gamma phase-amplitude coupling in the right hippocampus while subjects stand still during a navigation task. Comparison with existing methods: An alignment technique described in this study improves the upper bound on task-ECoG alignment uncertainty from approximately 30 ms to under 4 ms. The RNS System is one of the first platforms capable of providing untethered ambulatory ECoG recording in humans, allowing for the study of real world instead of virtual navigation. Compared to intracranial video EEG studies, studies using the RNS System platform are not subject to confounds caused by the drugs and recent surgery inherent to the perioperative environment. Furthermore, these subjects provide the opportunity to record from the same electrodes over the course of many years. Conclusions: The RNS System enables us to study human navigation with unprecedented clarity. While RNS System patients have fewer electrodes implanted than video EEG patients, the lack of external artifact and confounds from recent surgery make this system a useful tool to further human electrophysiology research.

Some of these relate to optimize the costs of the health system in favor of patients. To achieve this ideal, various methods are used to reduce the cost of medicines, the frequency of post-operative interventions, or even the recovery period after interventions or the risks of comorbidities. The main objective of the present research is to obtain a non-invasive tool for low cost, effective method and instrumentation for monitoring EEG signals in ambulatory (mobile) treatment and daily activities of prospective patients at risk and feedback the information to the treatment based medication. With such a tool is facilitated risk reduction in stroke by early detection based on monitoring and analysis of EEG data. The paper presents the advantages introduced by signal pre-processing. Are also highlighted the necessary further steps in the tool development.

Perhaps the most interesting approach is to combine wireless EEG and virtual reality, where one can create and manipulate realistic multimodal environments. However EEG recording during locomotion in a virtual reality lab is exposed to several types of electrical noise generating hardware. In the current paper we present two studies. In the first we turned on and off possible sources of electrical noise. We found that although electrical noise is present in the data, it is typically localized above the frequency ranges of brain related activity. In the second study we measured event related potential changes to a simple visual stimulus using wireless and wired setup in a virtual reality room and in a psychophysiology lab. We found that the shape of the N1, an early component of visual processing is not affected by the type of signal transmission but importantly its latency is different in the two labs.

Here, we examined whether a trait tendency to experience withdrawal motivation is associated with nostalgia proneness. Past work indicates that baseline right-frontal cortical asymmetry is a neural correlate of withdrawal-related motivation. We therefore hypothesized that higher baseline levels of right-frontal asymmetry would predict increased proneness to nostalgia. We assessed participants' baseline levels of frontal cortical activity using EEG. Results supported the hypothesis and demonstrated that the association between relative right-frontal asymmetry and increased nostalgia remained significant when controlling for the Big Five personality traits. Overall, these findings indicate that individuals with a stronger dispositional tendency to experience withdrawal-related motivation are more prone to nostalgia.

The diagnostic of these disorders is usually made by a polysomnography, requiring patient's hospitalization. Low cost ambulatory diagnostic devices can in certain cases be used, especially when there is no need of a full or rigorous sleep staging. In this paper, several methods to extract features from 6 EEG channels are described in order to evaluate their performance. The features are selected using the R-square Pearson correlation coefficient (Guyon and Elisseeff, 2003), providing this way a Bayesian classifier with the most discriminative features. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods to discriminate several sleep stages, and ranks the several feature extraction methods. The best discrimination was achieved for relative spectral power, slow wave index, harmonic parameters and Hjorth parameters.

The sleep-promoting effect of milk has been attributed to its psychological associations (i.e., the memory of a mother giving milk at bedtime) and its rich store of sleep-promoting constituents (e.g., tryptophan). Studies have shown that milk harvested at night (Night milk) contains exceptionally high amounts of tryptophan and melatonin. In the present study, we evaluated the psychopharmacological properties of Night milk, particularly its probable sleep-promoting/enhancing, and anxiolytic effects. Night milk was orally administered to ICR mice at various concentrations (100, 200, or 300mg/kg). An hour after administration, assessment of its sedative (open-field and rotarod tests) and sedative sleep-potentiating effects (pentobarbital-induced sleeping test) was conducted. For comparison, the effects of Day milk (daytime milking) were also assessed. In addition, the effects of Night milk on anxiety behavior (elevated plus maze [EPM] test) and electroencephalographic (EEG) waves were evaluated. Night milk-treated animals exhibited decreased spontaneous locomotion (open-field test) and impaired motor balance and coordination (rotarod test). Furthermore, Night milk shortened the sleep onset and prolonged the sleep duration induced by pentobarbital sodium. These effects were comparable to that of diazepam. In addition, Night milk significantly increased the percentage of time spent and entries into the open arms of the EPM, indicating that it also has anxiolytic effects. No significant changes in EEG waves were observed. Altogether, these findings suggest that Night milk is a promising natural aid for sleep- and anxiety-related disturbances.

A Randomized Controlled Trial	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Medical treatment; Muscles; Electromyography; Electrodes; Electroencephalography; Thumb; Wireless sensor networks; Afferent input; electromyography; muscle patterns; muscle activity; resting EEG; reflex locomotion; tactile stimulation; Vojta therapy	PHYSIOTHERAPY; STIMULATION	Objective: Vojta therapy describes stereotypic widespread motor responses as a pattern of tonic muscle contractions during a peripherical pressure stimulation. The present work proposes to characterize the responses at muscles level to a specific tactile input based on Vojta therapy, assessed by sEMG, compared to a sham stimulation in healthy subjects. Methods: Surface electromyography (sEMG) signal was acquired with dipolar electrodes placed at wrist extensors of both forearms, right tibialis anterior, and top part of rectus abdominus, ground channel placed over the right olecranon. It was amplified and digitized by a 4-channel hub Biosignalsplux device (Plux Wireless Biosignals S.A., Lisboa, Portugal), sampled at 1000 Hz with 16-bit per channel. A continuous 10-minute record of the sEMG signal from the four electrodes were registered. Resting EEG during the first minute before the stimulation period was recorded by 64 active electrodes. Results: Statistically significant differences were showed between sham and experimental group. Experimental group participants were subjected to cluster analysis based on their muscle activation patterns, generating three different models of activation. Differences in the previous resting cortical activity in left superior frontal area were found between clusters that activated limb muscles and the cluster that did not. Conclusions: Vojta specific stimulation area activates innate muscle responses assessed by sEMG in healthy subjects, compared to a sham stimulation. Significance: This characterization might be helpful to the prescription and application of Vojta therapy in an individual-basis for non-neurophysiologically damaged adult subjects.

Dentate granule cells, the first relay in the trisynaptic circuit through the hippocampus, exhibit low spontaneous firing rates even during locomotion. Using intracellular recordings from dentate neurons in awake mice operating a levitated spherical treadmill, we found a transient membrane potential alpha-band oscillation associated with the onset of spontaneous motion, especially forward walking movements. While often subthreshold, alpha oscillations could regulate spike timing during locomotion and may enable dentate gyrus neurons to respond to specific cortical afferent pathways while maintaining low average firing rates.

As a first step in determining whether the adolescent delta decline is similar in both sexes, we compared cross-sectional sleep EEG data from 9- and 12-year-old boys and girls. Design: All-night EEG recordings, 6 months apart, were conducted on each subject. Setting: EEG was recorded in the subjects' homes. Participants: Thirty-two 9-year-olds and 38 12-year-olds are enrolled in a 4-year longitudinal study of adolescent sleep. There are equal numbers of each sex in both age cohorts. Interventions: N/A. Measurements: Using ambulatory recorders, EEG was recorded in the subjects' homes on their normal sleep schedule. For each of the 2 semiannual recording periods, data from the 10 subjects from each age-sex group with the cleanest (fewest artifacts) signals were selected for cross-sectional comparisons of visual scoring and EEG variables. All artifact-free 20-second non-rapid eye movement epochs were analyzed with power spectral and period-amplitude analysis. Results: In the 12-year-old cohort, delta power per minute was 37% higher in boys than girls. The 9-year-old cohort showed no sex difference. A second recording 6 months later produced similar results. Conclusion: These cross-sectional data indicate that girls begin the steep adolescent decline in slow-wave EEG earlier than boys. We hypothesize that this reflects an earlier onset of adolescent synaptic pruning in females.

Lossless EEG Compression Using the DCT and the Huffman Coding	JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Lossless EEG Compression; Discrete Cosine Transform; Huffman Coding	CLASSIFICATION; SIGNALS	The telemedicine and ambulatory monitoring development motivates many researchers to focus on the lossless electroencephalogram (EEG) compression in recent years. Nevertheless, most of these studies could not present the potential of compression techniques such as discrete cosine transform (DCT), and Huffman coding due to lack of attention to the signal and technique characteristics. In this work, we developed a lossless hybrid EEG compression method based on the characteristic of DCT frequency spectrum and the Huffman coding. In our method, we calculate the DCT coefficients below 40 Hz (dominant components) of the EEG segments. Then, we code these quantized DCT coefficients using a Huffman coder in the transmitter site. In the receiver site, we add a zero set for the DCT coefficients above 40 Hz, and then reconstruct the EEG segments using the inverse DCT. We applied our method for the five sets (denoted A-E) of the Bone University database. The results indicate that our algorithm can improve the average compression ratio of these sets up to 1.78, 1.94, 2.66, 3.35, and 1.78 times of the best results in the literature, respectively. Therefore, our hybrid method could compress the single-channel signal satisfactory enough.	[Karimu, R.

Mesial temporal resection following long-term ambulatory intracranial EEG monitoring with a direct brain-responsive neurostimulation system	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						brain-responsive neurostimulation; electrocorticography; epilepsy surgery; intractable temporal lobe epilepsy; mesial temporal lobe resection; temporal lobectomy	EPILEPSY SURGERY; LOBE EPILEPSY; CONTROLLED TRIAL; STIMULATION; ADULTS	Objective To describe seizure outcomes in patients with medically refractory epilepsy who had evidence of bilateral mesial temporal lobe (MTL) seizure onsets and underwent MTL resection based on chronic ambulatory intracranial EEG (ICEEG) data from a direct brain-responsive neurostimulator (RNS) system. Methods We retrospectively identified all patients at 17 epilepsy centers with MTL epilepsy who were treated with the RNS System using bilateral MTL leads, and in whom an MTL resection was subsequently performed. Presumed lateralization based on routine presurgical approaches was compared to lateralization determined by RNS System chronic ambulatory ICEEG recordings. The primary outcome was frequency of disabling seizures at last 3-month follow-up after MTL resection compared to seizure frequency 3 months before MTL resection. Results We identified 157 patients treated with the RNS System with bilateral MTL leads due to presumed bitemporal epilepsy. Twenty-five patients (16%) subsequently had an MTL resection informed by chronic ambulatory ICEEG (mean = 42 months ICEEG); follow-up was available for 24 patients. After MTL resection, the median reduction in disabling seizures at last follow-up was 100% (mean: 94%; range: 50%-100%). Nine patients (38%) had exclusively unilateral electrographic seizures recorded by chronic ambulatory ICEEG and all were seizure-free at last follow-up after MTL resection; eight of nine continued RNS System treatment. Fifteen patients (62%) had bilateral MTL electrographic seizures, had an MTL resection on the more active side, continued RNS System treatment, and achieved a median clinical seizure reduction of 100% (mean: 90%; range: 50%-100%) at last follow-up, with eight of fifteen seizure-free. For those with more than 1 year of follow-up (N = 21), 15 patients (71%) were seizure-free during the most recent year, including all eight patients with unilateral onsets and 7 of 13 patients (54%) with bilateral onsets. Significance Chronic ambulatory ICEEG data provide information about lateralization of MTL seizures and can identify additional patients who may benefit from MTL resection.

The EEG recordings of the ambulatory recording systems generate very lengthy data and the detection of the epileptic activity requires a time-consuming analysis of the entire length of the EEG data by an expert. The traditional methods of analysis being tedious, many automated diagnostic systems for epilepsy have emerged in recent years. This paper-proposes a neural-network-based automated epileptic EEG detection system that uses approximate entropy (ApEn) as the input feature. ApEn is a statistical parameter that measures the predictability of the current amplitude values of a physiological signal based on its previous amplitude values. It is known that the value of the ApEn drops sharply during an epileptic seizure and this fact is used in the proposed system. Two different types of neural networks, namely, Elman and probabilistic neural networks, are considered in this paper. ApEn is used for the first time in the proposed system for the detection of epilepsy using neural networks. It is shown that the overall accuracy values as high as 100% can be achieved by using the proposed system.

LTM is an established technique in use both in a hospital setting and, increasingly, in an ambulatory and more recently in a community-based setting. There has been sufficient evidence to substantiate the claim that LTM is of crucial importance in documenting electroclinical correlations both in epilepsy and in paroxysmally occurring behavioral changes often mistaken for epilepsy. Internationally recognized neurophysiological equipment standards, data acquisition and data transfer protocols and widely accepted safety standards have made widespread access to LTM facilities in epilepsy possible. Recommendations on efficient and effective use of resources as well as regarding training and competencies for personnel involved in LTM in epilepsy have been formulated. The DMC Neurophysiology Subcommittee of the ILAE recommends use of hospital-based LTM in the documentation of seizures including its application for assessing seizure type and frequency, in the evaluation of status epilepticus, in noninvasive and invasive video/EEG investigations for epilepsy surgery and for the differential diagnosis between epilepsy and paroxysmally occurring nonepileptic conditions, in children and in adults. Ambulatory outpatient and community-based LTM may be used as a substitute for inpatient LTM in cases where the latter is not cost-effective or feasible or when activation procedures aimed at increasing seizure yield are not indicated. However, outpatient ambulatory monitoring may be less informative than is inpatient monitoring in some cases because: (1) reduction of medication to provoke seizures may not be safe as an outpatient; (2) faulty electrode contacts cannot quickly be noticed and repaired; (3) the patient may move out of video surveillance; and (4) duration of ambulatory monitoring can be limited by technical constraints.

ADL classification based on electroencephalogram (EEG) is of great significance to perform active robotic rehabilitation for patients with complete spinal cord injury (SCI) who lose locomotion of affected limbs absolutely, where surface electromyography (sEMG) or active force signal can hardly be detected. It is a challenge to achieve a satisfying result in neuro-rehabilitation robotics using EEG signals due to the high randomness of the EEG data. A classification method is proposed based on spiking neural networks (SNN) to identify the upper-limb ADL of three classes with 14-channel EEG data. The continuous real-number signals are firstly encoded into spike trains through Ben's Spike Algorithm (BSA). The generated spikes are then submitted into a 3-D brain-mapped SNN reservoir called NeuCube trained by Spike Timing Dependant Plasticity (STDP). Spike trains from all neurons of the trained reservoir are finally classified using one version of dynamic evolving spiking neuron networks (deSNN) - deSNNs. Classifications are presented with and without NeuCube respectively on the same EEG data set. Results indicate that using the reservoir improves identification accuracy which turns out pretty promising despite that EEG data is highly noisy, low frequently sampled, and only from 14 channels. The classification technique reveals a great potential for the further implementation of active robotic rehabilitation to the sufferers of complete SCI.

Methods: During propofol/remifentanil anaesthesia the EEG was continuously recorded in 92 patients aged 16 to 84 years (ASA I -IV, 39 men, 53 women) using the EEG monitor Narcotrend (R). For application of propofol the TO pump Diprifusor (R) was used. Propofol application rates were determined according to the EEG, the target level for maintenance of anaesthesia being EEG stages D-2/E-0, which are related to deep anaesthesia. Propofol dosages and recovery times were analysed with regard to age and ASA group. Results: Propofol consumption decreased by 4.1 % per decade of life (20 years: 3.13 mu g/ml, 80 years: 2.45 mu g/ml). Times from stop of propofol until eyes open and until extubation did not differ significantly between ASA groups I, II, and III/IV and between patients in the age groups <= 50, 51 - 70 and > 70 years. The mean remifentanil dosage was 0.22 +/- 0.07 mu g/kg/min and the mean TCI blood concentration was 2.74 +/- 0.51 mu g/ml. Discussion: During propofol/remifentanil anaesthesia EEG monitoring helped to ascertain propofol dosages which were adapted to the age and the general condition of the patients. Conclusion: Using EEG control of anaesthesia on a regular basis helps to optimise perioperative processes in hospital based anaesthesia departments as well as in ambulatory care centers.

Methods for the Detection of Seizure Bursts in Epilepsy	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						EEG; bursts; seizure cluster; prediction; epilepsy; interseizure interval	LONG-TERM; CLUSTERS; IDENTIFICATION; RECORDINGS; CORTEX	Background: Seizure clusters and "bursts" are of clinical importance. Clusters are reported to be a marker of antiepileptic drug resistance. Additionally, seizure clustering has been found to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, there are no statistical methods described in the literature to delineate bursting phenomenon in epileptic seizures. Methods: We present three automatic burst detection methods referred to as precision constrained grouping (PCG), burst duration constrained grouping (BCG), and interseizure interval constrained grouping (ICG). Concordance correlation coefficients were used to confirm the pairwise agreement between common bursts isolated using these three automatic burst detection procedures. Additionally, three graphical methods were employed to demonstrate seizure bursts: modified scatter plots, staircase plots, and dropline plots. Burst detection procedures are demonstrated on data from continuous intracranial ambulatory EEG monitoring in a patient diagnosed with drug-refractory focal epilepsy. Results: We analyzed 1,569 seizures, from our assigned index patient, captured on ambulatory intracranial EEG monitoring. A total of 31, 32, and 32 seizure bursts were detected by the three quantitative methods (BCG, ICG, and PCG), respectively. The concordance correlation coefficient was >= 0.99 signifying considerably stronger than chance burst detector agreements with one another. Conclusions: Bursting is a quantifiable temporal phenomenon in epilepsy and seizure bursts can be reliably detected using our methodology.

Is a routine procedure necessary?	EPILEPSIA OPEN			English	Article						absence childhood epilepsy; clinical seizure; generalized epileptiform discharges; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; EEG activation; hyperventilation	ILAE COMMISSION; CLASSIFICATION; ACTIVATION; SEIZURES	Objective Hyperventilation (HV) is one of the main and basic activation methods during ambulatory electroencephalogram (EEG), unless medical reasons contraindicate it. During the COVID-19 pandemic, with the high risk of human-to-human infection, local guidelines and recommendations have been developed that suggest not to perform the HV maneuver routinely. Our objective was to characterize patients who present positive HV in an epilepsy center. Methods We analyzed retrospectively all the ambulatory EEGs performed during one year in our specialized ambulatory child and adolescent epilepsy center, and describe patients with positive maneuver. Results A total of 305 EEGs were performed. Patients under 3 years and 11 months were excluded as well as all patients that did not fill up the criteria for epilepsy diagnosis. From the 252 EEGs that were included in the study, 194 EEGs (77%) were classified as abnormal and 58 (23%) as normal. From these same 252 EEGs, 150 EEG finished correctly the HV maneuver. Physiological slowing response was found in 54 EEGs (36%), no changes (negative) in 83 (55%), and abnormal response (positive) in 13 EEGs (9%). The 13 HV-positive EEGs showed 4 patients with an increase of epileptiform activity, 3 patients experienced an increase of basal preregistered abnormal slowing, and 6 EEGs showed trigger of bilaterally synchronous and symmetric 2-4 Hz spike-and-slow wave discharges and absences. None of these last 6 patients needed more than 3 minutes to elicit the paroxysmal discharge. Significance Based on these findings and according with other studies, the low positivity and high specificity of the HV maneuver support the idea that HV could be excluded during the COVID-19 pandemic situation, and also reevaluate whether it could be changed to a complementary maneuver, restricted only for cases where absence epilepsy is suspected. Larger studies will be needed to reaffirm this proposal.

Her consciousness was altered with mutism, asterisxis, and horizontal nystagmus. Her EEG showed continuous generalized three spikes-and-wave per second that were abolished after intravenous diazepam. Ceftazidime-related NCSE was suggested and ceftazidime therapy was stopped. Hemodialysis was done while phenytoin was also given to control the convulsions. Her consciousness improved after hemodialysis. Serum ceftazidime measured before and after hemodialysis on the second and third day were 105.2/39.4, 36.2/5.2 mu g/mL (normal peak level 55 mu g/mL), respectively.

J	Lin, YP; Wang, YJ; Jung, TP				Lin, Yuan-Pin; Wang, Yijun; Jung, Tzyy-Ping			Assessing the feasibility of online SSVEP decoding in human walking using a consumer EEG headset	JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						EEG; Consumer-level EEG headset; SSVEP; BCI; Moving humans	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; DYNAMICS; DESIGN	Background: Bridging the gap between laboratory brain-computer interface (BCI) demonstrations and real-life applications has gained increasing attention nowadays in translational neuroscience. An urgent need is to explore the feasibility of using a low-cost, ease-of-use electroencephalogram (EEG) headset for monitoring individuals' EEG signals in their natural head/body positions and movements. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of using a consumer-level EEG headset to realize an online steady-state visual-evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI during human walking. Methods: This study adopted a 14-channel Emotiv EEG headset to implement a four-target online SSVEP decoding system, and included treadmill walking at the speeds of 0.45, 0.89, and 1.34 meters per second (m/s) to initiate the walking locomotion. Seventeen participants were instructed to perform the online BCI tasks while standing or walking on the treadmill. To maintain a constant viewing distance to the visual targets, participants held the hand-grip of the treadmill during the experiment. Along with online BCI performance, the concurrent SSVEP signals were recorded for offline assessment. Results: Despite walking-related attenuation of SSVEPs, the online BCI obtained an information transfer rate (ITR) over 12 bits/min during slow walking (below 0.89 m/s). Conclusions: SSVEP-based BCI systems are deployable to users in treadmill walking that mimics natural walking rather than in highly-controlled laboratory settings. This study considerably promotes the use of a consumer-level EEG headset towards the real-life BCI applications.

However, existing approaches in tourism do not adequately explain the process by which emotions are elicited. Recent advances in cognitive and neuropsychology demonstrate that emotions are elicited through an appraisal process, which occurs in the cortex of the brain. These processes produce chemical monoamine neurotransmitters that lead to bodily feelings, which in turn enable our brain to recognise emotions. This research note draws on Lovheim's Cube, a self-report scale that provides a proxy indicator of the likely presence of monoamine neurotransmitters of serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline. Six images of the Great Barrier Reef were used as a stimuli in an online panel survey (n = 1249). Results demonstrate that images used by tourism stakeholders are likely to produce stronger neurological reactions than images from an environmental non-governmental organisation. Combining recent advances in self-report methods with a neurocognitive approach has the propensity to offers additional insight into emotional reactions to visual stimuli. Further research should focus on the efficacy of utilising self-report measures with cutting edge psychophysiological techniques, such as ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG) to open the door to the next frontier in tourism emotion research.

Motor cortex signals in bipedal monkeys have been interpreted to predict walk kinematics. Epidural electrical stimulation in rats and in one young paraplegic has been realized to partially restore motor control after spinal cord injury. However, these experimental trials are far from being applicable to all patients suffering from motor impairments. Therefore, it is thought that more simple rehabilitation systems are desirable in the meanwhile. The goal of this review is to describe and summarize the progress made in the development of non-invasive brain-computer interfaces dedicated to motor rehabilitation systems. In the first part, the main principles of human locomotion control are presented. The paper then focuses on the mechanisms of supra-spinal centers active during gait, including results from electroencephalography, functional brain imaging technologies [near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron-emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission-computed tomography (SPELT)] and invasive studies. The first brain-computer interface (BCI) applications to gait rehabilitation are then presented, with a discussion about the different strategies developed in the field. The challenges to raise for future systems are identified and discussed. Finally, we present some proposals to address these challenges, in order to contribute to the improvement of BCI for gait rehabilitation.

Largely due to difficultly of measuring sleep outside a controlled, clinical, and laboratory study in ambulatory individuals, human biologists have yet to undergo a thorough examination of sleep in ecologically diverse settings. Here, I outline the procedures and methods for generating sleep data in a broader ecological context with the goal of facilitating the integration of sleep and circadian analyses into human biology research. Methods I describe the steps involved in participant recruitment, screening by way of survey instruments, and sample collection. In addition to describing field use of the traditional (but invasive) equipment such as the gold-standard application of electroencephalography (EEG), I demonstrate leading-edge noninvasive techniques for biometric devices (ie, wrist-worn actigraphy, ring worn arterial pulsometry) to generate sleep and circadian rhythms data. Results I outline best approaches to process and analyze data-including variables such as sleep duration, 24-hour sleep time (ie, summation of night and day sleep), sleep efficiency, sleep fragmentation, and nonparametric circadian rhythms analysis to quantify circadian amplitude. Finally, I discuss comparative statistical methods that are optimized for the use of time-series data. Conclusions This review serves as an introduction to the best practices for studying sleep-wake patterns in humans-with the goal of standardizing tools for launching new human sleep biology research initiatives across the globe.

These wireless sensors are responsible for collecting, processing, and transmitting vital information such as: blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, electrocardiographic (ECG), electroencephalography (EEG) and oxygenation signals to provide continuous health monitoring with real-time feedback to the users and medical centers. In order to fully exploit the benefits of WBANs for important applications such as Electronic Health (EH), Mobile Health (MH), and Ambulatory Health Monitoring (AHM), the power consumption must be minimized. Since Wireless Nodes (WNs) in WBANs are usually driven by battery power consumption is the most important factor to determine the life of WBANs. This paper presents the applications of Compressed Sensing (CS) theory in WBANs. We have achieved networks with low-sampling rate and low-power consumption on a number of applications. A combination of CS theory to WBANs is the optimal solution for achieving the networks with low-sampling rate and low-power consumption. Our simulation results in ECG signals show that sampling rate can be reduced t0 25% and power consumption to 35% without sacrificing performances by employing the CS theory to WBANs.

Locomotor effects, prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle reaction (ASR), dopamine and its metabolite levels in nucleus accumbens (NAc), EEG power spectra and coherence in freely moving rats were analysed. Amphetamine was used as a reference compound. 2C-B had a biphasic effect on locomotion with initial inhibitory followed by excitatory effect; amphetamine induced only hyperlocomotion. Both drugs induced deficits in the PPI; however they had opposite effects on ASR. 2C-B increased dopamine but decreased 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the NAc. Low doses of 2C-B induced a decrease in EEG power spectra and coherence. On the contrary, high dose of 2C-B 50 mg/kg had a temporally biphasic effect with an initial decrease followed by an increase in EEG power; decrease as well as increase in EEG coherence was observed. Amphetamine mainly induced an increase in EEG power and coherence in theta and alpha bands. Increases in the theta and alpha power and coherence in 2C-B and amphetamine were temporally linked to an increase in locomotor activity and DA levels in NAc. 2C-B is a centrally active compound similar to other hallucinogens, entactogens and stimulants. Increased dopamine and decreased DOPAC in the NAc may reflect its psychotomimetic and addictive potential and monoaminoxidase inhibition. Alterations in brain functional connectivity reflected the behavioral and neurochemical changes produced by the drug; a correlation between EEG changes and locomotor behavior was observed.

To help clarify the situation single trials of hippocampal EEG were analysed using wavelet time-frequency analysis and we found that theta frequency within single trials shows positive or negative correlation with wheel running speed, even when mean theta frequency is not correlated with mean wheel running speed. As the mean running speed increases and the standard deviation of running speed decreases in a single trial, the correlation between theta frequency and wheel running speed within the single trial tends to be positive. Trials with abrupt decelerations have lower means and higher standard deviations of speed and tend to have negative correlations within single trials. In addition, we observed a shift of dominant theta frequency from 7.5-8 Hz to 8.5-9 Hz during spontaneous deceleration behaviour without involving any cognitive task, which has been connected to learning, attention and cognition.

J	Sinnamon, HM				Sinnamon, HM			Hippocampal theta activity related to elicitation and inhibition of approach locomotion	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						theta; hippocampus; approach; locomotion; inhibition; reward attention	HYPOTHALAMIC-STIMULATION; MOTOR-ACTIVITY; RATS; RHYTHM; BEHAVIOR; EEG; MODULATION; MOVEMENT; LESIONS; WAVE	This study determined if the hippocampal theta rhythm showed phase relationships or changes in amplitude and frequency with the onset of stimuli and locomotion in a task in which auditory cues initiated and suppressed approach locomotion. Rats with electrodes in the dorsal hippocampus lapped at a milk dipper and were presented a tone which predicted the delivery of a food pellet. In some trials the pellet cue tone was negated by 60-Hz clicks beginning 0.3 s after onset, and no pellet was delivered. A video capture system (20-ms sampling) synchronized to the hippocampal recording system (10-ms sampling) was used to determine the onset of locomotor approach to the pellet area. The findings failed to support proposals that phase-related mechanisms play a role in encoding and retrieval of movement-related information. Neither the pellet cue nor the negating cue reset the theta rhythm, and they did not produce differential evoked potentials. During milk lapping, theta amplitude increased in the 1/2 s prior to all pellet cues regardless of their locomotor effect. Frequency also rose but only when a nonnegated pellet elicited short-latency locomotion. During locomotor execution, theta peak amplitude peaked earlier than theta frequency by approximately one period. In general during performance of this task, increasing theta amplitude reflected a general preparation to process the cue and increasing theta frequency reflected the readiness to respond to the cue with locomotion.

Although this presents a difficult technical challenge in any context, these concerns are particularly pronounced in a system designed for mobile contexts. This paper describes a neurophysiologically derived cognitive state classification approach designed for ambulatory task contexts. We highlight signal processing and classification components that render the electroencephalogram (EEG) - based cognitive state estimation system robust to noise. Field assessments show classification performance that exceeds 70% for all participants in a context that many have regarded as intractable for cognitive state classification using EEG.

The method is based on a two-channel electro-oculography (EOG) referenced to the left mastoid (M I). Synchronous electroencephalo-graphic (EEG) activity in S2 and SWS was detected by calculating cross-correlation and peak-to-peak amplitude difference ill the 0.5-6 Hz band between the two EOG channels. An automatic slow eye-movement (SEM) estimation was used to indicate wakefulness, SREM and S L Beta power 18-30 Hz and alpha power 8-12 Hz was also used for wakefulness detection. Synchronous 1.5-6 Hz EEG activity and absence of large eye movements was used for S I separation from SREM. Simple smoothing rules were also applied. Sleep EEG, EOG and EMG were recorded from 265 subjects. The system was tuned using data from 132 training subjects and then applied to data from 131 validation subjects that were different to the training subjects. Cohen's Kappa between the visual and the developed new automatic scoring in separating 30 s wakefulness, SREM, S 1 7 S2 and SWS epochs was substantial 0.62 with epoch by epoch agreement of 72%. With automatic subject specific alpha thresholds for offline applications results improved to 0.63 and 73%. The automatic method can be further developed and applied for ambulatory sleep recordings by using only four disposable, self-adhesive and self-applicable electrodes. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

J	Malik, S				Malik, Shireen			Using neuroscience to explore creative media in art therapy: a systematic narrative review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART THERAPY			English	Review						Art therapy; art media; neuroscience; transdisciplinary; ECLIPSE; neuroimaging; Mobile brain; Body Imaging (MoBI); Expressive Therapies Continuum (ETC)	BILATERAL ART; QUANTITATIVE EEG; BRAIN; TRAUMA; NEUROPSYCHOANALYSIS; ATTACHMENT; MEMORY	Background Few studies have investigated brain responses to different art media. Investigations into brain processes during art making have highlighted important structures. Neuroimaging tools have been used to investigate activation of brain areas whilst artmaking, but not in a therapeutic setting. This review highlights recent advancements in this area and encourages researchers to be the first to apply this in the UK. Aim To understand how the principles of neuroscience are currently informing the literature to explain the effects of art media in art therapy practice. Methods Review of published peer-reviewed research between years 2000 and 2020 on neuroscience and art therapy. Results Findings were summarised into categories discussing psychological/neurobiological issues, art media, neuroimaging technology, and models posited. Forty-six studies were found; majority discussed the structure and function of the brain to explain art therapy processes. The Expressive Therapies Continuum (ETC) model theorised that media properties stimulate different levels of visual and cognitive processing. The novel Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) neuroimaging technology may be used as a means of quantifying data. Conclusion Significant progress has been made in attempting to explain brain responses during the art therapy process. However empirical data is needed to prove theoretical models. The use of neuroimaging has started this process to lead research into evidence-based practice. Implications for practice/further research Evidencing the ground-breaking ETC model, using neuroimaging and MoBI technology is needed through close collaboration between transdisciplinary departments. Art therapists should be encouraged to use the ETC to inform art therapy assessment, planning and treatment. Plain-language summary Neuroscience is the study of the brain and its processes, and recently technology has been available to researchers to examine brain processes in detail. This systematic narrative review explores recent literature that uses the principles of neuroscience to investigate the effects of art therapy, with a specific interest in art media. A systematic narrative review is when the findings of the study rely on the use of words to summarise the data. Art media is an important part of art therapy, as it is through artistic expressions that the client communicates their inner troubles. Different art media has been shown to elicit different feelings and behavioural responses in clients. However, research showing brain responses to different art media is limited. This study highlights ways in which further research in this field can take place. Results show that significant advancements have already been made that identify important structures and functions of the brain accessed during art therapy. Important models which incorporate neuroscience principles and theorise the art therapy process are highlighted. A significant model is the Expressive Therapies Continuum. This model explains how the brain processes information when different art media is used. However empirical data is needed to substantiate the theory behind this model. The use of neuroimaging technology is one way to achieve this. Therefore, this paper encourages transdisciplinary research to further investigate the effects different art media has on the brain during the art therapy process.

J	Dora, C; Biswal, PK				Dora, Chinmayee; Biswal, Pradyut Kumar			Correlation-based ECG Artifact Correction from Single Channel EEG using Modified Variational Mode Decomposition	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						EEG; ECG; artifact; modified VMD; EEMD; Correlation	REGULARIZATION; METHODOLOGY; REMOVAL	Background and objective: Ambulatory based healthcare system use limited electrodes for electroencephalogram (EEG) acquisition at concerned electrode position, to minimize the instrumentation and computational complexity. But, again the possibility of contamination is inevitable depending on the electrode position on the scalp. This paper proposes an electrocardiogram (ECG) artifact correction algorithm in the absence of coherent ECG for automatic analysis/diagnosis of the acquired contaminated single channel EEG signal. Methods: The proposed algorithm uses an enhanced and modified version of signal decomposition i.e. modified variational mode decomposition (mVMD) to obtain band limited intrinsic mode functions (BLIMFs) from EEG epoch. The mVMD is found to be useful when the signal contains properties that are correlated. Further, exploiting the correlation among the obtained mode functions the ECG artifact components are identified. An ECG reference is estimated and QRS complexes are suppressed. The effective EEG reconstruction is performed by simply adding the remaining BLIMFs to QRS complex suppressed estimated reference. This is owing to the robust reconstruction feature provided by mVMD. Results: Upon the comparative evaluation for both real and semi-simulated dataset, the proposed algorithm is providing less distortion to the EEG brain activity frequency bands, and is also less computationally intensive than the existing Ensembled empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) based algorithm that requires ECG reference channel. Evaluation of semi-simulated dataset obtained an average correlation of 97% between EEG signals before contamination and after correction of ECG artifact. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm efficiently corrects the ECG artifact from EEG while overcoming the limitations such as, (1) requirement of a reference ECG channel, (2) requirement of R-R interval or amplitude thresholding for QRS complex identification.

Chronic DREADD Isn't As Bad As It Sounds	EPILEPSY CURRENTS			English	Editorial Material								Long-Term Chemogenetic Suppression of Spontaneous Seizures in a Mouse Model for Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Desloovere J, Boon P, Larsen LE, et al. Epilepsia. 2019;60(11):2314-2324. doi:10.1111/epi.16368. Objective: More than one-third of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) continue to have seizures despite treatment with antiepileptic drugs, and many experience severe drug-related side effects, illustrating the need for novel therapies. Selective expression of inhibitory Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) allows cell-type-specific reduction of neuronal excitability. In this study, we evaluated the effect of chemogenetic suppression of excitatory pyramidal and granule cell neurons of the sclerotic hippocampus in the intrahippocampal mouse model (IHKA) for TLE. Methods: Intrahippocampal IHKA mice were injected with an adeno-associated viral vector carrying the genes for an inhibitory DREADD hM4Di in the sclerotic hippocampus or control vector. Next, animals were treated systemically with different single doses of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg) and clozapine (0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg), and the effect on spontaneous hippocampal seizures, hippocampal electroencephalography (EEG) power, fast ripples (FRs), and behavior in the open field test was evaluated. Finally, animals received prolonged treatment with clozapine for 3 days, and the effect on seizures was monitored. Results: Treatment with both CNO and clozapine resulted in a robust suppression of hippocampal seizures for at least 15 hours only in DREADD-expressing animals. Moreover, total EEG power and the number of FRs were significantly reduced. Clozapine-N-oxide and/or clozapine had no effects on interictal hippocampal EEG, seizures, or locomotion/anxiety in the open field test in non-DREADD epileptic IHKA mice. Repeated clozapine treatment every 8 hours for 3 days resulted in almost complete seizure suppression in DREADD animals. Significance: This study shows the potency of chemogenetics to robustly and sustainably suppress spontaneous epileptic seizures and pave the way for an epilepsy therapy in which a systemically administered exogenous drug selectively modulates specific cell types in a seizure network, leading to a potent seizure suppression devoid of the typical drug-related side effects.

Ten participants wore two cEEGrid systems for at least seven hours. Using a smartphone for stimulus delivery and signal acquisition, resting EEG and auditory oddball data were collected in the morning and in the afternoon six to seven hours apart. Analysis of resting EEG data confirmed well-known spectral differences between eyes open and eyes closed conditions. The ERP results confirmed the predicted condition effects with significantly larger P300 amplitudes for target compared to standard tones, and a high test-retest reliability of the P300 amplitude (r>=.74). Moreover, a linear classifier trained on data from the morning session revealed similar performance in classification accuracy for the morning and the afternoon sessions (both > 70%). These findings demonstrate the feasibility of concealed and comfortable brain activity acquisition over many hours.

We applied Adaptive Mixture Independent Component Analysis (AMICA) to explore the voluntary cortical contribution during pedaling process and compared the difference between active and passive pedaling in this preliminary study. We explored the power spectral density, source localization, and event-related spectral perturbations of selected independent components (ICs). The results demonstrated typical IC clusters during pedaling, and various cortical regions contribute differently to the locomotion control process. The active and passive pedaling showed different activation pattern in the cortex, but no significant difference was found, further study is still necessary to confirm the cortical contribution difference for different pedaling conditions.

However, the signal quality of dry electrodes in comparison with wet electrodes has not yet been evaluated under activities of daily life (ADL) or high motion tasks. In this study, we compared the performances of foam-based and spring-loaded dry electrodes with wet electrodes under three different task conditions: resting state, walking, and cycling. Our analysis showed that signals obtained by the 2 types of dry electrodes and obtained by wet electrodes displayed high correlation for all conditions, while being prone to similar environmental and electrode-based artifacts. Overall, our results suggest that dry electrodes have a similar signal quality in comparison to wet electrodes during motion and may be more practical for use in mobile and real-time motion applications due to their convenience. In addition, we conclude that as with wet electrodes, post-processing can mitigate motion artifacts in ambulatory EEG acquisition.

A Comprehensive Review of Psychophysiological Applications for Ecological Momentary Assessment in Psychiatric Populations	PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT			English	Review						ambulatory; experience sampling; psychiatric disorder; psychophysiology	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; AMBULATORY BLOOD-PRESSURE; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; BORDERLINE PERSONALITY-DISORDER; STATE-RELATED DIFFERENCES; IN-VIVO EXPOSURE; PANIC DISORDER; SOCIAL SUPPORT; CARDIOVASCULAR ACTIVITY; BIPOLAR DISORDER	Psychophysiological assessment is a core method used in psychopathology research that has led to important insights in relation to the etiology and maintenance of many disorders. However, laboratory psychophysiology has limited ecological validity. This limitation has resulted in the field moving toward ambulatory recordings of psychophysiology paired with ecological momentary assessment (EMA). This review uses the results of a comprehensive review of EMA psychophysiology studies to discuss applications, advantages, limitations, and future use of this methodology, including electrocardiography, blood pressure, electroencephalography, and more. Mobile psychophysiology has several advantages, including ecological validity, temporal precision, and concurrent evaluation of internally and externally generated contexts that influence physiological response. However, it is limited by the difficulty of conducting such studies and reduced experimental control. Future research using EMA psychophysiology should aim to record over longer periods, better integrate with everyday life, determine the utility of ecological momentary interventions based on psychophysiology, create guidelines for standardization, and aim to establish reliability and validity. EMA psychophysiology is a promising direction for the field and provides novel avenues for research and treatment of psychopathology, although methodological shortcomings must be addressed. Public Significance Statement This article is a systematic review of ecological momentary assessment studies that utilize ambulatory psychophysiology to measure psychological and physical health constructs in psychiatric disorders. We conclude with a summary of methodological considerations of implementing ambulatory psychophysiology and make recommendations for future studies.

J	Kaplan, PW				Kaplan, PW			Prognosis in nonconvulsive status epilepticus	EPILEPTIC DISORDERS			English	Review						prognosis/outcome; non convulsive status epilepticus; EEG; diagnosis; morbidity; treatment	COMPLEX PARTIAL STATUS; CONVULSIVE STATUS EPILEPTICUS; EEG; TIAGABINE; SEIZURES; IMPAIRMENT; CONFUSION; LORAZEPAM; CHILDREN; PRIMATES	Determining the prognosis in nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is complicated by several factors. under-recognition of NCSE with its spontaneous resolution (thus decreasing the "denominator" of total cases that will have a poor outcome); incorrect diagnosis of NCSE based on misinterpretation of EEC "epileptiform" activity; mis-classification of certain EEC patterns as NCSE (e.g. PLEDs; triphasic waves); and grouping of different populations that have markedly different co-morbidities (ambulatory patients with NCSE together with comatose patients with electrographic seizure activity on EEC). There are almost no prospective studies with premorbid neuropsychometric studies, and retrospective studies typically include isolated cases, or case series that include conditions in which the cause of NCSE itself causes cognitive morbidity. To summarize available data, absence status (ambulatory generalized nonconvulsive status epilepticus) would appear to carry no lasting morbidity. Complex partial status epilepticus in ambulatory patients rarely results in measurable permanent neurologic deficit, although rarely, short or long-standing deficits may clearly occur. Because intensive treatment with intravenous anticonvulsants (e.g. benzodiazepines or phenytoin) can confer morbidity, the equation has not yet been made as to whether the morbidity of such intensive treatment for all cases of NCSE exceeds the morbidity of the disease itself. Larger, prospective studies will be needed to truly determine the prognosis in the different types of NCSE, stratified according to associated degrees of impairment (minimally impaired, moderately obtunded, comatose).

Diurnal pattern of seizures outside the hospital Is there a time of circadian vulnerability?	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION; SLEEP STAGE; ADENOSINE; EPILEPSY; SITE	Objective: To evaluate whether the distribution of seizures throughout the day is the same in ambulatory outpatient conditions as observed in inpatient conditions. Methods: We analyzed records from consecutive patients who had ambulatory EEG monitoring for 24 to 72 hours using Digitrace (TM) EEG recording system. The participants maintained a log of symptoms and signaled the time when symptoms occurred by pushing an event button. Additionally, automatic seizure and spike detection was performed on each record using Persyst detection software. Results: Of 831 reports analyzed, 44 unique patients had definite ictal events. There were a total of 129 electrographic seizures (34 subclinical) with timing as follows: frontal (31), temporal (71), and generalized, posterior, or central (27). Frontal lobe seizures occurred more frequently between 12 AM and 12 PM as compared to temporal lobe seizures, which occurred more frequently between 12 PM and 12 AM (p = 0.017). Analysis of frontal lobe seizures revealed a cluster of 10 seizures centered at 6: 33 AM (range 5:15-7:30 AM) with p = 0.0064. Temporal lobe seizures had a cluster of 24 seizures centered at 8:49 PM (range 6:45-11:56 PM) with p = 0.0437. Conclusion: In ambulatory outpatient conditions, electrographic seizures follow day/night patterns similar to those observed in hospital conditions. Frontal seizures occur preferentially in the early morning hours and temporal lobe seizures occur in the early evening hours.

The procedures these devices use to record these data vary a great deal. Some record the data in analog form, others in digital form, and others save only the interbeat intervals. With the variety of available devices the comparability of their resulting data needs to be verified for researchers to be confident of their results when sharing data among laboratories. Three ECG recording devices were compared using data collected from pilots during an approximately 60-min flight. The data were simultaneously recorded from the pilots by all 3 recorders. The results show that the devices provide essentially identical heart rate data.

As it is highly desirable to study sleep and to monitor sleep interventions in a realistic setting at home, new mobile approaches with equivalent performance to lab-based systems are needed. We present here the development and evaluation of a mobile system for sleep-biosignal monitoring and real-time intervention for ambulatory sleep research. We evaluated the system for electroencephalogram (EEG) signal quality and compared it to an established sleep EEG recording system. The real-time EEG signal processing performance was evaluated by implementing a closed-loop auditory deep-sleep stimulation algorithm, and we calculated the precision of slow wave (SW) phase targeting during 93 nights. The obtained EEG signals contained similar power spectrograms and high correlations in the delta (0.98) and sigma (0.99) bands when compared to the reference system. The SW phase targeting [mean 44.6 degrees, standard deviation (SD) 46.8 degrees] was comparable to previously published, lab-based approaches. We have, thus, demonstrated that our device is suitable for performing unobtrusive, multinight monitoring and intervention at home.

An OFI-group received OFI extracts (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) 30 min prior to EtOH administration. Behavioral and hematological tests were evaluated 1, 2, 4, and 8 h after EtOH administration. Electroencephalogram (EEG) assessment was also performed. EtOH significantly (p < 0.001) induced psychomotor alterations (reduced locomotion, balance, coordination, muscle strength, and tolerance to cold), compared with control group rats. Pre-treatment with OFI extracts alleviated alterations and also inhibited elevation of blood ethanol levels. EEG (percent of total power for delta, theta, alpha, and beta) results for OFI group rats were similar to control rats, indicating a countering of EtOHinduced EEG changes. Extracts of OFI can be effective for alleviation of psychomotor alterations induced by EtOH administration.

J	Cross, JH				Cross, JH			Topiramate monotherapy for childhood absence seizures: an open label pilot study	SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY			English	Article						epilepsy; childhood absence seizures; EEG; pilot study; topiramate	LAMOTRIGINE; CHILDREN	This open-label, single-site, pilot study evaluated the therapeutic usefulness of topiramate in five children with typical absence seizures defined as loss of awareness associated with 3 Hz spike-wave activity on 24 hour ambulatory electroencephalogram (EEG). The children were previously untreated or treated unsuccessfully using other antiepileptic medication. Topiramate was initiated at a dose of 1 mg kg(-1) day(-1), titrated twice weekly in 1 mg kg(-1) day(-1) increments to 12 mg kg(-1) day(-1) or individual maximally tolerated dose. Response was assessed after 6 weeks with ambulatory EEG monitoring and patient/parent record of seizure counts. All children completed the study. One previously untreated child became seizure-free on 5 mg kg(-1) day(-1) topiramate, with no residual spike-wave activity at the final visit. In two patients, the frequency of seizures decreased in the early phases of titration, but rose to baseline levels as the topiramate dose was increased. With a reduction in dose to 6 mg kg(-1) day(-1), seizure control improved, with substantial reductions in spike-wave activity. Seizure counts were not improved in the two remaining patients. Transient mood changes were noted in two patients. No child was withdrawn secondary to adverse effects. The results suggest that topiramate may be effective in childhood absence epilepsy. Controlled studies are now required to identify the clinically optimal dose. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of BEA Trading Ltd.

Twenty-one patients in the 4-to-17 year age bracket with refractory epilepsies, with 52.3% (n = 11) male and 47.6% (n = 10) female from the Discipline of Neurology of the Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (Federal University of Sao Paulo). Cerebral Holter was carried out with Bioware EEG-2008 of prolonged ambulatory electroencephalographic monitoring equipment. We observed greater frequency of isolated and grouped epileptic discharges in day and in night sleep in relation to awake; day and night sleep led to activation of epileptic discharges, both isolated and grouped. The cerebral Holter was more effective in detecting epileptiform discharges than the routine EEG in 33.33% of the patients, The cerebral Holter proved a useful and precise method in detecting epileptic discharges, as an aid in the assessment of the fluctuations in frequency of paroxysmal activity in children with refractory epilepsies, both in relation to activities in daily life, and to the relation to the biological cycle of sleep and awake.

Nonconvulsive seizures: Developing a rational approach to the diagnosis and management in the critically ill population	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						nonconvulsive seizure; nonconvulsive status epilepticus; critically ill; intensive care unit; EEG; periodic discharges	PERIODIC EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; REFRACTORY STATUS EPILEPTICUS; NEURON-SPECIFIC ENOLASE; INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; TRIPHASIC WAVES; CONTINUOUS EEG; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; CLINICAL-FEATURES; METABOLIC ENCEPHALOPATHY	Originally described in patients with chronic epilepsy, nonconvulsive seizures (NCSs) are being recognized with increasing frequency, both in ambulatory patients with cognitive change, and even more so in the critically ill. In fact, the majority of seizures that occur in the critically ill are nonconvulsive and can only be diagnosed with EEG monitoring. The semiology of NCSs and the associated EEG findings are quite variable. There are a number of periodic, rhythmic or stimulation-related EEG patterns in the critically ill of unclear significance and even less clear treatment implications. The field struggles to develop useful diagnostic criteria for NCSs, to standardize nomenclature for the numerous equivocal patterns, and to devise studies that will help determine which patterns should be treated and how aggressively. This review surveys the evidence for and against NCSs causing neuronal injury, and attempts to develop a rational approach to the diagnosis and management of these seizures, particularly in the encephalopathic population.

In this paper, we report customization of a wireless, ambulatory NeuroMonitor device originally developed for collecting electroencephalogram (EEG) signals as a platform for ECG and HRV data collection. The overall gain is altered to 93.86, while the band pass filter was set to 0.5 Hz to 126 Hz. The four independent inputs were connected to left arm, right arm, left leg and right leg. ECG signal and HRV data was collected during relax state and elevated cognitive load conditions. The signals were digitized at 256 sps and wirelessly transmitted to a remote computer for analysis. These cardiac signals were filtered and plotted using MATLAB. We demonstrate successful data collection that enables multiple applications of NeuroMonitor platform as an ambulatory physiological parameter monitoring hardware for long duration study of patients in natural settings.

EEG-based seizure detection in patients with intellectual disability: Which EEG and clinical factors are important?	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						EEG; Seizure detection; Intellectual disability; Imbalanced data; Post-processing; Multilevel analysis; LDA; SVM	NEONATAL SEIZURE; MENTAL-RETARDATION; AUTOMATIC ONLINE; EPILEPSY; CLASSIFICATION; PREVALENCE; MODELS; PREDICTION; PATTERNS; SYSTEMS	Epilepsy is a commonly secondary disability in people with an intellectual disability (ID), affecting 22% of the ID population while 1% of general population. Surprisingly, EEG-based automated seizure detection in the ID population has not yet been sufficiently studied. The reasons are twofold. Firstly, long-term EEG recordings are few due to behavioral problems. Secondly, the annotation of EEG recordings has been proved difficult due to the complex EEG signal abnormalities caused by brain development disorders. As a result, the performance of automated seizure detection for ID people is largely unknown. In this work, we performed automated seizure detection on a retrospective dataset containing 615 h ambulatory scalp EEG from 29 participants with ID, including 91 seizures. To design a generic seizure detector for the ID people, we need to deal with three major problems: highly imbalanced data, heterogeneous dataset and difficult annotation. (1) For the imbalanced data, we used proper performance criteria (e.g., precision and recall curve) and employed a post-processing process (i.e., patient-specific detection thresholds). (2) For the heterogeneous dataset, we employed multi-domain EEG features that showed a better discriminative power in our dataset, and compared the linear and nonlinear (LDA vs. SVM with Gaussian kernel) classifiers and validated using a leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV). (3) A stepwise EEG annotation procedure was used to improve the accuracy of annotation due to the presence of numerous seizure imitators and unclear contrast between ictal and interictal EEG activities. Results showed that LDA outperformed SVM with a clear margin of sensitivity, and achieved overall sensitivities 63.1-81.3%, a median FD/h of 1.0 and median latency of 11.5 s. Finally, we conclude that EEG signals of the ID population form a heterogeneous entity with respect to important factors: EEG discharge patterns, EEG backgrounds and EEG seizure visibility. The performance of the seizure detection varies significantly with these factors. The results presented here can serve as prior knowledge for designing a generic seizure detector for the ID patients and the non-convulsive seizure states (NCSS). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

To assess the stride-to-stride variation, estimating the dynamical stability discloses the encrypted behavior of the locomotion system, at times facing perturbations, and for that the Largest Lyapunov Exponent is extracted for both Short (lambda(S)) and Long (lambda(L)) term. Information about the complexity of movement further bolsters the variation-driven conclusions which are calculated for Correlation Index and Kolmogorov-Sinai (K-S) entropy. Using gait analysis, knee angular displacement is the considered data tested for different walking speeds. In the result, lambda(S) revealed significant differences between the groups and their walking velocities while lambda(L) failed to represent any distinguishable differences. In contrast to the control group, increases in the walking velocity did not affect the amount of locomotion variability for the patients. The stride features also verified the vicissitudes in the gait pattern of knee OA suffering individuals.

Dynamic Channel Selection to Reduce Computational Burden in Seizure Detection	2010 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	32nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC 10)	AUG 30-SEP 04, 2010	Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)				Ambulatory physiological monitoring devices benefit patients, medical staff and hospitals by allowing patients to return home with the devices for monitoring. The main problem associated with designing such devices is that of power consumption. Wireless communications and complex processing are generally part of such devices and are power hungry components. These problems are magnified when dealing with EEG signals, with relatively high data rates, multiple channels, and advanced signal processing techniques required. This paper proposes a method to dynamically select EEG channels in the REACT seizure detection system based on information already available in the system, hence keeping any added computational complexity very low. Using the techniques computational effort can be reduced by up to 65% with no effect on the REACT seizure detection performance.

Neurophysiological studies provide that human voluntary gait intention is represented by slow DC potentials and power shifts in specific frequency ranges of brain wave, which can be detected 1.5- 2 seconds before the actual onset. The goal of this study was to determine whether it is possible to reliably detect the intention of voluntary gait 'starting' and 'stopping' intention before it takes place. A computational algorithm was designed to implement asynchronous prediction of gait intention in an offline and pseudo-online environment using support vector machine. Six healthy subjects participated in the study and performed self- paced voluntary gait cycles. A combination of advanced wavelet transform algorithms resulted in 88.23 +/- 1.59% accuracy, 85.42 +/- 4.03% sensitivity and 90.24 +/- 2.78% specificity for intention of start detection and 87.04 +/- 1.72% accuracy, 82.69 +/- 4.13% sensitivity and 89.59 +/- 3.04% specificity for intention to stop walking in offline testing. Additionally, the wavelet transform methods accompanied with threshold regulation and majority voting algorithm resulted in a True Positive Rate of 85.5 +/- 5.0% and 81.2 +/- 3.3% for 'start' and 'stop' prediction with 6.8 +/- 0.7 and 9.4 +/- 1.0 False Positives per Minute respectively in pseudo online testing. The average detection latencies were -1002 +/- 603 ms and -943 +/- 603 ms, respectively, for 'start' and 'stop' prediction. The study provides promising outcomes in terms of TPR, FP/min, and detection latency, which suggests that human voluntary gait intention can be predicted before the onset of movement.	[Hasan, S. M.

CORTICAL NEURONAL ACTIVITY DOES NOT REGULATE SLEEP HOMEOSTASIS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cortex; arousal; atropine; c-Fos; homeostasis	LESS-THAN-1 HZ OSCILLATION; BRAIN-STEM; LATERAL HYPOTHALAMUS; MESSENGER-RNA; DELTA-EEG; RAT-BRAIN; BEHAVIOR; WAKING; LESIONS; WAKE	The neural substrate of sleep homeostasis is unclear, but both cortical and subcortical structures are thought to be involved in sleep regulation. To test whether prior neuronal activity in the cortex or in subcortical regions drives sleep rebound, we systemically administered atropine (100 mg/kg) to rats, producing a dissociated state with slow-wave cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) but waking behavior (e.g. locomotion). Atropine injections during the light period produced 6 h of slow-wave cortical EEG but also subcortical arousal. Afterward, rats showed a significant increase in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, compared to the same period on a baseline day. Consistent with the behavioral and cortical EEG state produced by systemic atropine, c-Fos expression was low in the cortex but high in multiple subcortical arousal systems. These data suggest that subcortical arousal and behavior are sufficient to drive sleep homeostasis, while a sleep-like pattern of cortical activity is not sufficient to satisfy sleep homeostasis.

Association Between Positive Occipital Sharp Transients of Sleep and Lambda Waves	CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; POSTS; lambda waves		Positive occipital sharp transients of sleep (POSTS) and lambda waves have similar morphology and location. We studied a possible association between these 2 normal EEG patterns. We reviewed a series of consecutive unselected ambulatory EEGs during a 3-month period (October 16, 2017 to January 19, 2018) and identified records with POSTS and records with lambda waves. Statistical analysis was performed using a chi-square test. A total of 140 ambulatory EEGs were reviewed. Duration of EEGs ranged from 24 to 168 hours (mean 76 hours). The population was 34% males, with ages ranging from 3 to 93 years (mean 48 years). Of the 140 records, 30 were abnormal, including 20 with epileptiform abnormalities. A chi-square test for independence (with Yates continuity correction) indicated a significant association between POSTS and lambda waves, (2)(1, n = 140) = 69.208, p < .001, phi = 0.72. In addition, 100% of records with lambda waves had POSTS, and 72% of records with POSTS had lambda waves. There is a high association between lambda waves and POSTS. This suggests a strong similarity between the 2 waveforms, and possibly a common occipital generator.

As sleep assessments in a lab environment are cumbersome for both the participant and researcher, it would be highly desirable to record sleep EEG with a user-friendly and mobile device. Dry electrodes that are reusable, low-cost, and easy to apply would be an essential component of such a device. In this study, we developed a testing protocol to investigate the performance of novel flat-type dry electrodes for sleep EEG recordings in free-living conditions. Methods: Overnight sleep EEG, electrooculogram and electromyogram of four young and healthy participants were recorded at home. Two identical ambulatory recording devices, one using novel flat-type dry electrodes, the other using self-adhesive pre-gelled electrodes, simultaneously recorded sleep EEG. Between both electrode types, we then compared the signal quality, the incidence of artifacts, the sensitivity, specificity and inter-scoring reliability (Cohen's kappa) of sleep staging, as well as the agreement of important characteristics of sleep-specific EEG microstructure features, such as slow waves (0.5-4 Hz) and sleep spindles (10-16 Hz). Results: Our testing protocol comprehensively compared the two electrode types on a macro- and microstructure level of sleep. The dry and pre-gelled electrodes both had comparable signal quality and sleep staging was feasible with both electrodes. Also, slow-wave and spindle characteristics were similar. However, sweat artifacts were more prevalent in the flat-type dry electrodes. Conclusion: With a reliable testing protocol, the performance of dry electrodes can be compared to reference technologies and objectively assessed also in free-living conditions.

The algorithm proposes a unique mathematical use of Walsh-transformed EEG signals to identify those criteria that best define the morphologic characteristics of interictal spikes. EEG recordings were accomplished using the 10-20 system interfaced with the Electrical Source Imaging System with 256 channels (ESI-256) for enhanced preprocessing and on-line monitoring and visualization. The merits of the algorithm are: (1) its computational simplicity; (2) its integrated design that identifies and localizes interictal spikes while automatically removing or discarding the presence of different artifacts such as electromyography, electrocardiography, and eye blinks; and (3) its potential implication to other types of EEG analysis, given the mathematical basis of this algorithm, which can be patterned or generalized to other brain dysfunctions. The mathematics that were applied here assumed a dual role, that of transforming EEG signals into mutually independent bases and in ascertaining quantitative measures for those morphologic characteristics deemed important in the identification process of interictal spikes. Clinical experiments involved 31 patients with focal epilepsy. EEG data collected from 10 of these patients were used initially in a training phase to ascertain the reliability of the observable and formulated features that were used in the spike detection process. Three EEG experts annotated spikes independently. On evaluation of the algorithm using the 21 remaining patients in the testing phase revealed a precision (positive predictive value) of 92% and a sensitivity of 82%. Based on the 20- to 30-minute epochs of continuous EEG recording per subject, the false detection rate is estimated at 1.8 per hour of continuous EEG. These are positive results that support further development of this algorithm for prolonged EEG recordings on ambulatory subjects and to serve as a support mechanism to the decisions made by EEG experts.

To assess the performance of EEG and ECG signals, AI systems offer a promising way forward for developing high performing models in securing both a reasonable sensitivity and specificity. There are crucial needs for these AI systems to be developed with more clinical relevance and inference generalization. In this work, we implement an ECG-specific convolutional neural network (CNN) model with residual layers and an EEG-specific convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) model. We trained, validated, and tested these models on a publicly accessible Temple University Hospital (TUH) dataset for reproducibility and performed a non-patient-specific inference-only test on patient EEG and ECG data of The Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPAH) in Sydney, Australia. We selected 31 adult patients to balance groups with the following seizure types: generalized, frontal, frontotemporal, temporal, parietal, and unspecific focal epilepsy. Our tests on both EEG and ECG of these patients achieve an AUC score of 0.75. Our results show ECG outperforms EEG with an average improvement of 0.21 and 0.11 AUC score in patients with frontal and parietal focal seizures, respectively. Clinical relevance- Prior research has demonstrated the value of using ECG for seizure documentation. It is believed that specific epileptic foci (seizure origin) may involve network inputs to the autonomic nervous system. Our result indicates that ECG could outperform EEG for individuals with specific seizure origin, particularly in the frontal and parietal lobes.

This study aims to propose and validate a subject-specific approach to recognize two different cognitive neural states (relax and pedaling motor imagery (MI)) by selecting the relevant electroencephalogram (EEG) channels. The main aims of the proposed work are: (i) to reduce the computational complexity of the BCI systems during MI detection by selecting the relevant EEG channels, (ii) to reduce the amount of data overfitting that may arise due to unnecessary channels and redundant features, and (iii) to reduce the classification time for real-time BCI applications. Approach. The proposed method selects subject-specific EEG channels and features based on their MI. In this work, we make use of non-negative matrix factorization to extract the weight of the EEG channels based on their contribution to MI detection. Further, the neighborhood component analysis is used for subject-specific feature selection. Main results. We executed the experiments using EEG signals recorded for MI where ten healthy subjects performed MI movement of the lower limb to generate motor commands. An average accuracy of 96.66%, average true positive rate (TPR) of 97.77%, average false positives rate of 4.44%, and average Kappa of 93.33% were obtained. The proposed subject-specific EEG channel selection based MI recognition system provides 13.20% improvement in detection accuracy, and 27% improvement in Kappa value with less number of EEG channels compared to the results obtained using all EEG channels. Significance. The proposed subject-specific BCI system has been found significantly advantageous compared to the typical approach of using a fixed channel configuration. This work shows that fewer EEG channels not only reduce computational complexity and processing time (two times faster) but also improve the MI detection performance. The proposed method selects EEG locations related to the foot movement, which may be relevant for neuro-rehabilitation using lower-limb movements that may provide a real-time and more natural interface between patient and robotic device.

Removal of Movement Artifact From High-Density EEG Recorded During Walking and Running	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LONG-RANGE CORRELATIONS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; STRIDE INTERVAL; DYNAMICS; FMRI; GAIT; SEPARATION; QUALITY	Gwin JT, Gramann K, Makeig S, Ferris DP. Removal of movement artifact from high-density EEG recorded during walking and running. J Neurophysiol 103: 3526-3534, 2010. First published April 21, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.00105.2010. Although human cognition often occurs during dynamic motor actions, most studies of human brain dynamics examine subjects in static seated or prone conditions. EEG signals have historically been considered to be too noise prone to allow recording of brain dynamics during human locomotion. Here we applied a channel-based artifact template regression procedure and a subsequent spatial filtering approach to remove gait-related movement artifact from EEG signals recorded during walking and running. We first used stride time warping to remove gait artifact from high-density EEG recorded during a visual oddball discrimination task performed while walking and running. Next, we applied infomax independent component analysis (ICA) to parse the channel-based noise reduced EEG signals into maximally independent components (ICs) and then performed component-based template regression. Applying channel-based or channel-based plus component-based artifact rejection significantly reduced EEG spectral power in the 1.5- to 8.5-Hz frequency range during walking and running. In walking conditions, gait-related artifact was insubstantial: event-related potentials (ERPs), which were nearly identical to visual oddball discrimination events while standing, were visible before and after applying noise reduction. In the running condition, gait-related artifact severely compromised the EEG signals: stable average ERP time-courses of IC processes were only detectable after artifact removal. These findings show that high-density EEG can be used to study brain dynamics during whole body movements and that mechanical artifact from rhythmic gait events may be minimized using a template regression procedure.

Performance of an Ambulatory Dry-EEG Device for Auditory Closed- Loop Stimulation of Sleep Slow Oscillations in the Home Environment	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ambulatory sleep device; automatic sleep-staging; closed-loop stimulation; EEG wearable; sleep monitoring; sleep device; N3 sleep; slow-wave sleep	WAVE SLEEP; VALIDATION; CLASSIFICATION; CONSOLIDATION; RECHTSCHAFFEN; RELIABILITY; HEADBAND; BRAIN; KALES	Recent research has shown that auditory closed-loop stimulation can enhance sleep slow oscillations (SO) to improve N3 sleep quality and cognition. Previous studies have been conducted in lab environments. The present study aimed to validate and assess the performance of a novel ambulatory wireless dry-EEG device (WDD), for auditory closed-loop stimulation of SO during N3 sleep at home. The performance of the WDD to detect N3 sleep automatically and to send auditory closed-loop stimulation on SO were tested on 20 young healthy subjects who slept with both the WDD and a miniaturized polysomnography (part 1) in both stimulated and sham nights within a double blind, randomized and crossover design. The effects of auditory closed-loop stimulation on delta power increase were assessed after one and 10 nights of stimulation on an observational pilot study in the home environment including 90 middle-aged subjects (part 2). The first part, aimed at assessing the quality of the WDD as compared to a polysomnograph, showed that the sensitivity and specificity to automatically detect N3 sleep in real-time were 0.70 and 0.90, respectively. The stimulation accuracy of the SO ascending-phase targeting was 45 +/- 52 degrees. The second part of the study, conducted in the home environment, showed that the stimulation protocol induced an increase of 43.9% of delta power in the 4 s window following the first stimulation (including evoked potentials and SO entrainment effect). The increase of SO response to auditory stimulation remained at the same level after 10 consecutive nights. The WDD shows good performances to automatically detect in real-time N3 sleep and to send auditory closed-loop stimulation on SO accurately. These stimulation increased the SO amplitude during N3 sleep without any adaptation effect after 10 consecutive nights. This tool provides new perspectives to figure out novel sleep EEG biomarkers in longitudinal studies and can be interesting to conduct broad studies on the effects of auditory stimulation during sleep.

Decoding Intra-Limb and Inter-Limb Kinematics During Treadmill Walking From Scalp Electroencephalographic (EEG) Signals	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Biological system modeling; brain-computer interfaces (BMIs); decoding; neural prosthesis	BRAIN ACTIVATION; GAIT; PHASE; PARAMETERS; MOVEMENTS; EXERCISE; SPEED; TIME	Brain-machine interface (BMI) research has largely been focused on the upper limb. Although restoration of gait function has been a long-standing focus of rehabilitation research, surprisingly very little has been done to decode the cortical neural networks involved in the guidance and control of bipedal locomotion. A notable exception is the work by Nicolelis' group at Duke University that decoded gait kinematics from chronic recordings from ensembles of neurons in primary sensorimotor areas in rhesus monkeys. Recently, we showed that gait kinematics from the ankle, knee, and hip joints during human treadmill walking can be inferred from the electroencephalogram (EEG) with decoding accuracies comparable to those using intracortical recordings. Here we show that both intra- and inter-limb kinematics from human treadmill walking can be achieved with high accuracy from as few as 12 electrodes using scalp EEG. Interestingly, forward and backward predictors from EEG signals lagging or leading the kinematics, respectively, showed different spatial distributions suggesting distinct neural networks for feedforward and feedback control of gait. Of interest is that average decoding accuracy across subjects and decoding modes was similar to 0.68 +/- 0.08, supporting the feasibility of EEG-based BMI systems for restoration of walking in patients with paralysis.

On the other hand, cholinergic transmission is modulated by neighbouring histaminergic neurons via H(1), H(2) and H(3) receptors. Dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons are also involved in these modulatory mechanisms. Furthermore, the release of histamine is modulated by glutamatergic neurons and nitric oxide of neuronal origin. The release of histamine in the brain oscillates according to circadian, slow ultradian and fast ultradian rhythms. Ultradian fluctuations have also been observed in the theta- and delta-frequency bands of the EEG spectral power. Simultaneous recordings of histamine outflow and EEG in the hypothalamus revealed that the ultradian histamine release rhythm coincides temporally with ultradian fluctuations in the EEG spectral power. Histamine receptor ligands used in pharmaco therapy, like H, and H, antagonists, modify the frequency of the EEG fluctuations. Brain histamine seems to be involved in memory processes, since inhibition of histamine synthesis deteriorates, while H, antagonists, histamine and histidine improve short-term memory. The latter finding may open new horizons in pharmacological treatment of memory disorders. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

NEUROLOGY			English	Article							COMPETENCE ACC/AHA COMMITTEE; ASIM TASK-FORCE; AMBULATORY ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY; ECG INTERPRETATION; NORMAL ADULTS; EPILEPSY; MISDIAGNOSIS; STATEMENT; PATTERNS; PHYSICIANS	The misdiagnosis of epilepsy is common and has serious consequences. A major contributor to the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is the tendency to overread normal EEGs as abnormal. In fact, the wrong diagnosis of seizures is sometimes based solely on the "abnormal" EEG. Reasons for the common overinterpretation of normal EEGs are mostly related to the lack of standards or mandatory training in EEG, and the erroneous assumption that all neurologists are trained to read EEGs. The most common overread pattern consists of benign, nonspecific, sharply contoured temporal transients. In particular, there is a common misconception that "phase reversals" are indicative of abnormality. Potential solutions include defining and ensuring EEG competency of neurologists who read EEGs, and perhaps providing a confirmatory reading by an electroenceph-alographer, as is done for EKGs.

Asynchronous Detection of Trials Onset from Raw EEG Signals	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Event-related potentials; brain-computer interface; brain area network; EEG teleservices; e-health	FUZZY SYNCHRONIZATION LIKELIHOOD; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; AMBULATORY EEG; BRAIN; VIDEO; HOME; METHODOLOGY; DIAGNOSIS; TELEMETRY; DISORDER	Clinical processing of event-related potentials (ERPs) requires a precise synchrony between the stimulation and the acquisition units that are guaranteed by means of a physical link between them. This precise synchrony is needed since temporal misalignments during trial averaging can lead to high deviations of peak times, thus causing error in diagnosis or inefficiency in classification in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Out of the laboratory, mobile EEG systems and BCI headsets are not provided with the physical link, thus being inadequate for acquisition of ERPs. In this study, we propose a method for the asynchronous detection of trials onset from raw EEG without physical links. We validate it with a BCI application based on the dichotic listening task. The user goal was to attend the cued auditory message and to report three keywords contained in it while ignoring the other message. The BCI goal was to detect the attended message from the analysis of auditory ERPs. The rate of successful onset detection in both synchronous (using the real onset) and asynchronous (blind detection of trial onset from raw EEG) was 73% with a synchronization error of less than 1 ms. The level of synchronization provided by this proposal would allow home-based acquisition of ERPs with low cost BCI headsets and any media player unit without physical links between them.

Quantification of arousals therefore makes an important contribution to the overall assessment of the sleep of a child with suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or other sleep disorders. Arousals are classically defined by changes in the electroencephalographic (EEG) channels, but most arousals in children involve body movement in addition to EEG changes. Several methods of quantifying arousals without the use of EEG have been proposed, with the aim of simplifying testing in children with suspected OSA so that it can be safely and efficiently performed in the child's home.

This was accomplished with a prospective study of children aged 6-14 years consecutively admitted to our center. Of 362 patients, 44 (12.2%) had previously been diagnosed with ADHD. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory EEG recording and assessment of ADHD according to DSM-IV were performed in 46 children suspected of having ADHD. ADHD was diagnosed in 30. We could not find any correlation between the spike index in 8 children with FNEA and the severity of their ADHD symptoms. This study is underpowered and should be considered a pilot study. There is a need for further investigation of a possible causal effect of FNEA on ADHD symptoms in larger cohorts of patients with FNEA. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Although different monitoring systems estimating antinociception effect during general anesthesia are available, the performance of these indices is limited. The aim of this study was to develop a predictive model of the probability of movement if a standardized tetanic stimulation is applied to the patient, using the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal as input. Seventy-seven female patients, scheduled for ambulatory gynecologic surgical procedures under general anesthesia, were included. EEG segments of 45s, preceding tetanic stimulation, were split into epochs of 5s with no overlapping. Features from both time and frequency domain, including continuous wavelet transform (CWT), were considered. Five different machine learning (ML) models were tested: 1D CNN model for raw EEG signal, random forest classifier, XGBoost classifier and support vector classifier for extracted features and finally 2D CNN model for CWT scalogram. The results showed that the performance of the proposed ML models to predict movement to standardized tetanic stimulation through the EEG signal was almost equal to the performance of commercially available indices (AUC=0.73). This performance was improved (AUC=0.84) with ML methods in ensemble mode with pupil diameter and remifentanil effect site concentration. Indeed, prediction of movement to noxious stimulation through the EEG signal matches state of the art and could potentially be used in combination of other variables.

A crucial and important block of this acquisition system is the analog readout front-end. We have implemented a low-power and low-noise readout front-end with configurable characteristics for Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), and Electromyogram (EMG) signals. Key to its performance is the new AC-coupled chopped instrumentation amplifier (ACCIA), which uses a low power current feedback instrumentation amplifier (U). Thus, while chopping filters the 1/f noise of CMOS transistors and increases the CMRR, AC coupling is capable of rejecting differential electrode offset (DEO) up to +/- 50 mV from conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes. The ACCIA achieves 120 dB CMRR and 57 nV/root Hz input-referred voltage noise density, while consuming 11.1 mu A from a 3 V supply. The chopping spike filter (CSF) stage filters the chopping spikes generated by the input chopper of ACCIA and the digitally controllable variable gain stage is used to set the gain and the bandwidth of the front-end. The front-end is implemented in a 0.5 mu m CMOS process. Total current consumption is 20 mu A from 3V.

Cognitive effects of interictal epileptiform discharges in children	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Epilepsy; Child; EEG; Spike; Epileptiform; Cognition	BENIGN CHILDHOOD EPILEPSY; EEG DISCHARGES; CENTROTEMPORAL SPIKES; IMPAIRMENT; SLEEP; PERCEPTION; SEIZURES; FOCUS	Frequent interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) may have effects on cognition. We analysed a group of 182 children with different epilepsy syndromes, all of whom had IEDs that did not result in observed seizures, with 24-h ambulatory EEG and cognitive tests. The IED index was estimated, in wakefulness and in sleep, as percentage of time in five categories (0%, <1%, 1-10%, >= 10-50% and >= 50%). IEDs were defined as spikes or spike-wave complexes, isolated or occurring serially (in runs) without evident clinical signs of a seizure. The IED categories were correlated to cognitive test results and epilepsy characteristics. The group of patients with diurnal IEDs in >= 10% of the EEG record showed impaired central information processing speed, short-term verbal memory and visual-motor integration. This effect was seen independently from other EEG-related and epilepsy-related characteristics, and independently from epilepsy syndrome diagnosis. The impact of the nocturnal IEDs was of less importance; only contributing partially to the slowing of central information processing speed. We conclude that frequent IEDs (in more than 10% of the record) in the awake EEG can impair cognitive performance in children. Whether children with a high diurnal spike frequency and low seizure frequency can benefit from antiepileptic treatment should be examined in controlled trials.

The prevalence of epilepsy is higher in developing countries, where medical facilities are illequipped and under-staffed. Mobile EEG devices promise a new dawn for long-term ambulatory EEG monitoring, which has a potential to revolutionize health care for neurological disorders especially epilepsy. Increasing the outreach to underserved communities and continuous monitoring of patients will yield vast amount of data. This requires the development of a method that can mark regions of interest, to aid in the evaluation of the EEG trial by the experts. Such an experimental setting calls for an unsupervised method, which can detect seizure regions with high accuracy. This paper focuses on the development of a seizure detection method with the above-stated characteristics. Group invariant scattering, a novel data representation technique, has been used for feature extraction. Tested on CHB-MIT data set, the proposed methodology outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches under similar testing conditions, by successfully detecting 180 out of 197 seizures.

Design: Patients with PI were randomly assigned to CBT or a placebo intervention (PC). Ambulatory polysomnography was performed before and after treatment. Setting: University medical center sleep laboratory. Participants: Thirty PI patients with sleep maintenance difficulty evident in subjective sleep measures. Interventions: CBT and PC. Results: CBT led to a more rapid decline in EEG delta power over the night, compared with PC. This change was associated with subjective improvement in response to CBT. Furthermore, lower pretreatment peak EEG delta power in the first NREM cycle and a more gradual decline in delta power predicted a better response to CBT. Increased wake time during the day produced by CBT was correlated with an increase in the steepness of the slope of EEG delta power and subjective improvement. Traditional polysomnography measures were associated with the subjective CBT response to a greater degree among patients whose total sleep time estimates better approximated polysomnography-derived total sleep time. In contrast, changes in all-night averaged NREM EEG spectral indices were more strongly related to subjective improvement in individuals who underestimated total sleep time to a greater extent. Conclusions: CBT led to a more rapid decline in EEG delta power over the night. This change is linked to the therapeutic effect of CBT, which appears to occur in conjunction with an increase in homeostatic sleep drive. Traditional polysomnography indices and all-night averaged NREM EEG measures appear to be related to subjective improvements with CBT in subsets of patients with PI.

However, the utilization of this technology has found news applications, such as increasing human capacities. Nowadays, several researchers are working on probing human capabilities to control several robotic devices simultaneously. The design of BCI is an intricate work that needs a long time to its implementation. For this reason, an architecture to design and implement different types of BCIs is presented in this article. The architecture has a modular design capable of reading various electroencephalography (EEG) sensors and controlling several robotic devices similar to the plug-and-play paradigm. To test the proposed architecture, a BCI was able to manage a hexapod robot and a drone was implemented. Firstly, a mobile robotic platform was designed and implemented. The BCI is based on eye blinking, where a single blinking represents a robot command. The command orders the robot to initiate or stops their locomotion for the hexapod robot. For the drone, a blink represents the takeoff or landing order. The blinking signals are obtained from the prefrontal and frontal regions of the head by EEG sensors. The signals are then filtered using temporal filters, with cutoff frequencies based on delta, theta, alpha, and beta waves. The filtered signals were labeled and used to train a classifier based on the multilayer perceptron (MLP) model. To generate the robot command, the proposal BCI used two models of MLP to ensure the classifier prediction. So, when the two classifiers make the same prediction, within a defined time interval, send the signal to the robot to start or stop its movement. The obtained results show that it is possible to get high precision to control the hexapod robot with a precision of 91.7% and an average of 81.4%.

Using Wearable Sensors for Semiology-Independent Seizure Detection - Towards Ambulatory Monitoring of Epilepsy	2015 37TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 25-29, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			ELECTRODERMAL ACTIVITY	Epilepsy is a disease of the central nervous system. Nearly 70% of people with epilepsy respond to a proper treatment, but for a successful therapy of epilepsy, physicians need to know if and when seizures occur. The gold standard diagnosis tool video-electroencephalography (vEEG) requires patients to stay at hospital for several days. A wearable sensor system, e.g. a wristband, serving as diagnostic tool or event monitor, would allow unobtrusive ambulatory long-term monitoring while reducing costs. Previous studies showed that seizures with motor symptoms such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures can be detected by measuring the electrodermal activity (EDA) and motion measuring acceleration (ACC). In this study, EDA and ACC from 8 patients were analyzed. In extension to previous studies, different types of seizures, including seizures without motor activity, were taken into account. A hierarchical classification approach was implemented in order to detect different types of epileptic seizures using data from wearable sensors. Using a k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier an overall sensitivity of 89.1% and an overall specificity of 93.1% were achieved, for seizures without motor activity the sensitivity was 97.1% and the specificity was 92.9%. The presented method is a first step towards a reliable ambulatory monitoring system for epileptic seizures with and without motor activity.

Hyperactivity and Hypermotivation Associated With Increased Striatal mGluR1 Signaling in a Shank2 Rat Model of Autism	FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						SHANK; Shank2; autism spectrum disorders; rat model; mGluR; motivation	METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; SPECTRUM DISORDER; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; REPETITIVE BEHAVIORS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; MOUSE MODELS; MICE; EXPRESSION; HIPPOCAMPUS; PERFORMANCE	Mutations in the SHANK family of genes have been consistently identified in genetic and genomic screens of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The functional overlap of SHANK with several other ASD-associated genes suggests synaptic dysfunction as a convergent mechanism of pathophysiology in ASD. Although many ASD-related mutations result in alterations to synaptic function, the nature of those dysfunctions and the consequential behavioral manifestations are highly variable when expressed in genetic mouse models. To investigate the phylogenetic conservation of phenotypes resultant of Shank2 loss-of-function in a translationally relevant animal model, we generated and characterized a novel transgenic rat with a targeted mutation of the Shank2 gene, enabling an evaluation of gene-associated phenotypes, the elucidation of complex behavioral phenotypes, and the characterization of potential translational biomarkers. The Shank2 loss-of-function mutation resulted in a notable phenotype of hyperactivity encompassing hypermotivation, increased locomotion, and repetitive behaviors. Mutant rats also expressed deficits in social behavior throughout development and in the acquisition of operant tasks. The hyperactive phenotype was associated with an upregulation of mGluR1 expression, increased dendritic branching, and enhanced long-term depression (LTD) in the striatum but opposing morphological and cellular alterations in the hippocampus (HP). Administration of the mGluR1 antagonist JNJ16259685 selectively normalized the expression of striatally mediated repetitive behaviors and physiology but had no effect on social deficits. Finally, Shank2 mutant animals also exhibited alterations in electroencephalography (EEG) spectral power and event-related potentials, which may serve as translatable EEG biomarkers of synaptopathic alterations. Our results show a novel hypermotivation phenotype that is unique to the rat model of Shank2 dysfunction, in addition to the traditional hyperactive and repetitive behaviors observed in mouse models. The hypermotivated and hyperactive phenotype is associated with striatal dysfunction, which should be explored further as a targetable mechanism for impairment in ASD.

Utilizing an ambulatory EEG monitoring combined with an auditory-based vigilance test, this method acquires both behavioral response (i.e., reaction time) and EEG waveforms that are simultaneously analyzed to produce a time-varying EEG-based Drowsiness-Sleepiness Index (DSI). DSI index is computed from the time-varying power spectrum of EEG using an algorithm whose coefficients were determined based on an optimization procedure that maximized the correlation between the time profiles of DSI and those of the behavioral response. Sleepiness is quantified using an algorithm based on the consistency of the neuro-behavioral indices over the test period as well as the degree and profile of their degradation when the subject is incapable of maintaining alertness. This test was administered to 5 volunteers (separate from the subjects whose data were used for the above optimization of DSI) under the conditions of adequate prior night sleep and sleep restriction. Cross correlation analysis showed a close agreement between the time profiles of EEG-based DSI and behavioral response indices. Statistical analysis showed significant difference between the alert and sleepy conditions for the whole group as well as in each individual subject.

J	Liu, HS; Zhang, T; Yang, FS				Liu, HS; Zhang, T; Yang, FS			A multistage, multimethod approach for automatic detection and classification of epileptiform EEG	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						adaptive filtering; artificial neural network; electroencephalogram (EEG); epilepsy; wavelet transform	EPILEPTOGENIC SHARP TRANSIENTS; SEIZURE DETECTION; NEURAL-NETWORK; SPIKE DETECTION; WAVELET ANALYSIS; RECOGNITION; SYSTEM; SIGNAL	An efficient system for detection of epileptic activity in ambulatory electroencephalogram (EEG) must be sensitive to abnormalities while keeping the false-detection rate to a low level. Such requirements could be fulfilled neither by single stage nor by simple method strategy, due to the extreme variety of EEG morphologies and frequency of artifacts. The present study proposes a robust system that combines multiple signal-processing methods in a multistage scheme, integrating adaptive filtering, wavelet transform, artificial neural network, and expert system. The system consists of two main stages: a preliminary screening stage in which data are reduced significantly, followed by an analytical stage. Unlike most systems that merely focus on sharp transients, our system also takes into account slow waves. A nonlinear filter for separation of nonstationary and stationary EEG components is also developed in this paper. The system was evaluated on testing data from 81 patients, totaling more than 800 hours of recordings. 90.0% of the epileptic events were correctly detected. The detection rate of sharp transients was 98.0% and overall false-detection rate was 6.1%. We conclude that our system has good performance in detecting epileptiform activities and the multistage multimethod approach is an appropriate way of solving this problem.

We examined whether two spectral analysis sleep measures, delta and beta power, were related to menopausal status. Design: The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) Sleep Study compared cross-sectionally spectral sleep measures in women in different stages of menopause. Setting: Sleep EEG was recorded in the participants' homes with ambulatory recorders. Participants: A multi-ethnic cohort of premenopausal and early perimenopausal (n = 189), late perimenopausal (n = 73), and postmenopausal (n = 59) women. Measurements: EEG power in the delta and beta frequency bands was calculated for all night NREM and all night REM sleep. Physical, medical, psychological, and socioeconomic data were collected from questionnaires and diaries. Results: Beta EEG power in NREM and REM sleep in late perimenopausal and postmenopausal women exceeded that in pre- and early perimenopausal women. Neither all night delta power nor the trend in delta power across the night differed by menopausal status. In a multivariate model that controlled for the physical, demographic, behavioral, psychological, and health-related changes that accompany menopause, beta power in both NREM and REM sleep EEG was significantly related to menopausal status. The frequency of hot flashes explained part but not all of the relation of beta power to menopausal status. Conclusions: Elevated beta EEG power in late perimenopausal and postmenopausal women provides an objective measure of disturbed sleep quality in these women. Elevated beta EEG activity suggests that arousal level during sleep is higher in these women.

Earlier evidence of human efficacy can be of value for decision making, and EEG surrogate endpoints can be of value in this respect. Studies of spontaneous EEG discharges under standard recording conditions can demonstrate meaningful acute EEG effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). These require a rapidly effective formulation of the product, preferably intravenous. The EEG recording conditions are standardised and the subject is required to perform a task to maintain a constant level of vigilance. The outcome measure of efficacy is spike count per minute or, if the discharges are more protracted (as generalised no spike and wave), the percentage of recording time occupied by discharges. Sub-acute experiments are conducted under less rigorously standardised conditions, but over longer periods, using ambulatory monitoring or telemetry to record the EEG. The photoparoxysmal responses (PPRs) of photosensitive subjects, evoked using a standardised stimulation protocol, are subject to less variability than spontaneous epileptiform activity. The PPR is elicited over a range of flash rates that can be used as a measure of sensitivity, and an effective treatment will reduce the range or abolish the PPR. Reduction in photosensitivity is demonstrable after a single dose of various AEDs, at clinically relevant plasma concentrations, even using drugs that are not generally effective for long-term treatment of photosensitive epilepsy. Evoked potential and nerve conduction studies and electronystagmography can be used to assess possible neurotoxicity, and quantitative EEG analysis can be employed to assess sedative effects.

In recent studies, the importance of developing driver fatigue countermeasure devices has been stressed, in order to help prevent driving accidents and errors. Although numerous physiological indicators are available to describe an individual's level of alertness, the EEG signal has been shown to be one of the most predictive and reliable, since it is a direct measure of brain activity. In the present study multichannel EEG data that were collected from 20 sleep-deprived subjects during real environmental conditions of driving are presented for the first time. EEG data's annotation made by two independent Medical Doctors revealed an increase of slowing activity and an acute increase of the alpha waves 5-10 seconds before driving events. From the EEG data that were collected, the Relative Band Ratio (RBR) of the EEG frequency bands, the Shannon Entropy, and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Entropy were estimated for each one second segment. The mean values of these measurements were estimated for 5 minutes periods. Analysis revealed a significant increase of alpha waves relevant band ratios (RBR), a decrease of gamma waves RBI; and a significant decrease of KL entropy when the first and the last 5-min periods were compared. A rapid decrease of both Shannon and K-L entropies was observed just before the driving events. Conclusively, EEG can assess effectively the brain activity alterations that occur a few seconds before sleeping/drowsiness events in driving, and its quantitative measurements can be used as potential sleepiness indicators for future development of driver fatigue countermeasure devices.

Yield of Outpatient Sleep EEG for Epileptiform Alterations' Detection in Children	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Sleep EEG; Epileptiform; Yield; Epilepsy; Pediatric	CYCLIC ALTERNATING PATTERN; GENERALIZED EPILEPSY; INFANTILE SPASMS; SEIZURES; ABNORMALITIES; DEPRIVATION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; TERMINOLOGY; DISCHARGES; MODULATION	Purpose: Ambulatory EEGs in children are frequently ordered as sleep studies. However, the yield according to different clinical situations has received little attention to date. The authors aimed to quantify the added value in terms of detection of epileptiform features of an EEG containing sleep, as compared with only wakefulness, according to the referral diagnoses. Methods: The authors retrospectively selected consecutive outpatients' EEG recordings of patients between 6 months to 16 years old, performed between January 2014 and February 2015. The authors excluded those lacking at least 10 minutes of waking and/or at least 5 minutes of behavioral sleep. Interictal epileptiform activity (IEA) in wakefulness and sleep was compared among referral suspected diagnoses. Additional yield of sleep was considered if at least one of the following was observed: appearance of interictal epileptiform activity or increase by.50%; interictal epileptiform activity change in localization or morphology, seizure occurrence. Results: A total of 425 recordings (mean age 6.9 +/- 4.7 years) were analyzed. Of them, 194 (45.6%) presented an additional yield during sleep, which was dependent on the occurrence of IEA during wakefulness: 77/251 (30.7%) in those without versus 117/174 (67.2%) in those with wakefulness IEA (P<0.001, chi(2)). The yield was markedly lower in studies performed for nonepileptic referral diagnoses (7% vs. 43% to 100%; P<0.001, Fisher). Conclusions: When wakefulness EEG lacks epileptiform features, the yield of sleep EEG in our pediatric population appeared modest, especially in patients without a suspected epileptic syndrome. This information may be used to optimize the request of sleep EEG in children.

Topographic Differences in the Adolescent Maturation of the Slow Wave EEG during NREM Sleep	SLEEP			English	Article						Adolescence; sleep; pruning; maturation; FFT; longitudinal	REM-SLEEP; DEVELOPMENTAL-CHANGES; AMPLITUDE ANALYSIS; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; SYNAPTIC DENSITY; HEALTHY-CHILDREN; BRAIN MATURATION; MIDDLE AGE; DELTA; POWER	Study Objectives: Our ongoing longitudinal study has shown that NREM delta (1-4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) power measured at C3 and C4 decrease by more than 60% between ages 11 and 17 years. Here, we investigate the age trajectories of delta and theta power at frontal, central, and occipital electrodes. Design: Baseline sleep EEG was recorded twice yearly for 6 years in 2 cohorts, spanning ages 9-18 years, with overlap at 12-15 years. Setting: Sleep EEG was recorded in the subjects' homes with ambulatory recorders. Participants: Sixty-seven subjects in 2 cohorts, one starting at age 9 (n = 30) and one at age 12 years (n = 37). Measurements and Results: Sleep EEG recorded from Fz, Cz, C3, C4, and O1 was referred to mastoids. Visual scoring and artifact elimination was followed by FFT power analysis. Delta and theta EEG power declined steeply across this age range. The maturational trajectories of delta power showed a "back to front" pattern, with O1 delta power declining earliest and Fz delta power declining latest. Theta EEG power did not show this topographic difference in the timing of its decline. Delta, and to a lesser extent, theta power became frontally dominant in early adolescence. Conclusions: We maintain our interpretation that the adolescent decline in EEG power reflects a widespread brain reorganization driven by synaptic pruning. The late decline in frontally recorded delta power indicates that plasticity is maintained in these circuits until a later age. Although delta and theta have similar homeostatic properties, they have different age and topographic patterns that imply different functional correlates.

With real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enabling online monitoring of emotion-related areas, such as the amygdala, many have begun testing its therapeutic benefits. However, most existing NF procedures still use monotonic uni-modal interfaces, thus possibly limiting user engagement and weakening learning efficiency. The current study tested a novel multi-sensory NF animated scenario (AS) aimed at enhancing user experience and improving learning. We examined whether relative to a simple uni-modal 2D interface, learning via an interface of complex multi-modal 3D scenario will result in improved NF learning. As a neural-probe, we used the recently developed fMRI-inspired EEG model of amygdala activity ("amygdala-EEG finger print"; amygdala-EFP), enabling low-cost and mobile limbic NF training. Amygdala-EFP was reflected in the AS by the unrest level of a hospital waiting room in which virtual characters become impatient, approach the admission desk and complain loudly. Successful downregulation was reflected as an ease in the room unrest level. We tested whether relative to a standard uni-modal 2D graphic thermometer (TM) interface, this AS could facilitate more effective learning and improve the training experience. Thirty participants underwent two separated NF sessions (1 week apart) practicing downregulation of the amygdala-EFP signal. In the first session, half trained via the AS and half via a TM interface. Learning efficiency was tested by three parameters: (a) effect size of the change in amygdala-EFP following training, (b) sustainability of the learned downregulation in the absence of online feedback, and (c) transferability to an unfamiliar context. Comparing amygdala-EFP signal amplitude between the last and the first NF trials revealed that the AS produced a higher effect size. In addition, NF via the AS showed better sustainability, as indicated by a no-feedback trial conducted in session 2 and better transferability to a new unfamiliar interface. Lastly, participants reported that the AS was more engaging and more motivating than the TM. Together, these results demonstrate the promising potential of integrating realistic virtual environments in NF to enhance learning and improve user's experience.

Recent epidemiological studies have shown that air pollution is associated with stroke. In the present study we aimed to investigate the probable protective effects of gallic acid (GA) on blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, brain oxidative stress, anxiety, depression, locomotion behaviors, and changes of hippocampal local electroencephalogram (local EEG) power induced by 4-vessel transient occlusion (4VO I/R) following exposure to dusty PM in rats. Male Wistar rats were divided randomly into eight groups: (1) vehicle+Sham (Veh + Sh), (2) vehicle+4VO I/R (Veh + I/R), (3) gallic acid+sham (GA + Sh), (4) gallic acid+4VO I/R (GA + I/R), (5) vehicle+PM (Veh + PM), (6) PM + 4VO I/R (PM + I/R), (7) gallic acid+PM + Sham (GA + PM + Sh), and (8) gallic acid+PM + 4Vo I/R (GA + PM + I/R). 4VO type of I/R was induced after 10 days of pretreatment by GA 100 mg/kg/2 ml/ip, or 2 ml/kg/ip, normal saline as vehicle (Veh) and exposure to dust storm composed of dusty PM (DPM, 2000-8000 mu g/m3), 60 min daily for consecutive 10 days) simultaneously. Seventy-two hours after I/R induction, all behavioral tests and BBB permeability evaluation were done. Hippocampus local EEG was recorded just before and 72 h after I/R induction, and finally brain tissue oxidative stress was assayed. Data showed that 4VO I/R following exposure to DPM increased BBB permeability (p < 0.001), brain oxidative stress (p < 0.001), induced anxiety (p < 0.001), depression (p < 0.01), locomotion impairment (p < 0.001), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and local EEG power also were decreased in PM + Sh (p < 0.001). Pretreatment with GA reversed BBB permeability and MDA. Our findings suggest that GA is a probable protective agent against adverse effects of both I/R and exposure to DPM and also in I/R subjects exposed to DPM. The beneficial effects of GA may induce by its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties.

JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Spike-wave; Generalized epilepsy; Syndrome	ABSENCE SEIZURES; VALPROIC ACID; CHILDHOOD; DISCHARGES; FEATURES; SPIKE	Purpose: To evaluate EEG differences among syndromes in genetic generalized epilepsy based on quantified data. Methods: Twenty-four-hour ambulatory EEGs were recorded in consecutive patients diagnosed with genetic generalized epilepsy. All epileptiform EEG abnormalities were quantified into density scores (total duration of epileptiform discharges per hour). One-way analysis of variance was conducted to find out differences in EEG density scores among the syndromes. Generalized linear mixed models were also fitted to explore the association between the proportion of "pure" generalized spike-wave paroxysms and fragments (without intervening polyspikes/polyspike-waves) and the syndromes. Results: In total, 6,923 epileptiform discharges were analyzed from 105 abnormal EEGs. In the analysis of variance, six EEG variables were significantly different among syndromes: total spike density (P = 0.001), total polyspike and polyspike-wave density (P = 0.049), generalized spike-wave-only density (P < 0.001), generalized paroxysm density (P < 0.001), generalized paroxysm duration mean (P = 0.018), and generalized paroxysm duration maximum (P = 0.009). The density of epileptiform discharges and the paroxysm durations were the highest in juvenile absence epilepsy followed by juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, childhood absence epilepsy, and generalized epilepsy with tonic-clonic seizures only. Generalized linear mixed models revealed that "pure" generalized spike-wave discharges (without intervening polyspikes/polyspike waves) tended to be more frequent in absence epilepsies, although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.21). Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that the density and duration of epileptiform discharges can help differentiate among genetic generalized epilepsy syndromes.

"Sleep Surge": The impact of sleep onset and offset on epileptiform discharges in idiopathic generalized epilepsies	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Sleep; Circadian; Spike-wave; Generalized epilepsy; Vigilance	SPIKE-WAVE DISCHARGES; ABNORMALITIES; PATTERNS	Objective: To investigate the impact of sleep onset and offset on the rate of epileptiform discharges (ED) in idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE). Methods: We studied the temporal distribution of EDs with mixed-effects Poisson regression modeling in a cohort of patients diagnosed with IGE who underwent 24-hour ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. We defined the mean number discharges per hour per subject as the mean ED rate. The association between each hour and the mean ED rate was quantified with incidence rate ratio (IRR) as the metric. We calculated the IRR of each hourly block for the total cohort in relation to sleep onset and offset. Finally, we admitted secondary risk factors into our Poisson regression model and quantified changes in IRR in order to investigate the impact of those variables on the outcome. The secondary risk factors included: epilepsy syndrome, duration of seizure freedom, duration of epilepsy, number of antiepileptic drugs (AED), type of AED, and age. Results: A total of 39 patients with a mean age of 29.1 y (SD = 10.1) were studied. The distribution of ED rate demonstrated a highly significant abrupt increase in the first hour after sleep onset (IRR = 3.96; p < 0.001). On the contrary, the ED rate significantly dropped in the second hour after the sleep offset compared with the last hour block before sleep offset (IRR = 0.39; p < 0.001). None of the secondary risk factors demonstrated any significant impact on this pattern. Conclusions: Sleep onset is a very significant trigger for the generation of EDs in IGE. Significance: Our results support the hypothesis that there is a "critical zone of vigilance" in the sleep-wake boundary from which generalized EDs are more likely to emerge.

We tested the hypothesis that adolescent daytime sleepiness also results from adolescent brain maturational processes indexed by declining delta electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. Design: Data are from the first 3 years of a semilongitudinal study of EEG changes in adolescence. All-night EEG was recorded semiannually. Setting: EEG was recorded with ambulatory recorders in the subjects' homes. Participants: Thirty-one subjects were 9 years old (cohort C9), and 38 subjects were 12 years old (cohort C12) at the start of the study. Measurements: EEG power density (power/minute) was calculated for the first 5 hours of non-rapid eye movement sleep. Subjects rated sleepiness on a modified Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Habitual sleep schedules were assessed with self-reports and actigraphy. Results: In C9 subjects, sleepiness increased slightly and was related only to age. In C12 subjects, the increase in subjective sleepiness was related to changes in age, bedtime, time in bed, and a wide frequency range of EEG power density. Sleepiness was not related to rise time, non-rapid eye movement sleep duration, rapid eye movement sleep duration, or total sleep time. With sleep schedule measures statistically controlled, the increase in sleepiness in the C12 group was strongly related to declining delta power density and, unexpectedly, even more strongly related to declining theta power density. Conclusions: The data support our hypothesis that, independent of sleep schedule changes, increasing adolescent daytime sleepiness is related to brain maturational changes indexed by declining EEG power. Our working hypothesis is that the declines in delta and theta power are correlates of an adolescent synaptic pruning that reduces waking arousal levels.

J	Sinnamon, HM				Sinnamon, HM			Hippocampal theta activity and behavioral sequences in a reward-directed approach locomotor task	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						theta; hippocampus; reward approach; locomotion; reward	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; HYPOTHALAMIC-STIMULATION; RHYTHM; RATS; FREQUENCY; MOVEMENT; PHASE; WAVE; EEG; MODULATION	Hippocampal rhythmic slow wave activity (theta) has been implicated in the processing of stimuli associated with movement. This study determined whether the theta rhythm showed phase relationships or changes in amplitude and frequency with the onset of stimuli and behavioral sequences in a skilled locomotor approach task. Rats with bipolar electrodes spanning CA1 approached a stall, turned to enter it, approached and depressed a treadle, waited 1.35 s, and approached a milk reward located forward either to the right or to the left. Auditory cues indicated the location of the reward during the waiting period and at the reward onset. A video capture system (20-ms sampling) was synchronized to the hippocampal recording system (10-ms sampling). Behavioral events identified by motion analysis were used to generate averages of hippocampal slow wave activity, theta peak amplitudes, and intervals between peaks. Theta activity at 8-10 Hz was almost continuous during the behavioral sequences. Phase relations with stimuli or movement onsets occurred infrequently and were not consistent across the four subjects. Theta peak amplitude and frequency decreased as the rat slowed locomotion in the stall and reached the treadle. Onset of locomotion directed to a reward location occurred on a positive peak of averaged theta activity. When locomotion had short latencies, increases in theta frequency appeared after the onset but, when it had longer latencies, frequency increases appeared 200 ms before onset. The results indicate that the execution of instrumental movement modulates both theta amplitude and frequency, and that the preparation for locomotion modulates theta frequency.

Intracranial recordings from human cortex have revealed evidence of high-amplitude theta oscillations throughout the brain, including the neocortex. Although its specific role is largely unknown, the observation of human theta has begun to reveal an intriguing connection between brain oscillations and cognitive processes.

Dynamic Increase in Corticomuscular Coherence during Bilateral, Cyclical Ankle Movements	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						corticomuscular coherence; motor control; locomotion; electroencephalography; electromyography	TIBIALIS ANTERIOR; ISOMETRIC CONTRACTION; EEG OSCILLATIONS; MOTOR CORTEX; BETA; WALKING; SYNCHRONIZATION; MUSCLE; MODULATION; TASK	In humans, the midline primary motor cortex is active during walking. However, the exact role of such cortical participation is unknown. To delineate the role of the primary motor cortex in walking, we examined whether the primary motor cortex would activate leg muscles during movements that retained specific requirements of walking (i.e., locomotive actions). We recorded electroencephalographic and electromyographic signals from 15 healthy, young men while they sat and performed bilateral, cyclical ankle movements. During dorsiflexion, near-20-Hz coherence increased cyclically between the midline primary motor cortex and the co-contracting antagonistic pair (i.e., tibialis anterior and medial gastrocnemius muscles) in both legs. Thus, we have shown that dynamic increase in corticomuscular coherence, which has been observed during walking, also occurs during simple bilateral cyclical movements of the feet. A possible mechanism for such coherence is corticomuscular communication, in which the primary motor cortex participates in the control of movement. Furthermore, because our experimental task isolated certain locomotive actions, the observed coherence suggests that the human primary motor cortex may participate in these actions (i.e., maintaining a specified movement frequency, bilaterally coordinating the feet, and stabilizing the posture of the feet). Additional studies are needed to identify the exact cortical and subcortical interactions that cause corticomuscular coherence and to further delineate the functional role of the primary motor cortex during bilateral cyclical movements such as walking.

The central mechanisms of these effects are not well understood. OPs inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, leading to a hyperactivity of the brain cholinergic systems that are involved in sleep regulation. We studied alterations in the EEG, behavioral states, motor activity and core temperature in rats orally administered with 10 or 40 mg/kg of the OP insecticide chlorpyrifos (CHP). Occipital EEG, motor activity and core temperature were recorded with telemetric transmitters. Behavioral sleep-wake states were visually scored. Both doses of CHP produced alterations of the EEG (decrease in power of sigma/beta and increase in slow theta and fast gamma bands) characteristic of arousal. EEG alterations were consistent with behavioral changes such as an increase in wakefulness and a decrease in sleep. Waking immobility was a prevalent behavior. We did not detect any overt signs of CHP toxicity, such as an abnormal posture or gait, suggesting that reduced locomotion can be a result of central effects of CHP (such as activation of cholinergic motor inhibitory system) rather than peripheral (such as an impairment of neuromuscular function). Changes in the EEG and behavior occurred independently of the decrease in core temperature. Increased wakefulness together with reduced motor activity after exposure to CHP seems to be a result of hyperactivity in brain cholinergic neuronal networks. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

J	Higgins, G; McGinley, B; Jones, E; Glavin, M				Higgins, Garry; McGinley, Brian; Jones, Edward; Glavin, Martin			An evaluation of the effects of wavelet coefficient quantisation in transform based EEG compression	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						EEG; Compression; SPIHT; Quantisation; AEEG; Telemedicine	ALGORITHM	In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the compression of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals for telemedical and ambulatory EEG applications. Data compression is an important factor in these applications as a means of reducing the amount of data required for transmission. Allowing for a carefully controlled level of loss in the compression method can provide significant gains in data compression. Quantisation is easy to implement method of data reduction that requires little power expenditure. However, it is a relatively simple, non-invertible operation, and reducing the bit-level too far can result in the loss of too much information to reproduce the original signal to an appropriate fidelity. Other lossy compression methods allow for finer control over compression parameters, generally relying on discarding signal components the coder deems insignificant. SPIHT is a state of the art signal compression method based on the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), originally designed for images but highly regarded as a general means of data compression. This paper compares the approaches of compression by changing the quantisation level of the DWT coefficients in SPIHT, with the standard thresholding method used in SPIHT, to evaluate the effects of each on EEG signals. The combination of increasing quantisation and the use of SPIHT as an entropy encoder has been shown to provide significantly improved results over using the standard SPIHT algorithm alone.

We tested the impact of window size and choice of reference electrode on the identification of two or more peaks with close frequencies in the spectral power distribution, so called "split alpha." Together with the connectivity analysis, examination of spatiotemporal maps showing the distribution of amplitudes of EEG patterns allowed for better explanation of the mechanisms underlying the generation of split alpha peaks. It was demonstrated that the split alpha spectrum can be generated by two or more independent and interconnected alpha wave generators located in different regions of the cerebral cortex, but not necessarily in the occipital cortex. We also demonstrated the importance of appropriate reference electrode choice during signal recording. In addition, results obtained using the original data were compared with results obtained using re-referenced data, using average reference electrode and reference electrode standardization techniques.

Inpatient monitoring is standard practice but is expensive and can be inconvenient. The authors sought to determine whether outpatient monitoring can be safe and effective as the sole method of recording seizures in the presurgical evaluation of patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. They reviewed the data of seven temporal lobectomy patients whose presurgical monitoring was performed entirely outside the hospital. Mean baseline seizure frequency was at least 9.1 seizures per week. An average of 7.4 seizures was recorded over 9.4 days of monitoring. Only one patient had any antiepileptic drug taper; none suffered any complications. After temporal lobectomy on the side of demonstrated ictal onset, postoperative follow-up averaged 5.5 years. At the most recent follow-up, all patients were either seizure free or had only rare disabling or nocturnal seizures (four patients had outcomes in Engel's class I and three patients in Engel's class II). A comparison group who underwent standard inpatient monitoring was similar in average seizure frequency, monitoring duration, number of seizures recorded, and postoperative outcome, although all but one had antiepileptic drugs tapered during monitoring. The authors conclude that there is a subset of patients for whom solely outpatient presurgical EEG monitoring can be used to help plan successful temporal lobectomy.

We investigated the variation in first- and second-night spike counts in children undergoing 48-h ambulatory EEG recording. Methods: We analyzed 40 consecutive 48-h ambulatory EEGs performed at Boston Children's Hospital that manifested spikes but no seizures. Distinct spike foci in the same child were counted separately. We visually counted all spikes in the first 20 min after the. first sleep spindle during nighttime sleep, comparing the first and second nights. Results: Fifty-five unique spike foci were counted in 40 children (age range: 9 months to 19 years; median: 8.4 years). Considerable variation was seen when comparing Night 1 and Night 2 spike counts: for all foci, Night 1 mean and median spike counts were 304.5 and 126 and Night 2 counts were 309.5 and 148, respectively. For each focus, the mean change in spike frequency between Night 1 and Night 2 was 42.1% (median = 28.3%, IQR 19.0-50.0%). The coefficient of variation of 0.94 suggested a large amount of variation. The percentage change weighted according to high or low spike frequency was 25.1%. Conclusion: In 40 children with 55 unique spike foci, significant variability in spike frequency was seen between consecutive nights of sleep, suggesting significant natural variation in spike frequency. A quarter of spike foci varied by 50% or more. Spike counts separated by longer intervals may show even more dramatic natural variation. (C) 2014 British Epilepsy Association.

Focal retrograde amnesia: Extending the clinical syndrome of transient epileptic amnesia	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Transient epileptic amnesia; Retrograde amnesia; Ictal epileptic activity; Autobiographical memory; Prodromal TEA	AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL AMNESIA; MEMORY; UPDATE	A 44-year-old woman presented with focal retrograde amnesia and complaints of rapid forgetting in the absence of episodes of transient cognitive disturbance. Her MRI and 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FOG-PET) were normal. On standard neuropsychological tests she performed within the normal range although a test of autobiographical memory confirmed impoverished recall especially involving recent life events. The electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings were suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy but no clear diagnosis was established. After 4 years the patient's recurrent brief episodes of disorientation, suggestive of transient epileptic amnesia (TEA), were corroborated by her sister. This diagnosis was confirmed by an ambulatory EEG that revealed ictal activity. Several important points emerge from this study. Focal retrograde amnesia can be a prodromal symptom of TEA which can precede the full-blown syndrome by several years. Moreover, transient attacks might not be reported if patients live alone. The ictal EEG findings further substantiate the epileptic nature of the syndrome. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we contribute a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the robust classification of a steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) paradigm. We measure electroencephalogram (EEG)-based SSVEPs for a brain-controlled exoskeleton under ambulatory conditions in which numerous artifacts may deteriorate decoding. The proposed CNN is shown to achieve reliable performance under these challenging conditions. To validate the proposed method, we have acquired an SSVEP dataset under two conditions: 1) a static environment, in a standing position while fixated into a lower-limb exoskeleton and 2) an ambulatory environment, walking along a test course wearing the exoskeleton (here, artifacts are most challenging). The proposed CNN is compared to a standard neural network and other state-of-the-art methods for SSVEP decoding (i.e., a canonical correlation analysis (CCA)-based classifier, a multivariate synchronization index (MSI), a CCA combined with k-nearest neighbors (CCA-KNN) classifier) in an offline analysis. We found highly encouraging SSVEP decoding results for the CNN architecture, surpassing those of other methods with classification rates of 99.28% and 94.03% in the static and ambulatory conditions, respectively. A subsequent analysis inspects the representation found by the CNN at each layer and can thus contribute to a better understanding of the CNN's robust, accurate decoding abilities.

Nano- Bio- Textile Sensors with Mobile Wireless Platform for Wearable Health Monitoring of Neurological and Cardiovascular Disorders	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							T-WAVE ALTERNANS; RISK STRATIFICATION; ARRHYTHMIC EVENTS; CONTACT IMPEDANCE; COTTON; FIBERS; DEATH; INTERFACES; EMOTIONS; FATIGUE	Neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases and strokes are leading causes of mortality worldwide. Diagnostics and therapeutics for patients under timely point-of-care can save thousands of lives. However, lack of access to minimally-intrusive monitoring systems makes timely diagnosis difficult and sometimes impossible. Existing ambulatory recording equipment are incapable of performing continuous remote patient monitoring because of the inability of conventional silver-silver-chloride-gel-electrodes to perform long-term monitoring, non-reusability, lack of scalable-standardized wireless communication platforms, and user-friendly design. Recent progress in textile-based nanosensors and mobile platforms has resulted in novel wearable health monitoring systems for neurological and cardiovascular disorders. This review paper discusses nanostructured-textile-based dry electrodes that are better suited for long-term measurement of electrocardiography(ECG), electroencephalography(EEG), electrooculography(EOG), electromyography(EMG) and bioimpedance with very low baseline noise, improved sensitivity and seamless integration into garments of daily use. It presents bioelectromagnetic principles, of origination and propagation of bioelectric signals and nanosensor functioning, which provide a unique perspective on development of novel wearable systems that harness their potential. Combined with state-of-the-art embedded wireless network devices to communicate with smartphone, laptop or directly to remote server through mobile network (GSM,4G-LTE,GPRS), they can function as wearable wireless health- diagnostic systems that are more intuitive to use.

Sleep spindles have a key function in sleep maintenance and in brain plasticity. Previous studies have found decreased spindle activity in clinical autism. Here we examine the associations between the entire range of autistic traits and sleep spindle activity in a nonclinical community cohort of adolescents. Methods: Our cohort is based on 172 adolescents born in 1998 (58.7% girls, mean age = 16.9 years, standard deviation = 0.1), who filled in the adult autismspectrum quotient (AQ), consisting of total score, and social interaction and attention to details subscales. Participants underwent an ambulatory overnight sleep electroencephalography. Sleep spindles (amplitude, duration, density, and intensity) were automatically detected from stage N2 sleep, and divided to slow and fast spindles. Results: Higher AQ total sum and social interaction sum associated with lower fast spindle amplitude and intensity (P < .04). No associations were observed for attention to details. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that a higher level of autistic traits in the nonclinical range among generally healthy adolescents associate with similar alterations in sleep spindle activity as observed in many neuropsychiatric conditions, indicating lower sleep-related brain plasticity. This indicates that sleep microstructures form a continuum that follows self-reported symptoms of autism.

Cortical dynamics during preparation and execution of reactive balance responses with distinct postural demands	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Balance; Posture; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Independent component analysis (ICA); Mobile brain/body imaging (MOBI)	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; EVENT-RELATED DYNAMICS; CEREBRAL POTENTIALS; UNEXPECTED EVENTS; MUSCLE SYNERGIES; MOTOR CONTROL; LEFT-HANDERS; ALPHA-BAND; EEG ALPHA; MOVEMENT	The contributions of the cerebral cortex to human balance control are clearly demonstrated by the profound impact of cortical lesions on the ability to maintain standing balance. The cerebral cortex is thought to regulate subcortical postural centers to maintain upright balance and posture under varying environmental conditions and task demands. However, the cortical mechanisms that support standing balance remain elusive. Here, we present an EEG-based analysis of cortical oscillatory dynamics during the preparation and execution of balance responses with distinct postural demands. In our experiment, participants responded to backward movements of the support surface either with one forward step or by keeping their feet in place. To challenge the postural control system, we applied participant-specific high accelerations of the support surface such that the postural demand was low for stepping responses and high for feet-in-place responses. We expected that postural demand modulated the power of intrinsic cortical oscillations. Independent component analysis and time-frequency domain statistics revealed stronger suppression of alpha (9-13 Hz) and low-gamma (31-34 Hz) rhythms in the supplementary motor area (SMA) when preparing for feet in -place responses (i.e., high postural demand). Irrespective of the response condition, support-surface movements elicited broadband (3-17 Hz) power increase in the SMA and enhancement of the theta (3-7 Hz) rhythm in the anterior prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and bilateral sensorimotor cortices (Ml/S1). Although the execution of reactive responses resulted in largely similar cortical dynamics, comparison between the bilateral Ml/S1 showed that stepping responses corresponded with stronger suppression of the beta (13-17 Hz) rhythm in the Ml/S1 contralateral to the support leg. Comparison between response conditions showed that feet-in-place responses corresponded with stronger enhancement of the theta (3-7 Hz) rhythm in the PFC. Our results provide novel insights into the cortical dynamics of SMA, PFC, and Ml/S1 during the control of human balance.

JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCES			English	Article						Locomotion; frequency; attractor; exercise; accelerometer	ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; INITIAL VALIDATION; VELOCITY; WALKING; LOCOMOTION; MOVEMENTS; VALIDITY; TEMPO; HEAD	The frequency for movements along the longitudinal axis during running peaks at approximately 3Hz. Other physiological systems (e.g. heart rate and brain cortical activity) are known to show a dominant frequency of 3Hz connected to exercise. As recent studies have proposed a clear correlation between musical tempo, mood, and performance output, we wished to ascertain whether peak locomotion frequency of 3Hz during running is synchronized with different intrinsic and extrinsic frequencies. Eighteen healthy regular runners performed three outdoor running sessions at different intensities. Oscillations along the longitudinal axis were recorded using an accelerometer (ActiBelt (R)). Electrocortical activity was recorded using electroencephalography before and after exercise and analysed in the delta frequency range (2-4Hz). In addition, the frequency spectra of the participants' favourite musical pieces were analysed. Data revealed a peak frequency at around 2.7 to 2.8Hz for the vertical acceleration during running. Similar oscillation patterns were found for heart rate and musical pieces. Electroencephalographic delta activity increased after running. Results of this study give reason to speculate that a strong relationship exists between intrinsic and extrinsic oscillation patterns during exercise. A frequency of approximately 3Hz seems to be dominant in different physiological systems and seems to be rated as pleasurable when choosing the appropriate music for exercising. This is in line with previous research showing that an adequate choice of music during exercise enhances performance output and mood.

Slow wave EEG activity also declines across NREM periods (NREMPs) within a night, and this decline is thought to represent the dynamics of sleep homeostasis. We used longitudinal data to determine whether these homeostatic dynamics change across adolescence. Design: All-night sleep EEG was recorded semiannually for 6 years. Setting: EEG was recorded with ambulatory recorders in the subjects' homes. Participants: Sixty-seven subjects in 2 cohorts, one starting at age 9 and one starting at age 12 years. Measurements and Results: For NREM delta (1-4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) EEG, we tested whether the proportion of spectral energy contained in the first NREMP changes with age. We also tested for age changes in the parameters of the process S exponential decline. For both delta and theta, the proportion of energy in the first NREMP declined significantly across ages 9 to 18 years. Process S parameters SWA(0) and TWA(0), respectively, represent slow wave (delta) activity and theta wave activity at the beginning of the night. SWA(0) and TWA(0) declined significantly (P < 0.0001) across ages 9 to 18. Conclusions: These declines indicate that the intensity of the homeostatic or restorative processes at the beginning of sleep diminished across adolescence. We propose that this change in sleep regulation is caused by the synaptic pruning that occurs during adolescent brain maturation.

In order to realize the stable and flexible walking of prosthetic legs in different terrains according to human intention, a brain-computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery (MI) is developed. For the raw electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is utilized to extract the time-frequency domain features, which are used as the input signals of the common spatial pattern (CSP) to obtain the time-frequency-space domain features of EEG signals. Then, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier and a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure are combined to classify multiclass imaginary tasks. According to the result of human intention recognition, the prosthetic leg performs the corresponding gait trajectory generated by coding the ground reaction force (GRF). In addition, a sensory feedback loop is established by functional electrical stimulation (FES), which feeds back the movement of the prosthetic leg to human in real time. The effectiveness and feasibility of the developed EEG-based volitional control of powered prosthetic legs have been validated by three subjects, all of whom were able to fulfill smoothly walking on the floor, ascending stairs, and descending stairs according to their own intentions using prosthetic legs. Note to Practitioners-This article was inspired by the problem that the control mode of the prosthetic leg walking is not natural and intuitive, but it can also be applicable to other powered prosthetic limbs. Existing methods of controlling the walking patterns of the prosthetic leg usually require explicit human manipulation and are not convenient to use. In this article, a novel strategy was proposed, that is, using the human mind to choose the ambulation mode of prosthetic legs. This article described the methods of human brain activity information acquisition and intention recognition. Then, gaits inspired by the healthy leg are designed for the prosthetic leg in three terrains, including walking on the floor, ascending stairs, and descending stairs. In addition, this article provided a way for human to perceive the movement of prosthetic legs, which can make human control the prosthetic leg more smoothly. Experiments on healthy subjects have shown that this approach is feasible. However, no experiments have been conducted on lower limb amputees, and adding more walking patterns may reduce the accuracy of human intention recognition. In the future work, we will study how to accurately identify more categories of human intentions and further improve the control strategy so as to enhance the auxiliary effect of prosthetic legs on amputees.

This entire system is made wearable and functional in outside lab environment without requirement of technical expert. We are using cheapest (INR 6,800) available NeuroSky Brainwave Mobile (EEG sensor). Instead of using large number of electrode by applying gel between scalp and electrode as done in traditional EEG this sensor uses single non-invasive dry electrode sensor. So it can directly be placed on head and taken off as a head band without any surgery or using any gel making it functional, wearable and portable in outside lab environment. This makes BCI (Brain Computer Interface) much easy to use and affordable. Taking in account that subject has to alter his mental state to control the chair so response to sudden obstacle and hurdles will be difficult and not simultaneously which can be very dangerous in making assistive machine for locomotion in uneven environments. Hence we have added ultrasonic, infrared, LDR (Light Detecting Resistance), temperature, gas, inertial sensor along with EEG sensor. These sensor will do the trajectory mapping and the subject's mental state will control the driving in this safe trajectory, eye blinks will be used for conscious maneuvering of wheel chair and an instantaneous graph showing the subjects mental state would be displayed for feedback. So during subject's conscious state it will be semi-autonomous and in unconscious or sleepy state fully autonomous.

Epileptiform discharges in EEG may be seen in children with ADHD also in those without seizure disorders. Sleep enhances these discharges which may be suppressed by levetiracetam. Aim: To assess the effect of levetiracetam on focal epileptiform discharges during sleep in children with ADHD. Method: In this retrospective study a new semi-automatic quantitative method based on the calculation of spike index in 24-h ambulatory EEG recordings was applied. Thirty-five ADHD children, 17 with focal epilepsy, one with generalised epilepsy, and 17 with no seizure disorder were evaluated. Follow-up 24-h EEG recordings were performed after a median time of four months. Results: Mean Spike index was 50 prior to levetiracetam treatment and 21 during treatment. Seventeen children had no focal interictal epileptiform discharges in EEG at follow-up. Five children had-a more than 50% reduction in spike index. Thus, a more than 50% reduction in spike index 1:vas found in 22/35 children (63%). Out of these an improved behaviour was noticed in 13 children (59%). Conclusion: This study shows that treatment with levetiracetam reduces interictal epileptiform discharges in children with ADHD. There is a complex relationship between epilepsy, ADHD and epileptiform activity, why it is a need for prospective studies in larger sample sizes, also to ascertain clinical benefits.

Although ictal epileptic headache has become the focus of several studies, this remains a very rare and not well-known phenomenon. Electroclinical features, pathophysiology, and syndromic context are heterogeneous. We investigated the electroclinical and neuroimaging findings in a population of adult patients with ictal epileptic headache. Methods: We retrospectively examined 8800 EEG recordings of almost 4800 patients admitted to our video-EEG laboratory from 2010 to 2013 with a history of well-documented epilepsy. We selected patients who reported headache closely related to a seizure documented by video-EEG or 24-hour ambulatory EEG. We analyzed ictal electroclinical features of headache, and we defined the related epileptic syndromes. Results: We identified five patients with ictal epileptic headache. Two patients described tension headache during an epileptic seizure. In three patients, the headache was accompanied by other "minor" neurological symptoms mimicking a migrainous aura. In all cases, the headache stopped with the end of the epileptic activity. Three patients had a history of partial symptomatic epilepsy with cerebral lesions (low grade glioma, astrocytoma, porencephalic cyst) in the left posterior regions, whereas two patients were affected by idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Conclusion: This study confirms the rarity of ictal epileptic headache. To date, well-documented video-EEG cases remain as exceptional reports, especially in cases of idiopathic generalized epilepsies. Moreover, we confirm the main involvement of posterior regions in patients with ictal epileptic headache affected by partial symptomatic epilepsies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Cortical processes associated with continuous balance control as revealed by EEG spectral power	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Balance; EEG; Postural control; Theta; Error detection	MODULATION; RESPONSES; CORTEX; THETA	Balance is a crucial component in numerous every day activities such as locomotion. Previous research has reported distinct changes in cortical theta activity during transient balance instability. However, there remains little understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying continuous balance control. This study aimed to investigate cortical theta activity during varying difficulties of continuous balance tasks, as well as examining the relationship between theta activity and balance performance. 37 subjects completed nine balance tasks with different levels of surface stability and base of support. Throughout the balancing task, electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 32 scalp locations. ICA-based artifact rejection was applied and spectral power was analyzed in the theta frequency band. Theta power increased in the frontal, central, and parietal regions of the cortex when balance tasks became more challenging. In addition, fronto-central and centro-parietal theta power correlated with balance performance. This study demonstrates the involvement of the cerebral cortex in maintaining upright posture during continuous balance tasks. Specifically, the results emphasize the important role of frontal and parietal theta oscillations in balance control. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The long adaptation process that consolidates a novel gait pattern seems to depend on cerebellar function for reinforcement of specific gait modifications, but the precise, step-by-step gait modifications (e.g., foot placement) most likely rely on top-down commands from the brainstem and cerebral cortex. The aim of this study was to identify, in able-bodied individuals, the specific modulations of cortical rhythms that accompany short-term gait modifications during first-time use of a dummy prosthesis. Methods Fourteen naive participants walked on a treadmill without (one block, 4 min) and with a dummy prosthesis (three blocks, 3 x 4 min), while ground reaction forces and 32-channel EEG were recorded. Gait cycle duration, stance phase duration, step width, maximal ground reaction force and, ground reaction force trace over time were measured to identify gait modifications. Independent component analysis of EEG data isolated brain-related activity from distinct anatomical sources. The source-level data were segmented into gait cycles and analyzed in the time-frequency domain to reveal relative enhancement or suppression of intrinsic cortical oscillations. Differences between walking conditions were evaluated with one-way ANOVA and post-hoc testing (alpha = 0.05). Results Immediate modifications occurred in the gait parameters when participants were introduced to the dummy prosthesis. Except for gait cycle duration, these modifications remained throughout the duration of the experimental session. Power modulations of the theta, mu, beta, and gamma rhythms, of sources presumably from the fronto-central and the parietal cortices, were found across the experimental session. Significant power modulations of the theta, beta, and gamma rhythms within the gait cycle were predominately found around the heel strike of both feet and the swing phase of the right (prosthetic) leg. Conclusions The modulations of cortical activity could be related to whole-body coordination, including the swing phase and placing of the prosthesis, and the bodyweight transfer between legs and arms. Reduced power modulation of the gamma rhythm within the experimental session may indicate initial motor memories being formed. Better understanding of the sensorimotor processes behind gait modifications may inform the development of neurofeedback strategies to assist gait rehabilitation.	[Kooiman, Vera G.

These were described as the patient "becoming pale with sinking to the floor and staring for approximately 1 minute with confusion thereafter." The patient had years of reported seizure freedom until 2010 when she was evaluated for intractable headaches, and electroencephalography revealed her focal subclinical status. At that time, ambulatory electroencephalography findings showed asymmetric left parietal-occipital high-amplitude spike-and-wave discharges in her best awake and alert state. Since that time, the patient developed and continues to have complex partial seizures every 2-3 months that are persistent despite the implementation of several medical regimens. At the time of recent presentation, the patient initially underwent unenhanced head CT in the emergency department followed by unenhanced MRI of the brain due to increased seizure activity at the patient's group home despite continued compliance with her antiepileptic regimen. Contrast material-enhanced imaging was not available at the time of recent presentation, so comparison was made with gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI performed approximately 9 years earlier.

In all previous studies, GAERS were compared to their paired selected strain not expressing spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs), namely nonepileptic controls (NECs). Because the occurrence/absence of SWDs is of polygenic origin, some other traits could have been selected along with occurrence/absence of SWDs. Therefore, we explored the importance of using a second control group consisting in Wistar rats, the strain of origin of GAERS, in addition to NECs, on locomotion and anxiety in GAERS. MethodsA test battery encompassing home-cage, open-field, beam-walking and elevated plus-maze evaluations was used. In addition, stereologic analyses were performed to assess the volume of thalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus. The occurrence/absence of SWDs was determined in all three strains by electroencephalography (EEG) recording. ResultsWhen compared to NECs and Wistars, GAERS displayed lower exploratory activity and fastened habituation to novelty. In the plus-maze, scores of GAERS and Wistars were similar, but NECs appeared significantly less anxious (possibly in association with increased amygdala volume); evidence for weaker anxiety in NECs was also found in the open-field evaluation. The volumetric study revealed increased thalamic volume in GAERS compared to both control groups. SWDs were present in all GAERS and in 80% of Wistars. SignificanceCompared to the original Wistar strain as an additional control group, the selective breeding that generated the GAERS has no incidence on anxiety-related behavior, conversely to the selection of SWD suppression in NECs, in which anxiety is attenuated. These findings point to the importance of using a second control group composed of Wistar rats in studies characterizing the behavioral profile of GAERS. Thereby, possible confusions between occurrence/absence of SWDs and other features that come along with selection and/or differential brain development induced by the genetic mutations are reduced.

The methods used to generate visual stimuli on a PDA device and the design of an optical coupling device to convert the display to an electrical waveform which is recorded by the CAMAS base unit are presented. The optical sensor signal, synchronized to the visual stimulus emulates the brain's synchronized EEG signal input to CAMAS normally reviewed for the evoked potential response. Most importantly, the PDA also sends a marker message over the wireless Bluetooth connection to the CAMAS base unit synchronized to the visual stimulus which is the critical averaging reference component to obtain VEP results. Results show the variance in the latency of the wireless marker messaging link is consistent enough to support the generation and recording of visual evoked potentials. The averaged sensor waveforms at multiple CPU speeds are presented and demonstrate suitability of the Bluetooth interface for portable ambulatory visual evoked potential implementation on our CAMAS platform.

Therefore, we investigated the characteristics of BR in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) and potential associations with clinical variables.Methods: Sixty-two healthy controls (HCs) and 94 IGE patients completed BR task. Perceptual alternation rates were compared between HC and IGE groups as well as among the HC group and IGE patients stratified according to the presence or absence of interictal activity on the ambulatory electroencephalogram (EEG), termed the abnormal ambulatory EEG group (AB-AEEG, n = 64) and normal ambulatory EEG group (N-AEEG, n = 30), respectively.Results: The IGE patients demonstrated a slower rate of BR perceptual alternation than HC subjects (t = -4.364, p < 0.001). The alternation rate also differed among the HC, AB-AEEG, and N-AEEG groups (F = 44.962, df = 2, p < 0.001), and post hoc comparisons indicated a significantly slower alternation rate in the AB-AEEG group compared with the N-AEEG and HC groups (0.28 vs. 0.46, and 0.43 Hz). Stepwise linear regression revealed positive correlations between the BR alternation rate and both the ambulatory EEG status (beta, 0.173; standard error, 0.022 p < 0.001) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment score (beta, 0.013; standard error, 0.004; p = 0.003). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of the BR alternation rate distinguished AB-AEEG from N-AEEG subjects with 90.00% sensitivity and 76.90% specificity (area under the curve = 0.881; 95% confidence interval = 0.801- 0.961, cut-off = 0.319). Alternatively, Montreal Cognitive Assessment score did not accurately distinguish AB-AEEG from N-AEEG subjects and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve combining the BR alternation rate and Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was not markedly larger than that of the BR alternation rate alone (0.894, 95% confidence interval = 0.822-0.966, p < 0.001). K-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the predictive performance of BR alternation rate, MoCA score, and the combination of both, which yielded average AUC values of 0.870, 0.584 and 0.847, average sensitivity values of 89.36, 92.73, and 91.28%, and average specificity values of 62.25, 13.42, and 61.78%, respectively. The number of interictal epileptiform discharges was significantly correlated with the alternation rate in IGE patients (r = 0.296, p = 0.018). A forward stepwise linear regression model identified the number of interictal epileptiform discharges (beta, 0.001; standard error, 0.001; p = 0.025) as an independent factor associated with BR alternation rate in these patients.Conclusion: These results suggest that interictal epileptiform discharges are associated with disruptions in perceptual awareness, and that the BR may be a useful auxiliary behavioral task to diagnosis and dynamically monitor IGE patients with interictal discharge.

In our daily life, we mostly experience forward walking, but also backward stepping can occur, as in protective stepping. In this work, we investigated the electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates of cognitive processing underpinning step initiation by means of movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) analysis and force-plates recordings. Healthy young volunteers (N = 11) performed self-paced forward- and backward-oriented steps on two force platforms, which were synchronized to simultaneous EEG recordings. MRCPs and their source localization analyses were computed. Results demonstrate the involvement of cognitive processing during step preparation and execution, as showed by the prefrontal activity, which was enhanced in backward stepping. Further, the parietal activity was larger in forward than backward stepping, while motor-related regions were involved in both step directions. Thus, the neural timing and sources of forward and backward stepping suggest a functional distinction of these two actions, which undergo different cortical organizations. Backward stepping requires enhanced cognitive control and can be regarded as an avoidance behavior, while forward stepping would be assimilated to an oriented-to-action behavior mainly localized over parietal areas. In conclusion, preparing body locomotion involves high cognitive processing, with step direction showing different cortical organization and functional specialization.

Methods or devices capable of detecting seizures may help prevent injury or even death and significantly improve quality of life. Here, we summarize and evaluate currently available, unimodal, or polymodal detection systems for epileptic seizures, mainly in the ambulatory setting. Recent Findings There are two broad categories of detection devices: EEG-based and non-EEG-based systems. Wireless wearable EEG devices are now available both in research and commercial arenas. Neuro-stimulation devices are currently evolving and initial experiences of these show potential promise. As for non-EEG devices, different detecting systems show different sensitivity according to the different patient and seizure types. Regardless, when used in combination, these modalities may complement each other to increase positive predictive value. Summary Although some devices with high sensitivity are promising, practical widespread use of such detection systems is still some way away. More research and experience are needed to evaluate the most efficient and integrated systems, to allow for better approaches to detection and prediction of seizures. The concept of closed-loop systems and prompt intervention may substantially improve quality of life for patients and carers.

Here we expanded this analysis, exploring whether long EDs (>2.68 s), and short ones, were uniformly distributed during the day. Lastly, we evaluated the temporal distribution of seizure relapses. By Friedman test, we demonstrated that hourly frequencies of both short and long EDs were dependent on the hours of day and sleep-wake cycle factors, with an opposite trend. Short EDs were found mostly during the night (with two peaks at 1 AM and 6 AM), and sleep, dropping at the wake onset (p < 0.001). Conversely, long EDs surged at the wake onset (0.001), remaining frequent during the whole wake period, when compared to sleep (p = 0.002). Of note, this latter pattern mirrored that of seizures, which occurred exclusively during the wake period, and in 9 out of 13 cases at the wake onset. We therefore suggested that short and long EDs could reflect distinct pathophysiological phenomena. Extended wake EEG recordings, possibly including the awakening, could be extremely useful in clinical practice, as well as in further studies, with the ambitious goal of predicting seizure recurrences.

Current commercially available implantable devices that allow for recording and stimulation of deep brain activity in humans can provide invaluable intrinsic brain signals but are not inherently designed for research and thus lack flexible control and integration with wearable sensors. We developed a mobile deep brain recording and stimulation (Mo-DBRS) platform that enables wireless and programmable intracranial electroencephalographic recording and electrical stimulation integrated and synchronized with virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR) and wearables capable of external measurements (e.g., motion capture, heart rate, skin conductance, respiration, eye tracking, and scalp EEG). When used in freely moving humans with implanted neural devices, this platform is adaptable to ecologically valid environments conducive to elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying naturalistic behaviors and to the development of viable therapies for neurologic and psychiatric disorders.

Based on laboratory (Study 1) and home sleep records (Study II) here we report WS-related features of the patterns of antero-posterior 8-16 Hz non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep EEG power distributions. Participants in Study I were 9 WS and 9 typically developing (TD) controls matched for age (14-29 years) and sex, and sleeping for two consecutive nights in the laboratory. WS participants were characterized by region-independent decreases in 10.50-12.50 Hz and central increases in 14.75-15.75 Hz EEG power. Region-independent decreases and increases in z-scores of the spectra were observed in the 10.25-12.25 Hz and 14-16 Hz ranges, respectively. Moreover, in the EEG spectra of participants with WS a lower probability for the emergence of a frontally dominant peak was observed. Parietal fast sigma peaks and the antero-posterior shifts in power distributions were of higher frequencies in WS (similar to 1 Hz difference). A 1 year follow-up of 9 WS and 3 TD participants, as well as their inclusion into larger samples (20 WS and 20 TD, age: 6-29 years) of a two-night ambulatory home polysomnography study confirmed the WS-specific decrease in alpha/low sigma power (8-11.75 Hz) and the pattern of z-score differences (decreases: 8.50-11.25 Hz; increases: 13.5-14 Hz), including the antero-posterior shifts in power distribution (0.5 Hz) and some features of the spectral peaks. Altogether these data suggest a decrease in alpha/low sigma power, as well as a redistribution of NREM sleep 8-16 Hz EEG power toward the higher frequencies and/or a higher frequency of NREM sleep thalamocortical oscillations in WS.

Essential hypertension is associated with reduced pain sensitivity of unclear aetiology. This study explores this issue using the Cold Pressor Test (CPT), a reliable pain/stress model, comparing CPT-related EEG activity in first episode hypertensives and controls. Method. 22 untreated hypertensives and 18 matched normotensives underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). EEG recordings were taken before, during, and after CPT exposure. Results. Significant group differences in CPT-induced EEG oscillations were covaried with the most robust cardiovascular differentiators by means of a Canonical Analysis. Positive correlations were noted between ABPM variables and Delta (1-4Hz) oscillations during the tolerance phase; in high-alpha (10-12Hz) oscillations during the stress unit and posttest phase; and in low-alpha (8-10Hz) oscillations during CPT phases overall. Negative correlations were found between ABPM variables and Beta2 oscillations (16.5-20Hz) during the posttest phase and Gamma (28.5-45Hz) oscillations during the CPT phases overall. These relationships were localised at several sites across the cerebral hemispheres with predominance in the right hemisphere and left frontal lobe. Conclusions. These findings provide a starting point for increasing our understanding of the complex relationships between cerebral activation and cardiovascular functioning involved in regulating blood pressure changes.

Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (SE) is a term used to denote a range of conditions in which electrographic seizure activity is prolonged and results in nonconvulsive clinical symptoms. Nowadays, some experts on nonconvulsive SE have emphasized the utility on the clinical practice to consider the classification taking in account both the clinical setting and the severity of consciousness impairment, differentiating between ambulatory patients (from almost normal mental state to stupor) which includes absence SE and complex partial SE; and nonconvulsive SE in coma. Aim. To review the literature in relation to the diagnosis of nonconvulsive SE in comatose and/or critically ill patients. Development. Nonconvulsive SE has been reported with surprising frequency in a wide variety of acute neurological processes such as cerebrovascular disease, anoxia, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cranial trauma, encephalitis and following convulsive SE. Conclusions. Nonconvulsive seizures and episodes of nonconvulsive SE in patients with severe impairment of consciousness are frequent and, therefore, continuous EEG monitoring is an essential neurophysiologic tool in the evaluation of comatose subjects. EEG interpretation in patients with nonconvulsive SE may be particularly difficult and problematic and, therefore, requires expert knowledge and a clinical and neurophysiologic specific training.

J	Liang, CW; Hsiao, TS				Liang, Chiawei; Hsiao, Tesheng			Admittance Control of Powered Exoskeletons Based on Joint Torque Estimation	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Exoskeletons; Legged locomotion; Admittance; Torque; Estimation; Electromyography; Brain modeling; Exoskeleton; walking assistance; intention detection; disturbance observer; compliance control; admittance control	HUMAN-ROBOT INTERACTION; DESIGN	In recent years, exoskeletons have been widely accepted as rehabilitative and walking assistive devices for either healthy persons or patients with mobility impairment. Depending on mobility of the wearers, the control strategies for exoskeletons may differ significantly. This paper aims at developing an admittance control framework for exoskeletons to assist healthy persons in safer, faster, or more energy-efficient walking. A crucial step to accomplish assistive walking for healthy persons is to detect their intention. Direct sensing of the wearer's biological signals, such as electromyography (EMG) and electroencephalography (EEG), requires additional sensors, which increases the cost and makes it inconvenient for the wearer to put on and take off the exoskeleton. Instead, we propose to detect the wearer's intention by estimating the total torques applied from the wearer to the human-exoskeleton system based on the motor current and joint angles. Then the velocity commands to the joint motors are generated according to the estimated torque and a predefined mechanical admittance function of each joint. Consequently, the exoskeleton complies with the wearer's intention. Rigorous theoretical analysis is performed on robust stability of the closed-loop system. Then experiments are carried out to verify the accuracy and robustness of the proposed torque estimation algorithm. In addition, experimental data show that the wearer's gait can be shaped in a desired way by choosing an appropriate admittance function in the proposed admittance control loop.

J	Manford, M				Manford, M			Assessment and investigation of possible epileptic seizures	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY NEUROSURGERY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article								Epilepsy enters the differential diagnosis of paroxysmal disorders of central nervous system function. The first step is to differentiate seizures from other common paroxysmal disorders, which are considered in another section (see p ii9). When the diagnosis of recurrent seizures is confirmed the next step is to diagnose the epilepsy syndrome in order to estimate prognosis and optimise treatment. The following guiding principles are useful in considering attack disorders. The paroxysmal nature of seizures creates significant limitations in diagnostic precision. The great majority of seizures cause an ictal scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormality (below) and the gold standard diagnosis is made by ictal electroclinical correlation. It is often said that epilepsy is a clinical diagnosis but that is only because seizures are usually too infrequent to obtain ictal electrophysiological corroboration. When the diagnosis is in doubt, the key is to record the ictus, ideally with video-EEG, but alternatively with ambulatory EEG monitoring and home video recording. The adage "wait and see" is often good counsel. The diagnosis may become clearer and in the meantime a diagnosis of "don't know" may be better than an incorrect diagnosis of epilepsy with all its psychosocial consequences.

The aim of this study was to determine the specific electroencephalographic (EEG) features (spike morphology, location, and frequency and associated background slowing) in a broad population-based cohort identified through EEG laboratories. The mean spike frequency in the awake state was 9.3 per minute (95% confidence interval 6.5-12.0), in drowsiness, 21.2 per minute (16.7-25.6); and in sleep, 45.6 per minute (38.3-52.8), where 60% of patients had > 40 discharges per minute. In five patients, spike train rates occupied > 80% of the sleep record, and in nine patients, they occupied 61% to 80%. An ambulatory overnight record did not add new information comparing early-onset sleep with a mean spike frequency of 37.1 per minute (27.3-46.9) with slow-wave sleep, 36.0 per minute (27.3-44.7). Patients with benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes have a high spike burden, which can impact on cognitive function.

However, sensible, reliable, and diagnostic measurement of MWL is essential for applications of adaptive aiding system design, usability testing, and seafarers' training. To develop robust MWL measures, 10 participants voluntarily participated in a simulator-based experiment study. During this study, the participants carried out standard four-level calibration tasks and simulated four-level maritime operation tasks, their heart rate and electroencephalogram (EEG) were continuously measured using a heart rate sensor and an ambulatory EEG device, which includes an accelerometer to distinguish signal corruption epochs induced by body movement artefact. After each task, NASA Task Load Index was collected as subjective measurement. One-way analysis of variance was used to test the sensitivity of MWL measures and Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated. The significantly sensitive indices for n-back task and simulator-based maritime operation task were different, supporting the limited cognitive resource pool theory. EEG features showed higher sensitivity than heart-rate-related measures.

Here we assessed whether a diet supplemented with heat-killed SBC8803 affects circadian locomotor rhythmicity and sleep architecture. Main methods and key findings: Daily total activity gradually increased in mice over 4 weeks and supplementation with heat-killed SBC8803 significantly intensified the increase, which reached saturation at 25 days. Electroencephalography revealed that SBC8803 supplementation significantly reduced the total amount of time spent in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and increased the amount of time spent being awake during the latter half of the nighttime, but tended to increase the total amount of time spent in NREM sleep during the daytime. Dietary supplementation with SBC8803 can extend the duration of activity during the nighttime and of sleep during the daytime. Daily voluntary wheel-running and sleep rhythmicity become intensified when heat-killed SBC8803 is added to the diet. Significance: Dietary heat-killed SBC8803 can modulate circadian locomotion and sleep rhythms, which might benefit individuals with circadian rhythms that have been disrupted by stress or ageing.

Past findings on this issue have been mixed, partly due to the difficulty in collecting and isolating the relevant information. The purpose of this study was to contribute to this new and important literature. Research Question: Can left versus right imagined stepping be differentiated using the alpha, beta, and gamma frequencies of EEG data at four electrodes (C1, C2, PO3, and PO4)? Methods: An experiment was conducted with a sample of 16 healthy male participants. They imagined left and right lower limb movements across 60 trials at two time periods separated by one week. Participants were fitted with a 64-electrode headcap, lay supine on a specially designed device and then completed the imagined task while observing a customized computer-generated image of a human walking to signify the left and right steps, respectively. Results: Findings showed that eight of the twelve frequency bands from 4 EEG electrodes were significant in differentiating imagined left from right lower limb movement. Using these data points, a neural network analysis resulted in an overall participant average test classification accuracy of left versus right movements at 63 %. Significance: Our study provides support for using the alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands at the sensorimotor areas (C1 and C2 electrodes) and incorporating information from the parietal/occipital lobes (PO3 and PO4 electrodes) for focused, real-time EEG signal processing to assist in creating a BCI for those with lower limb compromised mobility.

In this respect, we designed and tested a novel methodological approach to early detect modifications of the scalp-level signals when steady walking is perturbed. Four young adults were asked to manage unexpected bilateral slippages while steadily walking at their self-selected speed. Lower limb kinematics, electromyographic (EMG) and electroencephalographic (EEG; 13 channels from motor and sensory motor cortex areas) signals were synchronously recorded. EMG signals from Vastus Medialis (both sides) were used to trigger the analysis of the EEG before and after the perturbation onset. Cortical activity was then assessed and compared pre vs. post perturbation. Specifically, for each gait cycle, the rate of variation of the EEG power spectrum density, named in, was used to describe the cortical responsiveness in five bands of interests: theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta I, beta II, beta III rhythms (13-15, 15-20, 18-28 Hz). Results revealed a sharp increment of m early after the onset of the perturbation (perturbed step) compared to steady locomotion, for all rhythms. This cortical behavior disappeared during the recovery step. This study promisingly supports the evidence that the proposed approach can distinguish between steady walking and early reactive balance recovery, paving the way for the EEG-based monitoring of the fall risk during daily activities.

Dynamics of fMRI and EEG Parameters in a Stroke Patient Assessed during a Neurofeedback Course Focused on Brodmann Area 4 (M1)	BULLETIN OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						interactive brain stimulation; stroke; fMRI; EEG; primary motor cortex	REAL-TIME FMRI	A course of interactive stimulation of primary motor cortex (Brodmann area 4) in the brain of a stroke patient resulted in recovery of locomotion volume in the paretic extremities and in improvement of general health accompanied with diverse changes in cerebral activity. During the training course, the magnitude of response in the visual fields of Brodmann areas 17 and 18 decreased; in parallel, the motor areas were supplemented with other ones such as area 24 (the ventral surface of anterior cingulate gyrus responsible for self-regulation of human brain activity and implicated into synthesis of tactile and special information) in company with Brodmann areas 40, 41, 43, 44, and 45. EEG data showed that neurofeedback sessions persistently increased the theta rhythm power in Brodmann areas 7, 39, 40, and 47, while the corresponding powers progressively decreased during a real motion. Both real motion and its virtual sibling constructed by interactive stimulation via neurofeedback were characterized with decreasing powers of the EEG beta rhythm in Brodmann areas 6 and 8. The neurofeedback course decreased the coherence between the left Brodmann area 6 and some other ones examined in alpha and theta ranges. In the context of real motions, the coherence assessed in the EEG beta range generally increased. Overall, the EEG and fMRI parameters attest to growing similarity between the moieties of functional communications effected in real and imaginary movements during neurofeedback course. The data open the vista for interactive stimulation to rehabilitate stroke patients; they highlight the important role of Brodmann areas in rearrangement of the brain in such patients; finally, the present results revealed the "common nervous pathway" that can be used to restore the capability for imaginary and real movements by a neurofeedback course after stroke.

Sensor Selection for Energy-Efficient Ambulatory Medical Monitoring	MOBISYS'09: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 7TH ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MOBILE SYSTEMS, APPLICATIONS, AND SERVICES			English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications and Services	JUN 22-25, 2009	Cracow, POLAND	ACM SIGMOBILE, USENIX		ambulatory medical monitoring; epilepsy; reducing energy consumption; channel selection; electroencephalography (EEG)	EPILEPSY	Epilepsy affects over three million Americans of all ages Despite recent advances, more than 20% of individuals with epilepsy never achieve adequate control of their seizures The use of a small, portable, non-invasive seizure monitor could benefit these individuals tremendously. However, in order for such a device to be Suitable for long-term wear, it must be both comfortable and lightweight. Typical state-of-the-art non-invasive seizure onset detection algorithms require 2 1 scalp electrodes to be placed oil the head. These electrodes are used to generate 18 data streams, called channels The large number of electrodes is inconvenient for the patient and processing 18 channels can consume a considerable amount of energy, a problem for a battery-powered device In this paper, we describe an automated way to construct detector-3 that use fewer channels, and thus fewer electrodes. Starting from an existing technique for constructing 18 channel patient-specific detectors, we use machine learning to automatically construct reduced channel detectors We evaluate our algorithm on data from 16 patients used in all earlier study. On average, our algorithm reduced the number of channels from 18 to 4.6 while decreasing the mean fraction of seizure onsets detected from 99% to 9 90 7, For 12 out of the 16 patients, there was no degradation in the detection rate. While the average detection latency increased from 7 8 s to 11 2 s. the average rate of false alarms per hour decreased from 0 35 to 0 19. We also describe a prototype implementation of a single channel EEC monitoring device built using off-the-shelf components, and use this implementation to derive all energy consumption model. Using fewer channels reduced file average energy Consumption by 69%, which amounts to a 3 3x increase in battery lifetime Finally, we show how additional energy savings call be realized by using a low-power screening detector to rule out segments of data that are obviously not seizures. Though this technique does not reduce the number of electrodes needed, it does reduce the energy consumption by an additional 16%	[Shih, Eugene I.; Shoeb, Ali H.; Guttag, John V.] MIT, Dept EECS, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA		Shih, EI (corresponding author), MIT, Dept EECS, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.	eishih@mit.edu; ashoeb@mit.edu; guttag@mit.edu							32	23	23	0	4	ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY	NEW YORK	1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA			978-1-60558-566-6				2009							347	358						12	Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Telecommunications	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Computer Science; Telecommunications	BLX02					2022-08-02	WOS:000271246300026

Methods: This was a retrospective study of 9 patients who underwent implantation of the responsive neurostimulator (RNS) system from 2015 to 2017 at the University of California, Irvine. Leads were placed at the ictal onset zone as determined by intracranial electroencephalography (EEG). The neurostimulator was programmed to detect and deliver stimulation following identification of the individual's epileptiform patterns. Electrographic seizures were determined by review of all detections. The electrocorticography (ECoG) seizure frequency baseline was the average of the first 2 months postimplantation. The patient-reported seizure frequency baseline was the average of the 2 most recent months prior to RNS implantation. Seizure control was assessed at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Results: Nine patients were included in the study. All 9 patients have been treated with responsive stimulation for at least 3 months, 7/9 for 6 months, and 4/9 for 12 months. The mean change in seizure frequency was -10%, -19%, and -56% at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively, using a self-reported seizure frequency baseline compared with -85%, -71%, and -56% at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively, using the ECoG seizure frequency baseline. Conclusion: Chronic ECoG may provide a more accurate estimate of seizure frequency and provide additional insight into the true efficacy of the RNS system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The initial visit to this clinic ranged 8 months-30 years 3 months of age, and the current ages are 5 years 8 months-42 years 3 months, 60% reaching to over 30 years of age. The average follow up duration is 22.2 years +/- 9.4 years. The ages of onset of epilepsy were from 7 months to 30 years of age, with the two peaks at 3.2 years and 16.7 years. EEG central focus appeared earlier than frontal focus. Abnormality of locomotion and atonic NREM were observed more frequently in epileptic group. These suggest the neuronal system related to abnormality of locomotion and atonic NREM, which are the hypofunction of the brainstem monoaminergic system, is the pathomechanism underling the epilepsy in autism. By showing the abnormal sleep-wake rhythm and locomotion being the very initial symptoms in autism, we had shown the hypofunction of the brainstem monoaminergic system is the initial pathomechanism of autism. Thus, epilepsy in autism is not the secondary manifestation, but one of the pathognomonic symptoms of autism. The brainstem monoaminergic system project to the wider cortical area, and the initial monoaminergic hypofunction may lead to the central focus which appears earlier. The failure of the monoaminergic (serotonergic) system causes dysfunction of the pedunculo-pontine nucleus (PPN) and induces dysfunction of the dopamine (DA) system, and with development of the DA receptor supersensitivity consequently disinhibits the thalamo-frontal pathway, which after maturation of this pathway in teens cause the epileptogenesis in the frontal cortex.

Association of epileptiform abnormalities and seizures in Alzheimer disease	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							RHYTHMIC-DELTA-ACTIVITY; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; HIPPOCAMPAL HYPERACTIVITY; DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINES; NATIONAL INSTITUTE; ACTIVITY TIRDA; AMYLOID-BETA; EPILEPSY; EEG; DISCHARGES	Objective To examine the relationship between scalp EEG biomarkers of hyperexcitability in Alzheimer disease (AD) and to determine how these electric biomarkers relate to the clinical expression of seizures in AD. Methods In this cross-sectional study, we performed 24-hour ambulatory scalp EEGs on 43 cognitively normal elderly healthy controls (HC), 41 participants with early-stage AD with no history or risk factors for epilepsy (AD-NoEp), and 15 participants with early-stage AD with late-onset epilepsy related to AD (AD-Ep). Two epileptologists blinded to diagnosis visually reviewed all EEGs and annotated all potential epileptiform abnormalities. A panel of 9 epileptologists blinded to diagnosis was then surveyed to generate a consensus interpretation of epileptiform abnormalities in each EEG. Results Epileptiform abnormalities were seen in 53% of AD-Ep, 22% of AD-NoEp, and 4.7% of HC. Specific features of epileptiform discharges, including high frequency, robust morphology, right temporal location, and occurrence during wakefulness and REM, were associated with clinical seizures in AD. Multiple EEG biomarkers concordantly demonstrated a pattern of left temporal lobe hyperexcitability in early stages of AD, whereas clinical seizures in AD were often associated with bitemporal hyperexcitability. Frequent small sharp spikes were specifically associated with epileptiform EEGs and thus identified as a potential biomarker of hyperexcitability in AD. Conclusion Epileptiform abnormalities are common in AD but not all equivalent. Specific features of epileptiform discharges are associated with clinical seizures in AD. Given the difficulty recognizing clinical seizures in AD, these EEG features could provide guidance on which patients with AD are at high risk for clinical seizures.

Effect of locomotor demands on cognitive processing	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ELECTROCORTICAL ACTIVITY; MOTOR INTERFERENCE; LOAD CARRIAGE; TASK DEMANDS; EEG; WALKING; PERFORMANCE; POTENTIALS; ARTIFACTS; EXERCISE	Understanding how brain dynamics change with dual cognitive and motor tasks can improve our knowledge of human neurophysiology. The primary goals of this study were to: (1) assess the feasibility of extracting electrocortical signals from scalp EEG while performing sustained, physically demanding dual-task walking and (2) test hypotheses about how the P300 event-related potential is affected by walking physical exertion. Participants walked on a treadmill for an hour either carrying an empty rucksack or one filled with 40% of their body weight. During the walking conditions and during a seated control condition, subjects periodically performed a visual oddball task. We recorded scalp EEG and examined electrocortical dynamics time-locked to the target stimulus. Channel-level event-related potential analysis demonstrated that it is feasible to extract reliable signals during long duration loaded walking. P300 amplitude was reduced during loaded walking versus seated, but there was no effect of time on task. Source level activity and frequency analysis revealed that sensorimotor, parietal, and cingulate brain areas all contributed to the reduced P300 amplitude during dual-task walking. We interpret the results as supporting a prioritization of cortical resources for walking, leading to fewer resources being directed toward the oddball task during dual-task locomotion.	[Bradford, J.

Different neuroimaging methods have been used to understand the brain substrates of locomotion in various neurological diseases (mainly in Parkinson's disease) during actual walking, and while resting (using mental imagery of gait, or brain-behavior correlation analyses). These studies, using structural (i.e., MRI) or functional (i.e., functional MRI or functional near infra-red spectroscopy) brain imaging, electrophysiology (i.e., EEG), non-invasive brain stimulation (i.e., transcranial magnetic stimulation, or transcranial direct current stimulation) or molecular imaging methods (i.e., PET, or SPECT) reveal extended brain networks involving both grey and white matters in key cortical (i.e., prefrontal cortex) and subcortical (basal ganglia and cerebellum) regions associated with locomotion. However, the specific roles of the various pathophysiological mechanisms encountered in each neurological condition on the phenotype of gait disorders still remains unclear. After reviewing the results of individual brain imaging techniques across the common neurological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, dementia, stroke, or multiple sclerosis, we will discuss how the development of new imaging techniques and computational analyses that integrate multivariate correlations in "large enough datasets" might help to understand how individual pathophysiological mechanisms express clinically as an abnormal gait. Finally, we will explore how these new analytic methods could drive our rehabilitative strategies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Interestingly, VIPS is suppressed during light finger touch to a stationary object. Here, we explored whether VIPS is mediated by parietal field activity in the dorsal visual stream as well as by activity in early visual areas, as has been suggested. We performed a mobile brain/body imaging study using high-density electroencephalographic recording from human participants (11 men and 3 women) standing during exposure to periodically reversing optic flow with and without light finger touch to a stable surface. We also performed recording their visuo-postural tracking movements as a typical visually guided movement to explore differences of cortical process of VIPS from the voluntary visuomotor process involving the dorsal stream. In the visuo-postural tracking condition, the participants moved their center of pressure in time with a slowly oscillating (expanding, shrinking) target rectangle. Source-resolved results showed that alpha band (8-13 Hz) activity in the medial and right occipital cortex during VIPS was modulated by the direction and velocity of optic flow and increased significantly during light finger touch. However, source-resolved potentials from the parietal association cortex showed no such modulation. During voluntary postural sway with feedback (but no visual flow) in which the dorsal stream is involved, sensorimotor areas produced more theta band (4-7 Hz) and less beta band (14-35 Hz) activity than during involuntary VIPS. These results suggest that VIPS involves cortical field dynamic changes in the early visual cortex rather than in the posterior parietal cortex of the visual dorsal stream.

J	Bullock, T; Elliott, JC; Serences, JT; Giesbrecht, B				Bullock, Tom; Elliott, James C.; Serences, John T.; Giesbrecht, Barry			Acute Exercise Modulates Feature-selective Responses in Human Cortex	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							MOUSE VISUAL-CORTEX; BEHAVIORAL STATE; ALPHA-BAND; WORKING-MEMORY; MACAQUE V1; ATTENTION; GAIN; LOCOMOTION; MOTION; EEG	An organism's current behavioral state influences ongoing brain activity. Nonhuman mammalian and invertebrate brains exhibit large increases in the gain of feature-selective neural responses in sensory cortex during locomotion, suggesting that the visual systembecomesmore sensitive when actively exploring the environment. This raises the possibility that human vision is also more sensitive during active movement. To investigate this possibility, we used an inverted encoding model technique to estimate feature-selective neural response profiles from EEG data acquired from participants performing an orientation discrimination task. Participants (n=18) fixated at the center of a flickering (15 Hz) circular grating presented at one of nine different orientations and monitored for a brief shift in orientation that occurred on every trial. Participants completed the task while seated on a stationary exercise bike at rest and during low- and high-intensity cycling. We found evidence for inverted-U effects; such that the peak of the reconstructed feature-selective tuning profiles was highest during low- intensity exercise compared with those estimated during rest and high-intensity exercise. When modeled, these effects were driven by changes in the gain of the tuning curve and in the profile bandwidth during low- intensity exercise relative to rest. Thus, despite profound differences in visual pathways across species, these data show that sensitivity in human visual cortex is also enhanced during locomotive behavior. Our results reveal the nature of exercise-induced gain on feature-selective coding in human sensory cortex and provide valuable evidence linking the neural mechanisms of behavior state across species.

Ambulatory non-convulsive status epilepticus evolving into a malignant form	EPILEPTIC DISORDERS			English	Article						non-convulsive status epilepticus; coma; refractory status epilepticus; anaesthetic drugs; profound sedation	REFRACTORY STATUS EPILEPTICUS; PROGNOSTIC UTILITY; CRITICALLY-ILL; EEG PATTERNS; COMA; ENCEPHALITIS; DISCHARGES; DURATION; OUTCOMES; CANCER	We retrospectively analysed the clinical characteristics, electroencephalogram (EEG) records, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, antiepileptic therapy and prognosis of a case series with ambulatory non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) which evolved into a malignant form (mNCSE). mNCSE was defined as NCSE that continues or recurs five days or more after the onset of general anaesthesia, including those cases where NCSE recurs upon reduction or withdrawal of anaesthetic therapy. Four women and two men were studied. The mean age was 42.8 years (range: 19-63 years). Two of six patients had a previous diagnosis of epilepsy. Four patients died. Two patients had a good outcome with return to consciousness and activities of daily life, and one of these subjects developed temporal lobe epilepsy. In four patients, the cause of mNCSE was encephalitis. Clinical presentation was complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE) in three patients and generalised NCSE (GNCSE) in the other three. Two of the latter had encephalitis and one was diagnosed with progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME) of Lafora type. The mean duration of the NCSE episode was 47.5 days (range: 9-139 days; SD:53.1). In three patients, continuous or rhythmic focal epileptiform discharges were the EEG pattern at onset. In the other three, continuous rhythmic generalised spike-wave, polyspike-wave or sharp slow-wave complexes were observed. Antiepileptic treatment was heterogeneous and patients were treated with an average of 6.0 AEDs (range: 3-10; SD: 3.0). In summary, mNCSE is a severe epileptic condition that occurs often in the context of encephalitis or pre-existing epilepsy. Both CPSE and GNCSE may occur. Although high mortality is associated with mNCSE, some patients may survive with normal or good recovery.

J	Puteikis, K; Wolf, P; Mameniskiene, R				Puteikis, Kristijonas; Wolf, Peter; Mameniskiene, Ruta			Accelerated long-term forgetting in adult patients with genetic generalized epilepsy	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						attention; cognitive functions; free recall; memory; neuropsychology	TEMPORAL-LOBE; MEMORY; CHILDREN; CONSOLIDATION	Objective Accelerated long-term forgetting (ALF) has been demonstrated among children but not adults with genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE). We investigated (1) how forgetting patterns of verbal and visuospatial material differ between patients with GGE and healthy controls (HCs) and (2) whether ALF is associated with ictal or interictal epileptic activity. Methods Forty-two patients with GGE (39, 92.9% experiencing seizures) were compared to 57 HCs in word, logical story, and Rey-Osterrieth complex figure recall tasks by testing after intervals of 30 min and 4 weeks. Ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG) was performed before testing to detect generalized epileptic activity, and patients were asked to document the number of seizures during the 4-week interval. Results A two-way repeated measures ANOVA indicated that individuals with GGE have different forgetting patterns in comparison to HCs in tasks of word (delay by group interaction F-1.5,F- 142.5 = 4.5, p = .02, eta p2 = .04) and figure (F-2,F- 194 = 15.9, p < .001, eta p2 = .14) but not story (F-1.6 151.1 = .5, p = .58, eta p2 = .005) recall. Last learning trial-adjusted scores of word recall were comparable between HCs and patients with epilepsy (PWEs) at 30 min (p = .21) but not at 4 weeks (p = .006). Individuals with GGE performed worse than HCs in figure recall at 30 min and 4 weeks (p < .001), with lower performance after the 4-week interval present only among seizure-positive and EEG-positive individuals (p < .001) during subgroup analysis. Performance on memory tests was unrelated to overall seizure frequency, the number of antiseizure drugs used, and epilepsy duration. Significance Our study supports the presence of ALF in a task of word recall among adult patients with GGE. The pattern of forgetting visuospatial information suggests greater forgetting of material before the first delay and ongoing deficits among PWEs with epileptic activity. Future studies should confirm our findings and investigate the functional or pathological mechanisms of memory dysfunction in GGE.

Ambulatory epileptic monitoring devices that can detect or even predict seizures play an important role for patients with intractable epilepsy. Though many EEG-based seizure detection algorithms have been proposed in the literature with high accuracy, their hardware implementations are constrained because of power consumption. Many commercial non-research EEG monitoring systems samples multiple electrodes at a relatively high rate and transmit the data either via a wire or wirelessly to an external signal processing unit. In this work, we studied how a reduced sampling precision affects the performance of our machine learning signal processing in seizure detection. To answer this question, we reduce the number of bits (precision) in an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) used in an EEG recorder. The outcome shows that the reduction of ADC precision down to 6-bit does not significantly reduce our convolutional neural network performance in detecting seizure onsets. As an indication of the performance, we achieved an area under the curve (AUC) more than 92% and above 96% on Freiburg Hospital and the Boston Children's Hospital-MIT seizure datasets, respectively. A possible reduction in ADC precision not only contribute to energy consumption reduction, particularly if the data has to be transmitted, but also offers an improved computational efficacy regarding memory requirement and circuit area.

Effects of propofol anesthesia on nonlinear properties of EEG: Lyapunov exponents and short-term predictability	4TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	4th European Conference of the International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering (ECIFMBE)	NOV 23-27, 2008	Antwerp, BELGIUM			EEG; Anesthesia; Lyapunov exponents; surrogate data testing; short-time; depth of anesthesia	TIME-SERIES; STRANGE ATTRACTORS	This paper focuses on the analysis of the short term predictability of the EEG signal after the estimation of the maximum Lyapunov exponent (MLE) of the chaotic attractor associated to the EEG signal. After clinical research and ethical committee approval and signed informed consent, EEG data was collected from 6 patients scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia and 7 ones scheduled for ambulatory endoscopic procedures. One differential channel of EEG (+ in mastoids M1/M2, - in the middle-line of the forehead FPz/AFz and referenced to F7/F8) was amplified with a gain of 10.000 (Biopac MP100-EEG100B), low-pass filtered at 300 Hz (2nd order Butterwoth) and acquired at 2.5 KHz. Data were digitally filtered (50 Hz comb filter and 120-taps linear phase FIR lowpass filter at 85 Hz) and then decimated to 250 Hz prior to analysis under OpenTstool. In order to reconstruct the associated chaotic attractor, two different approaches were followed. First, classical methods were used to find time-lag and embedding dimension. Also, a parametric swept was used for tau=1,2,3...,20 and d=2,3...6. Once the attractor was reconstructed, MLE was estimated as the finite growth rate proposed by Wessel et al., for different window lengths. Surrogate data sets were generated for validation purposes. After analyzing the data with different window lengths (250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500 and 2000 samples), finite growth rates were found to decrease with anesthesia. Embedding after formal methods did NOT offer the best discrimination among different anesthesia levels. Discrimination was very effective even with very short time series (250 samples - 1s). These results seem to indicate that finite growth rates are able of detecting the changes on brain dynamics induced by anaesthetic agents.

J	Ebner, M; Hameroff, S				Ebner, Marc; Hameroff, Stuart			Lateral Information Processing by Spiking Neurons: A Theoretical Model of the Neural Correlate of Consciousness	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							DEPENDENT ASSEMBLY FORMATION; ANALYTICALLY SOLUBLE MODEL; COLLECTIVE OSCILLATIONS; STIMULATION REWARD; COLOR CONSTANCY; PHASE SYNCHRONY; SERVO CONTROL; NETWORK; SYSTEM; CORTEX	Cognitive brain functions, for example, sensory perception, motor control and learning, are understood as computation by axonal-dendritic chemical synapses in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons. Cognitive brain functions may occur either consciously or nonconsciously (on "autopilot"). Conscious cognition is marked by gamma synchrony EEG, mediated largely by dendritic-dendritic gap junctions, sideways connections in input/integration layers. Gap-junction-connected neurons define a sub-network within a larger neural network. A theoreticalmodel (the "conscious pilot") suggests that as gap junctions open and close, a gamma-synchronized subnetwork, or zone moves through the brain as an executive agent, converting nonconscious "auto-pilot" cognition to consciousness, and enhancing computation by coherent processing and collective integration. In this study we implemented sideways "gap junctions" in a single-layer artificial neural network to perform figure/ground separation. The set of neurons connected through gap junctions form a reconfigurable resistive grid or sub-network zone. In the model, outgoing spikes are temporally integrated and spatially averaged using the fixed resistive grid set up by neurons of similar function which are connected through gap-junctions. This spatial average, essentially a feedback signal from the neuron's output, determines whether particular gap junctions between neurons will open or close. Neurons connected through open gap junctions synchronize their output spikes. We have tested our gap-junction-defined sub-network in a one-layer neural network on artificial retinal inputs using real-world images. Our system is able to perform figure/ground separation where the laterally connected sub-network of neurons represents a perceived object. Even though we only show results for visual stimuli, our approach should generalize to other modalities. The system demonstrates a moving sub-network zone of synchrony, within which the contents of perception are represented and contained. This mobile zone can be viewed as a model of the neural correlate of consciousness in the brain.

By the use of an ambulatory recorder, investigators and clinicians have more opportunity to analyze paroxysmal or sudden symptoms from the long-duration recorded signals. We propose a modular recorder that contains a motherboard, modules, and an isolated RS-232 interface. The modules have been modified to measure electrogastrogram (EGG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The compact motherboard includes a microcontroller with a built-in A/D converter, secure digital (SD) memory card, and the driven-right-leg (DRL) circuit. The power consumption of the proposed recorder is less than 2 mA (6 mW). It can continuously record a lead-II ECG signal with a 10-bit resolution for 3.9 days. As a result, the design is suitable for the purpose of long-term portable recording. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Children with epilepsy differ from their adult counterparts in many important ways, mostly related to the age-related expression of specific epilepsy syndromes. This results in many important considerations related to the epilepsy diagnosis, classification, evaluations to determine an etiology, as well as treatment guidelines. A good understanding of these factors will help to establish an accurate epilepsy diagnosis, which in turn will guide appropriate testing and treatment decisions. In this way, patients will have improved seizure outcomes, and families will be educated appropriately and provided with the most accurate prognostic information available. The purpose of this article is to review the diagnosis, work-up, and management of pediatric epilepsy.

A model with a very early development of parenchymal plaque load at the age of 2 months is the 5xFAD mouse (Tg6799, Oakley et al. 2006). These 5xFAD mice over-express both human amyloid precursor protein (APP) and human presenilin 1 (PS1). Mice from this line have a high APP expression correlating with a high burden and an accelerated accumulation of the 42 amino add species of amyloid-beta (A beta The aim of this study was the behavioral and functional investigations of 5xFAD males because in most studies females of this strain were characterized. In comparison to literature of transgenic 5xFAD females, transgenic 5xFAD males showed decreased anxiety in the elevated plus maze, reduced locomotion and exploration in the open field and disturbances in learning performance in the Morris water maze starting at 9 months of age. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings on 6 month old transgenic mice revealed a decrease of delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands whereas the subdelta frequency was increased. EEG recordings during sleep showed a reduction of rapid eye movement sleep in relation to the amount of total sleep. Thus, 5xFAD males develop early functional disturbances and subsequently behavioral deficits and therefore they are a good mouse model for studying Alzheimer's disease.

Algorithms of estimation of the main rhythms of the electroencephalograms used for the diagnosing of the functioning of the human central nervous system and the initial ambulatory screening	JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY AND ELECTRONICS			English	Article								A mathematical model and an algorithm for the statistical estimation of the frequencies of the main rhythms of human electroencephalograms (EEGs) are developed. Detailed description is presented by the example of three rhythms. A code for the computer-aided processing of EEGs, which implements this algorithm, is written. Using the statistical processing of the reliable experimental EEG sample, two criteria, which use processing of the O2-A2 signal of the patient's EEG for making the decision about the level of health of the patient's central nervous system (CNS), namely, to decide that the level of health of the patient's CNS is normal or the patient suffers from the Parkinson's disease, are formulated. After obtaining an additional information on the sample, it is possible to determine the probabilities of type one and type two errors in accepting the statistical hypotheses.

Indications and methodology for video-electroencephalographic studies in the epilepsy monitoring unit	EPILEPSIA			English	Review						epilepsy monitoring; epilepsy surgery; inpatient specialized testing; nonepileptic events		Although the epilepsy and neurology communities have position papers on a number of topics pertaining to epilepsy diagnosis and management, no current paper exists for the rationale and appropriate indications for epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) evaluation. General neurologists, hospital administrators, and insurers also have yet to fully understand the role this type of testing has in the diagnosis and management of individuals with paroxysmal neurologic symptoms. This review outlines the indications for long-term video-electroencephalography (VEEG) for typical elective admissions to a specialized inpatient setting. The common techniques used in EMUs to obtain diagnostic information are reviewed. The added benefit of safety measures and clinical testing above that available for routine or long-term ambulatory electroencephalography is also discussed. The indications for admission to the EMU include differential diagnosis of paroxysmal spells, characterization of seizure types, presurgical epilepsy evaluations, seizure quantification, monitoring medication adjustment in a safe setting, and differentiation between seizures and side effects. We conclude that the appropriate use of this specialized testing can lead to an early and correct diagnosis in a variety of clinical circumstances. The EMU evaluation is considered the gold standard test for the definitive diagnosis of epilepsy and seizure-like spells.

CHANGES IN HIPPOCAMPAL THETA RHYTHM AND THEIR CORRELATIONS WITH SPEED DURING DIFFERENT PHASES OF VOLUNTARY WHEEL RUNNING IN RATS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						wheel running; hippocampal theta rhythm; speed	SENSORIMOTOR INTEGRATION; OSCILLATIONS REFLECT; TREADMILL EXERCISE; MOTOR-ACTIVITY; SLOW ACTIVITY; HEART-RATE; EEG; BEHAVIOR; FREQUENCY; POWER	Hippocampal theta rhythm (4-12 Hz) can be observed during locomotor behavior, but findings on the relationship between locomotion speed and theta frequency are inconsistent if not contradictory. The inconsistency may be because of the difficulties that previous analyses and protocols have had excluding the effects of behavior training. We recorded the first or second voluntary wheel running each day, and assumed that theta frequency and activity are correlated with speed in different running phases. By simultaneously recording electroencephalography, physical activity, and wheel running speed, this experiment explored the theta oscillations during spontaneous running of the 12-h dark period. The recording was completely wireless and allowed the animal to run freely while being recorded in the wheel. Theta frequency and theta power of middle frequency were elevated before running and theta frequency, theta power of middle frequency, physical activity, and running speed maintained persistently high levels during running. The slopes of the theta frequency and theta activity (4-9.5 Hz) during the initial running were different compared to the same values during subsequent running. During the initial running, the running speed was positively correlated with theta frequency and with theta power of middle frequency. Over the 12-h dark period, the running speed did not positively correlate with theta frequency but was significantly correlated with theta power of middle frequency. Thus, theta frequency was associated with running speed only at the initiation of running. Furthermore, theta power of middle frequency was associated with speed and with physical activity during running when chronological order was not taken into consideration. (C) 2012 IBRO.

The CMAE can be considered as an operational transconductance amplifier, which modulates the supply current by input voltage signal through its two supply rails. The CMAE prototype is implemented with only two discrete op-amps for ECG and EEG recording with current consumption of 60 mu A and 100 mu A, respectively. The CMAE's built-in preamplifier has utilized a dc feedback loop, instead of the conventional dc servo loop, which suppresses electrode offset in almost rail-to-rail. Total input-referred noise voltages of the ECG and EEG type CMAEs are 3.9 mu V-RMS and 0.7 mu V-RMS, respectively, in 0.5-100 Hz bandwidth. By using bipolar pseudoresistors, sub-hertz high-pass corner frequency but with fast settling time is achieved. The common-mode noise due to the disparate channels imbalances is digitally rejected by using an online adaptive noise canceler, which boosts the common-mode rejection ratio up to 120 dB with assisting the driven right leg circuit.

EPILEPSY CURRENTS			English	Editorial Material							TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY	Objective: To describe seizure outcomes in patients with medically refractory epilepsy who had evidence of bilateral mesial temporal lobe (MTL) seizure onsets and underwent MTL resection based on chronic ambulatory intracranial EEG (ICEEG) data from a direct brain-responsive neurostimulator (RNS) system. Methods: We retrospectively identified all patients at 17 epilepsy centers with MTL epilepsy who were treated with the RNS system using bilateral MTL leads, and in whom an MTL resection was subsequently performed. Presumed lateralization based on routine presurgical approaches was compared to lateralization determined by RNS system chronic ambulatory ICEEG recordings. The primary outcome was frequency of disabling seizures at last 3-month follow-up after MTL resection compared to seizure frequency 3 months before MTL resection. Results: We identified 157 patients treated with the RNS system with bilateral MTL leads due to presumed bitemporal epilepsy. Twenty-five (16%) patients subsequently had an MTL resection informed by chronic ambulatory ICEEG (mean = 42 months ICEEG); follow-up was available for 24 patients. After MTL resection, the median reduction in disabling seizures at last follow-up was 100% (mean: 94%; range: 50%-100%). Nine (38%) patients had exclusively unilateral electrographic seizures recorded by chronic ambulatory ICEEG and all were seizure-free at last follow-up after MTL resection; 8 of 9 continued RNS system treatment. Fifteen (62%) patients had bilateral MTL electrographic seizures, had an MTL resection on the more active side, continued RNS system treatment, and achieved a median clinical seizure reduction of 100% (mean: 90%; range: 50%-100%) at last follow-up, with 8 of 15 seizure-free. For those with more than 1 year of follow-up (N = 21), 15 (71%) patients were seizure-free during the most recent year, including all 8 patients with unilateral onsets and 7 (54%) of 13 patients with bilateral onsets. Significance: Chronic ambulatory ICEEG data provide information about lateralization of MTL seizures and can identify additional patients who may benefit from MTL resection.											10	1	1	1	1	SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC	THOUSAND OAKS	2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA	1535-7597	1535-7511		EPILEPSY CURR	Epilepsy Curr.

Sleep fragmentation in the form of multiple arousals is associated with daytime somnolence and cognitive impairment; however, manual scoring of arousal is time consuming and problematic due to relatively high inter-scorer variability. We have recently shown that automated analysis of in-lab recorded peripheral arterial tone (PAT) signal and the pulse rate derived from it can accurately assess arousals from sleep as defined by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM). In the current study we sought to extend these findings to the Watch_PAT100 (WP100), an ambulatory device measuring PAT, oximetry and actigraphy. Methods: Sixty-eight subjects (61 patients referred to the sleep lab with suspected obstructive sleep apnea and seven healthy volunteers, mean age 46.3 +/- 14.2 years) underwent a whole night polysomnography (PSG) with simultaneous recording of PAT signal by the ambulatory WP100 device. The PSG recordings were blindly manually analyzed for arousals based on AASM criteria, while PAT was scored automatically based on the algorithm developed previously. Results: There was a significant correlation between AASM arousals derived from the PSG and PAT autonomic arousals derived from the WP100 (R = 0.87, P < 0.001), with a good agreement across a wide range of values. The sensitivity and specificity of PAT in detecting patients with at least 20 arousals per hour of sleep were 0.80 and 0.79, respectively, with a receiver operating characteristic curve having an area under the curve of 0.87. Conclusions: We conclude that automatic analysis of peripheral arterial tonometry signal derived from the ambulatory device Watch_PAT100 can accurately identify arousals from sleep in a simple and time saving fashion.

Does the locomotion technique matter in an immersive virtual store environment? - Comparing motion-tracked walking and instant teleportation	JOURNAL OF RETAILING AND CONSUMER SERVICES			English	Article						Virtual reality; Shopper behaviour; Embodied cognition	CONSUMER; BRANDS; ENGAGEMENT; COGNITION; EMOTIONS; BEHAVIOR; STRESS; CHOICE; AR	Immersive virtual reality shopping environments may use a variety of locomotion techniques. Currently the most prominent are instant teleportation and motion-tracked walking. Motion-tracked walking more closely mimics natural shopping behaviour as it allows a shopper to physically walk through the virtual store; however, it requires a larger space and has design and cost implications. Instant teleportation is likely to be cheaper and to enable larger store formats; yet it is unknown whether the choice of instant teleportation results in different in store behaviour by shoppers. Our research examines whether instant teleportation provides a feasible design alternative to motion-tracked walking by determining whether it does result in altered shopper behaviour. Using a split sample experiment in a purpose-built immersive VR convenience store, we compare shoppers' emotional states (engagement, excitement and stress, measured through electroencephalography), purchase behaviour metrics, and store coverage (represented by heat maps) between motion-tracked walking and instant teleportation locomotion techniques. Results demonstrate that the absence of physical walking had no impact on emotional states or the investigated shopping outcomes. While instant teleportation led to some skipped shelf sections, there was no impact observed on the number of unplanned purchases. To the extent that the naturalism of immersive VR relies on proprioceptive engagement or embodied cognition, this appears to be adequately supported by upper body movements that do not require physical walking. These findings provide fresh insights for the design of Virtual Reality shopping environments for market research or future online-retailing platforms.

Different assistive technologies are used to improve the physical and mental health of the affected patients. Exoskeletons have emerged as one of the most promising technology to provide movement and rehabilitation for the paralyzed. But exoskeletons are limited by the constraints of weight, flexibility, and adaptability. To resolve these issues, we propose an adaptive and flexible Brain Energized Full Body Exoskeleton (BFBE) for assisting the paralyzed people. This paper describes the design, control, and testing of BFBE with 15 degrees of freedom (DoF) for assisting the users in their daily activities. The flexibility is incorporated into the system by a modular design approach. The brain signals captured by the Electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors are used for controlling the movements of BFBE. The processing happens at the edge, reducing delay in decision making and the system is further integrated with an IoT module that helps to send an alert message to multiple caregivers in case of an emergency. The potential energy harvesting is used in the system to solve the power issues related to the exoskeleton. The stability in the gait cycle is ensured by using adaptive sensory feedback. The system validation is done by using six natural movements on ten different paralyzed persons. The system recognizes human intensions with an accuracy of 85%. The result shows that BFBE can be an efficient method for providing assistance and rehabilitation for paralyzed patients.

Here we generated and characterized a Shank3 knock-in mouse line carrying the Q321R mutation (Shank3(Q)(321R) mice) identified in a human individual with ASD that affects the ankyrin repeat region (ARR) domain of the Shank3 protein. Homozygous Shank3(Q)(321R)(/)(Q321R) mice show a selective decrease in the level of Shank3a, an ARR-containing protein variant, but not other variants. CA1 pyramidal neurons in the Shank3(Q321R)(/)(Q321R) hippocampus show decreased neuronal excitability but normal excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. Behaviorally, Shank3(Q321R)(/Q)(321R) mice show moderately enhanced self-grooming and anxiolytic-like behavior, but normal locomotion, social interaction, and object recognition and contextual fear memory. In addition, these mice show abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns and decreased susceptibility to induced seizures. These results indicate that the Q321R mutation alters Shank3 protein stability, neuronal excitability, repetitive and anxiety-like behavior, EEG patterns, and seizure susceptibility in mice.

In the present study, we investigated cortical activity during lower limb movement using EEG. Assisted by a dynamic tilt table, all subjects performed standardized stepping movements in an upright position. Source localization of the movement-related potential in relation to spontaneous EEG showed activity in brain regions classically associated with human gait such as the primary motor cortex, the premotor cortex, the supplementary motor cortex, the cingulate cortex, the primary somatosensory cortex and the somatosensory association cortex. Further, we observed a task-related power decrease in the alpha and beta frequency band at electrodes overlying the leg motor area. A temporal activation and deactivation of the involved brain regions as well as the chronological sequence of the movement-related potential could be mapped to specific phases of the gait-like leg movement. We showed that most cortical capacity is needed for changing the direction between the flexion and extension phase. An enhanced understanding of the human gait will provide a basis to improve applications in the field of neurorehabilitation and brain-computer interfaces.

However, the present pharmacotherapy is greatly limited by adverse effects, so it is necessary to explore new drugs for the treatment of insomnia. Radix Bupleuri (RB) has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for >2000 years; it has many pharmacological effects, including sedation and anticonvulsant properties. The present study investigated the effects of saikosaponin a (SSa), an active component of RB, on sleep and locomotion. Male C57BL/6j mice received intraperitoneal injections of SSa at three different dosages (0.625, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg). Sleep parameters were analysed by electroencephalography and electromyography. The open-field test was used to measure locomotor activities. Our present results showed that SSa treatment significantly increased the duration of non-rapid eye movement sleep and shortened sleep latency in a dose-dependent manner. A high dose of SSa (2.5 mg/kg) also decreased locomotor activities. Moreover, by measuring c-Fos expression and the calcium signal in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), we found that SSa treatment decreased neuronal activity in the LH. In conclusion, SSa might be the sleep-promoting component in RB and its mechanism may be related to the modulation of neuronal activity in the LH.

While the probabilistic properties of random graphs has been extensively studied, the development of statistical inference methods for this class of objects has received less attention. In this work we propose a non-parametric test of hypotheses to test if a sample of random graphs was generated by a given probability distribution (one-sample test) or if two samples of random graphs were originated from the same probability distribution (two-sample test). We prove a Central Limit Theorem providing the asymptotic distribution of the test statistics and we propose a method to compute the quantiles of the finite sample distributions by simulation. The test makes no assumption on the specific form of the distributions and it is consistent against any alternative hypotheses that differs from the sample distribution on at least one edge-marginal. Moreover, we show that the test is a Kolmogorov-Smirnov type test, for a given distance between graphs, and we study its performance on simulated data. We apply it to compare graphs of brain functional network interactions built from electroencephalographic (EEG) data collected during the visualization of point light displays depicting human locomotion.

However, the origins of this phenomenon remain relatively poorly understood. The present research examined the joint and independent contributions of two fundamental motivational systems behavioural approach and inhibition systems (BAS and BIS) to lateral spatial bias in a locomotion task. Participants completed self-report measures of trait BPS and BIS, then repeatedly traversed a room, blindfolded, aiming for a straight line. We obtained locomotion data from motion tracking to capture variations in the walking trajectories. Overall, walking trajectories deviated to the left, and this tendency was more pronounced with increasing BIS scores. Meanwhile, BAS was associated with relative rightward tendencies when BIS was low, but not when BIS was high. These results demonstrate for the first time an association between BIS and lateral spatial bias independently of variations in BAS. The findings also contribute to clarify the circumstances in which BAS is associated with a rightward bias. We discuss the implications of these findings for the neurobiological underpinnings of BIS and for the literature on spatial bias. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We have developed a fourth-generation ambulatory near infrared spectroscopy device, namely NINscan 4. NINscan 4 enables recording of brain function (via cerebral hemodynamics), systemic hemodynamics, electrocardiography, and actigraphy simultaneously and continuously for up to 24 h at 250-Hz sampling rate, during (and with minor restriction to) daily activities. We present initial 24-h human subject test results, with example analysis including (1) comparison of cerebral perfusion and oxygenation changes during wakefulness and sleep over a 24-h period and (2) capturing of hemodynamic changes prior, during and after sudden waken up in the night during sleep. These results demonstrate the first ambulatory 24-h cerebral and systemic hemodynamics monitoring, and its unique advantages including long-term data collection and analysis capability, ability to catch unpredictable transient events during activities of daily living, as well as coregistered multimodality analysis capabilities. These results also demonstrate that NINscan 4's motion artifact at 1-g head movement is smaller than physiological hemodynamic fluctuations during motionless sleep. The broader potential of this technology is also discussed.

Influence of the menopausal transition on polysomnographic sleep characteristics: a longitudinal analysis	SLEEP			English	Article						spectral analysis; polysomnography; sleep; beta power; menopause; midlife women	NREM SLEEP; EEG POWER; INSOMNIA; MIDLIFE; DISTURBANCE; SYMPTOMS; QUALITY; WOMEN	Study Objectives: To evaluate how change in menopausal status related to spectral analysis and polysomnographic measures of sleep characteristics. Methods: The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) Ancillary Sleep Study evaluated sleep characteristics of 159 women who were initially pre- or early perimenopausal and repeated the assessment about 31/2 years later when 38 were pre- or early perimenopausal, 31 late perimenopausal, and 90 postmenopausal. Participants underwent in-home ambulatory polysomnography for two to three nights. Average EEG power in the delta and beta frequency bands was calculated during NREM and REM sleep, and sleep duration, wake after sleep onset (WASO), and apnea hypopnea index (AHI) were based on visually-scored sleep. Results: The women who transitioned to postmenopause had increased beta NREM EEG power at the second assessment, compared to women who remained pre-or early premenopausal; no other sleep measures varied by change in menopausal status. In multivariate models the associations remained; statistical controls for self-reported hot flashes did not explain findings. In secondary analysis, NREM beta power at the second assessment was greater among women who transitioned into the postmenopause after adjustments for initial NREM beta power. Conclusions: Sleep duration and WASO did not vary by menopause transition group across assessments. Consistent with prior cross-sectional analysis, elevated beta EEG power in NREM sleep was apparent among women who transitioned to postmenopause, suggesting that independent of self-reported hot flashes, the menopausal transition is associated with physiological hyperarousal during sleep.

J	Corbetta, D; Friedman, DR; Bell, MA				Corbetta, Daniela; Friedman, Denise R.; Bell, Martha Ann			Brain reorganization as a function of walking experience in 12-month-old infants: implications for the development of manual laterality	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						brain reorganization; human infants; reaching; walking; manual laterality; EEG coherence	PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; EEG COHERENCE; BIMANUAL COORDINATION; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; CHRONIC STROKE; REACHING TASK; TOOL USE; HANDEDNESS; PERFORMANCE; ACQUISITION	Hand preference in infancy is marked by many developmental shifts in hand use and arm coupling as infants reach for and manipulate objects. Research has linked these early shifts in hand use to the emergence of fundamental postural locomotor milestones. Specifically, it was found that bimanual reaching declines when infants learn to sit; increases if infants begin to scoot in a sitting posture; declines when infants begin to crawl on hands and knees; and increases again when infants start walking upright. Why such pattern fluctuations during periods of postural locomotor learning? One proposed hypothesis is that arm use practiced for the specific purpose of controlling posture and achieving locomotion transfers to reaching via brain functional reorganization. There has been scientific support for functional cortical reorganization and change in neural connectivity in response to motor practice in adults and animals, and as a function of crawling experience in human infants. In this research, we examined whether changes in neural connectivity also occurred as infants coupled their arms when learning to walk and whether such coupling mapped onto reaching laterality. Electroencephalogram (EEG) coherence data were collected from 43 12-month-old infants with varied levels of walking experience. EEG was recorded during quiet, attentive baseline. Walking proficiency was laboratory assessed and reaching responses were captured using small toys presented at mid-line while infants were sitting. Results revealed greater EEG coherence at homologous prefrontal/central scalp locations for the novice walkers compared to the prewalkers or more experienced walkers. In addition, reaching laterality was low in prewalkers and early walkers but high in experienced walkers. These results are consistent with the interpretation that arm coupling practiced during early walking transferred to reaching via brain functional reorganization, leading to the observed developmental changes in manual laterality.

Validation of a multidirectional locomotive dual-task paradigm to evaluate task-related differences in event-related electro-cortical activity	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Event-related potentials; Dual-task; Walking; Locomotion	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; WALKING; P300; ERP; INTERFERENCE; BRAIN; EEG; COMPONENT; SYSTEM; GAIT	A fundamental aspect of everyday function is the ability to simultaneously execute both cognitive and motor tasks. The ability to perform such tasks is commonly assessed using a dual-task paradigm that has the capacity to manipulate both cognitive and motor components of an action. Dual-task performance provides an opportunity to obtain an insight into how cognitive and motor function are affected during natural tasks (e.g., locomotion). The following study aimed to determine the effectiveness of using a goal-directed multidirectional locomotor task to measure differences in task-related (tasks of increasing difficulty) electro-cortical activity. In the single-task condition participants walked around a grid-based track, performing directional changes at each intersection in response to a sensory stimulus. In the dual-task condition participants performed the same primary task while performing a simultaneous memory recall task. Behavioural differences in trial completion time and electro-cortical activity were identified in relation to the posterior N2 and P3 component mean amplitudes. The results showed that, while performing a higher-level cognitive task during walking (dual-task), interference arises in a shared system that influences neural mechanisms involved in attention and selection for action, and later cognitive processes recruited in working memory and cognitive control. This study extends previous work and shows that performing a more complex cognitive task while walking, elicits interference effects sensitive to higher-level cognitive processes, and takes the next step towards measurement of electro-cortical activity within naturalistic environments.

(almond) has been traditionally used as a natural medicine in the treatment of various diseases. The present research studied the sedative and hypnotic effects of the aqueous fraction of seeds of almond in rats. In order to investigate these effects, a combination of behavioral methods (open field test and loss of righting reflex test) as well as quantitative and analytic methods (EEG and EMG) were applied. The results of the open field test showed that a dose of 400 mg/kg of the almond extract significantly inhibited the locomotion activity of rats compared to normal. The results also illustrated that the almond extract affected pentobarbital-induced sleep through increasing the number of fallings asleep and prolongation of sleeping time. Analysis of EEG recordings of the animals which had received the same dose of the almond extract as the open field test demonstrated marked changes in the animals' sleep architecture. Significant prolongation of total sleeping time as well as significant increase in NREM sleep were the main observed changes compared to the normal condition. These results suggest that the aqueous extract of almond has significant sedative and hypnotic effects, which may support its therapeutic use for insomnia.

Although theta has been extensively studied in freely moving rodents, its presence in humans has been elusive and primarily investigated in stationary subjects. Here we used a unique clinical opportunity to examine theta within the human MTL during untethered, real-world ambulatory movement. We recorded intracranial electroencephalographic activity from participants chronically implanted with the wireless NeuroPace responsive neurostimulator (RNS) and tracked their motion with sub-millimeter precision. Our data revealed that movement-related theta oscillations indeed exist in humans, such that theta power is significantly higher during movement than immobility. Unlike in rodents, however, theta occurs in short bouts, with average durations of similar to 400 ms, which are more prevalent during fast versus slow movements. In a rare opportunity to study a congenitally blind participant, we found that both the prevalence and duration of theta bouts were increased relative to the sighted participants. These results provide critical support for conserved neurobiological characteristics of theta oscillations during ambulatory spatial navigation, while highlighting some fundamental differences across species in these oscillations between humans and rodents.

The concept is heavily reliant on technology and in particular remote physiological monitoring. One of the principal challenges is the maintenance of high quality data streams which must be collected with minimally intrusive, inexpensive sensor systems operating in difficult conditions. Ambulatory monitoring represents one of the most challenging signal acquisition challenges of all in that data is collected as the patient engages in normal activities of everyday living. Data thus collected suffers from considerable corruption as a result of artifact, much of it induced by motion and this has a bearing on its utility for diagnostic purposes. We propose a model for ambulatory signal recording in which the data collected is accompanied by labeling indicating the quality of the collected signal. As motion is such an important source of artifact we demonstrate the concept in this case with a quality of signal measure derived from motion sensing technology viz. accelerometers. We further demonstrate how different types of artifact might be tagged to inform artifact reduction signal processing elements during subsequent signal analysis. This is demonstrated through the use of multiple accelerometers which allow the algorithm to distinguish between disturbance of the sensor relative to the underlying tissue and movement of this tissue. A brain monitoring experiment utilizing EEG and fNIRS is used to illustrate the concept.

A simple equation that measured neurophysiological effects of alcohol in the first group of 15 participants performing repetitive cognitive tasks was applied to a second group of 15 operating an automobile driving simulator, and to a third group of 10 ambulatory people recorded simultaneously during a cocktail party. The equation derived from the first group quantified alcohol's effect by combining measures of higher frequency (beta) and lower frequency (theta) power into a single score. It produced an Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristic Curve of .73 (p<.05; 67% sensitivity in recognizing alcohol and 87% specificity in recognizing placebo). Applying the same equation to the second group operating the driving simulator, AUC was .95, (p<.0001; 93% sensitivity and 73% specificity), while for the cocktail party group AUC was .87 (p<.01; 80% sensitivity and 80% specificity). EEG scores were significantly related to breath alcohol content in all studies. Some individuals differed markedly from the overall response evident in their respective groups. The feasibility of measuring the neurophysiological effect of a psychoactive substance from an entire group of ambulatory people at a cocktail party suggests that future studies may be able to fruitfully apply brain function measures derived under rigorously controlled laboratory conditions to assess drug effects on groups of people interacting in real world situations.

J	Kittner, H; Krugel, U; Hoffmann, E; Illes, P				Kittner, H; Krugel, U; Hoffmann, E; Illes, P			Effects of intra-accumbens injection of 2-methylthio ATP: a combined open field and electroencephalographic study in rats	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						2-methylthio ATP; nucleus accumbens; EEG power spectrum; locomotor activity; P-2 receptor; dopamine D-1 receptor; dopamine D-2 receptor	NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY; DOPAMINE-RECEPTORS; AUTONOMIC NEUROTRANSMISSION; P-2X PURINOCEPTORS; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; D-AMPHETAMINE; IN-VIVO; BRAIN; STIMULATION	Rationale: Previous experiments have shown that P-2 receptor activation increases the release of dopamine in the mesolimbic mesocortical system. Objective: In order to investigate the functional correlates of dopaminergic stimulation, EEG and behavioural responses to injection of the P-2 receptor agonist 2-methylthio ATP (2-MeSATP) into the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of rats were investigated. Methods: EEG electrodes were positioned into the NAc together with the guide cannula for intracerebral injection. Behavioural analysis was performed in an open field cage and was evaluated by a video activity measurement system. Rats were assigned to separate groups that were given artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) or drug treatment. Results: 2-MeSATP significantly extended the period of locomotor activity in the novel environment. The quantitative EEG was characterized by an elevation of the power in the alpha-1 range and a decrease in power in the delta range. The P2 receptor antagonists reactive blue 2 but not pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2 '4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS) also enhanced locomotion when given alone, and elevated the alpha-1 and beta-2 bands. Both antagonists abolished the locomotor and EEG responses to 2-MeSATP. The dopamine D-1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 and the D-2/D-3 receptor antagonist sulpiride did not alter locomotor activity when given either alone or in combination. Only sulpiride and especially sulpiride in combination with SCH 23390 prevented the effect of 2-MeSATP. Sulpiride produced a selective increase in the alpha-1 band of the power spectrum whereas SCH '3390 elevated the power of the alpha-1, alpha-2 and beta-1 activities. Neither antagonist inhibited the effect of 2-MeSATP on the EEG when applied separately; however, the coadministration of SCH 23390 and sulpiride abolished the 2-MeSATP-induced alteration of power distribution. After a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced lesion of the accumbal dopaminergic terminals, 2-MeSATP failed to enhance the locomotor activity and to induce the characteristic EEG changes. Conclusions: The observed alterations in open field behaviour and quantitative EEG after injection of 2-MeSATP into the NAc may be mostly due to P-2 receptor-mediated dopamine release and subsequent receptor activation.

However, these approaches are restricted mainly to hospital setting and requires video/EEG analysis by experts, which makes these approaches resource- nd labor-intensive. In contrast, we aim to develop a wireless remote monitoring system based on a single wrist-worn accelerometer device, which is sensitive to multiple types of convulsive seizures and is capable of detecting seizures with short duration. Simple time domain features including a new set of Poincare plot based features were extracted from the active movement events recorded using a wrist-worn accelerometer device. The best features were then selected using the area under the ROC curve analysis. Kernelized support vector data description was then used to classify nonseizure and seizure events. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on 5576 h of recordings from 79 patients and detected 40 (86.95%) of 46 convulsive seizures (generalized tonic-clonic (GTCS), psychogenic nonepileptic, and complex partial seizures) from 20 patients with a total of 270 false alarms (1.16/24 h). Furthermore, the algorithm showed a comparable performance (sensitivity 95.23% and false alarm rate 0.64/24 h) with respect to existing unimodal and multimodal methods for GTCS detection. The promising results shows the potential to build an ambulatory monitoring convulsive seizure detection system. A wearable accelerometer based seizure detection system would aid in continuous assessment of convulsive seizures in a timely and non-invasive manner.

The automatic method is based on a two-channel electro-oculography (EOG) with left mastoid (M1) as reference. An automatic estimation of slow eye movements (SEM) was developed and used as the main criterion to separate sleep stage 1 (S1) from wakefulness. Additionally synchronous electroencephalographic (EEG) activity of sleep stages I and 2 was detected by calculating cross-correlation and amplitude difference in the 1.5-6 Hz theta band between the two EOG channels. Alpha power 8-12 Hz and beta power 18-30 Hz were used to determine wakefulness. Unintentional sleep onsets were studied using data from four separate maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) sessions of 228 subjects. The automatic scoring of 30 s sleep onset epochs using only EOG was compared to standard visual sleep stage scoring. The optimal detection thresholds were derived using data from 114 subjects and then applied to the data from different 114 subjects. Cohen's Kappa between the visual and the new automatic scoring system in separating wakefulness and sleep was substantial (0.67) with epoch by epoch agreement of 98%. The sleep epoch detection sensitivity was 70% and specificity 99%. The results are provided with a 1 s delay for each 30 s epoch. The developed method has to be tested in field applications. The advantage of the automatic method is that it could be applied during online recordings using only four disposable self-adhesive self-applicable electrodes. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this review is to summarize information on ambulatory seizure detection, seizure prediction, and status epilepticus prevention. Method: Narrative review. Results: Seizure detection devices are currently under investigation with regards to utility and feasibility in the detection of isolated seizures, mainly in adult patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, in long-term epilepsy monitoring units, and occasionally in the outpatient setting. Detection modalities include accelerometry, electrocardiogram, electrodermal activity, electroencephalogram, mattress sensors, surface electromyography, video detection systems, gyroscope, peripheral temperature, photoplethysmography, and respiratory sensors, among others. Initial detection results are promising, and improve even further, when several modalities are combined. Some portable devices have already been U.S. FDA approved to detect specific seizures. Improved seizure prediction may be attainable in the future given that epileptic seizure occurrence follows complex patient-specific non-random patterns. The combination of multimodal monitoring devices, big data sets, and machine learning may enhance patient-specific detection and predictive algorithms. The integration of these technological advances and novel approaches into closed-loop warning and treatment systems in the ambulatory setting may help detect seizures sooner, and tentatively prevent status epilepticus in the future. Conclusions: Ambulatory monitoring systems are being developed to improve seizure detection and the quality of life in patients with epilepsy and their families.

Iatrogenic bradycardia-asystole as a complication of an intracranial Ommaya reservoir	JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Intracranial catheter; iatrogenic; bradycardia-asystole		We report a case of a previously unreported complication of an intracranial Ommaya reservoir catheter causing paroxysmal episodes of bradycardia-asystole and syncope as a result of migration of the catheter tip into the left temporal lobe. These episodes were captured on ambulatory electroencephalography as syncopal events, but with interictal left temporal epileptiform discharges. These events promptly resolved after repositioning the catheter. There was a recurrence of these events 1 yr later, associated with remigration of the catheter tip into the left temporal lobe, necessitating removal of the Ommaya reservoir, rendering the patient symptom free. This is the first reported case of an iatrogenic and possibly ictal bradycardia-asystole syndrome and underpins the importance of considering migration of indwelling intracranial catheters into sensitive regions of the cortex as a possible cause of paroxysmal episodes.

The alternative surgical treatment for these patients in Japan has been vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Besides VNS, epileptologists in the United States can choose a novel palliative option called responsive neurostimulation (RNS), a dosed-loop neuromodulation system approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2013. The RNS System continuously monitors neural electroencephalography (EEG) activity at the possible seizure onset zone (SOZ) where electrodes are placed and responds with electrical stimulation when a pre-defined epileptic activity is detected. The controlled clinical trials in the United States have demonstrated long-term utility and safety of the RNS System. Seizure reduction rates have continued to improve over time, reaching 75% over 9 years of treatment. The incidence of implant-site infection, the most frequent device-related adverse event, is similar to those of other neuromodulation devices. The RNS System has shown favorable efficacy for both mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and neocortical epilepsy of the eloquent cortex. Another unique advantage of the RNS System is its ability to provide chronic monitoring of ambulatory electrocorticography (ECoG). Valuable information obtained from ECoG monitoring provides a better understanding of the state of epilepsy in each patient and improves clinical management. This article reviews the developmental history, structure, and clinical utility of the RNS System, and discusses its indications as a novel palliative option for drug-resistant epilepsy.

For example, channels that conduct the N-type Ca2+ current possess the alpha(1B) subunit (Ca(v)2.2), which has been localized, inter alia, to the piriform cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe, thalamic nuclei, and granular layer of the cortex. Some of these regions have been previously implicated in metabolic and vigilance state control, and selective block of the N-type Ca2+ channel causes circadian rhythm disruption. In this study of Ca(v)2.2(-/-) knock-out mice, we examined potential differences in feeding behavior, spontaneous locomotion, and the sleep-wake cycle. Ca(v)2.2(-/-) mice did not display an overt metabolic phenotype but were hyperactive, demonstrating a 20% increase in activity under novel conditions and a 95% increase in activity under habituated conditions during the dark phase, compared with wild-type littermates. Ca(v)2.2(-/-) mice also displayed vigilance state differences during the light phase, including increased consolidation of rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep and increased intervals between non-REM (NREM) and wakefulness episodes. EEG spectral power was increased during wakefulness and REM sleep and was decreased during NREM sleep in Ca(v)2.2(-/-) mice. These results indicate a role of the N-type Ca2+ channel in activity and vigilance state control, which we interpret in terms of effects on neurotransmitter release.

Stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) was originally developed by Talairach and Bancaud at Hospital Sainte-Anne in the middle of the 20th century. SEEG has survived, and is now being recognized once again, especially with the development of neurosurgical robots. Many epilepsy centers have already replaced invasive monitoring with subdural electrodes (SDEs) by SEEG with depth electrodes worldwide. SEEG has advantages in terms of complication rates as shown in the previous reports. However, it would be more indispensable to demonstrate how much SEEG has contributed to improving seizure outcomes in epilepsy surgery. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been an only implantable device since 1990s, and has obtained the autostimulation mode which responds to ictal tachycardia. In addition to VNS, responsive neurostimulator (RNS) joined in the options of palliative treatment for medically refractory epilepsy. RNS is winning popularity in the United States because the device has abilities of both neurostimulation and recording of ambulatory electrocorticography (ECoG). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has also attained approval as an adjunctive therapy in Europe and the United States. Ablative procedures such as SEEG-guided radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RF-TC) and laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) have been developed as less invasive options in epilepsy surgery. There will be more alternatives and tools in this field than ever before. Consequently, we will need to define benefits, indications, and limitations of these new technologies and concepts while adjusting ourselves to a period of fundamental transition in our foreseeable future.

On the influence of the day of the week on objective and self-rated sleep quality of adults	SOMNOLOGIE			English	Article						Social jetlag; Sleep latency; Subjective sleep quality; Polysomnography; Sleep log	SOCIAL JETLAG; PERFORMANCE; INSTRUMENT; PATTERNS; TIME; LIFE	Background and objective The extent to which adult sleep varies depending on the day of the week has not yet been systematically investigated with electroencephalography (EEG) data. Whether such effects exist and whether they are related to age, gender, and employment status was retrospectively analyzed based on data from an experimental double-blind cross-over study in which effects of electromagnetic fields of a cell phone base station on the sleep of a general rural population had been examined. Methods The sleep of 397 adults (age 45.0 +/- 14.2 years, range 18-81 years; 50.9% women) from ten different rural German villages was recorded for 12 nights with ambulatory devices. Self-reported sleep quality was recorded in morning and evening protocols. Friedman tests were used for statistical analysis of the comparison between the days, and the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for pairwise comparisons of independent parameters between groups. Results For the present analysis, data from 335 participants were considered. Overall, the differences between nights were small and the quality of sleep was good. Three of the five objective and all six self-rated sleep parameters differed significantly between the days of the week. While the objective and the self-estimated total sleep time were longest on Sunday nights, the qualitatively poorest values occurred on Monday nights. People who worked fulltime had the longest sleep latencies on Sunday nights. Friday nights were rated the best. Conclusion The objective and self-rated sleep quality varied relatively little in a rural adult population over the course of the week, being worst on Monday nights and best on Friday nights.

Prolonged sleep fragmentation of mice exacerbates febrile responses to lipopolysaccharide	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Rodent; LPS; Stress; Inflammation; Fever	METABOLIC CONSEQUENCES; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; IMMUNE INTERACTIONS; WAKE BEHAVIOR; DEPRIVATION; EEG; RAT; DISTURBANCES; POWER; TEMPERATURE	Background: Sleep disruption is a frequent occurrence in modern society. Whereas many studies have focused on the consequences of total sleep deprivation, few have investigated the condition of sleep disruption. New method: We disrupted sleep of mice during the light period for 9 consecutive days using an intermittently rotating disc. Results: Electroencephalogram (EEG) data demonstrated that non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep was severely fragmented and REM sleep was essentially abolished during the 12 h light period. During the dark period, when sleep was not disrupted, neither NREM sleep nor REM sleep times differed from control values. Analysis of the EEG revealed a trend for increased power in the peak frequency of the NREM EEG spectra during the dark period. The fragmentation protocol was not overly stressful as body weights and water consumption remained unchanged, and plasma corticosterone did not differ between mice subjected to 3 or 9 days of sleep disruption and home cage controls. However, mice subjected to 9 days of sleep disruption by this method responded to lipopolysaccharide with an exacerbated febrile response. Comparison with existing methods: Existing methods to disrupt sleep of laboratory rodents often subject the animal to excessive locomotion, vibration, or sudden movements. This method does not suffer from any of these confounds. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that prolonged sleep disruption of mice exacerbates febrile responses to lipopolysaccharide. This device provides a method to determine mechanisms by which chronic insufficient sleep contributes to the etiology of many pathologies, particularly those with an inflammatory component.

Many studies have shown that efficient motor actions are associated with mu rhythm (8-13 Hz) and beta band (13-35 Hz) local field desynchronizations in sensorimotor and parietal cortex, whereas a number of cognitive task studies have reported higher behavioral accuracy to be associated with increases in beta band power in prefrontal and sensory cortex. How these two distinct patterns of beta band oscillations interplay during gait adaptation, however, has not been established. Here we recorded 108 channel EEG activity from 18 participants (10 males, 22-35 years old) attempting to walk on a treadmill in synchrony with a series of pacing cue tones, and quickly adapting their step rate and length to sudden shifts in pacing cue tempo. Independent component analysis parsed each participant's EEG data into maximally independent component (IC) source processes, which were then grouped across participants into distinct spatial/spectral clusters. Following cue tempo shifts, mean beta band power was suppressed for IC sources in central midline and parietal regions, whereas mean beta band power increased in IC sources in or near medial prefrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex IC cluster, the beta band power increase was stronger during (more effortful) step shortening than during step lengthening. These results thus show that two distinct patterns of beta band activity modulation accompany gait adaptations: one likely serving movement initiation and execution; and the other, motor control and inhibition.

A combination of visual evoked potential (VEP) analyses and analyses of temporal spectral evolution (TSE, time-dependent spectral power) was carried out. Significant differences were found for the N2 component of VEP for optic flow versus random visual motion within and between groups. Both adults and infants showed shorter latencies for structured optic flow than random visual motion, and infants showed longer latencies, particularly for random visual motion, and larger amplitudes than adults. Both groups also showed significant differences in induced activity when TSE of the two motion stimuli (optic flow and random visual motion) was compared with TSE of a static dot pattern. Infants showed an induced decrease in the amplitudes in theta-band frequency, while adults showed an induced increase in beta-band frequency. Differences in induced activity for the two motion stimuli could, however, not be observed. Brain activity related to motion stimuli is different for infants and adults and the differences are observed both in VEPs and in induced activity of the EEG. To investigate how changes in locomotor development are related to accompanying changes in brain activity associated with visual motion perception, more data of infants with different experiences in self-produced locomotion are required.

Effects of propofol anesthesia on nonlinear properties of EEG: Time-lag and embedding dimension	4TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	4th European Conference of the International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering (ECIFMBE)	NOV 23-27, 2008	Antwerp, BELGIUM			Non-linear; EEG; embedding; time-lag; embedding dimension	PRACTICAL METHOD; SERIES	Depth of anesthesia monitors frequently use linear features. Though some non-linear methods such as spectral entropy and bispectrum analysis are also used; the application of methods derived after Chaos Theory is still pending. This paper focuses on the analysis of the embedding parameters required for the reconstruction of the chaotic atractor associated to the EEG signal. After clinical research and ethical committee approval and signed informed consent, EEG data was collected from 6 patients scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia and 7 ones scheduled for ambulatory endoscopic procedures. One differential channel of EEG (+ in mastoids M1/M2, - in the middle-line of the forehead FPz/AFz and referenced to F7/F8) was amplified with a gain of 10000 (Biopac MP100-EEG100B), low-pass filtered at 300 Hz (2nd order Butterwoth) and acquired at 2.5 KHz. Data were digitally filtered (50 Hz comb filter and 120-taps linear phase FIR low-pass filter at 85 Hz) and decimated to 250 Hz prior to analysis under OpenTstool. Time-lag was evaluated through autocorrelation and auto-mutual information functions. False nearest neighbors, and Higuchi Fractal Dimension were used for the study of the embedding dimension. After analyzing the data with different window lengths (250, 500, 1000 and 2000 samples), time lag was found to decrease from the basal level with anesthesia levels. Embedding dimension after Cao's method was not found to vary, due to the short length of the time series. Higuchi fractal dimension was able to show a slight dimensionality reduction with anesthesia. These results seem to indicate a decrease on the data-rate of the brain channel due to the reduction of the number of active neurons and the decrease of the neural conduction velocity induced by the anaesthetic agent used (propofol) at the GABAA receptors.

Constitutive spectral EEG peaks in the gamma range: suppressed by sleep, reduced by mental activity and resistant to sensory stimulation	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalogram; EEG bands; steady-state responses; oddball task; mental difficulty; neuro-psychiatric disorder	BAND ACTIVITY; POTENTIALS; CORTEX; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; OSCILLATIONS; INTERFACE; RESPONSES; REVEALS; HZ	Objective: In a systematic study of gamma activity in neuro-psychiatric disease, we unexpectedly observed distinctive, apparently persistent, electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral peaks in the gamma range (25-100 Hz). Our objective, therefore, was to examine the incidence, distribution and some of the characteristics of these peaks. Methods: High sample-rate, 128-channel, EEG was recorded in 603 volunteers (510 with neuropsychiatric disorders, 93 controls), whilst performing cognitive tasks, and converted to power spectra. Peaks of spectral power, including in the gamma range, were determined algorithmically for all electrodes. To determine if peaks were stable, 24-h ambulatory recordings were obtained from 16 subjects with peaks. In 10 subjects, steady-state responses to stimuli at peak frequency were compared with off-peak-frequency stimulation to determine if peaks were a feature of underlying network resonances and peaks were evaluated with easy and hard versions of oddball tasks to determine if peaks might be influenced by mental effort. Results: 57% of 603 subjects exhibited peaks >2 dB above trough power at or above 25 Hz. Larger peaks (>5 dB) were present in 13% of subjects. Peaks were distributed widely over the scalp, more frequent centrally. Peaks were present through the day and were suppressed by slow-wave-sleep. Steady-state responses were the same with on- or off-peak sensory stimulation. In contrast, mental effort resulted in reductions in power and frequency of gamma peaks, although the suppression did not correlate with level of effort. Conclusions: Gamma EEG can be expressed constitutively as concentrations of power in narrow or wide frequency bands that play an, as yet, unknown role in cognitive activity. Significance: These findings expand the described range of rhythmic EEG phenomena. In particular, in addition to evoked, induced and sustained gamma band activity, gamma activity can be present constitutively in spectral peaks.

The electronics hardware integrates state-of-the-art, commercial-off-the-shelf components on a custom PCB. Features include on-board data logging, wireless data streaming, subject motion monitoring, and stable operation up to the maximum 2 kHz/channel sampling rate tested. The new device operates for approximate to 30 hr continuously powered by a single 3.7 V, 2500 mAh LiPo battery. The 3D-printed ABS mechanical enclosure is robust and small (13.1 x 8.8 x 2.5 cm), so that the device can be carried in a standard Holter monitor pouch. Results from initial 128-channel, high spatial resolution body surface colon mapping experiments demonstrate the utility of this new device for GI applications. The new bioamplifier module could also be used for multichannel recording experiments in a variety of biomedical domains to study electrical activity patterns of the neuromuscular system (EMG), uterus (EHG), heart (ECG), and brain (EEG).

Diagnostic yield of short-term video-EEG monitoring for epilepsy and PNESs: A European assessment	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNESs); Seizures; Epilepsy; Parasomnia	PSYCHOGENIC NONEPILEPTIC SEIZURES; AMBULATORY EEG; INDUCTION; UTILITY; ADULTS	Introduction: Although long-term video-EEG monitoring (LVEM) is routinely used to investigate paroxysmal events, short-term video-EEG monitoring (SVEM) lasting <24 h is increasingly recognized as a cost-effective tool. Since, however, relatively few studies addressed the yield of SVEM among different diagnostic groups, we undertook the present study to investigate this aspect. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 226 consecutive SVEM recordings over 6 years. All patients were referred because routine EEGs were inconclusive. Patients were classified into 3 suspected diagnostic groups: (1) group with epileptic seizures, (2) group with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNESs), and (3) group with other or undetermined diagnoses. We assessed recording lengths, interictal epileptiform discharges, epileptic seizures, PNESs, and the definitive diagnoses obtained after SVEM. Results: The mean age was 34 (+/- 18.7) years, and the median recording length was 18.6 h. Among the 226 patients, 127 referred for suspected epilepsy -73 had a diagnosis of epilepsy, none had a diagnosis of PNESs, and 54 had other or undetermined diagnoses post-SVEM. Of the 24 patients with pre-SVEM suspected PNESs, 1 had epilepsy, 12 had PNESs, and 11 had other or undetermined diagnoses. Of the 75 patients with other diagnoses pre-SVEM, 17 had epilepsy, 11 had PNESs, and 47 had other or undetermined diagnoses. After SVEM, 15 patients had definite diagnoses other than epilepsy or PNESs, while in 96 patients, diagnosis remained unclear. Overall, a definitive diagnosis could be reached in 129/226 (57%) patients. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that in nearly 3/5 patients without a definitive diagnosis after routine EEG, SVEM allowed us to reach a diagnosis.

Spastic cerebral palsy accounts for 60% to 70% of cases. Research has shown that acupuncture can improve the quality of life of children with cerebral palsy, but the mechanism of action remains unclear. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture for treatment of children with spastic cerebral palsy and to assess the value of multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ambulatory electroencephalogram (EEG) for evaluation of treatment effect. Methods and analysis: This randomized controlled trial will enroll a total of 72 children with CP from 2 hospitals-Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine and Nanjing State Hospital of Pediatric-with 36 participants from each hospital. Patients will be randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive "Tonifying Kidney and Invigorating Brain" acupuncture treatment plus standardized physical rehabilitation treatment (treatment group) or only standardized physical rehabilitation (control group). All participants will receive 3 treatment sessions per week for 3 consecutive months; they will then be followed up for another 3 months. The primary outcome measures will include multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ambulatory electroencephalogram (EEG), and Gesell Developmental Diagnostic Schedules. The secondary outcome measures will include Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS), Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM), Functional Independence Measure (WeeFIM), and Modified Ashworth Scale score. Outcome measures (including primary and secondary outcome measures) were collected at the baseline, 3 months and 6 months prior to the intervention. Ethics and dissemination Patients consent: Obtained. Ethics approval: The central independent ethics committee of Jiangsu Province Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine approved the protocol (2017NL-115-02). Safety considerations: outine blood tests and liver and kidney function tests will be conducted to exclude patients with severe heart, liver, or kidney diseases. The same examinations will be performed again at the end of the study to detect any possible side effects. Possible acupuncture-related adverse events (e.g., fainting, needle stick injury, local infection, subcutaneous hematoma, and low-grade fever) will be documented. Serious adverse events will be reported to the principal investigator immediately. All unexpected and unintended responses, even those not necessarily related to the acupuncture intervention, will be documented as adverse events. Case dropout management: articipants have a right to withdraw from the study at any time if they feel uncomfortable upon receiving the treatments or being diagnosed with serious complications or diseases. They will then be referred to the preferred department for further treatment and management. If cases of dropout, the researcher need to contact the participant to reason the problem out, collect and record all the necessary assessments on the last visit as well as the date of last visit. All data available until the date of withdrawal will be stored for further statistical analysis. Discussion: This research is being conducted to assess the value of acupuncture as an intervention for rehabilitation of children with spastic cerebral palsy and also to evaluate the usefulness of multimodal MRI and ambulatory EEG for identifying changes in brain function.

Network mechanisms underlying the shift from an active goal-directed behavior to a "seemingly purposeless" stereotypic locomotion remain unclear. In the present study we sought to determine the relationships between the behavioral effects of dopaminergic drugs and their effects on local field potentials (LFPs), which were telemetrically recorded within the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of freely moving rats. We used the D2/D3 agonist quinpirole in a low, autoreceptor-selective (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) and in a high (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) dose, and a moderate dose of cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.). In the control group, power spectrum analysis revealed a prominent peak of LFP power in the theta frequency range during active exploration. Cocaine alone stimulated locomotion, but had no significant effect on the peak of the LFP power. In contrast, co-administration of low dose quinpirole with cocaine markedly altered the pattern of locomotion, from goal-directed exploratory behavior to recurrent motion resembling loco motor stereotypy. This behavioral effect was accompanied by a shift of the dominant theta power toward a significantly lower (by similar to 15%) frequency. High dose quinpirole also provoked an increased locomotor activity with signs of behavioral stereotypies, and also induced a shift of the dominant oscillation frequency toward the lower range. These results demonstrate a correlation between the LFP oscillation frequency within the VTA and a qualitative aspect of locomotor behavior, perhaps due to a variable level of coherence of this region with its input or output areas.

The orexin/hypocretin system plays an important role in maintaining wakefulness. This study aimed to explore the potential of a nonpeptide orexin receptor agonist to alleviate morphine-induced sedative effects. Methods: Morphine sedative effects were evaluated as changes in electroencephalogram (EEG), locomotor activity, and acoustic startle response in rats (n = 5 to 9 per group). Effects of intracerebroventricular orexin-A and systemic orexin type-2 receptor agonist, YNT-185, on EEG changes induced by morphine were examined. Furthermore, the authors examined effects of morphine administered with or without YNT-185 on locomotor activity and on acoustic startle response. Results: Morphine-induced, frequent, short epochs of increased power (total epoch duration: 0.5 [0.0 to 8.0] s/10 min during baseline vs. 74.0 [49.0 to 115.0] s/10 min during the post-morphine administration period; P = 0.012). EEG analyses revealed that morphine-induced, high-amplitude, slow activity (increase in spectral power of frequencies less than 15 Hz, baseline vs. postmorphine; P < 0.001). Orexin- A and YNT-185 attenuated these changes. Locomotor activity decreased after morphine (268 [103 to 889] ambulatory movement counts during baseline period [20 min] vs. 138 [7 to 434] counts during 40 to 59 min postadministration; P = 0.012), but did not change after morphine with YNT-185 (363 [121 to 636] vs. 864 [381 to 1092] counts, difference within morphine + YNT-185 group; P = 0.071). Startle response latency was longer after morphine (26 [20 to 28] ms) than after morphine with YNT-185 (17 [16 to 18] ms; P = 0.012). Conclusions: Orexin- A and/or YNT-185 attenuated morphine-induced sedative effects assessed by EEG changes and behavioral measures in rats. The authors' results suggest that orexin-2 receptor activation alleviates morphine-induced sedative effects.

AD patients typically experience increased sleep fragmentation, excessive daytime sleepiness and night-time insomnia. Here, we sought to investigate the link between sleep architecture, cognition and amyloid pathology in the APP23 amyloidosis mouse model for AD. By means of polysomnographic recordings the sleep-wake cycle of freely-moving APP23 and wild-type (WT) littermates of 3, 6 and 12 months of age was examined. In addition, ambulatory cage activity was assessed by interruption of infrared beams surrounding the home cage. To assess visuo-spatial learning and memory a hidden-platform Morris-type Water Maze (MWM) experiment was performed. We found that sleep architecture is only slightly altered at early stages of pathology, but significantly deteriorates from 12 months of age, when amyloid plaques become diffusely present. APP23 mice of 12 months old had quantitative reductions of NREM and REM sleep and were more awake during the dark phase compared to WT littermates. These findings were confirmed by increased ambulatory cage activity during that phase of the light-dark cycle. No quantitative differences in sleep parameters were observed during the light phase. However, during this light phase, the sleep pattern of APP23 mice was more fragmented from 6 months of age, the point at which also cognitive abilities started to be affected in the MWM. Sleep time also positively correlated with MWM performance. We also found that spectral components in the EEG started to alter at the age of 6 months. To conclude, our results indicate that sleep architectural changes arise around the time the first amyloid plaques start to form and cognitive deterioration becomes apparent. These changes start subtle, but gradually worsen with age, adequately mimicking the clinical condition.

Heterogeneous patterns of care are thus expected, which explain the need for shared patterns of care. These guidelines were developed by a group of experts from the Italian League against Epilepsy ( LICE) in accordance with the requirements of evidence-based medicine. An accurate assessment of the seizure is required, with active questioning about circumstances of occurrence, clinical manifestations, and postictal symptoms. For seizures with loss of consciousness, the presence of cyanosis, hypersalivation, tongue biting, and postictal disorientation has a specific diagnostic value. Laboratory tests and toxicological screening should be performed only in the presence of circumstances suggesting a metabolic or toxic encephalopathy. Elevated prolactin levels 10-20 min. after the event help in differentiating generalized tonic-clonic or partial seizures from psychogenic nonepileptic seizures. Except for infants less than six months of age, CSF examination is recommended only when a cerebral infection is suspected. An EEG should be performed within 24 h. after a seizure, particularly in children. If the EEG is normal during wakefulness, a sleep EEG is recommended. A CT scan is strictly indicated when a severe structural lesion is suspected or when the etiology is unknown. MRI may not be indicated in the emergency room, but it should be preferred to CT as part of the diagnostic assessment. The added value of other diagnostic tools (neuropsychological tests, ambulatory EEG, functional MRI, SPECT, and PET) is as yet unknown. These tests may be used on a case-by-case basis. In the presence of an acute symptomatic seizure, treatment of the cause is recommended. Symptomatic therapy is not justified unless the seizure has the characteristics of status epilepticus. Long-term treatment may be considered in patients with abnormal EEG and imaging data and after consideration of the social, emotional, and personal implications of seizure relapse.

Depending on the attendant conditions, walking patterns must be modified to optimally meet the demands of the task. Assessing neuromuscular control during dynamic conditions is methodologically highly challenging and prone to artifacts. Here we aim at assessing corticospinal involvement during different locomotor tasks using non-invasive surface electromyography. Activity in tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius medialis (GM) muscles was monitored by electromyograms (EMGs) in 27 healthy volunteers (11 female) during regular walking, walking while engaged in simultaneous cognitive dual tasks, walking with partial visual restriction, and skilled, targeted locomotion. Whereas EMG intensity of the TA and GM was considerably altered while walking with partial visual restriction and during targeted locomotion, dual-task walking induced only minor changes in total EMG intensity compared to regular walking. Targeted walking resulted in enhanced EMG intensity of GM in the frequency range associated with Piper rhythm synchronies. Likewise, targeted walking induced enhanced EMG intensity of TA at the Piper rhythm frequency around heelstrike, but not during the swing phase. Our findings indicate task- and phase-dependent modulations of neuromuscular control in distal leg muscles during various locomotor conditions in healthy subjects. Enhanced EMG intensity in the Piper rhythm frequency during targeted walking points toward enforced corticospinal drive during challenging locomotor tasks. These findings indicate that comprehensive time-frequency EMG analysis is able to gauge cortical involvement during different movement programs in a non-invasive manner and might be used as complementary diagnostic tool to assess baseline integrity of the corticospinal tract and to monitor changes in corticospinal drive as induced by neurorehabilitation interventions or during disease progression.

Current estimation approaches are significantly limited by several factors. Comparing patient diaries and objective estimates (through both inpatient video-EEG monitoring of and long-term ambulatory EEG studies) reveal that patients document seizures inaccurately. So far, few practical alternative methods of estimation have been available. Recent findings We review the systems of counting currently utilized and their limitations, as well as the limitations imposed by problems defining clinical events. Alternative methodologies that permit the volatility of seizure rates to be accommodated, and possible alternative measures of brain excitability will be outlined. Recent developments in technologies around data capture, such as wearable and implantable devices, as well as significant advances in the ability to analyse the large data-sets supplied by these systems have provided a wealth of information. Summary There are now unprecedented opportunities to utilize and apply these insights in routine clinical management and assessment of therapies. The rapid adoption of long-term, wearable monitoring systems will permit major advances in our understanding of the natural history of epilepsy, and lead to more effective therapies and improved patient safety.

SWA is also locally regulated as it increases in the brain areas that have been used intensively. Moreover, in children, SWA is a marker of cortical maturation. In the present study the local properties of NREM sleep depth were evaluated using the quantitative mean frequency method. We aimed to study if age is related to NREM sleep depth in young infants. In addition, we studied if young infants have local differences in their NREM sleep. Methods: Ambulatory over-night polysomnographies were recorded in 59 healthy and full-term infants at the age of one month. The infants were divided into two age groups (<44 weeks and >= 44 weeks) to allow maturational evaluations. Results: The quantitative sleep depth analysis showed differences between the age groups. In addition, there were local sleep depth differences within the age groups. Conclusions: The sleep depth change with age is most likely related to cortical maturation, whereas the local sleep depth gradients might also reflect the use-dependent properties of SWA.

There may be a potential clinical benefit using the processed electroencephalogram (EEG) to monitor hypnotic level in this population. We prospectively studied 16 patients aged over 65 years having hip fractures repaired under general anaesthesia by experienced anaesthetists blinded to Bispectral Index (BISXP) and Entropy values. Pre-induction EEG indices did not correlate with age or mini-mental state examination (MMSE). During maintenance of anaesthesia, BISXP and Response Entropy (RE) values were within the recommended range of 40-60, 45% and 32% of the total time, respectively. BISXP and Response Entropy (RE) values were above 60 for 11% and 13% of the total time, respectively, and below 40 for 44% and 55% of the total time, respectively. BISXP correlated well with RE in 12 patients, but in the other four patients there was a difference of more than 20 points between BISXP and RE.

Despite the heterogeneity of the reported musical triggers, patients' emotional response to music is thought to play a crucial role in provoking seizures. Accordingly, the mesial temporal structures (especially of the non-dominant hemisphere) appear most involved in seizure generation, although a more complex fronto-temporal epileptogenic network was documented in some cases. Autoimmune encephalitis has been recently included among the many possible aetiologies of ME based on a few reports of music-induced seizures in patients with anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 antibodies. Here, we describe the case of a 25-year-old man, educated in music over a long period of time, who had suffered from drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy following seronegative limbic encephalitis related to non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Along with spontaneous events, the patient also developed musicogenic seizures later in the disease course. After detecting five music-induced episodes via 24-hour ambulatory EEG, we performed prolonged video-EEG monitoring during which the patient presented a right temporal seizure (characterized by deja-vu, piloerection and gustatory hallucinations) while listening to a hard rock song through headphones (which he had not previously heard). This observation allowed us to confirm the provoking effect of the music on our patient's seizures, despite the lack of any emotional drive, which suggests that a "cognitive" trigger was more likely in this case. Our report further highlights that autoimmune encephalitis should be investigated as a novel potential cause of musicogenic epilepsy, regardless of autoantibody status.

We herein provide an overview of these challenges and current technological landscape of mHealth devices for seizure detection. Specifically, we display, which types of sensor modalities and analytical methods are available, and give insight into current clinical practice guidelines, main outcomes of clinical validation studies, and discuss how to evaluate device performance at point-of-care facilities. We then address pitfalls which may arise in patient compliance and the need to design solutions adapted to user experience.

However, its numerous challenges and obstacles have impeded the realization of a definitive solution. This work aims to build upon our existing research and apply newer advanced machine learning and hardware techniques to this issue. The novelty proposed is two-fold. First, we utilize max-pooling convolutional neural networks (MPCNN) to perform end-to-end learning. Second, we demonstrate that transfer-learning can be used to teach MPCNNs generalized features of both normal and epileptiform patterns from a pool of subjects' raw EEG data. Using this hybrid approach, the system is able to detect all 184 seizure onsets from 24 cases with average latency of 1.47 seconds and 3.2 false-alarms/day. To demonstrate the full system, the entire design is efficiently implemented onto a highly parallel, highly granular embedded SoC (NVIDIA Jetson TK1). When utilizing the GPU, the system is able to classify 15-second segments in 308 mu s and last over 80 hours.

The sample consisted of 13 infants examined between October 2001 and September 2002 at IMIP ambulatory patients' office or private clinic. Administration of vigabatrin was around 118 mg/kg/day. Suppression of spasms was obtained in 4 children (31%), partial control in 3 (23%), 5 of them did not present therapeutic response (38%) and just one (8%) got worse. On the two patients with tuberous sclerosis, one was seizure-free and in another there was partial control. Side effects happened in 8 children (62%) and consisted of irritability, insomnia, somnolence and agitation, and all of them have been well tolerated. The second EEG showed disappearance of hipsarrhythmia in 6 patients (46%). Four of these were seizure-free. We conclude that VGB is effective and well tolerated as initial monotherapy for WS.

Despite growing attention to this ability, little is known about how reorientation happens in humans. To this aim, we recorded EEG from 34 participants. Participants were navigating a simple virtual reality plus-maze where at the beginning of each trial they were randomly teleported to either the North or the South alley. Results show that the teleportation event caused a quick reorientation effect over occipito-parietal areas as early as 100 ms; meaning that despite the known stochastic nature of the teleportation, participants built up expectations for their place of arrival. This result has important consequences for the optimal design of virtual reality locomotion.

Moreover, the authors advise to use seven electrodes with a standard xDawn spatial filter - known to magnify the P300 response in order to obtain the best performance/compactedness ratio. However, the positive impact of the xDawn filter and the gait-related artifact removal techniques on the BCI performance with seven EEG electrodes had not been precisely evaluated at that time. This is precisely what we do in this study using seven healthy subjects walking at three different speeds. Astonishingly, none of the methods, even the so-called xDawn spatial filter, does significantly outperform the raw data. Thereby, the recommendation considering a low-complexity four-state P300 BCI under ambulatory conditions would be to use filtered raw data without specific gait-related artifact removal techniques.

We aim to fill this gap by analyzing sleep records of a twin pair discordant for Williams syndrome extending our focus on presleep wakefulness and sleep spindling. Methods - We performed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification of the 7q11.23 region of a 17 years old dizygotic opposite-sex twin pair discordant for Williams syndrome. Polysomnography of laboratory sleep at this age was analyzed and followed-up after 1.5 years by ambulatory polysomnography. Sleep stages scoring, EEG power spectra and sleep spindle analyses were carried out. Results - The twin brother showed reduced levels of amplification for all of the probes in the 7q11.23 region indicating a typical deletion spanning at least 1.038 Mb between FKBP6 and CLIP2. The results of the twin sister showed normal copy numbers in the investigated region. Lower sleep times and efficiencies, as well as higher slow wave sleep percents of the twin brother were evident during both recordings. Roughly equal NREM, Stage 2 and REM sleep percents were found. EEG analyses revealed state and derivation-independent decreases in cc power, lack of an a spectral peak in presleep wakefulness, as well as higher NREM sleep a peak frequency in the twin brother. Faster sleep spindles with lower amplitude and shorter duration characterized the records of the twin brother. Spectra show a striking reliability and correspondence between the two situations (laboratory vs. home records). Conclusion - Alterations in sleep and specific neural oscillations including the alpha/sigma waves are inherent aspects of Williams syndrome.

In addition, the avoidance of awareness or excessive anaesthetic depth might result in improved patient outcomes. Various depth of anaesthesia monitors based on processed analysis of the EEG or mid-latency auditory-evoked potentials are commercially available as surrogate measures of anaesthetic drug effect. However, not all of them are validated to the same extent.

Brief Potentially Ictal Rhythmic Discharges [B(I)RDs] in Noncritically Ill Adults	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Brief potentially ictal rhythmic discharges; B(I)RDs; Medically refractory epilepsy; Seizures; Nonconvulsive seizures; Epilepsy	PAROXYSMAL FAST ACTIVITY; ABSENCE SEIZURES; EEG PATTERNS; SCALP EEG; TERMINOLOGY; EPILEPSIES; CLASSIFICATION; CHILDREN	Introduction: Brief potentially ictal rhythmic discharges (B(I)RDs) have been described in neonates and critically ill adults, and their association with seizures has been demonstrated. Their significance in noncritically ill adults remains unclear. We aimed to investigate their prevalence, electrographic characteristics, and clinical significance. Methods: We identified adult patients with B(I)RDs who received long-term EEG recordings either in the epilepsy monitoring unit or in the ambulatory setting. Patients with acute findings on imaging or statusepilepticus were excluded. B(I)RDs were defined as very brief (< 10 seconds) runs of focal or generalized sharply contoured rhythmic activity greater than 4 Hz, with or without evolution, that were not consistent with any known normal or benign pattern. The clinical history, EEG, and imaging results were retrieved. Each patient with B(I)RDs was matched by age and etiology to a control group with epileptiform discharges but without B(I)RDs in a 1:2 ratio. Results: We identified B(I)RDs in 15 patients of 1,230 EEGs (1.2%). The pattern typically consisted of 0.5 to 4 second runs of sharply contoured alpha activity without evolution. All patients with B(I)RDs had epilepsy, and, when compared with controls with epilepsy but without BIRDs, were more likely to be medically refractory (10 of 15 [67%] vs. 5 of 30 [17%]; P < 0.01). All seizure onsets colocalized to the B(I)RDs, and most were morphologically similar. Conclusions: In noncritically ill patients, B(I)RDs are associated with refractory epilepsy and their location is correlated with the seizure onset area.

Estimating sleep time from non-EEG-based PSG signals in the diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing	SLEEP AND BREATHING			English	Article						Movement; Type 3 device; Home recording; Ambulatory	APNEA SYNDROME; ACTIGRAPHY; PARAMETERS	Purpose The purpose of this study was to use non-EEG PSG signals to estimate TST in order to diagnose SDB with a greater sensitivity than type 3 device methodology that relies on TRT. Methods Movement patterns were obtained from the thoracoabdominal signals of adult PSG recordings (n = 60) in the laboratory and the home. Parameters obtained allowed, with 95% certainty, identification of sleep and wake based on the duration of movements and quiescent time ( Qd). Snoring, apneas, and hypopneas indicated sleep with 100% certainty. The method was tested in a different set of PSG recordings (n = 80). Results Subjects lay awake and immobile for longer in the laboratory (Qd(LAB) = 27.4 (12.1, 62.0), Qd(HOME) = 16.0 s (8.0, 36.0); p < 0.0001) but asleep and immobile for longer at home (Qd(LAB) = 65.2 (23.0, 121.4), Qd(HOME) = 95.0 s (44.5, 247.5); 0.005). Only 5% of wake Qd periods were > 173 s in the laboratory and >105 s at home. In both locations, 95% of movements during sleep were <10 s. Experimental TST values were 21 min shorter than EEG-defined TST and, combined with fewer scored respiratory events, produced AHI values that were 1.6 events/h lower than the reference. The experimental TST increased the sensitivity of SDB diagnosis from 73 to 97%. Conclusions In the sleep laboratory, subjects are immobile for longer periods when awake and for shorter periods when asleep. The experimental TST was similar to EEG- defined TST and could be used to diagnose SDB with a much higher sensitivity than the type 3 method.	[Norman, M. B.; Sullivan, C.

Methods Automatic sleep staging was performed for single-ear, single-ear with ipsilateral mastoid, and cross-ear electrode configurations, and for actigraphy data. The polysomnography data were manually scored and used as the gold standard. The automatic sleep staging was tested on 80 full-night recordings from 20 healthy subjects. The scoring performance and sleep metrics were determined for all ear-EEG setups and the actigraphy device. Results The single-ear, the single-ear with ipsilateral mastoid setup, and the cross-ear setup performed five class sleep staging with kappa values 0.36, 0.63, and 0.72, respectively. For the single-ear with mastoid electrode and the cross-ear setup, the performance of the sleep metrics, in terms of mean absolute error, was better than the sleep metrics estimated from the actigraphy device in the current study, and also better than current state-of-the-art actigraphy studies. Conclusion A statistically significant improvement in both accuracy and kappa was observed from single-ear to single-ear with ipsilateral mastoid, and from single-ear with ipsilateral mastoid to cross-ear configurations for both two and five-sleep stage classification. In terms of sleep metrics, the results were more heterogeneous, but in general, actigraphy and single-ear with ipsilateral mastoid configuration were better than the single-ear configuration; and the cross-ear configuration was consistently better than both the actigraphy device and the single-ear configuration.

In an attempt to explore further the importance of performing such emergency procedures in children, we analyzed the utility of not only emergency EEGs but also emergency long-term bedside EEGs and emergency video-EEGs at our institution in 1 year. The number of EEG studies performed in 1 year at our neurophysiology laboratory was 1821: 1212 routine EEGs, 387 24-hour ambulatory EEGs, 81 video-EEGs, and 141 long-term bedside EEGs. The number of emergency studies during the same period of time was 32 (1.8% of the total studies): 18 emergency EEGs, 8 emergency long-term bedside EEGs, and 6 emergency video-EEGs. The reasons for ordering the 18 emergency EEGs included the evaluation of (1) altered mental status (n = 10), (2) paroxysmal movement (including cluster of seizures) (n = 6), and (3) prolonged febrile or afebrile seizures prior to being discharged on a weekend (n = 2). The eight emergency long-term bedside EEGs were done to evaluate (1) altered mental status (n = 6) and (2) frequently occurring paroxysmal events (n = 2). Four of the eight emergency long-term bedside EEGs were done after an abnormal emergency EEG. The six emergency video-EEGs were done to evaluate frequently occurring paroxysmal events (n = 5) and altered mental status (n = 1). Overall, emergency EEGs and emergency video-EEGs were useful in decision making in 30 of 32 (94%) studies. This might be related to the fact that a neurologist approved all of the studies. Appropriate strategies need to be developed to make this essential service available for patient care.

Using Actiwatch to monitor circadian rhythm disturbance in Huntington' disease: A cautionary note	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Actiwatch; Actimetry; EEG; Sleep circadian; Huntington's disease	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; SLEEP DIARY; EXPRESSION; MELATONIN; MOVEMENTS; CORTISOL	Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that is well recognised as producing progressive deterioration of motor function, including dyskinetic movements, as well as deterioration of cognition and ability to carry out activities of daily living. However, individuals with HD commonly suffer from a wide range of additional symptoms, including weight loss and sleep disturbance, possibly due to disruption of circadian rhythmicity. Disrupted circadian rhythms have been reported in mice models of HD and in humans with HD. One way of assessing an individual's circadian rhythmicity in a community setting is to monitor their sleep/wake cycles, and a convenient method for recording periods of wakefulness and sleep is to use accelerometers to discriminate between varied activity levels (including sleep) during daily life. Here we used Actiwatch Activity monitors alongside ambulatory EEG and sleep diaries to record wake/sleep patterns in people with HD and normal volunteers. We report that periods of wakefulness during the night, as detected by activity monitors, agreed poorly with EEG recordings in HD subjects, and unsurprisingly sleep diary findings showed poor agreement with both EEG recordings and activity monitor derived sleep periods. One explanation for this is the occurrence of 'break through' involuntary movements during sleep in the HD patients, which are incorrectly assessed as wakeful periods by the activity monitor algorithms. Thus, care needs to be taken when using activity monitors to assess circadian activity in individuals with movement disorders. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The bispectral index was the input variable used in a proportioned, integral and differential controller to determine the infusion rate of propofol required to maintain a stable level of hypnosis (Cases 1 and 2) or sedation (Case 3). This feedback control system provided intraoperative hemodynamic stability and a prompt recovery from the sedative-hypnotic effects of propofol.

Epilepsy, unawareness of seizures and driving license: The potential role of 24-hour ambulatory EEG in defining seizure freedom	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Subclinical seizures; Driving license; Seizure-free period; 24-Hour ambulatory EEG	MOTOR-VEHICLES; CONSCIOUSNESS; PEOPLE; ADULTS; STATE	Introduction: Seizures represent a potential source of accidents/death. Permission to drive may, therefore, be granted in a seizure-free period. Laws and regulations regarding this issue vary widely, and the onus of reporting seizures ultimately rests on the individual. Unfortunately, as some patients are unaware of their seizures, their reports may be unreliable. Methods: In this retrospective study, we selected, from a group of 1100 consecutive patients, 57 cases (26 males/31 females; mean age: 42.5 years) in whom the AEEG documented ictal events (UIEs) not reported in a self-kept diary. By means of a simple questionnaire, we interviewed all these patients to collect information on driving licenses. We, thus, assessed how many of these patients (both drug resistant and seizure free) drove regularly. Results: Our study shows a relatively large number of patients with epilepsy and UIEs. Fifteen patients suffered from idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) while 42 had partial epilepsy (PE). The patients were seizure free in 21 cases and 36 had drug-resistant seizures. Many patients in both these subgroups had a driving license and drove normally (active driving in 12/36 drug-resistant patients and in 18/21 seizure-free patients). Worthy of note is the finding that an "apparently" seizure-free group of patients drove regularly. Conclusions: This study revealed a large number of patients (both drug resistant and seizure free) with AEEG-documented UIEs. This finding highlights the usefulness of AEEG in clinical practice as a means of more accurately ascertaining seizure freedom and supporting decisions involving the renewal or granting of a driving license.

The interrelation between sensorimotor abilities, cognitive performance and individual EEG alpha peak frequency in young children	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Brain; Development; Locomotion; Motor coordination; Cognition; Childhood	DEVELOPMENTAL COORDINATION DISORDER; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; MOTOR DEVELOPMENT; ATTENTION; CONNECTIVITY; DYNAMICS; SCALES	Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the interrelation between sensorimotor abilities, cognitive performance and individual alpha peak frequency (iAPF), an EEG marker of global architectural and functional properties of the human brain, in healthy preschool children. Methods: 25 participants completed a one minute eyes-closed EEG recording, two cognitive tests assessing processing speed and visual working memory and a sensorimotor test battery. Results: We found positive correlations between selective sensorimotor abilities and iAPF; however, no significant correlations were observed between iAPF and cognitive performance. Specifically, locomotor skills correlated with iAPF across all cortical regions, except for the occipital cortex. Furthermore, a close relationship was found between sensorimotor and cognitive performance indicating that children with improved sensorimotor abilities were faster and/or more accurate in cognitive task performance. The cumulative pattern of our results indicates that a close relationship exists between sensorimotor and cognitive performance in young children. However, this relationship is dissociated from the iAPF. Conclusion: In contrast to adults, in young children the iAPF is related to locomotor skills and not to cognitive processing speed or visual working memory function. Significance: The global architectural and functional properties of the brain are closely related to locomotor skills during development.

A high-density EEG study of differentiation between two speeds and directions of simulated optic flow in adults and infants	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						development; EEG; ERPs; oscillation/time frequency analyses; visual processes	FUNCTIONAL BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; RANDOM VISUAL-MOTION; CORTICAL RESPONSES; WHITE-MATTER; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE; SYNCHRONIZATION ERS; NEURONS RESPOND; SENSITIVITY; PERCEPTION; MATURATION	A high-density EEG study was carried out to investigate cortical activity in response to forward and backward visual motion at two different driving speeds, simulated through optic flow. Participants were prelocomotor infants at the age of 4-5 months and infants with at least 3 weeks of crawling experience at the age of 8-11 months, and adults. Adults displayed shorter N2 latencies in response to forward as opposed to backward visual motion and differentiated significantly between low and high speeds, with shorter latencies for low speeds. Only infants at 8-11 months displayed similar latency differences between motion directions, and exclusively in response to low speed. The developmental differences in latency between infant groups are interpreted in terms of a combination of increased experience with self-produced locomotion and neurobiological development. Analyses of temporal spectral evolution (TSE, time-dependent amplitude changes) were also performed to investigate nonphase-locked changes at lower frequencies in underlying neuronal networks. TSE showed event-related desynchronization activity in response to visual motion for infants compared to adults. The poorer responses in infants are probably related to immaturity of the dorsal visual stream specialized in the processing of visual motion and could explain the observed problems in infants with differentiating high speeds of up to 50 km/h.

Effect of 7-Nitroindazole, a Neuronal Nitric Oxide Synthase Inhibitor, on Behavioral and Physiological Parameters	PHYSIOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						7-nitroindazole; Open field test; Ladder rung walking test; Brain excitability; Blood gas analysis; Rat	MOTOR-ACTIVITY; POTENT INHIBITORS; NOS INHIBITOR; MICE LACKING; HIPPOCAMPAL; ACTIVATION; NNOS; EEG; RESPIRATION; RECEPTORS	The role of brain derived nitric oxide in the physiology and behavior remains disputable. One of the reasons of the controversies might be systemic side effects of nitric oxide synthase inhibitors. Therefore, under nNOS inhibition by 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) we carried out recordings of blood gasses, blood pressure and spontaneous EEG in conscious adult rats. Locomotion and spontaneous behavior were assessed in an open field. In addition skilled walking and limb coordination were evaluated using a ladder rung walking test. The blood gas analysis revealed a significant increase in pCO2 180 min and 240 min after the application of 7-NI. The power and entropy decreased simultaneously with a shift of the mean frequency of the spontaneous EEG toward slow oscillations after 7-NI treatment. The thresholds of evoked potentials underwent a significant drop and a trend towards a slight increase in the I-O curve slope was observed. 7-NI significantly suppressed open field behavior expressed as distance moved, exploratory rearing and grooming. As for the ladder rung walking test the 7-NI treated animals had more errors in foot placement indicating impairment in limb coordination. Therefore our findings suggest that 7-NI increased cortical excitability and altered some physiological and behavioral parameters.

Its main contributions were in the study of memory formation and consolidation, interhemispheric transfer, motor learning, conditioned taste aversion and spatial orientation and navigation. In the last five years it concentrated on navigation of rats in multiple reference frames, on electrophysiological evidence for the role of hippocampal place cells support of behavior in such dissociated frames, on the analysis of idiothetic and allothetic forms of navigation and on the mathematical methods allowing assessment of the contribution of goal directed locomotion to place cell activity. The methods used in spatial memory research in rats were used for examination of human subjects in a laboratory equipped with a tracking system for humans in the hospital Homolka.

C	DuRousseau, DR		Schmorrow, DD		DuRousseau, DR			Artifact differences in seated vs mobile EEG recordings made during simulated military operations in urban terrain (MOUT)	Foundations of Augmented Cognition, Vol 11			English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Augmented Cognition held in Conjunction with the 11th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction	JUL 22-27, 2005	Las Vegas, NV					The ever increasing complexity of networked human-machine interactions has led to renewed interest in real-time measures of mental effort and stress of soldiers in mobile and dismounted environments. More than a decade of operational workload research has provided cognitive and behavioral metrics that have advanced our laboratory understanding of the human-system (Gevins et al., 1996). Presently, necessity is driving the discovery of human-system metrics for real-time assessments of a war fighter's arousal, vigilance, and attentional capacity. The need for assessment occurs as intelligent systems become capable of monitoring cognition and stress and adapting to variability in the human-machine interface. However, we have yet to transition these metrics from the laboratory into fieldable operational systems that are error-proof and relied-upon. What we lack are the tools to transition from in-the-lab psychophysiological testing to operational on-the-move cognition/stress assessments. In particular, what we require are lightweight, ruggedized, and wireless electronics with ubiquitous sensors and automated systems for de-noising and data analysis. Considerable efforts have been put forth to develop faster and more reliable EEG artifact identification and removal algorithms over the last 2 decades and today there are several algorithms demonstrating impressive results. Unfortunately, current de-noising methods were designed to deal with artifacts in sedentary recordings under laboratory or clinical conditions. Although, today's filtering algorithms are highly successful at removing simple eye, heart, and 60 Hz artifacts from the EEG, they are not good at identifying and removing compound artifacts that are routinely generated when ambulatory recordings are made during simulated MOUT type operations. This paper describes research performed to examine the differences in artifact types and severity when EEG's were collected under seated and mobile conditions. Here, we report our artifact difference results from 40-channels of EEG, eye, and heart signals recorded from 26 subjects either seated, walking in place, or completely mobile while performing a complex cognitive dual-task battery within a simulated MOUT environment. Our results include an examination of post hoc filtering methods used to remove unwanted artifacts, the identification of residual contaminations in the EEG data, and a prescription for new methods of arbitrating the effects of compound artifacts.

The process is complex, using multiple electrodes, and is usually based on relatively high (200-500 Hz) sampling rates. Also at least 12 bit analog to digital conversion is recommended (with 16 bit storage) resulting in total bit rate of at least 12.8 kbit/s. This is not a problem for in-house laboratory sleep studies, but in the case of online wireless self-applicable ambulatory sleep studies, lower complexity and lower bit rates are preferred. In this study we further developed earlier single channel facial EMG/EOG/EEG-based automatic sleep stage classification. An algorithm with a simple decision tree separated 30 s epochs into wakefulness, SREM, S1/S2 and SWS using 18-45 Hz beta power and 0.5-6 Hz amplitude. Improvements included low complexity recursive digital filtering. We also evaluated the effects of a reduced sampling rate, reduced number of quantization steps and reduced dynamic range on the sleep data of 132 training and 131 testing subjects. With the studied algorithm, it was possible to reduce the sampling rate to 50 Hz (having a low pass filter at 90 Hz), and the dynamic range to 244 mu V, with an 8 bit resolution resulting in a bit rate of 0.4 kbit/s. Facial electrodes and a low bit rate enables the use of smaller devices for sleep stage classification in home environments.

Patients with epilepsy may suffer from severe consequences from seizures (e.g. injuries) when not monitored. Automatic seizure detection systems could mitigate this problem, improving seizure tracking and alerting a caregiver during a seizure. Existing unimodal solutions for seizure detection, based on electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) still have an unacceptable level of false positives, which can be reduced by combining these two biosignals. In this paper, EEG and ECG data from 7 epileptic patients with diverse recording length and seizure types were used for analyzing the importance of multimodal seizure detection, at a total of around 110 h 2 m. A leave one seizure out cross validation was selected, grouping data containing the period before a seizure and the seizure period. A proof of concept of multimodal seizure detection which uses a deep learning architecture directly on raw data is performed - a Fully Convolutional Neural Network and an architecture based on LSTM were tested. The network based on LSTM achieved better performance - using the best of one or a combination of both signals, all patients had above 91% detected seizures, a specificity per epoch above 0.96 +/- 0.06 and a detection delay below 8.5 +/- 12 s. These results show potential for developing a patient-specific approach for seizure detection that can be transferred to the ambulatory.

An EEG Study of Turning Freeze in Parkinson's Disease Patients: The Alteration of Brain Dynamic on the Motor and Visual Cortex	2015 37TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 25-29, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			GAIT; PREDICTION	Freezing of gait is a very debilitating symptom affecting many patients with Parkinson's disease, leading to a reduced mobility and increased risk for falls. Turning is known to be the most provocative trigger for freezing of gait. However, the underlying brain dynamic changes associated with a turning freeze remain unknown. This study therefore used ambulatory EEG to investigate the brain dynamic changes associated with freezing of gait during turning. In addition, this study aimed to determine the most suitable EEG sensor location to detect freezing of gait during turning using our classification system. Data from four Parkinson's disease patients with freezing of gait was analysed using power spectral density and brain effective connectivity, comparing periods of successful turning with freezing of gait during turning. Results showed that freezing of gait during turning is associated with significant alterations in the high beta and theta power spectral densities across the occipital and parietal areas. Furthermore, brain effective connectivity showed that freezing during turning was associated with increased connectivity towards the visual area, which also had the highest accuracy to detect freezing episodes in the O1 regions by using power spectral density in our classification analyses. This is the first study to show cortical dynamic changes associated with freezing of gait during turning, providing valuable information to enhance the performance of future freezing of gait detection systems.

Locomotion and Self-Administration Induced by Cocaine in 129/O1aHsd Mice Lacking Galanin	BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						galanin; dopamine; addiction; reward; locomotion; 129/O1aHsd	PLACE-PREFERENCE; INTRAVENOUS COCAINE; NEURITE OUTGROWTH; EEG AROUSAL; DOPAMINE; RELEASE; SENSITIZATION; NUCLEUS; SYSTEM; OREXIN	Previous studies have demonstrated that the galanin system modulates responses to drugs of abuse such as morphine. The current study examined whether genetic deletion of galanin could affect the locomotor and reinforcing effects of cocaine in mice. We analyzed spontaneous motor activity and cocaine-induced hyperactivity in wild-type (GAL-WT) and knockout mice lacking galanin (GAL-KO) maintained on the 129/O1aHsd background. Our results indicate that cocaine enhanced locomotion (defined as moving more than 5 cm) dose-dependently in GAL-WT and GAL-KO mice. However, general activity (total beam breaks) was increased by cocaine only in GAL-WT mice. An additional experiment indicated that galnon, a nonselective galanin receptor agonist, did not affect cocaine-induced hyperactivity. In a second set of experiments, mice of both genotypes were trained to self-administer cocaine under a fixed ratio schedule, tested with various doses of cocaine and under different schedules of reinforcement. This set of experiments showed that cocaine self-administration did not differ markedly between genotypes. However, while GAL-WT mice acquired cocaine self-administration, a median split analysis showed that mice could be divided into large and small drug takers, whereas all GAL-KO mice behaved as small drug takers. Our results indicate that wild-type and galanin knockout mice on a congenic 129/O1aHsd background are responsive to the locomotor effects of cocaine and can acquire intravenous cocaine self-administration. However, the phenotype observed in GAL-KO mice does not support a major role for galanin in cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion and self-administration.

Deep brain stimulation of the PPN has been proposed as an emerging treatment for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) or multiple system atrophy (MSA) who have gait-related atypical parkinsonian syndromes. In this study, we investigated PPN activities during gait to better understand its functional role in locomotion. Specifically, we investigated whether PPN activity is rhythmically modulated by gait cycles during locomotion. PPN local field potential (LFP) activities were recorded from PD or MSA patients with gait difficulties during stepping in place or free walking. Simultaneous measurements from force plates or accelerometers were used to determine the phase within each gait cycle at each time point. Our results showed that activities in the alpha and beta frequency bands in the PPN LFPs were rhythmically modulated by the gait phase within gait cycles, with a higher modulation index when the stepping rhythm was more regular. Meanwhile, the PPN-cortical coherence was most prominent in the alpha band. Both gait phase-related modulation in the alpha/beta power and the PPN-cortical coherence in the alpha frequency band were spatially specific to the PPN and did not extend to surrounding regions. These results suggest that alternating PPN modulation may support gait control. Whether enhancing alternating PPN modulation by stimulating in an alternating fashion could positively affect gait control remains to be tested.

We have recently shown that electrophysiological markers of motor preparation, rather than decision-making, differentiate PwP with freezing of gait (FOG +) and without (FOG -) while sitting. To examine the effect of locomotion on these results, we measured behavioural and electrophysiological responses in PwP with and without FOG during a target response time task while sitting (single-task) and stepping-in-place (dual-task). Behavioural and electroencephalographic data were acquired from 18 PwP (eight FOG +) and seven young controls performing the task while sitting and stepping-in-place. FOG + had slower response times while stepping compared with sitting. However, response times were significantly faster while stepping compared with sitting for controls. Electrophysiological responses showed no difference in decision-making potentials (centroparietal positivity) between groups or conditions but there were differences in neurophysiological markers of response inhibition (N2) and motor preparation (lateralized readiness potential, LRP) in FOG + while performing a dual-task. This suggests that the addition of a second complex motor task (stepping-in-place) impacts automatic allocation of resources in FOG +, resulting in delayed response times. The impact of locomotion on the generation of the N2 and LRP potentials, particularly in freezers, indirectly implies that these functions compete with locomotion for resources. In the setting of multiple complex tasks or cognitive impairment, severe motor dysfunction may result, leading to freezing of gait.

While both mouse strains displayed sleep fragmentation and increased paradoxical sleep (PS), they presented a number of marked differences: (1) the PS increase in HDC-/- mice was seen during lightness, whereas that in Ox(-/-) mice occurred during darkness; (2) contrary to HDC-/-, Ox(-/-) mice had no W deficiency around lights-off, nor an abnormal EEG and responded to a new environment with increased W; (3) only Ox (-/-), but not HDC (-/-) mice, displayed narcolepsy and deficient W when faced with motor challenge. Thus, when placed on a wheel, wild-type (WT), but not littermate Ox(-/-) mice, voluntarily spent their time in turning it and as a result, remained highly awake; this was accompanied by dense c-fos expression in many areas of their brains, including Ox neurons in the dorsolateral hypothalamus. The W and motor deficiency of Ox (-/-) mice was due to the absence of Ox because intraventricular dosing of orexin-A restored their W amount and motor performance whereas SB-334867 (Ox1-receptor antagonist, i.p.) impaired Wand locomotion of WT mice during the test. These data indicate that Ox, but not HA, promotes W through enhanced locomotion and suggest that HA and Ox neurons exert a distinct, but complementary and synergistic control of W: the neuropeptide being more involved in its behavioral aspects, whereas the amine is mainly responsible for its qualitative cognitive aspects and cortical EEG activation.

Symptoms can be relieved with cerebrospinal fluid drainage, which makes iNPH the leading cause of reversible dementia. Because of a limited understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms, unspecific symptoms and the high prevalence of comorbidity (i.e. Alzheimer's disease), iNPH is largely underdiagnosed. For these reasons, there is an urgent need for developing noninvasive quantitative biomarkers for iNPH diagnosis and prognosis. Structural and functional changes of brain circuits in relation to symptoms and treatment response are expected to deliver major advances in this direction. We review structural and functional brain connectivity findings in iNPH and complement those findings with iNPH symptom meta-analyses in healthy populations. Our goal is to reinforce our conceptualization of iNPH as to brain network mechanisms and foster the development of new hypotheses for future research and treatment options.

Activation of G-protein-gated inward rectifying K+ channels (GIRKs) by GABA(B) agonists baclofen or -hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) promotes nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and consolidates sleep. However, baclofen has poor brain penetration, GHB possesses abuse liability, and in rodents both drugs cause spike-wave discharges (SWDs), an absence seizure activity. We tested the hypothesis that direct GIRK activation promotes sleep without inducing SWD using ML297, a potent and selective GIRK activator. Methods Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from hypocretin/orexin or hippocampal neurons in mouse brain slices were made to study neuronal excitability and synaptic activity; spontaneous activity, locomotion, contextual and tone-conditioned memory, and novel object recognition were assessed. Electroencephalogram/electromyogram (EEG/EMG) recordings were used to study GIRK modulation of sleep. Results ML297, like baclofen, caused membrane hyperpolarization, decreased input resistance, and blockade of spontaneous action potentials. Unlike baclofen, ML297 (5-10 mu M) did not cause significant depression of postsynaptic excitatory and inhibitory currents (EPSCs-IPSCs), indicating preferential postsynaptic inhibition. ML297 (30 mg/kg, i.p.) inhibited wake activity and locomotion, and preferentially increased NREM sleep without altering EEG delta power, REM sleep, inducing SWDs, or impairing conditioned memory and novel object recognition. Conclusions This study finds that direct activation of neuronal GIRK channels modulates postsynaptic membrane excitability and prolongs NREM sleep without changing sleep intensity, inducing SWDs, or impairing memory in rodents. These results suggest that direct GIRK activation with a selective compound may present an innovative approach for the treatment of chronic insomnia.

Heterogeneous patterns of care are thus expected, which explain the need for shared patterns of care. These guidelines were developed by a group of experts from the Italian League against Epilepsy (LICE) in accordance with the requirements of evidence-based medicine. An accurate assessment of the seizure is required, with active questioning about circumstances of occurrence, clinical manifestations, and postictal symptoms. For seizures with loss of consciousness, the presence of cyanosis, hypersalivation, tongue biting, and postictal disorientation has a specific diagnostic value. Laboratory tests and toxicological screening should be performed only in the presence of circumstances suggesting a metabolic or toxic encephalopathy. Elevated prolactin levels 10-20 min. after the event help in differentiating generalized tonic-clonic or partial seizures from psychogenic nonepileptic seizures. Except for infants less than six months of age, CSF examination is recommended only when a cerebral infection is suspected. An EEG should be performed within 24 h. after a seizure, particularly in children. If the EEG is normal during wakefulness, a sleep EEG is recommended. A CT scan is strictly indicated when a severe structural lesion is suspected or when the etiology is unknown. MRI may not be indicated in the emergency room, but it should be preferred to CT as part of the diagnostic assessment. The added value of other diagnostic tools (neuropsychological tests, ambulatory EEG, functional MRI, SPECT, and PET) is as yet unknown. These tests may be used on a case-by-case basis. In the presence of an acute symptomatic seizure, treatment of the cause is recommended. Symptomatic therapy is not justified unless the seizure has the characteristics of status epilepticus. Long-term treatment may be considered in patients with abnormal EEG and imaging data and after consideration of the social, emotional, and personal implications of seizure relapse.

EEG data were recorded with an array of 128-channel sensors. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and temporal spectral evolution (TSE, time-dependent amplitude changes) were analysed. VEP results showed a significant improvement in full-term infants' latencies with age for forwards and reversed optic flow but not random visual motion. Full-term infants at 12 months significantly differentiated between the motion conditions, with the shortest latency observed for forwards optic flow and the longest latency for random visual motion, while preterm infants did not improve their latencies with age, nor were they able to differentiate between the motion conditions at 12 months. Differences in induced activities were also observed where comparisons between TSEs of the motion conditions and a static non-flow pattern showed desynchronised theta-band activity in both full-term and preterm infants, with synchronised alpha-beta band activity observed only in the full-term infants at 12 months. Full-term infants at 12 months with a substantial amount of self-produced locomotor experience and neural maturation coupled with faster oscillating cell assemblies, rely on the perception of structured optic flow to move around efficiently in the environment. The poorer responses in the preterm infants could be related to impairment of the dorsal visual stream specialized in the processing of visual motion. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We performed a 1-year prospective audit of use of a group of PNES-related health care items in patients with newly diagnosed (mean duration: 7.3 months) PNES from PNES onset to diagnosis and from diagnosis to 6 months postdiagnosis. Twenty-eight patients (20 women, age: 34 +/- 16 years) were responsible for 14 general practitioner home visits, 31 ambulance calls, 34 emergency department visits, 21 hospital admissions (66 inpatient days), 8 MRI scans, 24 CT scans, 2 standard EEGs, 28 short video EEG recordings, and 5 ambulatory EEG recordings. In the 6 months following diagnosis, there were 2 emergency department visits (94.1% reduction), no hospital admissions (100% reduction), 2 ambulance calls, no general practitioner visits, 1 MRI scan, and no CT scans or EEGs. The immediacy of this marked health care demand reduction suggests that the relationship between presentation of diagnosis and health care demand reduction is causal. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

J	Horne, J				Horne, Jim			Exercise benefits for the aging brain depend on the accompanying cognitive load: insights from sleep electroencephalogram	SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						Physical activity; Aging brain; Cognitive load; Use dependent recovery processes; Sleep; EEG slow wave activity; Sleep spindles	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; AEROBIC EXERCISE; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL PERFORMANCE; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EEG; SPINDLES	Although exercise clearly offsets aging effects on the body, its benefits for the aging brain are likely to depend on the extent that physical activity (especially locomotion) facilitates multisensory encounters, curiosity, and interactions with novel environments; this is especially true for exploratory activity, which occupies much of wakefulness for most mammals in the wild. Cognition is inseparable from physical activity, with both interlinked to promote neuroplasticity and more successful brain aging. In these respects and for humans, exercising in a static, featureless, artificially lit indoor setting contrasts with exploratory outdoor walking within a novel environment during daylight. However, little is known about the comparative benefits for the aging brain of longer-term daily regimens of this latter nature including the role of sleep, to the extent that sleep enhances neuroplasticity as shown in short-term laboratory studies. More discerning analyses of sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) slow-wave activity especially 0.5-2-Hz activity would provide greater insights into use-dependent recovery processes during longer-term tracking of these regimens and complement slower changing waking neuropsychologic and resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures, including those of the brain's default mode network. Although the limited research only points to ephemeral small sleep EEG effects of pure exercise, more enduring effects seem apparent when physical activity incorporates cognitive challenges. In terms of "use it or lose it,'' curiosity-driven "getting out and about,'' encountering, interacting with, and enjoying novel situations may well provide the brain with its real exercise, further reflected in changes to the dynamics of sleep.

Long term monitoring in refractory epilepsy: the Gowers Unit experience	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY NEUROSURGERY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							PSYCHOGENIC NONEPILEPTIC SEIZURES; PAROXYSMAL EVENTS; EEG; DIAGNOSIS; UTILITY	Introduction: Guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the International League Against Epilepsy recommend long term EEG monitoring (LTM) in patients for whom seizure or syndrome type is unclear, and in patients for whom it is proving difficult to differentiate between epilepsy and non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD). The purpose of this study was to evaluate this recommended use of LTM in the setting of an epilepsy tertiary referral unit. Methods: This study reviewed the case notes of all admissions to the Sir William Gowers Unit at the National Society for Epilepsy in the years 2004 and 2005. A record was made of the type, duration and result of all LTM performed both prior to and during the admission. Pre- and post-admission diagnoses were compared, and patients were divided according to whether LTM had resulted in a change in diagnosis, refinement in diagnosis or no change in diagnosis. The distinction between change and a refinement in the diagnosis was made on the basis of whether or not this alteration resulted in a change in management. Results: 612 patients were admitted during 2004 and 2005, 230 of whom were referred for diagnostic clarification. Of these, LTM was primarily responsible for a change in diagnosis in 133 (58%) and a refinement of diagnosis in 29 (13%). In 65 (29%) patients the diagnosis remained the same after LTM. In those patients in whom there was a change in diagnosis, the most common change was in distinguishing epilepsy from NEAD in 73 (55%) and in distinguishing between focal and generalised epilepsy in 47 (35%). LTM was particularly helpful in differentiating frontal lobe seizures from generalised seizures and non-epileptic attacks. Inpatient ambulatory EEG proved as effective as video telemetry in helping to distinguish between NEAD, focal and generalised epilepsy. Discussion: The study revealed that LTM led to an alteration in the diagnosis of 71% of patients referred to a tertiary centre for diagnostic clarification of possible epilepsy. Although LTM is relatively expensive, time consuming and of limited availability, this needs to be balanced against the considerable financial and social cost of misdiagnosed and uncontrolled seizures. This service evaluation supports the use of performing LTM (either video or ambulatory) in a specialist setting in patients who present diagnostic difficulty.

Utilizing Subdermal Electrodes as a Noninvasive Alternative for Motor-Based BCIs	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES HANDBOOK: TECHNOLOGICAL AND THEORETICAL ADVANCES			English	Article; Book Chapter							WIRE ELECTRODES; SIGNALS	Continuous, long-term scalp electroenchephalogram (EEG) monitoring of brain activity is difficult to perform on awake, ambulatory patients because of increased artifacts from muscles and electronic interference, as well as frequent electrode replacement over time. Prior research has shown that subdermal wire electrodes placed below the scalp maintain good recording characteristics with stable impedances for long-term monitoring of EEG signals. This chapter provides evidence that an implanted subdermal recording electrode system may provide a reliable, long-term, portable method for recording motor-related signals from the brain. This chapter outlines a study that found that neural recordings that used subdermal electrodes were comparable to those of scalp surface recordings, particularly in the low-frequency bands (8-30 Hz). The coherence results indicate that there appears to be mutual information between the subdermal and surface electrode signals in the low-frequency signal, but many of signals in the higher frequencies (>40 Hz) may be unique to each surface and subdermal electrode. These results further support the idea that an implantable subdermal electrode system may provide reliable, long-term motor control signals for brain-computer interface control.

Characterizing Intent Changes in Exoskeleton-Assisted Walking Through Onboard Sensors	2019 IEEE 16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON REHABILITATION ROBOTICS (ICORR)	International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics ICORR		English	Proceedings Paper	16th IEEE International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR)	JUN 24-28, 2019	Toronto, CANADA	IEEE			SPEED	Robotic exoskeletons are a promising technology for rehabilitation and locomotion following musculoskeletal injury, but their adoption outside the physical therapy clinic has been limited by relatively primitive methods for identifying and incorporating the user's gait intentions. Various intent detection approaches have been demonstrated using electromyography and electroencephalography signals. These technologies sense the human directly but introduce complications for donning/doffing the device and in measurement consistency. By contrast, sensors onboard the exoskeleton avoid these complications but sense the human indirectly via the human-robot interface. This pilot study examines if onboard sensors alone may enable identification of user intent. Joint positions and commanded motor currents are compared prior to and after changes in the user's intended gait speed. Preliminary experimental results confirm that these measures are significantly different following intent changes for both able-bodied and non-able-bodied users. The findings suggest that intent detection is possible with onboard sensors alone, but the intent signals depend on exoskeleton control settings, user ability, and temporal considerations.

Methods: Initially, and after 3 and 9 months of VNS-treatment, 15 children were investigated with 24 h ambulatory EEG monitoring for spike detection. The number of interictal epiteptiform discharges (IEDs) and the inter spike intervals (ISIs) were analysed during 2 h in the awake state, and 1 h of rapid eye movement (REM)-, spindle- and delta-steep, respectively. Total number and duration of electrographic seizure episodes were also analysed. Results: At 9 months the total number of IEDs was significantly reduced (p = 0.04). There was a tendency of reduction in all activity stages, and significantly so in delta-steep (p = 0.008). Total etectrographic seizure number was significantly reduced in the 24 h EEG at 3 and 9 months (p = 0.03, 0.05). There was a significant concordance in direction of changes in epileptiform activity and etectrographic seizures at 9 months (p = 0.04). Concordance in direction of changes was seen in 9 of 15 children between clinical seizures and IED (p > 0.3), in 10 of 15 children between QOL and IED (p = 0.3) and in 8 of 15 children between NHS3 and IED (p > 0.3). There was no direct correlation between the extent of improvement in these clinical data and the degree of spike reduction. Conclusion: This study shows that VNS reduces IEDs especially in REM and delta steep, as well as the number of electrographic seizures. It also shows a concordance between reduction in IEDs and etectrographic seizures. (c) 2005 BEA Trading Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: Cohort study, comparison of sleep measures between BDZs abusers and controls. Drug Addiction Unit (Institute of Psychiatry) and Unit of Sleep Disorders (Institute of Neurology) of the Catholic University in Rome. Six outpatients affected by chronic BDZ abuse were enrolled, (4 men, 2 women, mean age 53.3 +/- 14.8, range: 34-70 years); 55 healthy controls were also enrolled (23 men, 32 women, mean age 54.2 +/- 13.0, range: 27-76 years). All patients underwent clinical evaluation, psychometric measures, ambulatory polysomnography, scoring of sleep macrostructure and microstructure (power spectral fast-frequency EEG arousal, cyclic alternating pattern [CAP]), and heart rate variability. Results: BDZ abusers had relevant modification of sleep macrostructure and a marked reduction of fast-frequency EEG arousal in NREM (patients: 6.6 +/- 3.7 events/h, controls 13.7 +/- 4.9 events/h, U-test: 294, p = 0.002) and REM (patients: 8.4 +/- 2.4 events/h, controls 13.3 +/- 5.1 events/h, U-test: 264, p = 0.016), and of CAP rate (patients: 15.0 +/- 8.6%, controls: 51.2% +/- 12.1%, U-test: 325, p < 0.001). Discussion: BDZ abusers have reduction of arousals associated with increased number of nocturnal awakenings and severe impairment of sleep architecture. The effect of chronic BDZ abuse on sleep may be described as a severe impairment of arousal dynamics; the result is the inability to modulate levels of vigilance.

Language outcome, in particular, seems to be affected, although rolandic epilepsy originates from the motor-sensory cortex. In this study we tried to find a correlation between locomotion problems and language impairment. Methods: In this noncontrolled, open, clinical cohort study of 48 children with rolandic epilepsy, a 24-hour EEG and a neuropsychological assessment were obtained for all children. Results: Children with rolandic epilepsy had a significant delay in reading skills (reading words: mean = 6 months, SD = 11.9, P<0.002; reading sentences: mean = 8.6 months, SD = 12.7, P<0.001), compared with the healthy population. There was a significant correlation between problems in motor development and delays in reading skills (reading words: r = -0.426, P=0.006: reading sentences: r = -0343, P = 0.03). Conclusion: Reading performance is impaired in children with rolandic epilepsy. Reading of sentences is more impaired than reading of words. There is a significant correlation between problems in motor development and language, suggesting their interaction at the level of the cortex. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to assess the signal acquisition and the performance of the automatic sleep staging algorithms of a reduced-montage dry-electroencephalographic (EEG) device (Dreem headband, DH) compared to the gold-standard polysomnography (PSG) scored by five sleep experts. Methods: A total of 25 subjects who completed an overnight sleep study at a sleep center while wearing both a PSG and the DH simultaneously have been included in the analysis. We assessed (1) similarity of measured EEG brain waves between the DH and the PSG; (2) the heart rate, breathing frequency, and respiration rate variability (RRV) agreement between the DH and the PSG; and (3) the performance of the DH's automatic sleep staging according to American Academy of Sleep Medicine guidelines versus PSG sleep experts manual scoring. Results: The mean percentage error between the EEG signals acquired by the DH and those from the PSG for the monitoring of a was 15 +/- 3.5%, 16 +/- 4.3% for 13, 16 +/- 6.1% for lambda, and 10 +/- 1.4% for theta frequencies during sleep. The mean absolute error for heart rate, breathing frequency, and RRV was 1.2 +/- 0.5 bpm, 0.3 +/- 0.2 cpm, and 3.2 +/- 0.6%, respectively. Automatic sleep staging reached an overall accuracy of 83.5 +/- 6.4% (F1 score: 83.8 +/- 6.3) for the DH to be compared with an average of 86.4 +/- 8.0% (F1 score: 86.3 +/- 7.4) for the 5 sleep experts. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the capacity of the DH to both monitor sleep-related physiological signals and process them accurately into sleep stages. This device paves the way for, large-scale, longitudinal sleep studies.

In the present study, we investigated in how far cognitive and motor functioning interfere in an outdoor environment. Our participants performed an auditory oddball task while concurrently completing various motor tasks on the outside premises of our institute. Beside behavioural responses and subjective workload ratings, we also analysed electrophysiological data recorded with a 30-channel mobile EEG montage. We observed an increase of subjective workload and decrease of performance with increasing movement complexity. Accordingly, we also found a decrease in the parietal P3 amplitude as well as in frontal midline Theta power with higher motor load. These results indicate that an increased movement complexity imposes a higher workload to the cognitive system, which, in turn, effectively reduces the availability of cognitive resources for the cognitive task. Overall this experiment demonstrates the feasibility of transferring classical paradigms of cognitive research to real-world settings. The findings support the notion of shared resources for motor and cognitive functions by demonstrating distinct modulations of correlates of cognitive processes across different motor tasks.

Methods: Three independent reviewers undertook an electronic database research browsing six databases. The search request consisted of three search fields. The first field comprised common methods to evaluate brain activity.The second search field comprised synonyms for brain responses to movements. The third search field comprised synonyms for walking. Results: 48 of an initial yield of 1832 papers were reviewed. We found differences in cortical activity regarding young vs. old individuals, physically fit vs. physically unfit cohorts, healthy people vs. patients with neurological diseases, and between simple and complex walking tasks. Conclusions: We summarize that the dimension of brain activity in different brain areas during walking is highly sensitive to task complexity, age and pathologies supporting previous assumptions underpinning the significance of cortical control. Many compensation mechanisms reflect the brain's plasticity which ensures stable walking. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The changes were more prominent in the frontal cortex areas. The influence of hypnotic state on cortical gamma activity pharmacologically augmented by ketamine injection was analyzed. Administration of subanesthetic ketamine doses led to behavioral locomotor excitation of an animal accompanied by a long-lasting (up to 2 h) increase in the gamma electrical activity. If the animal hypnosis was induced after the ketamine injection, it resulted in an almost instant reorganization of the spectral power. The slow-wave power increased and the gamma-power decreased to the baseline levels. Thus, the animal hypnosis eliminated the reorganization of cortical rhythmicity produced by ketamine, which suggests a stabilizing and, to a certain extent, protective function of this kind of hypnosis in the states of behavioral locomotion and stress.

However, there is hardly any information available regarding the underlying neural correlates of single-and dual-task walking. We had 12 young adults (23.8 +/- 2.8 years) walk while concurrently performing a cognitive interference (CI) or a motor interference (MI) task. Simultaneously, neural activation in frontal, central, and parietal brain areas was registered using a mobile EEG system. Results showed that the MI task but not the CI task affected walking performance in terms of significantly decreased gait velocity and stride length and significantly increased stride time and tempo-spatial variability. Average activity in alpha and beta frequencies was significantly modulated during both CI and MI walking conditions in frontal and central brain regions, indicating an increased cognitive load during dual-task walking. Our results suggest that impaired motor performance during dual-task walking is mirrored in neural activation patterns of the brain. This finding is in line with established cognitive theories arguing that dual-task situations overstrain cognitive capabilities resulting in motor performance decrements.

The impact of sleep characteristics and epilepsy variables on memory performance in patients with focal seizures	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Discharges; Hippocampal lesion; Slow-wave sleep; EEG; Retention	SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; CONSOLIDATION; HIPPOCAMPAL; OSCILLATIONS; RETENTION; SPINDLES; RIPPLES; STIMULATION; HOMEOSTASIS; DISTURBANCE	Disturbed sleep can negatively affect overnight memory retention as well as new learning the subsequent day. In healthy participants, positive associations between memory performance and sleep characteristics (e.g., time spent in slow-wave sleep [SWS]) have been detected. In a previous study, we found that SWS was much reduced in patients with focal seizures, but when correlations between memory complaints and various sleep characteristics were considered, the only significant relationship was with the time to onset of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (i.e., REM latency). In this study, we investigated the relationships between sleep, epilepsy, and objective memory performance variables. Twenty-five patients with focal seizures had their memory tested while undergoing a two-day ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG). The sleep variables of interest were the percentage of time spent in SWS (%SWS) and REM latency. Epilepsy variables included the presence of (1) seizures, (2) interictal epileptiform discharges, and/or (3) hippocampal lesions as well as site of seizure origin (temporal vs extratemporal). Overnight retention (of autobiographical events, a story, and a complex geometric figure) and the ability to learn a word list on day 2 were the measures of memory. A significant positive correlation was found between word-list learning and %SWS during the previous night. A significant negative correlation was observed between REM latency and overnight retention of autobiographical events. Overnight retention scores for the story and geometric figure were not related to sleep characteristics but were negatively affected by the presence of epileptiform activity. Story retention was also worse for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) than for patients with extratemporal epilepsy (ETE). Those with hippocampal lesions were more impaired than those without lesions on word-list learning, autobiographical events retention, and story retention. When multiple contributing factors were entered into regression analyses, %SWS was found to be the best predictor of subsequent word-list learning, whereas the presence of a hippocampal lesion was the best predictor of overnight retention of autobiographical events and a story.

The DCT algorithm is necessary to implement the signal compression subsystem for an ambulaloty EEG system. Hardware/Software co-design techniques were applied to optimize the DCT algorithm. The ambulatory system requires a DCT compression module capable of processing 32 channels. The DCT algorithm was first implemented totally in software (SW/SW). The large clock cycle count required to execute the SW/SW implementation motivated the partitioning of the DCT algorithm in hardware and software modules. The results, obtained by modeling the hardware and software modules using systemC, indicate the HW/SW implementation reduces the DCTs algorithm execution time by 83.11%.

Postural changes imposed by balance perturbations elicit a robust negative potential (N1) and a brisk increase of theta activity in the electroencephalogram recorded over midfrontal scalp areas. Because action monitoring is a cognitive function proposed to detect errors and initiate corrective adjustments, we hypothesized that the possible cortical markers of action monitoring during balance control (N1 potential and theta rhythm) scale with perturbation intensity and the eventual execution of reactive stepping responses (as opposed to feet-in-place responses). We recorded high-density electroencephalogram from eleven young individuals, who participated in an experimental balance assessment. The participants were asked to recover balance following anteroposterior translations of the support surface at various intensities, while attempting to maintain both feet in place. We estimated source-resolved cortical activity using independent component analysis. Combining time-frequency decomposition and group-level general linear modeling of single-trial responses, we found a significant relation of the interaction between perturbation intensity and stepping responses with multiple cortical features from the midfrontal cortex, including the N1 potential, and theta, alpha, and beta rhythms. Our findings suggest that the cortical responses to balance perturbations index the magnitude of a deviation from a stable postural state to predict the need for reactive stepping responses. We propose that the cortical control of balance may involve cognitive control mechanisms (i.e., action monitoring) that facilitate postural adjustments to maintain postural stability.

Of these, seizures are the most common acute symptom, mainly of the generalised tonic-clonic type, with focal events only exceptionally being reported and documented. Hypoglycaemia can modify cortical excitability by determining an imbalance between excitation and inhibition; some brain structures, such as the temporal lobe and hippocampus, appear to be particularly susceptible to this insult. We describe a case of a 61-year-old diabetic patient in whom insulin-induced transient hypoglycaemia triggered a focal seizure of temporal origin that was well documented by EEG during 24-hour ambulatory monitoring. This is, to our knowledge, one of the few, well-documented cases of this type of seizure.

Hybrid brain-computer interface with motor imagery and error-related brain activity	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interface; error-related potentials; motor imagery; EEG; common spatial patterns; hybrid BCI; BCI feedback	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; SPATIAL FILTERS; CLASSIFICATION; POTENTIALS; COMMUNICATION; PERFORMANCE; BCI	Objective. Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems read and interpret brain activity directly from the brain. They can provide a means of communication or locomotion for patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases or stroke. However, non-stationarity of brain activity limits the reliable transfer of the algorithms that were trained during a calibration session to real-time BCI control. One source of non-stationarity is the user's brain response to the BCI output (feedback), for instance, whether the BCI feedback is perceived as an error by the user or not. By taking such sources of non-stationarity into account, the reliability of the BCI can be improved. Approach. In this work, we demonstrate a real-time implementation of a hybrid motor imagery BCI combining the information from the motor imagery signal and the error-related brain activity simultaneously so as to gain benefit from both sources. Main results. We show significantly improved performance in real-time BCI control across 12 participants, compared to a conventional motor imagery BCI. The significant improvement is in terms of classification accuracy, target hit rate, subjective perception of control and information-transfer rate. Moreover, our offline analyses of the recorded EEG data show that the error-related brain activity provides a more reliable source of information than the motor imagery signal. Significance. This work shows, for the first time, that the error-related brain activity classifier compared to the motor imagery classifier is more consistent when trained on calibration data and tested during online control. This likely explains why the proposed hybrid BCI allows for a more reliable means of communication or rehabilitation for patients in need.

In this study, we further investigated whether other structures that are connected to the septohippocampal system are involved in mediating general anesthesia. In freely behaving rats, muscimol (0.25 mg) or saline was infused intracerebrally into one of four areas - the supramammillary area (SUM), nucleus accumbens (NAC), ventral pallidum (VP), and ventral tegmental area (VTA) - and righting, pain, and EEG responses were recorded following either halothane or sodium pentobarbital, representing inhalational and injectable general anesthetic, respectively. The effect of halothane (2%) or pentobarbital (20 mg/kg i.p.) in abolishing the righting, pain response, or low-voltage neocortical activity was enhanced, and the initial behavioral hyperactivity (delirium) was reduced, after muscimol as compared to after saline infusion in SUM, NAC, VP, and VTA. EEGs in the hippocampus and the sensorimotor cortex following halothane or pentobarbital showed increased delta, and decreased hippocampal theta and gamma waves after muscimol infusion as compared to saline infusion in SUM, NAC, VP, and VTA. By contrast, infusion of muscimol in the median raphe increased locomotion and did not significantly alter the behavioral or EEG effects of halothane or pentobarbital. It is suggested that structures that activate the limbic cortices (MS, SUM, and VTA but not the median raphe) or mediate the output of the hippocampus (NAC and VP) normally participate in maintaining consciousness and inactivation of these structures potentiates the response to a general anesthetic.

The present study assessed the sleep-promoting (sedative-hypnotic) effects of Artemisia capillaris Thunberg (A. capillaris), and elucidated a possible mechanism behind its effect. ICR mice were given A. capillaris extract (oral) at different dosages (50, 100, 200, 300, or 400 mg/kg), distilled water (oral; control), or diazepam (intraperitoneal; reference drug). One hour after administration, locomotion (open-field test) and motor coordination (rota-rod test) were assessed. The extract's effect on pentobarbital-induced sleep was also evaluated. Additionally, electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were measured in rats. To evaluate a possible mechanism behind its effects, changes in chloride (Cl-) ion influx were measured in human neuroblastoma cells. As compared to the control group, mice treated with A. capillaris demonstrated significantly decreased locomotor activity and impaired motor balance and coordination. The extract also shortened the onset and lengthened the duration of sleep induced by pentobarbital sodium. These effects were comparable to that induced by diazepam. Furthermore, A. capillaris-treated rats showed increased delta and decreased alpha EEG waves; an electroencephalographic pattern indicative of relaxation or sedation. In neuroblastoma cells, the extract dose-dependently increased Cl- ion influx, which was blocked by co-administration of bicuculline, a GABA(A) receptor competitive antagonist, suggesting that its effects are mediated through the GABA(A) receptor-Cl- ion channel complex. Altogether, the results of the present study demonstrate that A. capillaris possesses potent sedative-hypnotic effects, which are probably mediated through potentiation of the GABA(A) receptor-Cl- ion channel complex.

The PAT signal is a measure of the pulsatile arterial volume changes at the finger tip reflecting sympathetic tone variations and is recorded by an ambulatory unattended device, the Watch-PAT100, which has been shown to be capable of detecting wake, NREM and REM sleep. An algorithm to differentiate light from deep sleep was developed using a training set of 49 patients and was validated using a separate set of 44 patients. In both patient sets, Watch-PAT100 data were recorded simultaneously with polysomnography during a full night sleep study. The algorithm is based on 14 features extracted from two time series of PAT amplitudes and inter-pulse periods (IPP). Those features were then further processed to yield a prediction function that determines the likelihood of detecting a deep sleep stage epoch during NREM sleep periods. Overall sensitivity, specificity and agreement of the automatic algorithm to identify standard 30 s epochs of light and deep sleep stages were 66%, 89%, 82% and 65%, 87%, 80% for the training and validation sets, respectively. Together with the already existing algorithms for REM and wake detection we propose a close to full stage detection method based solely on the PAT and actigraphy signals. The automatic sleep stages detection algorithm could be very useful for unattended ambulatory sleep monitoring assessing sleep stages when EEG recordings are not available.

The wave packet is filtered and sent to the entorhinal cortex, where it is combined with wave packets from all sensory systems. This triggers the second step forming a unified memory that is passed through the hippocampal formation where it is assigned a place in the life-long memory of the subject. In the third step the output of the entorhinal cortex triggers the formation of a global wave packet that synchronizes the oscillatory activity of most of not all of the cerebral cortex. This shared oscillation caries a pattern of amplitude modulation, that can be observed noninvasively from the scalp EEG of human volunteers perceiving the stimulus and correlated with the stimulus. The same dendritic electric currents that drive the output of the brains of the wave packet drive the observed EEG signs. Therefore I postulate that the global wave packet, the third step in the cycle requiring only 0.2 seconds expresses the memory of the global accommodation that initiates the next action-perception cycle. Some unspecified fraction of the AM pattern is available to me the observer, and some other unspecified fraction of the total activity in the subject who is expected to respond to the stimulus. There is reason to hope that these fractions will coincide often enough to support refinements in techniques for extending these correlates of consciousness.

Recently, the cholinomimetic neostigmine has been reported to strongly enhance REMS following microinjection into the PRF of the mouse. That study used behavioral assessments of locomotion in lieu of electrophysiological measures of muscle tone to identify REMS. We sought to confirm that the behavioral state induced in mice by PRF injections of neostigmine meets standard electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) criteria for defining REMS. Cortical EEG, nuchal muscle EMG, and PGO waves were recorded from male C57BL/6N mice with chronic indwelling cannulae for the delivery of neostigmine to the PRF. Recordings were made during midday following injections of neostigmine (8.8 mM, 50 nl), 2 h after lights on (LD 12:12). Neostigmine induced a behavioral state characterized by low amplitude, highly desynchronized cortical EEG with little theta, no PGO waves, and a sustained high muscle tone. Behavioral states meeting standard criteria for slow-wave sleep (SWS) and REMS were significantly suppressed compared to baseline recordings, and R-EMS onset was delayed by 3 h. Consistent with earlier reports, neostigmine did strongly suppress locomotor activity in open field tests and in the home cage. Due to the failure to meet criteria for defining REMS, we conclude that neostigmine microinjection into the PRF of the mouse induces an abnormal waking state rather than REMS. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The utility of an automated and ambulatory device for detecting and differentiating epileptic and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures	EPILEPSIA OPEN			English	Article						epilepsy; psychogenic non-epileptic seizures; automation; ambulatory; accelerometry		ObjectiveAccurate differentiation between epileptic seizures (ES) and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) can be challenging based on history alone. Inpatient video EEG monitoring (VEM) is often needed for a definitive diagnosis. However, VEM is highly resource intensive, is of limited availability, and cannot be undertaken over long periods. Previous research has shown that time-frequency analysis of accelerometer data could be utilized to differentiate between ES and PNES. Using a seizure detection and classification algorithm, we sought to examine the diagnostic utility of an automated analysis with an ambulatory accelerometer. MethodsA wrist-worn device was used to collect accelerometer data from patients during VEM admission, for diagnostic evaluation of convulsive seizures. An automated process, that involved the use of K-means clustering and support vector machines, was used to detect and classify each seizure as ES or PNES. The results were compared with VEM diagnoses determined by epileptologists blinded to the accelerometer data. ResultsTwenty-four convulsive seizures, consisting of at least 20 seconds of sustained continuous activity, recorded from 11 patients during inpatient VEM (13 PNES from five patients and 11 ES from six patients) were included for analysis. The automated system detected all convulsive seizures (ES, PNES) from >661 hours of recording with 67 false alarms (2.4 per 24 hours). The sensitivity and specificity for classifying ES from PNES were 72.7% and 100%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values for classifying PNES were 81.3% and 100%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the classification results obtained from the automation process and the VEM diagnoses. SignificanceThis automated system can potentially provide a wearable out-of-hospital seizure diagnostic monitoring system.

Examples of biosignals include the electrocardiogram (ECG; electrical signal associated with the heart), electromyogram (EMG; electrical signal associated with muscles), electroencephalogram (EEG; electrical signal associated with the brain), phonocardiogram (PCG; heart sounds), photoplethysmogram (PPG; changes in blood volume measured optically), and body temperature. These biosignals provide valuable information regarding the status and function of the body and can be used in various applications. ECG is used to monitor heart rate during athlete training and to diagnose and monitor cardiovascular conditions, such as atrial fibrillation, myocardial ischemia, and myocardial infarction [1]-[3]. It is also being explored for use in the security field as a replacement or augmentation of current biometric systems [4]. EMG is used in movement and gait analysis, rehabilitation medicine, and as a control signal for prosthetic devices [5]-[7]. EEG is used for brain-computer interfaces [8] and to detect the onset of epileptic seizures [9]. Conventionally, biosignals are measured by highly trained personnel in a controlled environment with short recordings. This helps to minimize signal contaminants and ensure sufficient quality of the measurements before analysis or interpretation.

Methods: We start by proposing Kmeans-directed transfer function, an adaptive functional connectivity method intended for seizure onset zone localization in bilateral intracranial EEG recordings. Electrodes identified as seizure activity sources and sinks are then used to implement a seizure-forecasting algorithm on long-term continuous recordings in dogs with naturally-occurring epilepsy. A precision-recall genetic algorithm is proposed for feature selection in line with a probabilistic support vector machine classifier. Results: Epileptic activity generators were focal in all dogs confirming the diagnosis of focal epilepsy in these animals while sinks spanned both hemispheres in 2 of 3 dogs. Seizure forecasting results show performance improvement compared to previous studies, achieving average sensitivity of 84.82% and time in warning of 0.1. Conclusion: Achieved performances highlight the feasibility of seizure forecasting in canine epilepsy. Significance: The ability to improve seizure forecasting provides promise for the development of EEG-triggered closed-loop seizure intervention systems for ambulatory implantation in patients with refractory epilepsy.

The literature suggests a strong link between gait and cognition, where attention is seen to play a central role. This study investigated if clinically useful electrophysiological measures of attention can be collected using an auditory oddball task in ecological/non-clinic environments through analysis of the amplitude and latency of auditory P3 event related potentials (ERPs). Electrophysiological (EEG, EOG, EMG) recordings were taken for 7 healthy subjects while presented with an auditory oddball task. Data was recorded in control, static (seated) and dynamic (fixed cycling) experimental conditions. Recordings were also taken for two subjects during treadmill walking. P3 ERPs were calculated and data analysis showed that peak amplitude and component latency remained stable across all experimental conditions. For the Cz electrode position there were 0.2-2% P3 amplitude and 3-9% P3 latency differences. P3 amplitude and latency also remained stable between experimental conditions for all electrode locations. This result opens up the possibility to quantitatively investigate the interaction between gait and attention during the ageing process but also in movement disorders such as freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease.

During sevoflurane anaesthesia with an AAI(TM)-index < 30, the addition or withdrawal of nitrous oxide in a concentration of 66% end tidal did not show any linear dose dependent change in AAI(TM)-index. However, comparing nitrous oxide > 40% to nitrous oxide < 10% end tidal concentration the AAI(TM)-index did decrease, p < 0.05. The AAI(TM)-index is either non-linear at deeper anaesthetic levels or is insensitive to the anaesthetic effects of nitrous oxide in terms of MAC-multiples.

The network activity patterns in the awake resting state and in the actively behaving state in rodents are not well understood, and a better tool for differentiating these states can provide insights on healthy brain functions and its alteration with disease. Therefore, we simultaneously recorded local field potentials (LFPs) bilaterally in motor cortex and striatum, and measured locomotion from healthy, freely behaving rats. Here we analyze spectral characteristics of the obtained signals and present an algorithm for automatic discrimination of the awake resting and the behavioral states. We used the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and utilized features obtained by applying discrete wavelet transform (DWT) on LFPs, which arose as a solution with high accuracy.

Their function is not fully understood. In the present study, the involvement of D3 receptors in locomotor activity and sleep in the two structures was investigated. The method used was the measure of locomotor activity in an open field and the measure of sleep and sleep/waking stages by electroencephalographic recordings in the rat. Dopamine receptor agonists (7-OH-DPAT, quinelorane and SKF38393) and antagonists (amisulpride, nafadotride and haloperidol) were microinjected into the two structures. Concerning locomotor activity, the results show that D3 receptor stimulation, as well as concomitant stimulation of D1 and D3 receptors, have opposite effects in the cerebellum and in the core of nucleus accumbens, with an inhibition of locomotion in the cerebellum and a stimulation of locomotion in the nucleus accumbens. D1 and D3 stimulation have mutual potentiating locomotor effects. The results also show that in the cerebellum, the effects are selective to lobules 9 and 10, and are not observed with microinjections into lobule 8. Concerning sleep, the effects of agonists and antagonists show a similar tendency in the cerebellum and nucleus accumbens, with a somnogenic effect of D2 blockage, an awakening effect of at least one of the D2/ D3 agonists, and a dose-dependent awakening effect of the D2/D3 antagonists. In conclusion, this study suggests that dopamine D3 receptors in the cerebellum and nucleus accumbens are involved in several aspects of the regulation of locomotor activity and sleep.

Brain Network Oscillations During Gait in Parkinson's Disease	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						locomotion; deep brain stimulation; basal ganglia; cerebral cortex; coherence; neurorehabilitation; closed-loop stimulation	FIELD POTENTIAL ACTIVITY; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; MOTOR REPRESENTATION; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; WALKING; STIMULATION; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; SYNCHRONIZATION; DYNAMICS	Human bipedal walking is a complex motor task that requires supraspinal control for balance and flexible coordination of timing and scaling of many muscles in different environment. Gait impairments are a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD), reflecting dysfunction of cortico-basal ganglia-brainstem circuits. Recent studies using implanted electrodes and surface electroencephalography have demonstrated gait-related brain oscillations in the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. Here, we review the physiological and pathophysiological roles of (1) basal ganglia oscillations, (2) cortical oscillations, and (3) basal ganglia-cortical interactions during walking. These studies extend a novel framework for movement of disorders where specific patterns of abnormal oscillatory synchronization in the basal ganglia thalamocortical network are associated with specific signs and symptoms. Therefore, we propose that many gait dysfunctions in PD arise from derangements in brain network, and discuss potential therapies aimed at restoring gait impairments through modulation of brain network in PD.

A comparative methods' assessment	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Motor potential; Stepping; Locomotion; Motion capture; Biomechanics	POSTURAL ADJUSTMENTS; WALKING; POTENTIALS; TREADMILL	Background: Movement-Related Cortical Potentials (MRCPs) are widely used in studying brain dynamics of motor control. However, limited information is available on complex tasks such as locomotion for which the appropriate identification of gait initiation trigger is still a technical challenge. Thus, it is conceivable that recorded brain activity may vary due to the instrument used to provide the temporal trigger. Therefore, a comparative assessment was performed to determine whether and how trigger identification techniques affect the MRCP in gait initiation. New Method: Eleven able-bodied young participants performed 200 forward- and 200 backward-oriented self initiated steps. Brain activity was recorded through 64-channel electroencephalography. Four different triggering techniques were tested based on measurements of surface electromyography, stereophotogrammetry and forceplates. Results: Repeated-Measures ANOVAs on the mean amplitude of the Bereitschaftspotential and on both peak amplitude and latency of the motor potential showed a main effect of the triggering technique (p < 0.003). Specifically, force plates signal amplitude ( - 11.56 +/- 1.4 mu V) was larger than stereophotogrammetry ( - 5.0 +/- 0.5 mu V and 6.5 +/- 1 mu V) and electromyography ( - 7.2 +/- 0.9 mu V). Comparison with Existing Method(s): Considering the gait initiation task, no previous study has performed a comparison between the MRCPs observed by triggering the same signal with different approaches. Conclusion Different instruments identify triggers that vary in terms of time delay, resulting in different amplitudes and timing of the MRCPs. The comparative analysis indicates that forceplate allows to obtain the best MRCP trigger to study gait initiation, in terms of signal strength, cost and set up time.

Your brain on speed: cognitive performance of a spatial working memory task is not affected by walking speed	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						locomotion; EEG; brain imaging; dual-tasking; spatial working memory	SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; OLDER-ADULTS; TREADMILL WALKING; MOTOR INTERFERENCE; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; GAIT PERFORMANCE; YOUNG-ADULTS; VARIABILITY; ATTENTION	When humans walk in everyday life, they typically perform a range of cognitive tasks while they are on the move. Past studies examining performance changes in dual cognitive-motor tasks during walking have produced a variety of results. These discrepancies may be related to the type of cognitive task chosen, differences in the walking speeds studied, or lack of controlling for walking speed. The goal of this study was to determine how young, healthy subjects performed a spatial working memory task over a range of walking speeds. We used high-density electroencephalography to determine if electrocortical activity mirrored changes in cognitive performance across speeds. Subjects stood (0.0 m/s) and walked (0.4, 0.8, 1.2, and 1.6 m/s) with and without performing a Brooks spatial working memory task. We hypothesized that performance of the spatial working memory task and the associated electrocortical activity would decrease significantly with walking speed. Across speeds, the spatial working memory task caused subjects to step more widely compared with walking without the task. This is typically a sign that humans are adapting their gait dynamics to increase gait stability. Several cortical areas exhibited power fluctuations time-locked to memory encoding during the cognitive task. In the somatosensory association cortex, alpha power increased prior to stimulus presentation and decreased during memory encoding. There were small significant reductions in theta power in the right superior parietal lobule and the posterior cingulate cortex around memory encoding. However, the subjects did not show a significant change in cognitive task performance or electrocortical activity with walking speed. These findings indicate that in young, healthy subjects walking speed does not affect performance of a spatial working memory task. These subjects can devote adequate cortical resources to spatial cognition when needed, regardless of walking speed.

J	Horne, J				Horne, Jim			REM sleep vs exploratory wakefulness: Alternatives within adult 'sleep debt'?	SLEEP MEDICINE REVIEWS			English	Review						Human REM sleep; Atonia; Exploratory wakefulness; Neuroplasticity; Neoteny; Locomotion; Sleep debt	EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; HUMAN CORTEX; MU RHYTHM; BRAIN; DURATION; EEG; DEPRIVATION; ACTIVATION; AMYGDALA	Our declining sleep duration over early human infant development is largely through REM sleep (REM), loss, not of nonREM. It coincides with the infant's increasing locomotion providing for multisensory inputs ('exploratory wakefulness' - EW), together facilitating neural restructuring and behavioural adaptations ('neuroplasticity'). EW also involves curiosity, novelty, navigation, spatial memory, associated emotions, and feeding; all having brain processes particularly active in REM. It is proposed that: 1) REM is a proxy for EW in facilitating neuroplasticity; 2) necessitating REM having a locomotor output, actively inhibited (the atonia); 3) human adults retain many (neotenous) infant characteristics including large amounts of REM towards the end of usual sleep, where REM's qualitative changes indicate reduced sleep pressure, 4) as in infancy, some of our adult REM remains replaceable by EW (without REM rebounds), mostly in this final REM episode whenever EW need prevails. Accordingly, our adult sleep duration is adaptable to habitual shortening via this REM episode substituted by purposeful EW, which could provide extra (day) light exposure for circadian synchrony. Such processes may underlie seasonally shorter (6 h) sleep, eg in hunter-gather people. This flexibility of REM questions the extent of our western 'chronic sleep debt'. Evidence is provided to counter claims that this absent REM would cause obesity and related disorders. 200w. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Dynamics of corticospinal motor control during overground and treadmill walking in humans	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						ambulatory EEG; corticomuscular coherence; human gait; neural oscillations; time frequency analysis	CORTICOMUSCULAR COHERENCE; LEG MUSCLES; ELECTROCORTICAL ACTIVITY; SUPRASPINAL CONTROL; GRANGER CAUSALITY; SPINAL NEURONS; CORTEX CONTROL; GAIT; BRAIN; EMG	Increasing evidence suggests cortical involvement in the control of human gait. However, the nature of corticospinal interactions remains poorly understood. We performed time-frequency analysis of electrophysiological activity acquired during treadmill and overground walking in 22 healthy, young adults. Participants walked at their preferred speed (4.2, SD 0.4 km/h), which was matched across both gait conditions. Event-related power, corticomuscular coherence (CMC), and intertrial coherence (ITC) were assessed for EEG from bilateral sensorimotor cortices and EMG from the bilateral tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. Cortical power, CMC, and ITC at theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequencies (4-45 Hz) increased during the double support phase of the gait cycle for both overground and treadmill walking. High beta (21-30 Hz) CMC and ITC of EMG was significantly increased during overground compared with treadmill walking, as well as EEG power in theta hand (4-7 Hz). The phase spectra revealed positive time lags at alpha, beta, and gatmna frequencies, indicating that the EEG response preceded the EMG response. The parallel increases in power, CMC, and ITC during double support suggest evoked responses at spinal and cortical populations rather than a modulation of ongoing corticospinal oscillatory interactions. The evoked responses are not consistent with the idea of synchronization of ongoing corticospinal oscillations but instead suggest coordinated cortical and spinal inputs during the double support phase. Frequency-band dependent differences in power, CMC, and ITC between overground and treadmill walking suggest differing neural control for the two gait modalities, emphasizing the task dependent nature of neural processes during human walking. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We investigated cortical and spinal activity during overground and treadmill walking in healthy adults. Parallel increases in power, corticomuscular coherence, and intertrial coherence during double support suggest evoked responses at spinal and cortical populations rather than a modulation of ongoing corticospinal oscillatory interactions. These findings identify neurophysiological mechanisms that are important for understanding cortical control of human gait in health and disease.

Past research suggests that stepping, as a cyclical movement, should activate the motor control areas of the brain that integrates smooth movements with spinal cord nerves. The neuronal activity needed to imagine that same activity is likely to recruit additional sensory-motor areas that provide initiation and inhibition signals, making this task take on a neuronal activity pattern that is more similar to discrete movements. To assess this research question, 16 participants took part in the current study where they executed and imagined stepping, with movement at the hip, knee, and ankle joints, while viewing a computer-generated image of a human walking. A block design with a total of 10 blocks for rest and task for each condition was used. Rest blocks lasted 18 seconds, followed by an 18-second display of the visual stimulus. Results showed that in the executed condition, areas of the brain that are most prominently associated with sensory-motor activity were activated. In the imagined condition areas of the brain associated with movement control, inhibition of movement, and the integration of sensory input and motor output (parietal and occipital) were also activated. These findings contribute to the literature identifying brain areas that are activated in lower limb locomotion.

For example, noradrenergic, cholinergic, and serotonergic systems increase EEG and, in some cases, behavioral indices of arousal. The extent to which dopaminergic systems exert a similar activating influence on behavioral state remains unclear. The current studies examined the wake-promoting actions of centrally administered D1 and D2 receptor agonists. In these studies, intracerebroventricular infusions of a D1 (SKF-82958; 2.5 and 25 nmol) or D2 ( quinpirole; 40 and 140 nmol)-agonist were made into sleeping animals. The effects of these infusions on electroencephalogram/ electromyographic indices of sleep-wake state and behavior were examined. D1 agonist administration dose dependently increased time spent awake and suppressed rapid eye movement and slow-wave sleep in the 2 h immediately after infusion. D1 agonist administration also elicited modest increases in measures of locomotion and time spent grooming and eating. D2 agonist administration had similar wake-promoting actions, accompanied by modest effects on drinking and locomotion. Interestingly, D2 agonist administration also significantly increased time spent chewing on inedible material, an arousal/ stress-related behavior. Overall, these results demonstrate that dopamine contributes to the alert waking state via actions of D1 and D2 receptors. Additionally or alternatively, these results further suggest a potential involvement of dopamine receptors in the induction of high-arousal states, including stress.

Laboratory tests were all normal and the enzymatic activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme complexes I-IV were normal. However, thyroid tests showed abnormal results, and complex V showed a deficiency activity of 52.8% of the low limit of healthy individuals (normal activity is > 60.7%). The patient experienced convulsions, and the 24-h ambulatory electroencephalography results showed abnormalities, but the electromyography results were normal. Axial brain MRI showed abnormal dysplasia over the white matter myelination in the bilateral horn of the lateral ventricle. Furthermore, DNA sequencing data showed a novel mutation at 8691A > G of the mitochondrial ATPase 6 gene.

Both sleep and memory have been found to be abnormal in patients with epilepsy. In this study, we explored the effects that nocturnal epileptiform discharges and the presence of a hippocampal lesion have on sleep patterns and memory. Twenty-five patients with focal epilepsy who underwent a 24-hr ambulatory EEG also completed the Everyday Memory Questionnaire (EMQ). The EEG record was scored for length of time spent in the various sleep stages, time spent awake after sleep onset, and rapid eye movement (REM) latency. Of these sleep variables, only REM latency differed when the epilepsy patients were divided on the bases of either presence/absence of nocturnal discharges or presence/absence of a hippocampal lesion. In both cases, presence of the abnormality was associated with longer latency. Furthermore, longer REM latency was found to be a better predictor of EMQ score than either number of discharges or presence of a hippocampal lesion. Longer REM latency was associated with a smaller percentage of time spent in slow-wave sleep in the early part of the night and may serve as a particularly sensitive marker to disturbances in sleep architecture.

This Letter proposes a novel method to construct analog wavelet base for analog wavelet filter design, in which the mathematical approximation model in frequency domain is built as an optimization problem and the genetic algorithm is used to find the global optimum resolution. Also, the Gm-C filter structure based on LC ladder simulation is employed to synthesize the obtained analog wavelet base. The Marr wavelet filter is designed as an example using SMIC 1V 0.35 mu m CMOS technology. Simulation results show that the proposed method can give a stable analog wavelet filter with higher approximation accuracy and excellent circuit performance, which is well suited for the design of low-frequency low-power spike detector.

Automatic Detection of Childhood Absence Epilepsy Seizures: Toward a Monitoring Device	PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Article							SPIKE-WAVE; EEG	Automatic detections of paroxysms in patients with childhood absence epilepsy have been neglected for several years. We acquire reliable detections using only a single-channel brainwave monitor, allowing for unobtrusive monitoring of antiepileptic drug effects. Ultimately we seek to obtain optimal long-term prognoses, balancing antiepileptic effects and side effects. The electroencephalographic appearance of paroxysms in childhood absence epilepsy is fairly homogeneous, making it feasible to develop patient-independent automatic detection. We implemented a state-of-the-art algorithm to investigate the performance of paroxysm detection. Using only a single scalp electroencephalogram channel from 20 patients with a total of 125 paroxysms >2 seconds, 97.2% of paroxysms could be detected with no false detections. This result leads us to recommend further investigations of tiny, one-channel electroencephalogram systems in an ambulatory setting. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DBS of Thalamic Centromedian Nucleus for Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (ESTEL Trial)	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; GENERALIZED SEIZURES; LONG-TERM; EPILEPSY; CHILDREN; FREQUENCY; SEVERITY; DISEASE	Objective Prior uncontrolled studies have reported seizure reductions following deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), but evidence from randomized controlled studies is lacking. We aimed to formally assess the efficacy and safety of DBS to the centromedian thalamic nucleus (CM) for the treatment of LGS. Methods We conducted a prospective, double-blind, randomized study of continuous, cycling stimulation of CM-DBS, in patients with LGS. Following pre- and post-implantation periods, half received 3 months of stimulation (blinded phase), then all received 3 months of stimulation (unblinded phase). The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with >= 50% reduction in diary-recorded seizures in stimulated versus control participants, measured at the end of the blinded phase. A secondary outcome was the proportion of participants with a >= 50% reduction in electrographic seizures on 24-hour ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG) at the end of the blinded phase. Results Between November 2017 and December 2019, 20 young adults with LGS (17-37 years;13 women) underwent bilateral CM-DBS at a single center in Australia, with 19 randomized (treatment, n = 10 and control, n = 9). Fifty percent of the stimulation group achieved >= 50% seizure reduction, compared with 22% of controls (odds ratio [OR] = 3.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.44-21.45, p = 0.25). For electrographic seizures, 59% of the stimulation group had >= 50% reduction at the end of the blinded phase, compared with none of the controls (OR= 23.25, 95% CI = 1.0-538.4, p = 0.05). Across all patients, median seizure reduction (baseline vs study exit) was 46.7% (interquartile range [IQR] = 28-67%) for diary-recorded seizures and 53.8% (IQR = 27-73%) for electrographic seizures. Interpretation CM-DBS in patients with LGS reduced electrographic rather than diary-recorded seizures, after 3 months of stimulation. Fifty percent of all participants had diary-recorded seizures reduced by half at the study exit, providing supporting evidence of the treatment effect.

Investigating the role of mGluR2 versus mGluR3 in antipsychotic-like effects, sleep-wake architecture and network oscillatory activity using novel Han Wistar rats lacking mGluR2 expression	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Metabotropic glutamate receptor; mGluR2; mGluR3; Han Wistar; Hyperlocomotion; Sleep; EEG	METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY; AGONIST LY379268; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; D-AMPHETAMINE; G-PROTEIN; PHENCYCLIDINE	Group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR2 and mGluR3) are implicated in a number of psychiatric disorders. They also control sleep-wake architecture and may offer novel therapeutic targets. However, the roles of the mGluR2 versus mGluR3 subtypes are not well understood. Here, we have taken advantage of the recently described mutant strain of Han Wistar rats, which do not express mGluR2 receptors, to investigate behavioural, sleep and EEG responses to mGluR2/3 ligands. The mGluR2/3 agonist, LY354740 (10 mg/kg), reversed amphetamine- and phencyclidine-induced locomotion and rearing behaviours in control Wistar but not in mGluR2 lacking Han Wistar rats. In control Wistar but not in Han Wistar rats the mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 (3 & 10 mg/kg) induced REM sleep suppression with dose-dependent effects on wake and NREM sleep. By contrast, the mGluR2/3 antagonist LY3020371 (3 & 10 mg/kg) had wake-promoting effects in both rat strains, albeit smaller in the mGluR2-lacking Han Wistar rats, indicating both mGluR2 and mGluR3-mediated effects on wakefulness. LY3020371 enhanced wake cortical oscillations in the theta (4-9 Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz) range in both Wistar and Han Wistar rat strains, whereas LY379268 reduced theta and gamma oscillations in control Wistar rats, with minimal effects in Han Wistar rats. Together these studies illustrate the significant contribution of mGluR2 to the antipsychotic-like, sleep and EEG effects of drugs acting on group II mGluRs. However, we also provide evidence of a role for mGluR3 activity in the control of sleep and wake cortical theta and gamma oscillations. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Shin, J				Shin, Jonghan			The Interrelationship Between Movement and Cognition: Theta Rhythm and the P300 Event-Related Potential	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						delta; theta; gamma; oscillation; oddball; P300 event-related potential	HUMAN HIPPOCAMPAL; FREQUENCY; OSCILLATIONS; DELTA; RATS; BAND	The relationship among brain electrophysiological activity, motor activity, and cognition has been a matter of great interest. For example, it has been discussed whether hippocampal theta rhythm reflects motor activity or cognitive activity, whereas it is widely accepted that the P300 event-related potential (ERP) reflects cognitive processes such as updating working memory. Here, we investigated the interrelationships among motor activity, hippocampal theta rhythm, and hippocampal P300 ERP using electrophysiological and behavioral data recorded from rats performing an auditory discrimination task (i.e., the auditory oddball paradigm) in a chamber with and without a running-wheel. We found that the hippocampal theta rhythm generated during locomotion codes information about self-motion, and event-related increases in hippocampal theta rhythm observed when rats performed the auditory discrimination cognitive task reflect a change in motor behavior after learning the cognitive task. Interestingly, the hippocampal P300 ERP occurred coincidently with increases in the power and frequency of hippocampal theta rhythm. In addition, we found that changes in theta rhythm observed during spontaneous wheel running without performing a cognitive task as well as when performing the cognitive task are associated with changes in delta-and gamma-band EEG activities. These major findings are discussed with respect to current hypotheses regarding P300 ERP and theta-, delta-, and gamma-band EEG activities in brain functions. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

J	Akman, CI				Akman, Cigdem Inan			Nonconvulsive Status Epilepticus and Continuous Spike and Slow Wave of Sleep in Children	SEMINARS IN PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Review							JUVENILE MYOCLONIC EPILEPSY; EEG; SEIZURES; MORBIDITY	Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is a special epileptic state that can be more common than previously thought in children and adult patients. Currently, there is no universally accepted definition for NCSE. Early and accurate diagnosis depends on a high index of suspicion and rapid availability of electroencephalographic recording. The clinical presentation of NCSE can vary from a mild confusional state to a coma. The underlying etiology is also quite diverse. In critically ill patients, NCSE has been reported with convulsive status epilepticus (CSE), hypoxemia, acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, encephalitis, or trauma. The estimated incidence of NCSE is 15% to 40% in post-CSE, 8% in subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 8% to 10% in coma. As seen in CSE, there is a bimodal distribution with NCSE in critically ill patients; children (age <1 year) and elderly appear to be at great risk. NCSE has also been reported in a number of epilepsy syndromes, such as childhood absence epilepsy, Panayiotopoulos syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and Dravet syndrome. However, it is difficult to determine the incidence of NCSE in an ambulatory setting because of the great variation in clinical presentation and underlying etiology. This review examines the clinical features, outcome, and treatment approach for NCSE in 2 different clinical settings, in ambulatory and critically ill patients. NCSE is reviewed in children and adults to distinguish similarities and differences in their clinical presentation. Semin Pediatr Neurol 17:155-162 (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods: A non-invasive polysomnographic study of 6 spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) was conducted. The relative beta power of the motor cortex and its linear relation with muscle tone in the facial mentalis muscle and the abductor caudae medialis muscle of the tail during wakefulness and sleep stages were calculated. Results: A strong negative linear relationship (r = -.8, P = .03) was found between the relative power of the beta2 band in the left motor cortex and abductor caudae medialis muscle tone during delta sleep. Conclusions: The left motor cortex, through beta2 band activity, interacts with abductor caudae medialis muscle tonicity during delta sleep. This interaction takes part in the mechanisms that regulate the sleep postures.

It is potentially life-threatening with the highest incidence and severity in younger children. Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) is a condition, in which a child develops a nonspecific febrile illness that may not persist when the initial seizure activity begins. However, an electroencephalogram (EEG) shows that the child is in status epilepticus. We report the case of a five-year-old male who presented with difficulty to maintain sitting posture, and inability to stand and walk without support, following viral encephalitis at the age of one year. He had motor, visual, speech and cognitive impairment along with a seizure disorder. The physiotherapy interventions including neurodevelopmental treatment (NDT) and sensory integration (SI) helped in regaining locomotion ability in the child. The study aims to assess the impact of physiotherapy interventions on regaining locomotor ability in a child with FIRES following infective encephalitis.

Using Motor Imagery to Control Brain-Computer Interfaces for Communication	FOUNDATIONS OF AUGMENTED COGNITION: NEUROERGONOMICS AND OPERATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE, AC 2016, PT I	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Augmented Cognition (AC) Held as Part of 18th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (HIC International)	JUL 17-22, 2016	Toronto, CANADA			BCI; Brain-computer interface; Motor imagery; AAC	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; EEG; BCI	Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) as assistive devices are designed to provide access to communication, navigation, locomotion and environmental interaction to individuals with severe motor impairment. In the present paper, we discuss two approaches to communication using a non-invasive BCI via recording of neurological activity related to motor imagery. The first approach uses modulations of the sensorimotor rhythm related to limb movement imagery to continuously modify the output of an artificial speech synthesizer. The second approach detects event-related changes to neurological activity during single trial motor imagery attempts to control a commercial augmentative and alternative communication device. These two approaches represent two extremes for BCI-based communication ranging from simple, "button-click" operation of a speech generating communication device to continuous modulation of an acoustic output speech synthesizer. The goal of developing along a continuum is to facilitate adoption and use of communication BCIs to a heterogeneous target user population.

J	Kittner, H; Krugel, U; Illes, P				Kittner, H; Krugel, U; Illes, P			The purinergic P2 receptor antagonist pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2 ' 4 '-disulphonic acid prevents both the acute locomotor effects of amphetamine and the behavioural sensitization caused by repeated amphetamine injections in rats	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ATP; locomotion; PPADS; adenosine	ADENOSINE RECEPTORS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; DOPAMINE; RELEASE; BRAIN; ATP; A(1); TRANSMISSION; AGONISTS; STRIATUM	Repeated administration of amphetamine-like psychostimulants produce a progressive and long-lasting hypersensitivity to their behavioural effects known as behavioural sensitization,(10) Previous studies have shown that administration of the purinergic P2 receptor agonist 2-methylthio ATP into the nucleus accumbens of rats raises the extracellular level of dopamine(14) accompanied with enhanced locomotion(12) in a similar manner. Furthermore, the quantitative EEG after application of 2-methylthio ATP or amphetamine was characterized by an elevation of the alpha1-power.(13,20) However, purinergic P2 receptor antagonists decreased the basal level of dopamine in the NAc and in addition prevented the effects of 2-methylthio ATP.(12,14) The purpose of the present study was to investigate, whether endogenous ATP acting via purinergic P2 receptors is involved in the process of amphetamine-induced sensitization. Rats were treated systemically for five successive days with d-amphetamine (1.5 mg/kg) and tested in an open field with respect to their locomotor response. The enhanced locomotor activity after the first injection of amphetamine,vas diminished by the previous intracerebroventricular application of the purinergic P2 receptor antagonist pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2'4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS; 0.6 nmol) (P < 0.05). The challenge with a lower dose of amphetamine (0.75 mg/kg) produced an increased locomotion in comparison to the response after the first amphetamine application indicating the expression of a behavioural sensitization. Pretreatment with PPADS prior to each amphetamine administration prevented the increase of locomotor activity after the challenge with amphetamine (P < 0.05). In summary, the present study demonstrates that PPADS blocks both the acute locomotor effects of amphetamine and the development of behavioural sensitization to the psychostimulant. We suggest that the activation of purinergic P2 receptors by endogenous ATP is necessary for the expression of these effects. (C) 2001 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study we assessed current clinical practices in epilepsy monitoring units (EMUs) in the participating centers. Method: A 60-item web-based survey was distributed to 25 centers (27 EMUs) of the E-PILEPSY network across 22 European countries. The questionnaire was designed to evaluate the characteristics of EMUs, including organizational aspects, admission, and observation of patients, procedures performed, safety issues, cost, and reimbursement. Results: Complete responses were received from all (100%) EMUs surveyed. Continuous observation of patients was performed in 22 (81%) EMUs during regular working hours, and in 17 EMUs (63%) outside of regular working hours. Fifteen (56%) EMUs requested a signed informed consent before admission. All EMUs performed tapering/withdrawal of antiepileptic drugs, 14 (52%) prior to admission to an EMU. Specific protocols on antiepileptic drugs (AED) tapering were available in four (15%) EMUs. Standardized Operating Procedures (SOP) for the treatment of seizure clusters and status epilepticus were available in 16 (59%). Safety measures implemented by EMUs were: alarm seizure buttons in 21 (78%), restricted patient's ambulation in 19 (70%), guard rails in 16 (59%), and specially designated bathrooms in 7 (26%). Average costs for one inpatient day in EMU ranged between 100 and 2200 Euros. Conclusion: This study shows a considerable diversity in the organization and practice patterns across European epilepsy monitoring units. The collected data may contribute to the development and implementation of evidence-based recommended practices in LTM services across Europe. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Methods: In patients implanted with the NeuroPace (R) RNS (R) System, acute changes in iEEG spectral power following active and sham stimulation periods were quantified and compared within individual iEEG channels. Additionally, acute stimulation-induced acute iEEG changes were compared within iEEG channels before and after patients experienced substantial reductions in clinical seizure frequency. Results: Responsive stimulation resulted in a 20.7% relative decrease in spectral power in the 2-4 second window following active stimulation, compared to sham stimulation. On several detection channels, the AERS features changed when clinical outcomes improved but were relatively stable otherwise. AERS change direction associated with clinical improvement was generally consistent within detection channels. Conclusions: In this retrospective analysis, patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy treated with direct brain-responsive neurostimulation showed an acute stimulation related reduction in iEEG spectral power that was associated with reductions in clinical seizure frequency. Significance: Identifying favorable stimulation related changes in iEEG activity could help physicians to more rapidly optimize stimulation settings for each patient.

Methods We reviewed 47 consecutive patients older than 16 years who underwent hemispherectomy between 1996 and 2016 at our center. Clinical, electroencephalographic (EEG), imaging, neuropsychological, surgical, and functional status data were analyzed. Results Thirty-six patients were 18 years or older at surgery; 11 were aged between 16 and 18 years. Brain injury leading to hemispheric epilepsy occurred before 10 years of age in 41 (87%) patients. At a mean follow-up of 5.3 postoperative years (median = 2.9 years), 36 (77%) had Engel class I outcome. Longitudinal outcome analysis showed 84% seizure freedom (Engel IA) at 6 months, 76% at 2 years, and 76% at 5 years and beyond, with stable longitudinal outcomes up to 12 years from surgery. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that acute postoperative seizures and contralateral interictal spikes at 6-month follow-up EEG were associated with seizure recurrence. Patients who could walk unaided preoperatively and had no cerebral peduncle atrophy on brain magnetic resonance imaging were more likely to experience worsening of motor function postoperatively. Otherwise, postoperative ambulatory status and hand function were unchanged. Of the 19 patients who completed neuropsychological testing, 17 demonstrated stable or improved postoperative outcomes. Significance Hemispherectomy in adults is a safe and effective procedure, with seizure freedom rates and functional outcome similar to those observed in children.

These devices are supposed to be worn by people that would otherwise be carrying on a normal life and this factor imposes important constraints in the design. They have to be wireless, wearable, discrete, low maintenance and reliable. In order to reduce power intelligence will be built into the sensors aiming to reduce the data transmission to only that information that it is strictly necessary. This intelligence will be in the form of an algorithm which will be required to be implemented in electronic circuits as part of the system. The complexity of the algorithm affects the complexity of the electronics and hence the power consumption. This, in turn affects the size of the battery and the overall size of the device. For the sensor to be low maintenance the device must operate for extended periods from the battery, adding more constraints to the power consumption of the electronic circuits. The battery must be kept small so that the overall size of the device is small and lightweight enough to be worn on the body and the more discrete the device the higher consumer compliance. A tradeoff has to be met between the algorithm complexity, the power consumption of the electronics required to realize the latter, the power consumption required to transmit data and the battery size and lifetime.

Such impairments can ultimately fail adaptive attempts to regulate emotional processing (also known as cognitive control of emotion), although this hypothesis has not been examined directly. Therefore, we explored the influence of sleep deprivation on the human brain using two different cognitive-emotional tasks, recorded using fMRI and EEG. Both tasks involved irrelevant emotional and neutral distractors presented during a competing cognitive challenge, thus creating a continuous demand for regulating emotional processing. Results reveal that, although participants showed enhanced limbic and electrophysiological reactions to emotional distractors regardless of their sleep state, they were specifically unable to ignore neutral distracting information after sleep deprivation. As a consequence, sleep deprivation resulted in similar processing of neutral and negative distractors, thus disabling accurate emotional discrimination. As expected, these findings were further associated with a decrease in prefrontal connectivity patterns in both EEG and fMRI signals, reflecting a profound decline in cognitive control of emotion. Notably, such a decline was associated with lower REM sleep amounts, supporting a role for REM sleep in overnight emotional processing. Altogether, our findings suggest that losing sleep alters emotional reactivity by lowering the threshold for emotional activation, leading to a maladaptive loss of emotional neutrality.

Cycles of self-reported seizure likelihood correspond to yield of diagnostic epilepsy monitoring	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						diagnosis; electroencephalography; forecast; seizure cycles		Objective Video-electroencephalography (vEEG) is an important component of epilepsy diagnosis and management. Nevertheless, inpatient vEEG monitoring fails to capture seizures in up to one third of patients. We hypothesized that personalized seizure forecasts could be used to optimize the timing of vEEG. Methods We used a database of ambulatory vEEG studies to select a cohort with linked electronic seizure diaries of more than 20 reported seizures over at least 8 weeks. The total cohort included 48 participants. Diary seizure times were used to detect individuals' multiday seizure cycles and estimate times of high seizure risk. We compared whether estimated seizure risk was significantly different between conclusive and inconclusive vEEGs, and between vEEG with and without recorded epileptic activity. vEEGs were conducted prior to self-reported seizures; hence, the study aimed to provide a retrospective proof of concept that cycles of seizure risk were correlated with vEEG outcomes. Results Estimated seizure risk was significantly higher for conclusive vEEGs and vEEGs with epileptic activity. Across all cycle strengths, the average time in high risk during vEEG was 29.1% compared with 14% for the conclusive/inconclusive groups and 32% compared to 18% for the epileptic activity/no epileptic activity groups. On average, 62.5% of the cohort showed increased time in high risk during their previous vEEG when epileptic activity was recorded (compared to 28% of the cohort where epileptic activity was not recorded). For conclusive vEEGs, 50% of the cohort had increased time in high risk, compared to 21.5% for inconclusive vEEGs. Significance Although retrospective, this study provides a proof of principle that scheduling monitoring times based on personalized seizure risk forecasts can improve the yield of vEEG. Forecasts can be developed at low cost from mobile seizure diaries. A simple scheduling tool to improve diagnostic outcomes may reduce cost and risks associated with delayed or missed diagnosis in epilepsy.

For these cases biomarkers of epileptogenesis are critical to facilitate identification of patients at high-risk of developing epilepsy and to introduce effective anti-epileptogenic interventions. Here, we demonstrate that delayed brain-heart coincidences serve as a reliable biomarker. In a murine model of post-infection acquired epilepsy, we used long-term simultaneous measurements of the brain activity via electroencephalography and autonomic cardiac activity via electrocardiography, in male mice, to quantitatively track brain-heart interactions during epileptogenesis. We find that abnormal cortical discharges precede abnormal fluctuations in the cardiac rhythm at the resolution of single beat-to-beat intervals. The delayed brain-heart coincidence is detectable as early as the onset of chronic measurements, 2-14 weeks before the first seizure, only in animals that become epileptic, and increases during epileptogenesis. Therefore, delayed brain-heart coincidence serves as a biomarker of epileptogenesis and could be used for phenotyping, diagnostic, and therapeutic purposes.

Two days later, she experienced respiratory arrest with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3, necessitating endotracheal intubation. Therefore, she was transferred to our hospital with suspected acute encephalopathy. Although no abnormalities were observed on brain and spinal magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography, peripheral nerve conduction velocity tests failed to evoke motor and sensory nerve action potentials. Thus, we gave a diagnosis of fulminant Guillain-Barre syndrome and initiated immunoglobulin therapy. On day 3 of admission, she developed sinus tachycardia that induced circulatory failure and oliguria, which was successfully treated with landiolol. Subsequently, we performed plasmapheresis followed by immunoglobulin and steroid pulse therapies. She was weaned off the mechanical ventilator by day 20 of admission, was ambulatory by day 44, and had completely recovered without any adverse sequelae by day 55. In conclusion, landiolol was effective for treating acute sinus tachycardia-induced circulatory failure and played a key role in saving the life of this patient.

Consistency of Long-Term Subdural Electrocorticography in Humans	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Biomedical engineering; biomedical signal processing; brain-computer interfaces; electroencephalography; neural prosthesis	INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP; PREDICTION; RECORDINGS; EPILEPSY; SIGNALS; ARM	Objective: Subdural electrocorticography (ECoG) can provide a robust control signal for a brain-computer interface (BCI). However, the long-term recording properties of ECoG are poorly understood as most ECoG studies in the BCI field have only used signals recorded for less than 28 days. We assessed human ECoG recordings over durations of many months to investigate changes to recording quality that occur with long-term implantation. Methods: We examined changes in signal properties over time from 15 ambulatory humans who had continuous subdural ECoG monitoring for 184-766 days. Results: Individual electrodes demonstrated varying changes in frequency power characteristics over time within individual patients and between patients. Group level analyses demonstrated that there were only small changes in effective signal bandwidth and spectral band power across months. High-gamma signals could be recorded throughout the study, though there was a decline in signal power for some electrodes. Conclusion: ECoG-based BCI systems can robustly record high-frequency activity over multiple years, albeit with marked intersubject variability. Significance: Group level results demonstrated that ECoG is a promising modality for long-term BCI and neural prosthesis applications.

Numerous hardware systems have been presented since, which allow for continuous acquisition of various biosignals like the ECG, PPG, EMG or EEG and which are suited for ambulatory settings. Unfortunately, these flexible systems are liable to motion artifacts and especially photoplethysmographic signals are seriously distorted when the patient is not at rest. A lot of work has been done to reduce artifacts and noise, ranging from simple filtering methods to very complex statistical approaches. With regard to the PPG, certain quality indices have been proposed to evaluate the signal conditions. As movements are the primary source of signal disturbances, the relation between the output of a signal quality estimator and acceleration data captured directly on the PPG sensor is focused in this work. It will be shown that typical motions can be detected on-line, thereby providing additional information which will significantly improve signal quality assessments.

Although significant research exists for an all-encompassing BCI performance rating, almost all the literature addresses performance in terms of classification accuracy. For the few published experiments that address BCI hardware performance, they too, focused exclusively on improving classification accuracy. This paper explores some of the more recent studies and proposes a trusted performance rating for BCI applications based on the enhanced privacy, yet reduced bandwidth needs of mobile EEG -based BCI applications. In this paper we introduce a new security enforcement rating. We propose a set of Bluetooth operating parameters required to meet the performance, usability and security requirements of reliable and secure mobile neurofeedback applications.

Initial 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), 24-hr ambulatory ECG, transthoracic echocardiogram and electroencephalogram (EEG) were normal. A repeat episode of syncope warranted further investigation. Immediate post syncope ECG showed deeply inverted symmetrical T waves in the anterior leads. He underwent coronary angiogram which revealed distal left main disease and 70-80% stenosis of the proximal Left Anterior Descending Artery (LAD). The Circumflex artery was non dominant with normal Right Coronary artery. He subsequently had Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) of the LAD. Post-revascularisation course has been satisfactory with no recurrence of syncope. In view of the rising trend of cardiac death in the country, there is the need for high index of suspicion in making diagnosis of coronary artery disease in patients with syncope.

There is a need for automated seizure characterization, to identify high-risk seizures. Wearable devices can automatically identify seizure types with the highest associated morbidity and mortality (generalized tonic-clonic seizures), quantify their duration and frequency, and provide data on postictal position and immobility, autonomic changes derived from electrocardiography/heart rate variability, electrodermal activity, respiration, and oxygen saturation. In this review, we summarize how these biosignals reflect seizure severity, and how they can be monitored in the ambulatory outpatient setting using wearable devices. Multimodal recording of these biosignals will provide valuable information for individual risk assessment, as well as insights into the mechanisms and prevention of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.

While the feasibility of a closed-loop BCI system for the control of a lower body exoskeleton has been recently shown, multi-day closed-loop neural decoding of human gait in a virtual reality (BCI-VR) environment has yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we propose a real-time closed-loop BCI that decodes lower limb joint angles from scalp electroencephalography (EEC) during treadmill walking to control the walking movements of a virtual avatar. Moreover, virtual kinematic perturbations resulting in asymmetric walking gait patterns of the avatar were also introduced to investigate gait adaptation using the closed-loop BCI-VR system over a period of eight days. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using a closed-loop BCI to learn to control a walking avatar under normal and altered visuomotor perturbations, which involved cortical adaptations. These findings have implications for the development of BCI-VR systems for gait rehabilitation after stroke and for understanding cortical plasticity induced by a closed-loop BCI system.

Spatiotemporal Patterns of High-Frequency Activity (80-170 Hz) in Long-Term Intracranial EEG	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							OSCILLATIONS; RISK; RESECTION; SEIZURES	Objective To determine the utility of high-frequency activity (HFA) and epileptiform spikes as bio-markers for epilepsy, we examined the variability in their rates and locations using long-term ambulatory intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. Methods This study used continuous iEEG recordings obtained over an average of 1.4 years from 15 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. HFA was defined as 80- to 170-Hz events with amplitudes clearly larger than the background, which was automatically detected with a custom algorithm. The automatically detected HFA was compared with visually annotated high-frequency oscillations (HFOs). The variations of HFA rates were compared with spikes and seizures on patient-specific and electrode-specific bases. Results HFA included manually annotated HFOs and high-amplitude events occurring in the 80- to 170-Hz range without observable oscillatory behavior. HFA and spike rates had high amounts of intrapatient and interpatient variability. Rates of HFA and spikes had large variability after electrode implantation in most of the patients. Locations of HFA and spikes varied up to weeks in more than one-third of the patients. Both HFA and spike rates showed strong circadian rhythms in all patients, and some also showed multiday cycles. Furthermore, the circadian patterns of HFA and spike rates had patient-specific correlations with seizures, which tended to vary across electrodes. Conclusion Analysis of HFA and epileptiform spikes should consider postimplantation variability. HFA and epileptiform spikes, like seizures, show circadian rhythms. However, the circadian profiles can vary spatially within patients, and their correlations to seizures are patient-specific.

In this paper the SPIHT algorithm is applied for the compression of EEG data in single channel and multiple channels. For single channel data, the SPIHT algorithm in one dimension is used with compression ratio ranging from 1.17 to 4.55 for 2 order scale wavelet transform, 1.5 to 8.87 for 3 order scale wavelet transform, and 1.66 to 15.9 for 4 order scale wavelet transform, respectively. For multiple channels data, the two dimensional SPIHT algorithm is used with the compression ratio ranging from 2.72 to 13.08 for 1 order scale wavelet transform, 2.76 to 12.59 for 2 order scale wavelet transform and 2.80 to 12.37 for 3 order scale wavelet transform, respectively. Experimental data is from the people's hospital of Beijing university of normal people brain electrical data, the experiment results of compression binary codes flow and compression CR and PRD parameters are achieved in different wavelet scales, and the experiment results are analyzed and compared. It shows that experiment results of specific compression ratio can be achieved by using the SPIHT Algorithm, at the same time, the scale of Wavelet transform before compression transform affects subsequent algorithm compression, under the experiment data, the bigger scale of Wavelet is transformed, the better result of compression is got. As the same time using the SPIHT algorithm in two dimensions, the result is better than using the SPIHT algorithm in one dimension.

To clarify the effects of cutaneous warming on human sleep, eight male subjects with mild sleep difficulties were asked to try three experimental conditions at home, each lasting for 5 days, in a cross-over manner: warming of the periocular skin with a warming device for 10 min before habitual bedtime, warming of the posterior cervical skin with a warming device for 30 min before habitual bedtime, and no treatment as a control. The warming device had a heat-and steam-generating sheet that allowed warming of the skin to 40 degrees C through a chemical reaction with iron. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded during nocturnal sleep using an ambulatory EEG device and subjected to spectral analysis. All the participants reported their sleep status using a visual analog scale. We found that warming of the periocular or posterior cervical skin significantly improved subjective sleep status relative to the control. The EEG delta power density in the first 90 min of the sleep episode was significantly increased under both warming of the periocular or posterior cervical skin relative to the control. These results suggest that warming of appropriate skin regions may have favorable effects on subjective and objective sleep quality.

Functional Hemispherectomy in Adults: All We Have to Sphere Is Sphere Itself	EPILEPSY CURRENTS			English	Editorial Material							EPILEPSY	Hemispherectomy in Adults and Adolescents: Seizure and Functional Outcomes in 47 Patients McGovern RA, NV Moosa A, Jehi L, Busch R, Ferguson L, Gupta A, et al. Epilepsia. 2019;60(12):2416-2427. . Objective: To examine longitudinal seizure and functional outcomes after hemispherectomy in adults and adolescents. Methods: We reviewed 47 consecutive patients older than 16 years who underwent hemispherectomy between 1996 and 2016 at our center. Clinical, electroencephalographic (EEG), imaging, neuropsychological, surgical, and functional status data were analyzed. Results: Thirty-six patients were 18 years or older at surgery; 11 were aged between 16 and 18 years. Brain injury leading to hemispheric epilepsy occurred before 10 years of age in 41 (87%) patients. At a mean follow-up of 5.3 postoperative years (median = 2.9 years), 36 (77%) had Engel class I outcome. Longitudinal outcome analysis showed 84% seizure freedom (Engel IA) at 6 months, 76% at 2 years, and 76% at 5 years and beyond, with stable longitudinal outcomes up to 12 years from surgery. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that acute postoperative seizures and contralateral interictal spikes at 6-month follow-up EEG were associated with seizure recurrence. Patients who could walk unaided preoperatively and had no cerebral peduncle atrophy on brain magnetic resonance imaging were more likely to experience worsening of motor function postoperatively. Otherwise, postoperative ambulatory status and hand function were unchanged. Of the 19 patients who completed neuropsychological testing, 17 demonstrated stable or improved postoperative outcomes. Significance: Hemispherectomy in adults is a safe and effective procedure, with seizure freedom rates and functional outcome similar to those observed in children.											8	1	1	1	1	SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC	THOUSAND OAKS	2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA	1535-7597	1535-7511		EPILEPSY CURR	Epilepsy Curr.

A NOVEL TELEMETRIC SYSTEM FOR RECORDING BRAIN ACTIVITY IN SMALL ANIMALS	TELEMETRY: RESEARCH, TECHNOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Book Chapter							SLEEP	Wireless technology recording systems are as comfortable as possible to the awake experimental animal and are in many aspects advantageous and more valuable when compared to conventional recording devices. We describe here the different steps taken in the realization of a telemetric system to record an electroencephalogram (EEG) from adult freely-moving rats. Our system consists of an implantable transmitter that communicates bidirectionally with a receiver via radio transmission over a distance of up to three meters. The impact of the system on the animal movements was tested and has shown that the device did not restrict limb movements during locomotion. The sleeping posture was also maintained, proving the lack of discomfort produced by our system. The current system is optimized for recording electrical activity from the animal's brain, but can be easily modified to record other physiological parameters. Using our expertise, we also discussed here the points that have to be clarified before starting the production of such a system. Building a wireless device requires the consideration of a number of options concerning the experimental design and the recording environment to integrate the right parameters.

Patients and methods. -We prospectively screened all patients referred to the specialist sleep disorders clinic in Nancy University Hospital between May 2011 and August 2011. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they required polysomnography for the diagnosis of a sleep-related neurological disorder. One-night, polysomnography was performed in each patient's home by a trained steep technician. Financial cost was determined prior to inclusion. A recording was considered as satisfactory if all the following criteria were present: at least, one EEG channel with continuous signal allowing determination of sleep stages and wake during more than 66% of sleep time; at least, one usable respiratory channel (airflow or either band) during more than 66% of sleep time; and usable oximetry during more than 66% of sleep time. Results. -Forty-eight of the 139 screened patients were included. Among the 48 home polysomnography recordings, 35 (72.9%) were satisfactory. Thirteen (27.1%) tracings displayed an unsatisfactory loss of EEG data, including seven (14.6%) tracings with an unsatisfactory loss of respiratory data. Conclusion. -Home polysomnography prescribed for suspected sleep-related neurological disorders is feasible, with affordable costs, whilst maintaining high quality recording. Further studies are needed to measure the real medico-economic impact of promoting outpatient domiciliary explorations for sleep-related neurological disorders. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Similarly, the EEG recordings from rats with portacaval anastomosis (PCA), an animal model of BE, reveal less signs of drowsiness and sleepiness during the light hours, when the rats normally sleep. These rats also have flattened amplitudes of their circadian rhythms of locomotion and feeding. We have previously shown that increased brain histaminergic activity in rats with long-term PCA may have contributed to the development of these circadian changes. One potential mechanism could be a disturbance of melatonin balance. The 24 hour secretion of melatonin in the urine was highly significantly increased in rats with PCA. They also had higher daytime serum concentrations of melatonin, while the contents of melatonin and histamine in the pineal gland did not differ significantly between sham and PCA operated rats. Whether the elevation is transmitted by histaminergic system remains to be confirmed but it remains an attractive possibility.

Rapid Sensitization of Physiological, Neuronal, and Locomotor Effects of Nicotine: Critical Role of Peripheral Drug Actions	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SENSORY NERVE-ENDINGS; TEMPERATURE HOMEOSTASIS; INTRAVENOUS COCAINE; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; BODY-TEMPERATURE; DOPAMINE; BRAIN; HEXAMETHONIUM; SMOKING; ACTIVATION	Repeated exposure to nicotine and other psychostimulant drugs produces persistent increases in their psychomotor and physiological effects (sensitization), a phenomenon related to the drugs' reinforcing properties and abuse potential. Here we examined the role of peripheral actions of nicotine in nicotine-induced sensitization of centrally mediated physiological parameters (brain, muscle, and skin temperatures), cortical and VTA EEG, neck EMG activity, and locomotion in freely moving rats. Repeated injections of intravenous nicotine (30 mu g/kg) induced sensitization of the drug's effects on all these measures. In contrast, repeated injections of the peripherally acting analog of nicotine, nicotine pyrrolidine methiodide (nicotine(PM), 30 mu g/kg, i.v.) resulted in habituation (tolerance) of the same physiological, neuronal, and behavioral measures. However, after repeated nicotine exposure, acute nicotine(PM) injections induced nicotine-like physiological responses: powerful cortical and VTA EEG desynchronization, EMG activation, a large brain temperature increase, but weaker hyperlocomotion. Additionally, both the acute locomotor response to nicotine and nicotine-induced locomotor sensitization were attenuated by blockade of peripheral nicotinic receptors by hexamethonium (3 mg/kg, i.v.). These data suggest that the peripheral actions of nicotine, which precede its direct central actions, serve as a conditioned interoceptive cue capable of eliciting nicotine-like physiological and neural responses after repeated nicotine exposure. Thus, by providing a neural signal to the CNS that is repeatedly paired with the direct central effects of nicotine, the drug's peripheral actions play a critical role in the development of nicotine-induced physiological, neural, and behavioral sensitization.

Although people with disabled lower limb can restore their movements through assistive devices like wheelchair, such manner is not as natural as that healthy people perform locomotion. It would be better to regain movements by restoring the function of lower limb itself. Hence, an orthosis that can be worn on the disable lower limb might be a good choice. In addition, it is of interest to explore brain activities during walking with and without an orthosis. In this paper, we introduced a robotic knee exoskeleton that can provide assistive torque to facilitate walking. Three different conditions were employed here, namely free walking (FW, without exoskeleton), zero force (ZF, with the exoskeleton but no torque was provided), and assistive force (AF, torque was provided by the exoskeleton). During the walking, electrophysiological signals were simultaneously recorded. Partial directed coherence (PDC) was employed to measure connectivity strengths between channels and the obtained effective connectivity network was quantitatively assessed through a standard graph theoretical analysis framework. We found that the clustering coefficient was significantly increased when assistive torque was provided by the exoskeleton compared with FW and ZF. A decrease in path length was also found when assistive torque was provided. Our findings demonstrated that topological patterns of brain activities were distinctly different when people received assistive torque during walking. This study could be of meaningful significance on further orthosis development from the perspective of brain electrophysiological activity and insight into the understanding for brain plasticity and neural rehabilitation.

Intrinsic activity temporal structure reactivity to behavioural state change is correlated with depressive symptoms	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						criticality; long-range temporal correlations; negative thought; self-focus	NEURONAL AVALANCHES; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; EEG DIFFERENCES; RUMINATION; DYNAMICS; INFLEXIBILITY; CRITICALITY; LOCOMOTION	The brain's intrinsic activity plays a fundamental role in its function. In normal conditions this activity is responsive to behavioural context, changing as an individual switches between directed tasks and task-free conditions. A key feature of such changes is the movement of the brain between corresponding critical and sub-critical states, with these dynamics supporting efficient cognitive processing. Breakdowns in processing efficiency can occur, however, in brain disorders such as depression. It was therefore hypothesised that depressive symptoms would be related to reduced intrinsic activity responsiveness to changes in behavioural state. This was tested in a mixed group of major depressive disorder patients (n = 26) and healthy participants (n = 37) by measuring intrinsic EEG activity temporal structure, quantified with detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), in eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open task-free states and contrasting between the conditions. The degree to which DFA values changed between the states was found to correlate negatively with depressive symptoms. DFA values did not differ between states in those with higher symptom levels, meaning that the brain remained in a less flexible sub-critical condition. This sub-critical condition in the EC state was further found to correlate with levels of maladaptive rumination. This may reflect a general cognitive inflexibility resulting from a lack in neural activity reactivity that may predispose people to overly engage in self-directed attention. These results provide an initial link between intrinsic activity reactivity and psychological features found in psychiatric disorders.

Administration of Micronized Caffeine Using a Novel Oral Delivery Film Results in Rapid Absorption and Electroencephalogram Suppression	FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						transmucosal; buccal; bioavability; therapeutic delivery; caffeine (1, 3, 7-trimethyl-1h-purine-2)	A(2A) RECEPTORS; SLEEP	Route of administration is well-known to impact factors ranging from absorption and distribution, up through the subjective effects of active ingredients. Different routes of administration confer specific advantages, such as more rapid absorption resulting from intravenous injection, or increased convenience with oral administration, but a combination of both rapid and convenient delivery is highly desirable. QuickStrip (TM) was designed as a rapidly dissolving thin film matrix that contains active ingredients, which may be promising for rapid and convenient delivery via the oral mucosa. To assess the delivery of QuickStrip (TM), we administered the well-characterized active ingredient caffeine to mice and compared QuickStrip (TM) to standard oral gavage delivery at an equivalent dose of 20 mg kg(-1). Using HPLC assessment of serum concentrations of caffeine, we found that QuickStrip (TM) delivery resulted in higher serum levels of caffeine at 1, 10, and 30 min following administration compared to gavage. QuickStrip (TM) also produced greater bioavailability compared to gavage, as demonstrated by area under the curve analysis. Caffeine delivered by QuickStrip (TM) produced robust behavioral activation of locomotion, consistent with gavage caffeine. Electroencephalographic (EEG) assessment of central nervous system effects demonstrated that both gavage and QuickStrip (TM) caffeine produced suppression of delta and theta, consistent with prior literature on the effects of caffeine. In addition, QuickStrip (TM) produced a more rapid onset of EEG suppression, supporting the more rapid absorption demonstrated in the serum studies. Collectively, these studies suggest that QuickStrip (TM) may provide a balance between convenience and rapid onset, offering new options for delivery of therapeutics.

Recent findings suggest that the outcomes of GABA(B) activation in vivo are contingent on the chemical characteristics of the agonist. In particular, the endogenous ligand hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and its precursor gamma-butyro-lactone (GBL) have been shown to elicit different effects than the prototypical GABA(B) agonist baclofen. In view of these premises, the present study was aimed at the characterization of the effects of baclofen (0.5-10 mg/kg, i.p.) and GBL (5-100 mg/kg, i.p.) on the spontaneous SWDs and locomotor activity of DBA/2J mice. While both baclofen and GBL dose-dependently increased SWDs episodes, high doses of the latter (100 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced the occurrence of these phenomena and increased the number of isolated spikes. Interestingly, both compounds elicited a dose-dependent reduction of locomotor activity, in comparison with their vehicle-treated controls. The GABA(B) selective antagonist, SCHS0911 (50 mg/kg, i.p.), reversed the changes in SWD occurrence and locomotion induced by baclofen and GBL, but failed to elicit intrinsic effects on either paradigm. These results indicate that GABA(B) receptor signaling might exert differential effects on SWDs in DBA/2J mice. (C) 2010 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Development of motion speed perception from infancy to early adulthood: a high-density EEG study of simulated forward motion through optic flow	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Motion speed perception; Optic flow; High-density EEG; Visual evoked potential (VEP); Temporal spectral evolution (TSE); Lifespan visual motion perception	FUNCTIONAL BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; RANDOM VISUAL-MOTION; CORTICAL RESPONSES; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE; SYNCHRONIZATION ERS; FULL-TERM; SPECIALIZATION; SENSITIVITY; DESYNCHRONIZATION; MOVEMENTS	This study investigated evoked and oscillatory brain activity in response to forward visual motion at three different ecologically valid speeds, simulated through an optic flow pattern consisting of a virtual road with moving poles at either side of it. Participants were prelocomotor infants at 4-5 months, crawling infants at 9-11 months, primary school children at 6 years, adolescents at 12 years, and young adults. N2 latencies for motion decreased significantly with age from around 400 ms in prelocomotor infants to 325 ms in crawling infants, and from 300 and 275 ms in 6- and 12-year-olds, respectively, to 250 ms in adults. Infants at 4-5 months displayed the longest latencies and appeared unable to differentiate between motion speeds. In contrast, crawling infants at 9-11 months and 6-year-old children differentiated between low, medium and high speeds, with shortest latency for low speed. Adolescents and adults displayed similar short latencies for the three motion speeds, indicating that they perceived them as equally easy to detect. Time-frequency analyses indicated that with increasing age, participants showed a progression from low- to high-frequency desynchronized oscillatory brain activity in response to visual motion. The developmental differences in motion speed perception are interpreted in terms of a combination of neurobiological development and increased experience with self-produced locomotion. Our findings suggest that motion speed perception is not fully developed until adolescence, which has implications for children's road traffic safety.

These signals are necessary for bipedal locomotion, navigation, the coordination of eye and head movements in 3D space. The temporal dynamics of vestibular processing in cortical structures have hardly been studied in humans, let alone with natural stimulation. The aim was to investigate the cortical vestibular network related to natural otolith stimulation using a hexapod motion platform. We conducted two experiments, 1. to estimate the sources of the vestibular evoked potentials (VestEPs) by means of distributed source localization (n=49), and 2. to reveal modulations of the VestEPs through the underlying acceleration intensity (n=24). For both experiments subjects were accelerated along the main axis (left/right, up/down, fore/aft) while the EEG was recorded. We were able to identify five VestEPs (P1, N1, P2, N2, P3) with latencies between 38 and 461 ms as well as an evoked beta-band response peaking with a latency of 68 ms in all subjects and for all acceleration directions. Source localization gave the cingulate sulcus visual (CSv) area and the opercular-insular region as the main origin of the evoked potentials. No lateralization effects due to handedness could be observed. In the second experiment, area CSv was shown to be integral in the processing of acceleration intensities as sensed by the otolith organs, hinting at its potential role in ego-motion detection. These robust VestEPs could be used to investigate the mechanisms of inter-regional interaction in the natural context of vestibular processing and multisensory integration.

While intravenous (IV) medications are used inpatient for treatment of critical illness-related NCSE, there is no consensus on treatment of ambulatory NCSE. Up to 50% of patients with Angelman syndrome (AS) have NCSE with myoclonic or atypical absence status. Here we report our experience in pediatric patients with AS and NCSE treated outpatient with a tapering course of oral diazepam. We conducted a chart review of 104 patients seen in the Angelman Syndrome Clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital from January 2008 to March 2017, who met the criteria. Response to treatment was defined as cessation of NCSE symptoms with electroencephalogram (EEG) confirmation when possible. Twenty-one patients with NCSE were identified, and 13 patients (9 male) with 25 episodes of NCSE were included. Mean age at NCSE episode was 5 years 4 months (15 months-12 years). Six patients had one episode of NCSE, and 7 patients had recurrent episodes (mean: 2.7; range: 2-4). Median diazepam treatment was 6 days (4-12 days), with a mean dose of 0.32 mg/kg/day divided over 2-3 administrations, decreased every 2 days. Nine episodes required multiple courses; however, oral diazepam alone was ultimately successful in 80% (20/25) of NCSE episodes. Oral diazepam was well-tolerated with no major side effects. A short course of oral diazepam is well-tolerated and effective in patients with AS who have ambulatory NCSE. It may be considered prior to escalating to inpatient care in AS and possibly other epilepsy syndromes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Recently, memory consolidation has been causally facilitated in human participants via auditory stimuli phase-locked to SWS slow waves. Aims: Here, we aimed to develop a new acoustic stimulus protocol to facilitate learning and to validate it using different memory tasks. Most importantly, the stimulation setup was automated to be applicable for ambulatory home use. Methods: Fifteen healthy participants slept 3 nights in the laboratory. Learning was tested with 4 memory tasks (word pairs, serial finger tapping, picture recognition, and face-name association). Additional questionnaires addressed subjective sleep quality and overnight changes in mood. During the stimulus night, auditory stimuli were adjusted and targeted by an unsupervised algorithm to be phase-locked to the negative peak of slow waves in SWS. During the control night no sounds were presented. Results: Results showed that the sound stimulation increased both slow wave (p =.002) and sleep spindle activity (p <.001). When overnight improvement of memory performance was compared between stimulus and control nights, we found a significant effect in word pair task but not in other memory tasks. The stimulation did not affect sleep structure or subjective sleep quality. Conclusions: We showed that the memory effect of the SWS-targeted individually triggered single-sound stimulation is specific to verbal associative memory. Moreover, the ambulatory and automated sound stimulus setup was promising and allows for a broad range of potential follow-up studies in the future.

Laboratory investigations, brain imaging, and electroencephalography were performed. Twelve patients were diagnosed with subjective memory complaints (SMC), 32 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 43 with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), and 14 with vascular dementia (VAD). Thirty-three percent of the SMC group, 31% of the MCI group, 45% of the DAT group, and 62% of the VAD group had increased serum homocysteine (s-HCY). Principal component analysis of 19 variables showed 3 significant principal components by cross-validation. The cognitive impairment in the patients (MMSE) was explained to 50%. According to the principal component analysis, the population followed two different routes to cognitive impairment: one correlated with disturbance of one-carbon metabolism (cerebrospinal fluid vitamin B-12, plasma B-12, plasma folate, and s-HCY) and the other correlated with more classic dementia, as marked by cerebrospinal fluid tau, vascular risk factors, atrophy on brain imaging, possession of the apolipoprotein E4 allele, and age. There was poor discrimination between DAT and VAD.

Scheduled, non-emergent admissions to the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) have not yet been utilized to improve transition education. Methods: The overarching goal of this evidence-based practice project was to explore opportunities to enhance the transition education patients and families receive in the clinic setting by leveraging scheduled inpatient admissions for EEG monitoring to provide structured transition education. Twenty-one Neurology Clinic providers were surveyed about their perspectives on the transition process. Thirty-five adolescent patients (12-20 years old) received a pre-test regarding their condition, health maintenance and disease management, and a subsequent post-test measuring knowledge retention after education with a provider. Documentation in the electronic health record (EHR) using an institution created transition flowsheet and a standardized template was used to communicate through the EHR with the primary neurology team. Findings: The effectiveness of the intervention was supported as 100% of patients demonstrated increased knowledge after transition education. Providers' knowledge and support of transition efforts increased regarding tools and guidelines for transition of adolescents to adult care. Discussion: These results support the feasibility of providing transition education in the EMU with shared responsibility between inpatient and ambulatory providers. Implications for practice: Improved use of the transition flowsheet in the EMU and by ambulatory setting providers will enhance the process of transition. Discussion of self-management with adolescent patients during all phases of health care will encourage independence and promote successful transition to adult health care. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: The signal quality and outcomes of a Level 2 (home) polysomnography in young people undergoing investigation between September 2020 and January 2021 in a single centre was reviewed. A successful home polysomnogram was defined as a study with >6 h of sleep and all channels (EEG, thoraco-abdominal bands, calculated airflow, and pulse oximetry) present for at least 90% of the study time. Feedback from the guardian and young person was collected following the study using a questionnaire. Results: Fifty-five patients, aged 4 months to 18 years, were included. A successful polysomnogram, on the first attempt, was achieved for 48/55 (87%) subjects. There were no differences in success when accounting for neurodevelopmental conditions, OSA severity or age. The majority (76%) of guardians felt that their child slept the same or better than normal and only 12% found having the study conducted at home difficult. Following the study, only 8% would have preferred a hospital sleep study in retrospect. Conclusions: Home polysomnography produced a technically adequate study for the majority of subjects. Most families also found the experience of having a home sleep study to be positive. These data support the use of home sleep studies as an alternative to an in-patient sleep study, in appropriate circumstances, for young people undergoing investigation of a sleep disorder.

Day-Night Patterns of Epileptiform Activity in 65 Patients With Long-Term Ambulatory Electrocorticography	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Partial onset seizures; Long-term human EEG; Electrocorticography; Epileptiform activity; Circadian patterns; Closed-loop responsive electrical neurostimulation	RESPONSIVE CORTICAL STIMULATION; SEIZURES; EPILEPSY; SLEEP	Purpose:To characterize cyclic day-night patterns of electrocorticographic epileptiform activity (EA) in patients with focal onset seizures.Methods:Epileptiform events as defined by the physician (also termed more generally as epileptiform activity or EA) were recorded in 65 patients with partial onset (also referred to as focal onset) seizures using the RNS System, which includes a cranially implanted neurostimulator connected to 1 or two 4-contact leads placed at the seizure focus. The neurostimulator is programmed to detect specific patterns of electrocorticographic activity and to provide responsive stimulation. The 24-hour periodicity of detections of EA was analyzed for individual patients and for subgroups of patients according to the type of EA, laterality, lobe of onset, and whether the onset was neocortical or hippocampal. The time of day when peaks in EA occurred was also analyzed.Results:There were robust circadian patterns of detections of EA in most patients, with a primary peak in detections at night and a secondary peak in the late afternoon in some cases. Subset analyses were performed by lobe, region of the brain, and type of cortex (neocortical vs. hippocampal); significant circadian rhythmicity was present in all subsets.Conclusions:This is the first report of circadian cycles of EA as assessed through chronic ambulatory electrocorticographic recordings in adults with focal onset seizures. Epileptiform activity displayed circadian patterns in the majority of these patients. These findings suggest that epilepsy therapies might be optimized by adjusting the timing of therapy according to each patient's unique circadian pattern of EA.

However, no generic solution is currently available to reach these objectives. A number of biosignals are sensitive to specific forms of focal seizures, in particular heart rate and its variability for seizures affecting the neurovegetative system, and accelerometry for those responsible for prominent motor activity. However, most studies demonstrate high rates of false detection or poor sensitivity, with only a minority of patients benefiting from acceptable levels of accuracy. To tackle this challenging issue, several lines of technological progress are envisioned, including multimodal biosensing with cross-modal analytics, a combination of embedded and distributed self-aware machine learning, and ultra-low-power design to enable appropriate autonomy of such sophisticated portable solutions.

The aim of this study was to examine whether suppressing interietal discharges can affect behavior in children with epilepsy. Study design In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 61 children with well-controlled or mild epilepsy were randomly assigned to add-on therapy with either lamotrigine followed by placebo or placebo followed by lamotrigine. Ambulatory electroencephalographic recordings and behavioral scales were performed during baseline and at the end of placebo and drug phases. The primary hypothesis to be tested was that behavioral scales would improve specifically in patients with a reduction of electroencephalographic discharges during active drug treatment. Results Global rating of behavior significantly improved only in patients who showed a significant reduction in either frequency (P < .05) or duration of discharges (P < .05) during active treatment but not in patients with without a significant change in discharge rate. This improvement was mainly seen in patients with partial epilepsy (P < .005).

During ambulatory polysomnography (PSG), the patient presented an episode characterized by loss of consciousness and jerking of the four limbs. A video-PSG monitoring was performed and the patient showed unresponsiveness and drowsiness at 7 a.m. During the episode, EEG showed theta-delta diffuse activity, and blood glucose level was 32 mg dl(-1). The diagnosis of insulinoma was then assumed; CT scan showed a hypodense mass into the pancreatic tail, and a partial pancreasectomy was performed. The described symptoms disappeared, and 5 years later the findings of a complete clinical and neurophysiological examination were negative. The clinical picture of insulinoma presenting with paroxysmal disorders has been previously described; however, whereas hypersomnia is uncommon, in the current case it represents the main symptom. Clinicians should keep in mind that neuroglycopenia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with hypersomnia, particularly if the clinical scenario does not conform to standard criteria.

Sleep and autonomic nervous system changes - enhanced cardiac sympathetic modulations during sleep in permanent night shift nurses	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF WORK ENVIRONMENT & HEALTH			English	Article						electroencephalographic delta-power; heart rate variability; nighttime sleep; daytime sleep; shift work	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; SLOW-WAVE MAGNITUDE; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; POWER-DENSITY; ARTERIAL-PRESSURE; WAKING; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; HYPERTENSION; INSOMNIA; DISEASE	Objectives Disturbed sleep is the most common problem among the many health-related effects of shift work, with shift workers clearly having higher rates of cardiac disorders. However, the possible mechanism underlying the related health effects of shift work has yet to be examined. Consequently, this study aimed to explore the influence of long-term night shift work on the sleep patterns of nurses and their cardiac autonomic nervous system during sleep. Methods Our sample comprised ten permanent night shift and ten regular morning shift nurses. Nurses slept in their dormitory where they were allowed to sleep and wake spontaneously. All sleep parameters were digitized using an ambulatory polysomnographic recorder. Using sleep patterns and heart rate variability, the day- and nighttime sleep of permanent night shift nurses were compared with the nighttime sleep of regular morning shift nurses. Results Compared with the nighttime sleep of regular morning shift nurses, the pattern of daytime sleep of permanent night shift nurses showed significantly lower sleep onset latency. Permanent night shift nurses' daytime sleep also had greater proportions of Stage 3 and 4 (deep sleep), and arousal index than recorded during their nighttime sleep. Both the low frequency and low to high frequency ratio of the nighttime sleep of night shift nurses were significantly higher during periods of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep than the nighttime sleep of morning shift workers. In addition, the electroencephalography delta-power of the nighttime sleep of night shift nurses was significantly lower during the first NREM episode sleep than those of both the daytime sleep of night shift workers and the nighttime sleep of morning shift nurses. Conclusions Permanent night shift nurses have higher sympathetic activity during nighttime sleep than regular morning shift nurses. Night shift working may have effects on the sleeping patterns of nurses in the long run, inducing higher cardiac sympathetic regulation.	[Kuo, Terry B. J.; Yang, Cheryl C.

Interpersonal Problems and Negative Affect in Borderline Personality and Depressive Disorders in Daily Life	CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Borderline Personality Disorder; depression; interpersonal problems; negative affect; ambulatory assessment	ECOLOGICAL MOMENTARY ASSESSMENT; AFFECTIVE INSTABILITY; REJECTION SENSITIVITY; EMOTION RECOGNITION; CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS; SOCIAL REJECTION; EEG ASYMMETRY; CONFLICT; ANGER; IMPULSIVITY	Theories of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) suggest that interpersonal problems in BPD act as triggers for negative affect and, at the same time, are a possible result of affective dysregulation. Therefore, we assessed the relations between momentary negative affect (hostility, sadness, fear) and interpersonal problems (rejection, disagreement) in a sample of 80 BPD and 51 depressed outpatients at six time points over 28 days. Data were analyzed using multivariate multilevel modeling to separate momentary-, day-, and person-level effects. Results revealed a mutually reinforcing relationship between disagreement and hostility, rejection and hostility, and rejection and sadness in both groups at the momentary and day level. The mutual reinforcement between hostility and rejection/disagreement was significantly stronger in the BPD group. Moreover, the link between rejection and sadness was present at all three levels of analysis for the BPD group, whereas it was localized to the momentary level in the depressed group.

This study assesses the efficacy of nefazodone treatment (target dose of 400-600 mg/day) on objective and subjective sleep quality in Vietnam combat veterans with chronic DSM-IV posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Method. Medically healthy male Vietnam theater combat veterans with DSM-IV PTSD (N = 10) completed a 12-week open-label trial. Two nights of ambulatory polysomnography were obtained at baseline, and at the end of the trial. PTSD and depressive symptoms and subjective sleep quality were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks. Data were collected in 1999 and 2000. Results: Nefazodone treatment led to a significant decrease in PTSD and depressive symptoms (p < .05), an improvement in global subjective sleep quality, and a reduction in nightmares. Nefazodone also resulted in a substantial improvement in objective measures of sleep quality, particularly increased total sleep time, sleep maintenance, and delta sleep as measured by period amplitude analysis. Conclusion: Nefazodone therapy results in an improvement of both subjective and objective sleep quality in subjects with combat-related PTSD.

Furthermore, the local NREM quality reflects age-dependent brain maturation and individual, ageindependent, and psychomotor potential. Cortical maturation and its electrophysiological marker, Slow-wave activity (SWA), as well as sleep spindles are known to change in topography and quality during the early years of life, but their associations with psychomotor development in infants are unknown. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the local properties of SWA and spindles (sigma power) and ascertain whether they correlate with psychomotor development in 8-month-old infants. Methods: Ambulatory polysomnographies were recorded in 56 infants at 8 months of age to calculate the local SWA and sigma powers. The associations between the SWA and sigma powers and psychomotor development (Bayley-III) were examined in 36 of these infants. Results: In both hemispheres, the highest SWA and sigma powers were found occipitally and centrally, respectively, with higher powers in the right hemisphere than in the left. The Bayley-III correlated with local SWA and sigma powers: the occipital SWA and centro-occipital sigma correlated with cognitive scales, and the frontal and occipital SWA and centro-occipital sigma correlated with language and fine motor scales. Most of the correlations were unilateral. Conclusions: In 8-month-old infants, the NREM sleep quality shows local differences that are mostly attributable to the topical phase of brain maturation. The local NREM parameters correlate with psychomotor development.

J	Gennaro, F; de Bruin, ED				Gennaro, Federico; de Bruin, Eling D.			A pilot study assessing reliability and age-related differences in corticomuscular and intramuscular coherence in ankle dorsiflexors during walking	PHYSIOLOGICAL REPORTS			English	Article						aging; corticomuscular coherence; corticospinal control; gait; intramuscular coherence; test-retest	INTERMUSCULAR COHERENCE; MUSCLE; GAIT; DRIVE; MECHANISM; YOUNG	Corticomuscular (CMC) and intramuscular (intraMC) coherence represent measures of corticospinal interaction. Both CMC and intraMC can be assessed during human locomotion tasks, for example, while walking. Corticospinal control of gait can deteriorate during the aging process and CMC and intraMC may represent an important monitoring means. However, it is unclear whether such assessments represent a reliable tool when performed during walking in an ecologically valid scenario and whether age-related differences may occur. Wireless surface electroencephalography and electromyography were employed in a pilot study with young and old adults during overground walking in two separate sessions. CMC and intraMC analyses were performed in the gathered beta and lower gamma frequencies (i.e., 13-40 Hz). Significant log-transformed coherence area was tested for intersessions test-retest reliability by determining intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), yielding to low reliability in CMC in both younger and older adults. intraMC exclusively showed low reliability in the older adults, whereas intraMC in the younger adults revealed similar values as previously reported: test-retest reliability [ICC (95% CI): 0.44 (-0.23, 0.87); SEM: 0.46; MDC: 1.28; MDC%: 103; Hedge's g (95% CI): 0.54 (-0.13, 1.57)]. Significant differences between the age groups were observed in intraMC by either comparing the two groups with the first test [Hedge's g (95% CI): 1.55 (0.85, 2.15); p-value: .006] or with the retest data [Hedge's g (95% CI): 2.24 (0.73, 3.70); p-value: .005]. Notwithstanding the small sample size investigated, intraMC seems a moderately reliable assessment in younger adults. The further development and use of this measure in practical settings to infer corticospinal interaction in human locomotion in clinical practice is warranted and should help to refine the analysis. This necessitates involving larger sample sizes as well as including a wider number of lower limb muscles. Moreover, further research seems warranted by the observed differences in modulation mechanisms of corticospinal control of gait as ascertained by intraMC between the age groups.

Forecasting Seizures Using Intracranial EEG Measures and SVM in Naturally Occurring Canine Epilepsy	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; PREICTAL STATE; TEMPORAL-LOBE; ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS; IDIOPATHIC EPILEPSY; ANIMAL-MODELS; DOGS; PREDICTION; SYSTEM; BRAIN	Management of drug resistant focal epilepsy would be greatly assisted by a reliable warning system capable of alerting patients prior to seizures to allow the patient to adjust activities or medication. Such a system requires successful identification of a preictal, or seizure-prone state. Identification of preictal states in continuous long-duration intracranial electroenceph-alographic (iEEG) recordings of dogs with naturally occurring epilepsy was investigated using a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The dogs studied were implanted with a 16-channel ambulatory iEEG recording device with average channel reference for a mean (st. dev.) of 380.4 (+87.5) days producing 220.2 (+104.1) days of intracranial EEG recorded at 400 Hz for analysis. The iEEG records had 51.6 (+52.8) seizures identified, of which 35.8 (+30.4) seizures were preceded by more than 4 hours of seizure-free data. Recorded iEEG data were stratified into 11 contiguous, non-overlapping frequency bands and binned into one-minute synchrony features for analysis. Performance of the SVM classifier was assessed using a 5-fold cross validation approach, where preictal training data were taken from 90 minute windows with a 5 minute pre-seizure offset. Analysis of the optimal preictal training time was performed by repeating the cross validation over a range of preictal windows and comparing results. We show that the optimization of feature selection varies for each subject, i.e. algorithms are subject specific, but achieve prediction performance significantly better than a time-matched Poisson random predictor (p<0.05) in 5/5 dogs analyzed.

Electrical, molecular and behavioral effects of interictal spiking in the rat	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						Epilepsy; Interictal spiking; Neocortex; MAPK; CREB; Behavior; Hyperactivity	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; TETANUS TOXIN MODEL; DEPENDENT GENE-EXPRESSION; EPILEPTIFORM ABNORMALITIES; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; ADHD CHILDREN; EEG; SEIZURES; SPIKES; FOCI	Objective: Epilepsy is a disease characterized by chronic seizures, but is associated with significant comorbidities between seizures including cognitive impairments, hyperactivity, and depression. To study this interictal state, we characterized the electrical, molecular, and behavior effects of chronic, neocortical interictal spiking in rats. Methods: A single injection of tetanus toxin into somatosensory cortex generated chronic interictal spiking measured by long-term video EEG monitoring and was correlated with motor activity. The cortical pattern of biomarker activation and the effects of blocking MAPK signaling on interictal spiking and behavior were determined. Results: Interictal spiking in this model increases in frequency, size, and becomes repetitive over time, but is rarely associated with seizures. Interictal spiking was sufficient to produce the same molecular and cellular pattern of layer 2/3-specific CREB activation and plasticity gene induction as is seen in the human interictal state. Increasing spike frequency was associated with hyperactivity, demonstrated by increased ambulatory activity and preferential circling toward the spiking hemisphere. Loud noises induced epileptic discharges, identical to spontaneous discharges. Treatment with a selective MAPK inhibitor prevented layer 2/3 CREB activation, reduced the frequency of epileptic discharges, and normalized behavioral abnormalities, but had no effect on seizures induced by electrical kindling. Interpretation: These results provide insights into the development of interictal epileptic spiking, their relationship to behavior, and suggest that interictal and ictal activities utilize distinct molecular pathways. This model, that parallels recent observations in humans, will be useful to develop therapeutics against interictal spiking and its behavioral comorbidities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Ictal asystole (IA) is a potential mechanism underlying sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). We analyzed the clinical features of 5 patients who developed IA requiring pacemaker implantation. Methods: Patients with ictal arrhythmias were identified from the video-telemetry and ambulatory EEG database at Greater Manchester Neurosciences Centre, as well as an independent epilepsy residential care facility. Only those who had IA requiring pacemaker implantation were included in the analysis. A total of 5 patients were identified. Results: Of the 5 patients with IA, 4 were female. All 5 patients had focal epilepsy, and four had temporal lobe epilepsy. Ictal asystole occurred with focal seizures with impairment of awareness. Seizure onset was left sided in 2 patients, right-sided in one, left-sided onset with switch of lateralization in one, and nonlateralized in one patient. Three patients had hippocampal sclerosis, one of whom had undergone epilepsy surgery, one had traumatic encephalomalacia of the temporal lobe, and one patient had no lesions detected on MRI. Interictal epileptiform activity was more pronounced during sleep in all patients. Asystole occurred in association with sleep-related seizures in 4 of 5 patients. Conclusions: Ictal asystole (IA) occurred in association with sleep-related seizures in 4 out of 5 cases, predominantly in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. These findings may be of relevance to SUDEP. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Significant differences in caffeine consumption and smoking habits were observed between the two groups. Plasma samples were taken from each subject before (T-0) and after caffeine intake at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 24 h. Three pharmacokinetic parameters: half-life (t(1/2)), maximum time (T-max) and maximum plasma concentration (C-max) were calculated from caffeine plasma concentration measurements determined by reversed phase HPLC analysis. Caffeine-sensitive subjects showed significantly greater half-life values when calculated on 24 h after the administration than tolerant subjects (p < 0.05). Since the elimination kinetics were similar on the first 6 h after caffeine administration, the increased caffeine clearance observed overnight, when smoking was resumed in the control group, may indicate a short delay for the induction of hepatic cytochrome, reported here for the first time. Electrophysiological responses to caffeine, including vigilance and cortical activity, were assessed by ambulatory electroencephalographic (EEG) recorded during a period of 6 h before and after caffeine consumption. Following caffeine intake, the caffeine-intolerant subjects presented an increase in vigilance levels with faster peak alpha, beta frequency and lower delta and theta power when compared to tolerant subjects. Pharmacokinetic parameters and EEG data showed significant differences between sleep-sensitive and control subjects. These variations may be, in part, explained by cigarette smoking and the higher caffeine intake observed in the subjects of the control groups while caffeine sleep-sensitive subjects have a significantly lower caffeine intake, as already reported in previous studies on patients with sleep disturbances.

An underrecognized cause of syncope may occur when partial epileptic discharges profoundly disrupt normal cardiac rhythm, including cardiac asystole, the so-called arrhythmogenic epilepsy (AE). Aim. - To report initial results of observations of AE in patients with recurrent, unexplained, traumatic and/or convulsive syncope. Methods. - Ten patients aged 49 +/- 20 years (median 49.5 years; nine women) underwent complete cardiological. (including ambulatory Hotter electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography and head-up tilt test [plus electrophysiology in four patients]) and neurological (including standard electroencephalogram [EEG], computed tomography [CT] and magnetic resonance imaging scan [MRI]) assessments. Results. - After initial evaluation, neurocardiogenic syncope was suspected in six patients with tilt-induced hypotension bradycardia. Further evaluation (prolonged inpatient video-EEG/ECG monitoring) was undertaken because of non-diagnostic syncope or uncertainty about the diagnosis of neurocardiogenic syncope. White monitored in the neurophysiology tab, a syncopal episode similar to the spontaneous episodes recurred in all 10 patients. Cardiac asystole preceded by partial, seizure of temporal onset was documented in nine patients; a second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block with a cardiac rhythm of 30 beats per minute preceded by partial seizure of temporal onset was noted in one patient. Eight patients were treated successfully with antiepileptic drugs; two were refractory to antiepileptic therapy and required pacemaker implantation. No patient had recurrent syncope during a median follow-up of 102.5 months (mean 82.2 +/- 42; range 16-128 months). Conclusions. - In patients with recurrent, unexplained, traumatic and/or convulsive syncope, AE should be considered as a possible aetiotogy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Video-EEG based research, however, demonstrated lack of validity due to underreporting. Here we examined the practice of keeping seizure diaries and the patients' attitudes toward seizure counting. Methods: Anticipating a low return rate, a comprehensive survey was mailed to 1100 adult outpatients. Besides methods and reasons to document or not to document seizures, the questionnaire addressed clinical, personality and sociodemographic characteristics as well as the subjective experience of seizures. Results: Questionnaires from 170 patients (15%) could be included in our analysis. Patients estimated to be aware of 5.3 out of 10 daytime seizures (nocturnal seizures: 2.6) while they supposed that relatives/colleagues noticed 7.1 (nocturnal: 4.6). Almost two-thirds of the patients reported to keep a seizure diary with a self-estimated documentation rate of 8.7 out of 10 noticed daytime seizures (nocturnal: 7.7). Documenters and non-documenters showed only marginal group differences with regard to clinical, personality and sociodemographic characteristics. Importantly, patients were more committed to keep a seizure diary when they judged it to be relevant for clinical treatment decisions. Conclusion: Patients appear to know that they underreport seizures. According to their view, seizure unawareness as induced by seizures themselves seems to be a more important factor than omitting documentation of noticed seizures. Thus, the potential to improve the validity of seizure diaries of electronic devices which facilitate documenting noticed seizures appears limited. (C) 2015 British Epilepsy Association.

A randomized controlled crossover trial	SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						Electronic device; Sleep homeostasis; Blue light; Sleep quality; Sleep disturbance; Adolescents	PHASE RESPONSE CURVE; BRIGHT LIGHT; ELECTRONIC MEDIA; INTERNET USE; EXPOSURE; MORNINGNESS; TIME; LIFE; QUESTIONNAIRE; WAVELENGTH	Objective: To objectively and subjectively compare whether reading a story for 30 min from an iPad or from a book in bed prior to sleep will differentially affect sleep. Methods: Sixteen students (12 females, mean age 25.1 +/- 2.9 years) underwent ambulatory (sleeping in their own beds at home) polysomnographic (PSG) recordings in a counterbalanced crossover design consisting of three PSG nights (one adaptation night, two test nights) and two different reading materials: read from an iPad or from a book. Illumination was measured during reading and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale was completed prior to turning the light off. Sleep diaries were kept to assess subjective sleep parameters from day to day. Results: Illumination was higher in the iPad condition compared to the book condition (58.3 +/- 6.9 vs 26.7 +/- 8.0 lux, p < 0.001). Reading a story from an iPad decreased subjective sleepiness, delayed the EEG dynamics of slow wave activity by approximately 30 min, and reduced slow wave activity after sleep onset compared to reading from a book. No parameters of sleep state timing and sleep onset latency differed between the two reading conditions. Conclusion: Although there was no direct effect on time spent in different sleep states and self-reported sleep onset latency, the use of an iPad which emits blue enriched light impinges acutely on sleepiness and EEG characteristics of sleep pressure. Hence, the use of commercially available tablets may have consequences in terms of alertness, circadian physiology, and sleep. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Translational neurophysiological markers for activity of the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR2) modulator JNJ-40411813: Sleep EEG correlates in rodents and healthy men	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Circadian; Glutamate; Men; mGluR2 (-/-) mice; Metabotropic receptor mGluR2; Network oscillations and connectivity; Polysomnography; Positron Emission Tomography (PET); Psychiatric disorders; Rat; Sleep-wake cycle; Tolerance; Translational	SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; POSITIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATOR; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; REM-SLEEP; POWER SPECTRA; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; ANTAGONIST RITANSERIN; CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT; COGNITIVE-PROCESSES; THETA OSCILLATIONS	Alterations in rapid eye movement sleep (REM) have been suggested as valid translational efficacy markers: activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2) was shown to increase REM latency and to decrease REM duration. The present paper addresses the effects on vigilance states of the mGluR2 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) JNJ-40411813 at different circadian times in rats and after afternoon dosing in humans. Due to its dual mGluR2 PAM/serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor antagonism in rodents, mGlu2R specificity of effects was studied in wild-type (WT) and mGluR2 (-/-) mice. 5-HT2A receptor occupancy was determined in humans using positron emission tomography (PET). Tolerance development was examined in rats after chronic dosing. EEG oscillations and network connectivity were assessed using multi-channel EEG. In rats, JNJ-40411813 increased deep sleep time and latency of REM onset but reduced REM time when administered 2 h after 'lights on' (CT2): this was sustained after chronic dosing. At CT5 similar effects were elicited, at CT10 only deep sleep was enhanced. Withdrawal resulted in baseline values, while re administration reinstated drug effects. Parieto-occipital cortical slow theta and gamma oscillations were correlated with low locomotion. The specificity of functional response was confirmed in WT but not mGluR2 (-/-) mice. A double-blind, placebo-controlled polysomnographic study in healthy, elderly subjects showed that 500 mg of JNJ-40411813 consistently increased deep sleep time, but had no effect on REM parameters. This deep sleep effect was not explained by 5-HT2A receptor binding, as in the PET study even 700 mg only marginally displaced the tracer. JNJ-40411813 elicited comparable functional responses in rodents and men if circadian time of dosing was taken into account. These findings underscore the translational potential of sleep mechanisms in evaluating mGluR2 therapeutics when administered at the appropriate circadian time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the theta rhythms were studied while rats either walked or were passively translated by a toy car on a linear track (referred to as WALK and TRANS respectively). For the similar running speeds in WALK and TRANS conditions, theta frequency and amplitude were both reduced during TRANS. Theta modulation of pyramidal cells during TRANS was reduced compared to that during WALK. Theta frequency was positively correlated with translation speed during TRANS. Theta rhythm remained apparent during TRANS and WALK after large dose of atropine sulfate (blocking the cholinergic pathway) was injected compared to still states. The present study demonstrated the patterns of theta rhythm induced by passive translation in rats and suggested that the Type I theta rhythm could occur during non-voluntary locomotion. We further argued that the perception of actual self-motion may be the underlying mechanism that initiates and modulates type I theta. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

It has also been observed that the relative timing of place cell firing recedes as its place field is traversed - a phenomena known as phase precession. This has led to the development of a theory of theta phase coding, whereby spatial sequences being encountered on a behavioural timescale are compressed into a firing sequence of place cells which is repeated in each theta cycle and stored in an auto-associative network using spike-timing dependent plasticity. This paper provides an abstract, descriptive model of theta phase coding in a spiking neural network, and aims to investigate how learning and recall functions may be separated by the neuromodulatory action of Acetylcholine (ACh). It is demonstrated that ACh is not essential for concurrent learning and recall without interference in this case, thanks to the robust nature of the theta phase coding implementation. However, the neuromodulation of synaptic plasticity offers other advantages, and may be essential to avoid continually consolidating false predictions when learning new routes.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; MUSCLE-ACTIVITY; EEG; CORTEX; REHABILITATION; COORDINATION; ACTIVATION; LOCOMOTION; ATTENTION; ORTHOSIS	In order to determine optimal training parameters for robot-assisted treadmill walking, it is essential to understand how a robotic device interacts with its wearer, and thus, how parameter settings of the device affect locomotor control. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of different levels of guidance force during robot-assisted treadmill walking on cortical activity. Eighteen healthy subjects walked at 2 km.h(-1) on a treadmill with and without assistance of the Lokomat robotic gait orthosis. Event-related spectral perturbations and changes in power spectral density were investigated during unassisted treadmill walking as well as during robot-assisted treadmill walking at 30%, 60% and 100% guidance force (with 0% body weight support). Clustering of independent components revealed three clusters of activity in the sensorimotor cortex during treadmill walking and robot-assisted treadmill walking in healthy subjects. These clusters demonstrated gait-related spectral modulations in the mu, beta and low gamma bands over the sensorimotor cortex related to specific phases of the gait cycle. Moreover, mu and beta rhythms were suppressed in the right primary sensory cortex during treadmill walking compared to robot-assisted treadmill walking with 100% guidance force, indicating significantly larger involvement of the sensorimotor area during treadmill walking compared to robot-assisted treadmill walking. Only marginal differences in the spectral power of the mu, beta and low gamma bands could be identified between robot-assisted treadmill walking with different levels of guidance force. From these results it can be concluded that a high level of guidance force (i.e., 100% guidance force) and thus a less active participation during locomotion should be avoided during robot-assisted treadmill walking. This will optimize the involvement of the sensorimotor cortex which is known to be crucial for motor learning.

The theta phase affects the nature of the plasticity induced in urethane-anesthetized rats and in the carbachol-treated in vitro slice preparation, but these oscillations are phenomenologically different from natural theta, and the effects of theta phase on plasticity under natural conditions have not been reported. We therefore examined the effects of theta phase on the magnitude of long-term potentiation (LTP) in awake rats running on a linear track for a food reward. Twelve adult and 10 aged F344 male rats were implanted with a stimulating electrode in the perforant path and a recording electrode in the hilus of the fascia dentata. Stimuli were delivered at the peak or trough of the hilar theta rhythm. In both adult and aged, memory-impaired rats, LTP lasting at least 48 h was induced when stimuli were delivered at the positive theta peak, whereas LTP was not induced when stimuli were delivered at the negative troughs. Consistent with the finding that the threshold for LTP induction is increased at this synapse in old rats, the magnitude of LTP induced at the peak of theta rhythm was significantly lower in old animals. These data confirm that LTP can be modulated by locomotion-induced theta, and that this modulation is at least qualitatively preserved across age. Hippocampus 2001;11:647-654.

Introduction of bispectral index monitoring in a district general hospital operating suite: a prospective audit of clinical and economic effects	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article						anaesthesia; electroencephalography; pharmacoeconomics; postoperative nausea and vomiting; recovery room	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIALS; AMBULATORY ANESTHESIA; LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY; RECOVERY; METAANALYSIS; ONDANSETRON; PROPHYLAXIS; GRANISETRON; PROPOFOL; DEPTH	Background and objective Randomized controlled trials have shown several beneficial effects of intraoperative bispectral index monitoring. We conducted a prospective audit to determine whether these could be replicated in everyday clinical practice. Methods Recovery characteristics and drug costs from two 4-week periods were compared, immediately before (phase 1, n = 427 patients) and after (phase 2, n = 299 patients) the introduction of bispectral index monitoring in the main operating theatres of a district general hospital. Results Demographic and intraoperative variables for the two patient groups were similar. Nausea (P = 0.002), vomiting (P = 0.008) and antiemetic use (P = 0.001) in the postanaesthesia care unit all decreased in phase 2, though unrelated changes in antiemetic policy may have been partly responsible. Recovery time was unaffected. Drug costs decreased in phase 2 by an average of 0.86 pound per patient. The cost of each semi-reusable sensor was 6.60 pound. Conclusion In a prospective audit, benefits of intraoperative bispectral index monitoring in our district general hospital were not seen to the same degree as in randomized controlled trials elsewhere.

Previous work has thus proposed data reduction by only transmitting sections of data that contain candidate epileptic activity. This paper investigates algorithms by which this data selection can be carried out. It is essential that the algorithm is low power and that all possible features are identified, even at the expense of more false detections. Given this, a brief review of spike detection algorithms is carried out with a view to using these algorithms to drive the data reduction process. A CWT based algorithm is deemed most suitable for use and an algorithm is described in detail and its performance tested. It is found that over 90% of expert marked spikes are identified whilst giving a 40% reduction in the amount of data to be transmitted and analysed. The performance varies with the recording duration in response to each detection and this effect is also investigated. The proposed algorithm will form the basis of new a AEEG system that allows wireless and longer term epilepsy monitoring.

The brain histaminergic arousal system is under the negative control of H3-autoreceptors whose deletion results in permanent enhancement of histamine (HA) turnover. In order to determine the consequences of enhancement of the histaminergic system, we compared the cortical EEG and sleep-wake states of H3-receptor knockout (H3R-/-) and wild-type mouse littermates. We found that H3R-/- mice had rich phenotypes. On the one hand, they showed clear signs of enhanced HA neurotransmission and vigilance, i.e., a higher EEG theta power during spontaneous W and a greater extent of W or sleep restriction during behavioral tasks, including environmental change, locomotion, and motivation tests. On the other hand, during the baseline dark period, they displayed deficient W and signs of sleep deterioration, such as pronounced sleep fragmentation and reduced cortical slow activity during slow wave sleep (SWS), most likely due to a desensitization of postsynaptic histaminergic receptors as a result of constant HA release. Ciproxifan (H3-receptor inverse agonist) enhanced W in wild-type mice, but not in H3R-/- mice, indicating a functional deletion of H3-receptors, whereas triprolidine (postsynaptic H1-receptor antagonist) or alpha-fluoromethylhistidine (HA-synthesis inhibitor) caused a greater SWS increase in H3R-/- than in wild-type mice, consistent with enhanced HA neurotransmission. These sleep-wake characteristics and the obesity phenotypes previously reported in this animal model suggest that chronic enhancement of histaminergic neurotransmission eventually compromises the arousal system, leading to sleep-wake, behavioral, and metabolic disorders similar to those caused by voluntary sleep restriction in humans.

The design is based on the analysis of requirements for secure and efficient storage, transmission and access to medical tests in e-health environment. This approach uses the 1D SPIHT algorithm to compress 1D biomedical signals with clinical quality, metadata embedding in the compressed domain to avoid extra distortion, digital signature to implement security and attribute-level encryption to support Role-Based Access Control.

Differential behavioral, stress, and sleep responses in mice with different delays of fear extinction	SLEEP			English	Article						fear extinction; REM; REM-theta activity; contextual fear conditioning	HOME CAGE ACTIVITY; CONTEXTUAL FEAR; MEMORY RECONSOLIDATION; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; NEUROTOXIC LESIONS; CONDITIONED FEAR; THETA-RHYTHM; DEPRIVATION; CONSOLIDATION; HIPPOCAMPUS	Study Objectives: Sleep, in particular rapid eye movement (REM), has been linked to fear learning and extinction; however, their relationship is poorly understood. We determined how different delays of extinction training (ET) impact fear-conditioned behaviors, changes in sleep, and stress responses. Methods: EEG activity, movement, and body temperature in mice were monitored via telemetry. Following contextual fear conditioning (shock training [ST]), separate groups of mice were reexposed to the context at 24-hour post-ST (24h ET-1) and at 48-hour post-ST (48h ET-1). Post-ET sleep amount and sleep-associated EEG (delta and theta) activity were compared to baseline and to post-ST sleep. Freezing, locomotion, grooming, and rearing were monitored to determine effects of ET on fear behaviors. Body temperature immediately after ET was monitored to assess stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH). Results: 24h ET-1 and 48h ET-1 produced similar freezing and REM reductions, but dissimilar rearing activity and SIH. 24h ET-1 was followed by periods of suppressed REM-associated theta (REM-theta) activity, immediately after ET and during the subsequent dark period. Suppressed REM-theta was specific to sleep after 24h ET-1, and did not occur after ST, nor after 48h ET-1. Conclusions: ET-1 at 24 and 48 hours after ST was associated with similar freezing and REM amounts, but with differences in other overt behaviors, in REM-theta, and in SIH. Freezing was not predictive of changes in other fear-associated responses. This study demonstrated that consideration of time delay from fear acquisition to extinction is important when assessing the relationships between extinction and behavior, sleep, and stress responses.

Correlation of twisting motion phase and infantile spasms in high risk infants	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY			English	Article						General movements; Twisting motion; Infantile spasms; Risk newborns	GENERAL MOVEMENTS; CEREBRAL-PALSY; WEST SYNDROME; CHILDREN; TERM; SEIZURES; PRETERM	Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of twisting motion phase and infantile spasms in high risk infants. Materials and Methods: One hundred seventy-eight high-risk newborns experiencing follow-up in the rehabilitation phase were selected and full-body motion quality assessment was performed in the twisting motion phase. The occurrence of infants with infantile spasms after 12 months (corrected age) was statistically analyzed. Results: No clear correlation was found between monotonous movement twisting motion phase and infantile spasms, and spasm synchronized movement had no definite prediction for infantile spasms. The incidence of infant spasm with movement form having spastic synchronized characteristics had significant difference compared with monotonous systemic movement (p < 0.01). The sensitivity of predictive rate for spasm-synchronous movement of infantile spasms was 90.9%, the specificity was 96.8%, the positive predictive value was 80%, and the negative predictive value was 98.7%. Conclusions: Spasm synchronized movement had some predictive value for infantile spasms in twisting motion stage. The newborns with this kind of movement form should be checked by regularly ambulatory EEG.	[Wang, Y. Q.; Gu, G.

The prevalence of epileptic seizures in dogs ranges between 0.5% and 5.7% and between 1% and 3% in the human population. Studies on human epilepsy provide a ready-made format for classification, diagnosis and treatment in veterinary epilepsy. Human studies highlight the value of a thorough seizure classification. Nevertheless, a matter of concern in canine epilepsy is the limited information regarding seizure description and classification because of the lack of EEG-video recording. Establishment of a consensus protocol for ambulatory home video-recording in dogs who suffer from epilepsy, mainly considering indications, duration of monitoring, the sufficient essential training for an optimal interpretation of ictal semiology and the methodology of recordings is needed. The ultimate goal is that the information gathered by these videos will be analysed to describe the epileptic seizures thoroughly, recognize patterns and move towards a better understanding and therefore classification of canine epileptic seizures.

These disorders have never been investigated by prolonged, objective, and instrumental evaluations. The present work is based on sleep duration and structure in Sal patients. Study design: The features of sleep/wake cycle in 6 Sanfilippo patients and 6 healthy controls were evaluated by means of sleep diaries and 48 hour ambulatory EEG and polygraphic recordings. Statistical analysis was performed by means of the U-test (Mann-Whitney). Results: Four out of six Sanfilippo patients, the oldest patients in our sample, showed an extremely irregular sleep pattern, with several sleep episodes of inconstant duration, irregularly distributed along 24 hours. The two younger patients showed sleep maintenance insomnia with several nocturnal awakenings. Conclusions: These results suggest that sleep disruption in Sanfilippo syndrome consists of an irregular sleep/wake pattern, which at its onset might appear as a disorder of initiating or maintaining sleep, This could explain why some patients do not respond to conventional hypnotics. The present observation might suggest attempting therapies aimed at resynchronization, such as behavioral treatment, light therapy or melatonin.

We propose a multimodal framework based on random forest classifiers, which predict the actual environment among predefined generic classes of urban settings, inferring on real-time, non-invasive, ambulatory monitoring of brain and peripheral biosignals. Model performance reached 93 for the outdoor and 87 percent for the indoor environments (expressed in weighted AUROC), demonstrating the potential of the approach. Estimating the density distributions of the most predictive biomarkers, we present a series of geographic and temporal visualizations depicting the environmental contexts in which the most intense affective and cognitive reactions take place. A linear mixed model analysis revealed significant differences between categories of vision impairment, but not between normal and impaired vision. Despite the limited size of our cohort, these findings pave the way to emotionally intelligent mobility-enhancing systems, capable of implicit adaptation not only to changing environments but also to shifts in the affective state of the user in relation to different environmental and situational factors.

We have previously demonstrated that the medial septum (MS) mediated the phencyclidine-induced deficit in prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle (PPI) in rats. Objectives We investigated the involvement of the supramammillary area (SUM) to MS pathway in PPI impairment and behavioral hyperlocomotion induced by MK-801or ketamine in rats and correlated the behavioral deficits with hippocampal gamma wave increase. Materials and methods Ketamine (6 mg/kg, s.c.) or MK-801 (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered after infusion of saline or the GABA(A) receptor agonist, muscimol (0.25 mu g), into the MS or SUM. Locomotion, PPI, and hippocampal electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded. Results MK-801 or ketamine induced PPI impairment and behavioral hyperlocomotion, accompanied by an increase in hippocampal gamma waves (30-100 Hz). The changes in behavior and gamma waves induced by ketamine or MK-801 were antagonized by pre-infusion of muscimol, but not saline, into the SUM or MS. Infusion of muscimol into the SUM alone did not significantly affect PPI, but it suppressed spontaneous locomotor behavior and hippocampal EEG. Infusion of ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists into the MS did not affect the PPI deficit or the gamma wave increase after MK-801. Conclusions A non-glutamatergic component of the supramammillo-septal pathway mediates the hyperlocomotion and the deficits in PPI induced by MK-801 or ketamine. Inactivation of the MS or SUM normalized both the hippocampal gamma waves and the behavioral deficits (PPI impairment and hyperlocomotion).

A Negative Allosteric Modulator for alpha 5 Subunit-Containing GABA Receptors Exerts a Rapid and Persistent Antidepressant-Like Action without the Side Effects of the NMDA Receptor Antagonist Ketamine in Mice	ENEURO			English	Article						antidepressant; behavior; depression; GABA-NAM; gamma oscillation; ketamine	AMPA RECEPTOR; CHRONIC STRESS; A RECEPTOR; SYNAPSE; DEPRESSION; IMPAIRMENT; EXPRESSION; BLOCKADE; SEEKING; TRIAL	New antidepressant pharmacotherapies that provide rapid relief of depressive symptoms are needed. The NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine exerts rapid antidepressant actions in depressed patients but also side effects that complicate its clinical utility. Ketamine promotes excitatory synaptic strength, likely by producing high-frequency correlated activity in mood-relevant regions of the forebrain. Negative allosteric modulators of GABA-A receptors containing alpha 5 subunits (alpha 5 GABA-NAMs) should also promote high-frequency correlated electroencephalogram (EEG) activity and should therefore exert rapid antidepressant responses. Because alpha 5 subunits display a restricted expression in the forebrain, we predicted that alpha 5 GABA-NAMs would produce activation of principle neurons but exert fewer side effects than ketamine. We tested this hypothesis in male mice and observed that the alpha 5 GABA-NAM MRK-016 exerted an antidepressant-like response in the forced swim test at 1 and 24 h after administration and an antianhedonic response after chronic stress in the female urine sniffing test (FUST). Like ketamine, MRK-016 produced a transient increase in EEG gamma power, and both the increase in gamma power and its antidepressant effects in the forced swim test were blocked by prior administration of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor antagonist 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4tetrahydrobenzo[f] quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX). Unlike ketamine, however, MRK-016 produced no impairment of rota-rod performance, no reduction of prepulse inhibition (PPI), no conditioned-place preference (CPP), and no change in locomotion. alpha 5 GABA-NAMs, thus reproduce the rapid antidepressant-like actions of ketamine, perhaps via an AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-dependent increase in coherent neuronal activity, but display fewer potential negative side effects. These compounds thus demonstrate promise as clinically useful fast-acting antidepressants.

J	Wilson, GF				Wilson, GF			An analysis of mental workload in pilots during flight using multiple psychophysiological measures	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AVIATION PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							AMBULATORY BLOOD-PRESSURE; HEART-RATE; EEG; RESPIRATION; MISSIONS	Piloting an aircraft is a complex task that places demands on several aspects of a pilot's cognitive capabilities. Because of the multifaceted nature of flying, several measures are required to identify the effects of these demands on the pilot. Several psychophysiological measures were recorded so that a wider understanding of the effects of these demands could be achieved. Heart rate, heart rate variability, eye blinks, electrodermal activity, topographically recorded electrical brain activity, and subjective estimates of mental workload were recorded. Ten pilots flew an approximately 90-min scenario containing both visual and instrument flight conditions. To determine the reliability of the psychophysiological measures, the pilots flew. the same scenario twice. The responses during the 2 flights were essentially identical. Cardiac and electrodermal measures were highly correlated and exhibited changes in response to the various demands of the flights. Heart rate variability was less sensitive than heart rate. Alpha and delta bands of the brain activity showed significant changes to the varying demands of the scenarios. Blink rates decreased during the more highly visually demanding segments of the flights.

Methods: The previously developed AutoLearn (TM) algorithm, which employs the probabilistic neural network (PNN), is tested on 209 seizures obtained from the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) or ambulatory recordings. A construction algorithm is used to compare a variety of algorithm architectures and factors. The Taguchi design of experiments (DoE) method is employed find the significant factors without resorting to a full factorial design. Results: Architectures that train a single PNN per channel and use segmentation to identify ranges of similar activity are preferred. The two best architectures are insensitive to the levels of any of the other factors tested. The training time for the algorithm is less than 1 s, and approximately 2 min are required to find the seizures in an 8 h record. Conclusions: The final algorithm, which requires no input from the user other than the marking of the first seizure in a record, performs as well or better than the 3 seizure detectors on EMU and ambulatory records. The algorithm performs nearly as well as human experts on the EMU records. Significance: The described method can be used to identify unusual seizures (or other patterns) that will be missed by the current generation of seizure detectors. We expect that the methods developed here will also aid the development of patient independent seizure detectors that can improve their performance over time by incorporating new examples.

Most patients with epilepsy with comorbid depression exhibit hypoechogenic BRN in TCS. However, the role of BRN in the pathogenesis of epilepsy is unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the correlation of BRN echogenicity with epilepsy itself, and the echogenicity of other midbrain structures and the size of lateral ventricle (LV) will also be evaluated in patients with epilepsy. Methods: Thirty-six patients with epilepsy without depression and 37 healthy controls were recruited. Sonographic echogenicity of BRN, caudate nucleus (CN), lentiform nucleus (LN), substantia nigra (SN), and the width of frontal horns of the lateral ventricles (LV) and the third ventricle (TV) were evaluated with TCS. The frequency of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) was assessed with ambulatory electroencephalogram (AEEG). Results: Hypoechogenicity of BRN was depicted in 36.1% of patients with epilepsy and 18.9% of controls, showing no significant difference. Patients with epilepsy with BRN hypoechogenicity had higher epileptic discharge index (EDI) than those with normal BRN echogenecity. Especially, higher EDI in patients with BRN hypoechogenicity was observed during the sleep period but not during awake period. The width of TV was significantly larger in patients with epilepsy than that in controls. We did not find any difference between patients with epilepsy and controls in the echogenicity of CN, LN, and SN, as well as in the width of frontal horn of LV. Conclusions: Hypoechogenic BRN is correlated with a high frequency of epileptic discharges in electroencephalogram (EEG), especially during sleep period but not during awake period, indicating that BRN alterations may play a potential role in the pathogenesis of epilepsy in association with sleep cycle.

Effects of selective slow-wave sleep deprivation on nocturnal blood pressure dipping and daytime blood pressure regulation. Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 298: R191-R197, 2010. First published November 11, 2009; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00368.2009.-Nocturnal blood pressure (BP) decline or "dipping" is an active, central, nervously governed process, which is important for BP regulation during daytime. It is, however, not known whether the sleep process itself or, more specifically, slow-wave sleep (SWS) is important for normal dipping. Therefore, in the present study, healthy subjects (6 females, 5 males) were selectively deprived of SWS by EEG-guided acoustic arousals. BP and heart rate (HR) were monitored during experimental nights and the following day. Additionally, nocturnal catecholamine excretion was determined, and morning baroreflex function was assessed by microneurographic measurements of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and heart rate variability (HRV). Data were compared with a crossover condition of undisturbed sleep. SWS was successfully deprived leading to significantly attenuated mean arterial BP dipping during the first half (P < 0.05), but not during the rapid-eye-movement-dominated second half of total sleep; however, dipping still evolved even in the absence of SWS. No differences were found for nighttime catecholamine excretion. Moreover, daytime resting and ambulatory BP and HR were not altered, and morning MSNA and HRV did not differ significantly, indicating that baroreflex-mediated sympathoneural BP regulation was not affected by the preceding SWS deprivation. We conclude that in healthy humans the magnitude of nocturnal BP dipping is significantly affected by sleep depth. Deprivation of SWS during one night does not modulate the morning threshold and sensitivity of the vascular and cardiac baroreflex and does not alter ambulatory BP during daytime.

Synchronous EMG Activity in the Piper Frequency Band Reveals the Corticospinal Demand of Walking Tasks	ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Walking; Electromyography; Motor control; Nervous system; Locomotion	EVOKED MOTOR-RESPONSES; CORTICOMUSCULAR COHERENCE; HUMAN GAIT; DEPENDENT MODULATION; MUSCLE-ACTIVITY; SURFACE EMG; EEG-EMG; CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; DRIVE	Evidence indicates that the frequency-domain characteristics of surface electromyogram (EMG) signals are modulated according to the contributing sources of neural drive. Modulation of inter-muscular EMG synchrony within the Piper frequency band (30-60 Hz) during movement tasks has been linked to drive from the corticospinal tract. However, it is not known whether EMG synchrony is sufficiently sensitive to detect task-dependent differences in the corticospinal contribution to leg muscle activation during walking. We investigated this question in seventeen healthy older men and women. It was hypothesized that, relative to typical steady state walking, Piper band EMG synchrony of the triceps surae muscle group would be reduced for dual-task walking (because of competition for cortical resources), similar for fast walking (because walking speed is directed by an indirect locomotor pathway rather than by the corticospinal tract), and increased when taking a long step (because voluntary gait pattern modifications are directed by the corticospinal tract). Each of these hypotheses was confirmed. These findings support the use of frequency-domain analysis of EMG in future investigations into the corticospinal contribution to control of healthy and disordered human walking.

Moreover, abnormal sleep patterns are characteristic of many neurodevelopmental disorders. Studying how chronic sleep restriction during development can affect adult behavior may add to our understanding of the emergence of behavioral symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders. While there are many methods that can be used to restrict sleep in rodents including forced locomotion, constant disruption, presentation of an aversive stimulus, or electric shock, many of these methods are very stressful and cannot be used in neonatal mice. Here, we describe gentle handling, a sleep deprivation technique that can be used chronically throughout development and into adulthood to achieve sleep restriction. Gentle handling involves close observation of the mice throughout the sleep deprivation period and requires the researcher to gently prod the animals whenever they are inactive or display behaviors associated with sleep. Coupled with EEG recordings, gentle handling could be used to selectively disrupt a specific phase of sleep such as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The technique of gentle handling is a powerful tool for the study of the effects of chronic sleep restriction even in neonatal mice that circumvents many of the more stressful procedures used for sleep deprivation.

J	Parkinson, GM				Parkinson, GM			High incidence of language disorder in children with focal epilepsies	DEVELOPMENTAL MEDICINE AND CHILD NEUROLOGY			English	Article							CHILDHOOD; CLASSIFICATION	To investigate the relationship between the presence of language disorder, type of epilepsy, and epileptic seizures in childhood, language levels, types of language impairment, and aetiologies were examined in 109 children, aged between 5 and 17 years, attending a national children's epilepsy assessment unit over a 4-year period. There were 70 males and 39 females. Median age was 11 years 4 months (range 5 to 18 years 9 months). In addition to neurological assessment, simultaneous video and EEG monitoring and prolonged ambulatory EEG, each child underwent a comprehensive series of multidisciplinary tests, including intelligence, language, and communication assessments. Classification of seizures and epilepsy syndromes was agreed in conference by a physician specializing in childhood epilepsies, a paediatric neurologist, and a neuropsychiatrist. Other test procedures were administered by a speech and language pathologist with assistance from a neuropsychologist when relevant. Level of language disability in these children was associated with a range of aetiological factors. Evidence was found of a significant number of associations between focal epilepsies, certain seizure types, and language disorder. Of the 46 (42.2%) children with language disorders in the research sample, 30 had localization-related epilepsies and a further three had epilepsies which were undetermined as to whether focal or generalized. Children with focal epilepsies were 30% more likely to have language disorder than other language disability subtypes. The research demonstrated a clear though often subtle association between focal (localization-related) epilepsy and language disorder, indicating an increased risk in this patient group. Children with simple or complex partial seizures were more likely to have language disorder than other language disability subtypes; they also tended to have the lowest number of seizure types per case. This is of importance to clinicians managing children with epilepsy and has implications for their educational and social welfare.

Alternating Current Stimulation for Vision Restoration after Optic Nerve Damage: A Randomized Clinical Trial	PLOS ONE			English	Article							QUALITY-OF-LIFE; BRAIN-STIMULATION; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; IMPROVES VISION; FIELDS; EEG	Background Vision loss after optic neuropathy is considered irreversible. Here, repetitive transorbital alternating current stimulation (rtACS) was applied in partially blind patients with the goal of activating their residual vision. Methods We conducted a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial in an ambulatory setting with daily application of rtACS (n = 45) or sham-stimulation (n = 37) for 50 min for a duration of 10 week days. A volunteer sample of patients with optic nerve damage (mean age 59.1 yrs) was recruited. The primary outcome measure for efficacy was super-threshold visual fields with 48 hrs after the last treatment day and at 2-months follow-up. Secondary outcome measures were near-threshold visual fields, reaction time, visual acuity, and resting-state EEGs to assess changes in brain physiology. Results The rtACS-treated group had a mean improvement in visual field of 24.0% which was significantly greater than after sham-stimulation (2.5%). This improvement persisted for at least 2 months in terms of both within-and between-group comparisons. Secondary analyses revealed improvements of near-threshold visual fields in the central 5 degrees and increased thresholds in static perimetry after rtACS and improved reaction times, but visual acuity did not change compared to shams. Visual field improvement induced by rtACS was associated with EEG power-spectra and coherence alterations in visual cortical networks which are interpreted as signs of neuromodulation. Current flow simulation indicates current in the frontal cortex, eye, and optic nerve and in the subcortical but not in the cortical regions. Conclusion rtACS treatment is a safe and effective means to partially restore vision after optic nerve damage probably by modulating brain plasticity. This class 1 evidence suggests that visual fields can be improved in a clinically meaningful way.

Furthermore, long-term assessment of sleep relies on actigraphy differentiating only between wake and sleep periods without identifying specific sleep stages and having low reliability in identifying wake periods after sleep onset. To address these issues, we aimed to develop an automatic method for identifying the sleep stages from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal obtained with a simple finger pulse oximeter. Methods: PPG signals from the diagnostic polysomnographies of susptected OSA patients (n = 894) were utilized to develop a combined convolutional and recurrent neural network. The deep learning model was trained individually for three-stage (wake/NREM/REM), four-stage (wake/N1+N2/N3/REM), and five-stage (wake/N1/N2/N3/REM) classification of sleep. Results: The three-stage model achieved an epoch-by-epoch accuracy of 80.1% with Cohen's kappa of 0.65. The four- and five-stage models achieved 68.5% (kappa = 0.54), and 64.1% (kappa = 0.51) accuracies, respectively. With the five-stage model, the total sleep time was underestimated with a mean bias error (SD) of of 7.5 (55.2) minutes. Conclusion: The PPG-based deep learning model enabled accurate estimation of sleep time and differentiation between sleep stages with a moderate agreement to manual EEG-based scoring. As PPG is already included in ambulatory polygraphic recordings, applying the PPG-based sleep staging could improve their diagnostic value by enabling simple, low-cost, and reliable monitoring of sleep and help assess otherwise overlooked conditions such as REM-related OSA.

Polysomnography (PSG) is considered the gold standard test to monitor sleep objectively, but some practical and technical constraints exist due to environmental and patient considerations. Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring is commonly used in clinical practice for guiding anesthetic administration and provides an index based on relationships between EEG components. Due to similarities in EEG synchronization between anesthesia and sleep, several studies have assessed BIS as a sleep monitor with contradictory results. The aim of this study was to evaluate objectively both the feasibility and reliability of BIS for sleep monitoring through a robust methodology, which included full PSG recordings at a baseline situation and after 40 h of sleep deprivation. Results confirmed that the BIS index was highly correlated with the hypnogram (0.89 +/- 0.02), showing a progressive decrease as sleep deepened, and an increase during REM sleep (awake: 91.77 +/- 8.42; stage N1: 83.95 +/- 11.05; stage N2: 71.71 +/- 11.99; stage N3: 42.41 +/- 9.14; REM: 80.11 +/- 8.73). Mean and median BIS values were lower in the post-deprivation night than in the baseline night, showing statistical differences for the slow wave sleep (baseline: 42.41 +/- 9.14 vs. post-deprivation: 39.49 +/- 10.27; p = 0.02). BIS scores were able to discriminate properly between deep (N3) and light (N1, N2) sleep. BIS values during REM overlapped those of other sleep stages, although EMG activity provided by the BIS monitor could help to identify REM sleep if needed. In conclusion, BIS monitors could provide a useful measure of sleep depth in especially particular situations such as intensive care units, and they could be used as an alternative for sleep monitoring in order to reduce PSG-derived costs and to increase capacity in ambulatory care.

Interictal epileptiform discharge effects on neuropsychological assessment and epilepsy surgical planning	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Review						Interictal epileptiform discharges; Surgical outcome; Neuropsychological assessment	BENIGN CHILDHOOD EPILEPSY; STEREOTACTIC LASER AMYGDALOHIPPOCAMPOTOMY; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; EEG DISCHARGES; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; LANGUAGE DYSFUNCTION; RECENT SEIZURES; CHILDREN; SPIKES; ABNORMALITIES	Both animal research and human research suggest that interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) may affect cognition, although the significance of such findings remains controversial. We review a wide range of literature with bearing on this topic and present relevant epilepsy surgery cases, which suggest that the effects of IEDs may be substantial and informative for surgical planning. In the first case, we present a patient with epilepsy with left anterior temporal lobe (TL) seizure onset who experienced frequent IEDs during preoperative neuropsychological assessment. Cognitive results strongly lateralized to the left TL. Because the patient failed performance validity tests and appeared amnestic for verbal materials inconsistent with his work history, selected neuropsychological tests were repeated 6 weeks later. Scores improved one to two standard deviations over the initial evaluation and because of this improvement, were only mildly suggestive of left TL impairment. The second case involves another patient with documented left TL epilepsy who experienced epileptiform activity while undergoing neurocognitive testing and simultaneous ambulatory EEG recording. This patient's verbal memory performance was impaired during the period that IEDs were present but near normal when such activity was absent. Overall, although the presence of IEDs may be helpful in confirming laterality of seizure onset, frequent IEDs might disrupt focal cognitive functions and distort accurate measurement of neuropsychological ability, interfering with accurate characterization of surgical risks and benefits. Such transient effects on daily performance may also contribute to significant functional compromise. We include a discussion of the manner in which IED effects during presurgical assessment can hinder individual patient presurgical planning as well as distort outcome research (e.g., IEDs occurring during presurgical assessment may lead to an underestimation of postoperative neuropsychological decline).

Nitrogen gas produces less behavioural and neurophysiological excitation than carbon dioxide in mice undergoing euthanasia	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FLOW-RATE; AVERSION; RATS; ANESTHESIA; CO2; STRESS; ARGON; PAIN; STIMULATION; ISOFLURANE	Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the most commonly used gas euthanasia agents in mice, despite reports of aversion and nociception. Inert gases such as nitrogen (N-2) may be a viable alternative to carbon dioxide. Here we compared behavioural and electrophysiological reactions to CO2 or N-2 at either slow fill or rapid fill in C57Bl/6 mice undergoing gas euthanasia. We found that mice euthanised with CO2 increased locomotor activity compared to baseline, whereas mice exposed to N-2 decreased locomotion. Furthermore, mice exposed to CO2 showed significantly more vertical jumps and freezing episodes than mice exposed to N-2. We further found that CO2 exposure resulted in increased theta: delta of the EEG, a measure of excitation, whereas the N-2 decreased theta: delta. Differences in responses were not oxygen-concentration dependent. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CO2 increases both behavioural and electrophysiological excitation as well as producing a fear response, whereas N-2 reduces behavioural activity and central neurological depression and may be less aversive although still produces a fear response. Further studies are required to evaluate N-2 as a suitable euthanasia agent for mice.

The system distinguishes between 'Normal' and 'Seizure' state using on-the-fly calculated features representing the statistical measures for specifically filtered signals from the raw data. It was noticed that for a large number of cases, the seizure waveforms manifest higher energy components during the seizure episodes as compared to the normal brain activity in specific bands of frequencies. Same is also true in the reverse fashion for a separate band of frequency that changes the energy levels from higher to lower when a patient goes from Normal to a Seizure state. This fact has been exploited in this paper and filter has been developed to isolate the seizure band. The rule base has been developed on the calculated measures for the filtered signal from this band-filter and classification is performed on the basis of certain empirical thresholds. Since the complexity of calculations have been deliberately kept quite low, the algorithm is highly suitable for implementation in a small micro-controller environment with near-real-time operation. This gives an enhanced advantage over the existing EEG based seizure detection systems due to their complex pattern classification methodologies. Based on the presented technique, a wearable ubiquitous system can be easily developed with applications in personal healthcare and clinical usage. In this case, the users are not necessarily restricted to the clinical environment in which many devices are connected to the patient externally. The wearable devices allow the user to continue daily activities while being monitored for seizure activities. Once seizure is detected, a number of possible usages can be employed such as alerting the user while driving/holding a baby etc.	[Shakir, Mohamed; Malik, Aamir Saeed; Kamel, Nidal] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Neurosignal Proc Grp, Ctr Intelligent Signal & Imaging Res, Perak, Malaysia; [Qidwai, Uvais] Qatar Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Doha, Qatar		Shakir, M (corresponding author), Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Neurosignal Proc Grp, Ctr Intelligent Signal & Imaging Res, Perak, Malaysia.

Etiologic diagnosis is important for providing information about pathogenesis, prognosis, recurrence risk and specific medical interventions. The aim of this study was to determine the etiologic yield and spectrum of a consecutive cohort of global developmentally delayed children. Methods: This retrospective study included all children younger than 5 years of age with global developmental delay referred to a single university-based ambulatory pediatric neurology clinic for initial evaluation over a 14-month period from January 1997. Diagnostic studies consisted of history, physical examination, electroencephalography and selected investigations including neuroimaging, screening for metabolic disease, karyotype and fragile X testing. Results: In the study 247 patients (136 males) with a mean age of 24.2 +/- 20.3 months were evaluated. Etiologic diagnosis was determined in 64 per cent of the patients classified under the following categories: perinatal complications (21 per cent), cerebral dysgenesis (18 per cent), chromosomal abnormalities (9 per cent), genetic/dysmorphic syndromes (3 per cent), metabolic disorders (4 per cent), hypothyroidism (4 per cent), neurocutaneous syndromes (3 per cent), intrauterine infection (2 per cent). Etiology was unknown in 36 per cent of the patients. Two laboratory tests (neuroimaging and cytogenetic analysis) together with the history and physical examination were most helpful in determining the etiologic diagnosis. Conclusion: This study suggests that optimal management of global developmentally delayed children and their family should involve a comprehensive evaluation.

Although the first observation of such phenomena dates back to Bravais who described postictal hemiparesis in 1827, this critical period of time after seizure offset has received little attention in the literature. In this article, we report some of the most important postictal signs, such as postictal hemiparesis, postictal nose wiping, postictal language dysfunction, postictal headache and postictal cognitive impairment. Summarizing our own experience of the postictal state in more than 160 patients with focal epilepsy, we conclude that postictal signs can provide reliable information for the localization of the seizure onset zone in patients with focal epilepsy. Since the lateralization and localization of the seizure onset zone has become a major issue for the presurgical evaluation of those patients, we argue that more attention should be paid to the postictal state during video EEG monitoring. Moreover, in an ambulatory setting, the postictal period and its related signs is usually the only part of an epileptic seizure that is accessible to the physician's examination and might therefore add some information to the differential diagnosis of paroxysmal events, such as epileptic or psychogenic seizures [published with videosequences].

Six untreated children (5 boys, 1 girl) with a mean (standard deviation) age of 9.1 years (1.5 years) underwent overnight ambulatory electroencephalograph recording and neuropsychologic evaluation at baseline and after 6 months of sulthiame monotherapy. The Reliable Change Index was used to determine whether a statistically reliable change in neuropsychologic function occurred. All children continued receiving sulthiame monotherapy (dose range, 8.0-9.3 mg/kg per day) for the Study period without further seizures. Although spike frequency was reduced in all 6 children (3 showing a decrease to less than 10% of baseline), they all demonstrated significant deterioration in their reading ability, 5 had significant declines in general memory, and more than half had reduction in attention skills and mathematics ability. Although sulthiame was effective at seizure control and significantly reduced spike frequency in children, it was also associated with deterioration in cognitive function.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) offers the advantage of portable equipment and could, therefore, be used for ambulatory modulation of brain excitability. However, modulation of cortical excitability by tDCS has so far mostly been shown by indirect measures. Therefore, we examined whether tDCS has a direct behavioral/perceptional effect. We compared tactile discrimination of vibratory stimuli to the left ring finger prior to, during and after tDCS applied for 7 min at 1-mA current intensity in 13 subjects. Stimulation was pseudorandomized into cathodal, anodal and sham conditions in a within-subject design. The active electrode was placed over the corresponding somatosensory cortex at C4 according to the 10-20 EEG system and the reference electrode at the forehead above the contralateral orbita. Cathodal stimulation compared with sham induced a prolonged decrease of tactile discrimination, while anodal and sham stimulation did not. Thus, cortical processing can be modulated in a behaviorally/perceptually meaningful way by weak transcranial current stimulation applied through portable technology. This finding offers a new perspective for the treatment of conditions characterized by alterations of cortical excitability.

Hardware-Efficient Robust Biometric Identification from 0.58 Second Template and 12 Features of Limb (Lead I) ECG Signal Using Logistic Regression Classifier	2014 36TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 26-30, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE Engn Medicine & Biol Soc				The electrocardiogram (ECG), widely known as a cardiac diagnostic signal, has recently been proposed for biometric identification of individuals; however reliability and reproducibility are of research interest. In this paper, we propose a template matching technique with 12 features using logistic regression classifier that achieved high reliability and identification accuracy. Non-invasive ECG signals were captured using our custom-built ambulatory EEG/ECG embedded device (NeuroMonitor). ECG data were collected from healthy subjects (10), between 25-35 years, for 10 seconds per trial. The number of trials from each subject was 10. From each trial, only 0.58 seconds of Lead I ECG data were used as template. Hardware-efficient fiducial point detection technique was implemented for feature extraction. To obtain repeated random sub-sampling validation, data were randomly separated into training and testing sets at a ratio of 80:20. Test data were used to find the classification accuracy. ECG template data with 12 extracted features provided the best performance in terms of accuracy (up to 100%) and processing complexity (computation time of 1.2ms). This work shows that a single limb (Lead I) ECG can robustly identify an individual quickly and reliably with minimal contact and data processing using the proposed algorithm.

Sleep loss and recovery after administration of drugs related to different arousal systems in rats	PHYSIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						delta homeostasis; freely moving rats; homeostatic sleep regulation; pharmacological sleep deprivation; recovery sleep; sleep rebound	EEG POWER-DENSITY; BEHAVING RATS; DEPRIVATION; RECEPTORS; DOPAMINE; NEURONS; BRAIN; FLUOXETINE; SEROTONIN; CORTEX	Sleep is homeostatically regulated suggesting a restorative function. Sleep deprivation is compensated by an increase in length and intensity of sleep. In this study, suppression of sleep was induced pharmacologically by drugs related to different arousal systems. All drugs caused non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep loss followed by different compensatory processes. Apomorphine caused a strong suppression of sleep followed by an intense recovery. In the case of fluoxetine and eserine, recovery of NREM sleep was completed by the end of the light phase due to the biphasic pattern demonstrated for these drugs first in the present experiments. Yohimbine caused a long-lasting suppression of NREM sleep, indicating that either the noradrenergic system has the utmost strength among the examined systems, or that restorative functions occurring normally during NREM sleep were not blocked. Arousal systems are involved in the regulation of various wakefulness-related functions, such as locomotion and food intake. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that activation of the different systems results in qualitatively different waking states which might affect subsequent sleep differently. These differences might give some insight into the homeostatic function of sleep in which the dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems may play a more important role than previously suggested.

In the present study, the NPY Y1 receptor antagonist BIBP3226 was administered alone or in combination with a moderate dose of ethanol to determine whether it interacted with the neurobehavioral effects of ethanol. Method: Male Wistar rats were implanted with cortical recording electrodes and a lateral ventricular cannula. The effects of 1 nmol BIBP3226, 0.75 g/kg ethanol and the combination (BIBP3226 + EtOH) on neurophysiological activity and locomotion were then assessed. Results: Ethanol significantly increased 1-2 Hz parietal cortical power and this effect was partially antagonized by BIBP3226. Peak frequencies in the parietal cortical 6-8 Hz and 8-16 Hz bands were also altered by ethanol, but these effects were not reversed by BIBP3226. BIBP3226 or ethanol, when administered alone, did not alter motor activity or cortical event-related potentials (ERPs) but administration of BIBP3226 + EtOH reduced motor activity, reduced parietal cortical N1 ERP amplitude and increased frontal cortical N1 ERP latency. Conclusions: In the present study, the most prominent effect of antagonizing central NPY Y1 receptors was a facilitation of the effects of ethanol. In particular, the effects of combined administration of BIBP3226 and ethanol are indicative of enhanced sedation and possibly cognitive impairment.

Long-Term Training with a Brain-Machine Interface-Based Gait Protocol Induces Partial Neurological Recovery in Paraplegic Patients	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; RANDOMIZED CLINICAL-TRIAL; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; COMPUTER INTERFACE; MOTOR FUNCTION; BODY SCHEMA; WALKING; SCALE; HAND; PAIN	Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) provide a new assistive strategy aimed at restoring mobility in severely paralyzed patients. Yet, no study in animals or in human subjects has indicated that long-term BMI training could induce any type of clinical recovery. Eight chronic (3-13 years) spinal cord injury (SCI) paraplegics were subjected to long-term training (12 months) with a multi-stage BMI-based gait neurorehabilitation paradigm aimed at restoring locomotion. This paradigm combined intense immersive virtual reality training, enriched visual-tactile feedback, and walking with two EEG-controlled robotic actuators, including a custom-designed lower limb exoskeleton capable of delivering tactile feedback to subjects. Following 12 months of training with this paradigm, all eight patients experienced neurological improvements in somatic sensation (pain localization, fine/crude touch, and proprioceptive sensing) in multiple dermatomes. Patients also regained voluntary motor control in key muscles below the SCI level, as measured by EMGs, resulting in marked improvement in their walking index. As a result, 50% of these patients were upgraded to an incomplete paraplegia classification. Neurological recovery was paralleled by the reemergence of lower limb motor imagery at cortical level. We hypothesize that this unprecedented neurological recovery results from both cortical and spinal cord plasticity triggered by long-term BMI usage.	[Donati, Ana R.

J	McKenna, JT; Vertes, RP				McKenna, JT; Vertes, RP			Collateral projections from the median raphe nucleus to the medial septum and hippocampus	BRAIN RESEARCH BULLETIN			English	Article						dentate gyrus; brainstem; serotonin; memory; locomotion	FREELY MOVING RAT; THETA-RHYTHM; MIDBRAIN RAPHE; ASCENDING PROJECTIONS; LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY; CONTAINING NEURONS; AUTORADIOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS; INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY; RETICULAR-FORMATION; SEROTONIN NEURONS	It has previously been shown that the median raphe nucleus (MR) is a source of pronounced projections to the septum and hippocampus. The present study examined collateral projections from MR to the medial septum (MS) and to various regions of the hippocampus. The fluorescent retrograde tracers, Fluororuby and Fluorogold, were injected into the septum and hippocampus, respectively, and the median raphe nucleus was examined for the presence of single- and double-labeled neurons. The dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) was also examined for the presence of single- and double-labeled cells and comparisons were made with the MR. The main findings were: (1) pronounced numbers of retrogradely labeled cells (approximately 50 cells/section) were present in MR with injections in the MS or in various regions of the hippocampus; (2) approximately 8-12% of MR cells were double-labeled following paired injections in the MS-CA1, MS-CA3, and MS-dentate gyrus of the dorsal hippocampus, the lateral MS-dentate gyrus, and the MS-ventral hippocampus; (3) single- and double-labeled cells were intermingled throughout MR and present in greater numbers in the rostral than caudal MR; and (4) significantly more single- and double-labeled cells were present in MR than in DR with all combinations of injections. These findings demonstrate that MR projects strongly to the MS and hippocampus, and that a significant population of MR neurons (8-12%) sends collateral projections to both sites. It is well established that the MR nucleus serves a direct role in the desynchronization of the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity of the hippocampus-or the blockade of the hippocampal theta rhythm. The MR neurons that we have identified with collateral projections to the septum and hippocampus may be critically involved in the modulation/control of the hippocampal EEG. A role for the MR in memory associated functions of the hippocampus is discussed. (C) 2001. Elsevier Science Inc.

Bilateral temporal lobe epilepsy: How many seizures are required in chronic ambulatory electrocorticography to estimate the laterality ratio?	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						chronic electrocorticography; ECoG; epilepsy surgery; responsive neurostimulation; video-EEG	LOBECTOMY	Objective This study was undertaken to measure the duration of chronic electrocorticography (ECoG) needed to attain stable estimates of the seizure laterality ratio in patients with drug-resistant bilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (BTLE). Methods We studied 13 patients with drug-resistant BTLE who were implanted for at least 1 year with a responsive neurostimulation device (RNS System) that provides chronic ambulatory ECoG. Bootstrap analysis and nonlinear regression were applied to model the relationship between chronic ECoG duration and the probability of capturing at least one seizure. Laterality of electrographic seizures in chronic ECoG was compared with the seizure laterality ratio from Phase 1 scalp video-electroencephalographic (vEEG) monitoring. The Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to evaluate time to seizure laterality ratio convergence. Results Seizure laterality ratios from Phase 1 scalp vEEG monitoring correlated poorly with those from RNS chronic ECoG (r = .31, p = .30). Across the 13 patients, average electrographic seizure frequencies ranged from 1.4 seizures/month to 5.1 seizures/day. A 50% probability of recording at least one electrographic seizure required 9.1 days of chronic ECoG, and 90% probability required 44.3 days of chronic ECoG. A median recording duration of 150.9 days (5 months), corresponding to a median of 16 seizures, was needed before confidence intervals for the seizure laterality ratio reliably contained the long-term value. The median recording duration before the point estimate of the seizure laterality ratio converged to a stationary value was 236.8 days (7.9 months). Significance RNS chronic ECoG overcomes temporal sampling limitations intrinsic to inpatient Phase 1 vEEG evaluations. In patients with drug-resistant BTLE, approximately 8 months of chronic RNS ECoG are needed to precisely estimate the seizure laterality ratio, with 75% of people with BTLE achieving convergence after 1 year of RNS recording. For individuals who are candidates for unilateral resection based on seizure laterality, optimized recording duration may help avert morbidity associated with delay to definitive treatment.

Such an environment dramatically increases the likelihood of artifacts which can occlude features of interest and reduce the quality of information available in the signal. If multichannel recordings are available for a given signal source, then there are currently a considerable range of methods which can suppress or in some cases remove the distorting effect of such artifacts. There are, however, considerably fewer techniques available if only a single-channel measurement is available and yet single-channel measurements are important where minimal instrumentation complexity is required. This paper describes a novel artifact removal technique for use in such a context. The technique known as ensemble empirical mode decomposition with canonical correlation analysis (EEMD-CCA) is capable of operating on single-channel measurements. The EEMD technique is first used to decompose the single-channel signal into a multidimensional signal. The CCA technique is then employed to isolate the artifact components from the underlying signal using second-order statistics. The new technique is tested against the currently available wavelet denoising and EEMD-ICA techniques using both electroencephalography and functional near-infrared spectroscopy data and is shown to produce significantly improved results.

The preparatory activity in the motor cortex to the perturbation associated with obstacle avoidance movements with cognitive task is still unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the motor cortical activity involved in the preparation and execution of concurrent obstacle avoidance movement and cognitive task. Twenty young adults were required to step over obstacles that were projected on the floor while performing a cognitive task. The electroencephalogram was recorded, and the movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP) aligned by foot dorsiflexion were evaluated. There was no significant difference in the number of contacts between the toe and the obstacle between the obstacle avoidance task and obstacle avoidance with cognitive task; however, the distance between the toe and the obstacle just before obstacle avoidance movement was significantly extended in the latter task. The amplitude and the onset of MRCP during the dual task were decreased and delayed, respectively, compared with the simple obstacle avoidance movement task. These results suggest that the young participants changed their clearance strategy to stepping over the obstacle during the concurrent motor and cognitive dual task to reduce motor cortical activity.

EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Review						Seizure detection	SUDDEN UNEXPECTED DEATH; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; LONG-TERM; STATUS EPILEPTICUS; ACCELEROMETRY; FREQUENCY; PEOPLE; SYSTEM; EPIDEMIOLOGY; CONVULSIONS	Objective: This study aimed to (1) evaluate available systems and algorithms for ambulatory automatic seizure detection and (2) discuss benefits and disadvantages of seizure detection in epilepsy care. Methods: PubMed and EMBASE were searched up to November 2014, using variations and synonyms of search terms "seizure prediction" OR "seizure detection" OR "seizures" AND "alarm". Results: Seventeen studies evaluated performance of devices and algorithms to detect seizures in a clinical setting. Algorithms detecting generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs) had varying sensitivities (11% to 100%) and false alarm rates (0.2-4/24 h). For other seizure types, detection rates were low, or devices produced many false alarms. Five studies externally validated the performance of four different devices for the detection of GTCSs. Two devices were promising in both children and adults: a mattress-based nocturnal seizure detector (sensitivity: 84.6% and 100%; false alarm rate: not reported) and a wrist-based detector (sensitivity: 89.7%; false alarm rare: 0.2/24 h). Significance: Detection of seizure types other than GTCSs is currently unreliable. Two detection devices for GTCSs provided promising results when externally validated in a clinical selling. However, these devices need Lo be evaluated in the home setting in order lo establish their Lrue value. Automatic seizure detection may help prevent sudden unexpected death in epilepsy or status epileplicus, provided the alarm is followed by an effective intervention. Accurate seizure detection may improve the quality of life (QoL) of subjects and caregivers by decreasing burden of seizure monitoring and may facilitate diagnostic monitoring in the home setting. Possible risks are occurrence of alarm fatigue and invasion of privacy. Moreover, an unexpectedly high seizure frequency might be detected for which there are no treatment options. We propose that future studies monitor benefits and disadvantages of seizure detection systems with particular emphasis on QoL, comfort, and privacy of subjects and impact of false alarms.

Neuroimaging of Mobility in Aging: A Targeted Review	JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES A-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						Cognition; Neuroimaging; Gait; Balance; Brain aging	WHITE-MATTER HYPERINTENSITIES; NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; FUNCTIONING OLDER-ADULTS; STRIATAL DOPAMINERGIC DENERVATION; NORMAL-PRESSURE HYDROCEPHALUS; CORPUS-CALLOSUM ATROPHY; SMALL VESSEL DISEASE; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; GAIT SPEED; WALKING SPEED	Background. The relationship between mobility and cognition in aging is well established, but the relationship between mobility and the structure and function of the aging brain is relatively unknown. This, in part, is attributed to the technological limitations of most neuroimaging procedures, which require the individual to be immobile or in a supine position. Herein, we provide a targeted review of neuroimaging studies of mobility in aging to promote (i) a better understanding of this relationship, (ii) future research in this area, and (iii) development of applications for improving mobility. Methods. A systematic search of peer-reviewed studies was performed using PubMed. Search terms included (i) aging, older adults, or elderly; (ii) gait, walking, balance, or mobility; and (iii) magnetic resonance imaging, voxel-based morphometry, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, diffusion tensor imaging, positron emission tomography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, event-related potential, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Results. Poor mobility outcomes were reliably associated with reduced gray and white matter volume. Fewer studies examined the relationship between changes in task-related brain activation and mobility performance. Extant findings, however, showed that activation patterns in the cerebellum, basal ganglia, parietal and frontal cortices were related to mobility. Increased involvement of the prefrontal cortex was evident in both imagined walking conditions and conditions where the cognitive demands of locomotion were increased. Conclusions. Cortical control of gait in aging is bilateral, widespread, and dependent on the integrity of both gray and white matter.

Methods: A randomized, open-label parallel-group design was used. After undergoing an awake video-EEG recording, which included one to two trials of 3 min of hyperventilation and intermittent photic stimulation, eligible patients were randomized to receive LTG or VPA. LTG was initiated at a daily dose of 0.5 mg/kg for 2 weeks in two divided doses, followed by 1.0 mg/kg/day for an additional 2 weeks. Thereafter, doses were increased in 1-mg/kg/day increments every 5 days until seizures were controlled, intolerable adverse effects occurred, or a maximum dose of 12 mg/kg/day had been reached. VPA was equally uptitrated according to clinical response, starting at 10 mg/kg and increasing by 5 mg/kg/24 h every 3 days, if required, to a maximum of 30 mg/kg/day in three divided doses. Patients were seen in the clinic every month for less than or equal to12 months. The primary efficacy end point at each visit was seizure freedom, defined as lack of clinically observed seizures since the previous visit and lack of electroclinical seizures during ambulatory 24-h EEG testing and a video-EEG session with hyperventilation. Results: Thirty-eight children (17 boys, 21 girls), aged from 3 to 13 years (mean, 7.5 years), all newly diagnosed with childhood or juvenile typical absence seizures, were enrolled. After I month of treatment, 10 (52.6%) of 19 children taking VPA and one (5.3%) of 19 taking LTG were seizure free (p = 0.004). By the 3-month follow-up, 12 (63.1%) children taking VPA and seven (36.8%) taking LTG were controlled (p = 0.19). After 12 months, 13 children taking VPA (dose range, 20-30 mg/kg/day; mean serum level, 76.8 mg/L; range, 51.4-91 mg/L) and 10 taking LTG (dose range, 2-11 mg/kg/day; mean serum level, 8.1 mg/L; range, 1.1-18 mg/L) were seizure free (p = 0.51). Side effects were mostly mild and transient and were recorded in two (10.6%) children treated with VPA and in six (31.8%) treated with LTG. Conclusions: Both VPA and LTG can be efficacious against absence seizures, although VPA shows a much faster onset of action, at least in part because of its shorter titration schedule.

It has been proposed, but with limited in-depth investigation so far, that similar decision-making mechanisms are involved in tasks of a more embodied nature, such as movement and locomotion, by directly accumulating externally measurable sensory quantities of which the precise, typically continuously time-varying, magnitudes are important for successful behavior. Here, we leverage collision threat detection as a task which is ecologically relevant in this sense, but which can also be rigorously observed and modelled in a laboratory setting. Conventionally, it is assumed that humans are limited in this task by a perceptual threshold on the optical expansion rate-the visual looming-of the obstacle. Using concurrent recordings of EEG and behavioral responses, we disprove this conventional assumption, and instead provide strong evidence that humans detect collision threats by accumulating the continuously time-varying visual looming signal. Generalizing existing accumulator model assumptions from stationary to time-varying sensory evidence, we show that our model accounts for previously unexplained empirical observations and full distributions of detection response. We replicate a pre-response centroparietal positivity (CPP) in scalp potentials, which has previously been found to correlate with accumulated decision evidence. In contrast with these existing findings, we show that our model is capable of predicting the onset of the CPP signature rather than its buildup, suggesting that neural evidence accumulation is implemented differently, possibly in distinct brain regions, in collision detection compared to previously studied paradigms. Author summary Evidence accumulation models of decision-making propose that humans accumulate noisy sensory evidence over time up to a decision threshold. We demonstrate that this type of model can describe human behavior well not only in abstract, semi-static laboratory tasks, but also in a task that is relevant to human movement in the real world. Specifically, we show that a model directly accumulating the continuously time-varying visual looming (optical expansion) of an approaching obstacle explains full probability distributions of when humans can detect this collision threat. Using electroencephalography, we find indications that this type of evidence is accumulated differently in the brain compared to evidence accumulation in previously studied, more abstract tasks. Our experimental paradigm, model, and findings open for wider application of this type of decision-making model to laboratory and real-world tasks with ecologically relevant, time-varying sensory evidence, and further studies into how such decisions are implemented neurally. There are also societal implications: In applied safety research and traffic accident litigation it is conventionally assumed that human collision detection is limited by a fixed perceptual threshold, an assumption that our results show to be highly inaccurate.

It remains unclear whether sleep disturbances are transient post-stroke or are potentially enduring sequelae in chronic stroke. Here, we characterize sleep architectural dysfunction, sleep-respiratory parameters, and hemispheric sleep in ischemic stroke patients in the chronic recovery phase compared to healthy controls. Patients/methods: Radiologically confirmed ischemic stroke patients (n = 28) and matched control participants (n = 16) were tested with ambulatory polysomnography, bi-hemispheric sleep EEG, and demographic, stroke-severity, mood, and sleep-circadian questionnaires. Results: Twenty-eight stroke patients (22 men; mean age = 69.61 +/- 7.4 years) were cross-sectionally evaluated 4.1 +/- 0.9 years after mild-moderate ischemic stroke (baseline NIHSS: 3.0 +/- 2.0). Fifty-seven percent of stroke patients (n = 16) exhibited undiagnosed moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index >15). Despite no difference in total sleep or wake after sleep onset, stroke patients had reduced slow-wave sleep time (66.25 min vs 99.26 min, p = 0.02), increased time in non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) stages 1-2 (NREM-1: 48.43 vs 28.95, p = 0.03; NREM-2: 142.61 vs 115.87, p = 0.02), and a higher arousal index (21.46 vs 14.43, p = 0.03) when compared to controls. Controlling for sleep apnea severity did not attenuate the magnitude of sleep architectural differences between groups (NREM 1-3=eta p2 >0.07). We observed no differences in ipsilesionally versus contralesionally scored sleep architecture. Conclusions: Fifty-seven percent of chronic stroke patients had undiagnosed moderate-severe obstructive sleep apnea and reduced slow-wave sleep with potentially compensatory increases in NREM 1-2 sleep relative to controls. Formal sleep studies are warranted after stroke, even in the absence of self-reported history of sleep-wake pathology. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Multimodal wrist-worn devices for seizure detection and advancing research: Focus on the Empatica wristbands	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						Epilepsy; Convulsive seizures; Wearable device; SUDEP; Electrodermal activity; Machine learning	TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURES; ACCELEROMETER	Wearable automated seizure detection devices offer a high potential to improve seizure management, through continuous ambulatory monitoring, accurate seizure counts, and real-time alerts for prompt intervention. More importantly, these devices can be a life-saving help for people with a higher risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), especially in case of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). The Embrace and E4 wristbands (Empatica) are the first commercially available multimodal wristbands that were designed to sense the physiological hallmarks of ongoing GTCS: while Embrace only embeds a machine learning-based detection algorithm, both E4 and Embrace devices are equipped with motion (accelerometers, ACC) and electrodermal activity (EDA) sensors and both the devices received medical clearance (E4 from EU CE, Embrace from EU CE and US FDA). The aim of this contribution is to provide updated evidence of the effectiveness of GTCS detection and monitoring relying on the combination of ACM and EDA sensors. A machine learning algorithm able to recognize ACC and EDA signatures of GTCS-like events has been developed on E4 data, labeled using gold-standard video-EEG examined by epileptologists in clinical centers, and has undergone continuous improvement. While keeping an elevated sensitivity to GTCS (92-100%), algorithm improvements and growing data availability led to lower false alarm rate (FAR) from the initial (similar to)2 down to 0.2-1 false alarms per day, as showed by retrospective and prospective analyses in inpatient settings. Algorithm adjustment to better discriminate real-life physical activities from GTCS, has brought the initial FAR of (similar to)6 on outpatient real life settings, down to values comparable to best-case clinical settings (FAR < 0.5), with comparable sensitivity. Moreover, using multimodal sensing, it has been possible not only to detect GTCS but also to quantify seizure-induced autonomic dysfunction, based on automatic features of abnormal motion and EDA. The latter biosignal correlates with the duration of post-ictal generalized EEG suppression, a biomarker observed in 100% of monitored SUDEP cases.

MOVEMENT DISORDERS			English	Article						RLS; animal; MSH; ACTH; hormone	PERIODIC LIMB MOVEMENTS; GENERAL-POPULATION; IRON DEPRIVATION; SPINAL-CORD; SLEEP; RATS; DOPAMINE; PLASMA; MELANOCORTINS; ACTH	alpha-Melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) and adrenocorticotropic, hormone (ACTH) possess properties suggesting that they may be involved in the pathogenesis of restless legs syndrome (RLS). We sought to determine if alpha-MSH and ACTH when administered centrally in rat recapitulate features reminiscent of RLS: increased activity, sleep fragmentation, and periodic movements during sleep. Rats were instrumented with electroencephalography, electromyography, and intracerebral cannulae and recorded for the measurement of sleep, periodic movements, and behavior following intracerebroventricular administration of alpha-MSH, ACTH, or saline. Studied behavior included grooming, locomotion, and rearing during wake and limb movements during sleep. Vigilance states included active wake (AW), quiet wake (QW), slow wave sleep I (SWSI), slow wave sleep II (SWSII), and paradoxical sleep (PS). All rats received normal saline acting as their own controls. Different rats received alpha-MSH in doses of 0.05, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 6.0 mu g or ACTH in doses of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mu g. Administered alpha-MSH caused an increase in waking behavior and prolongation of sleep latency, while ACTH stimulated waking behavior and fragmented sleep, yielding more AW and less SWSII and PS. Both hormones increased periodic movements during sleep. When administered centrally in rat, alpha-MSH and ACTH stimulate motor activity in wake, cause changes in sleep architecture, and increase periodic movements in sleep. These melanocortin hormones may play a role in the pathogenesis of RLS. (C) 2008 Movement Disorder Society.

J	Hallbook, T; Kohler, S; Rosen, I; Lundgren, J				Hallbook, Tove; Kohler, Sven; Rosen, Ingmar; Lundgren, Johan			Effects of ketogenic diet on epileptiform activity in children with therapy resistant epilepsy	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						epilepsy; ketogenic diet; EEG; epileptiform activity; spike detection; children	CALORIE RESTRICTION; SPIKE DETECTION; DEFICIENCY; SEIZURES; SLEEP; EXCITABILITY; EFFICACY; BEHAVIOR; ELEVATE	Purpose: The purpose was to quantify changes of epileptiform activity during ketogenic diet (0) treatment in children with therapy resistant epilepsy, and evaluate how these changes are related to activity stage and to clinical effects on seizure frequency, seizure severity, attentional behaviour, quality of life (QOL), and beta - hyd roxybutyrate (beta OHb). Methods: Eighteen children were investigated with 24h ambulatory EEG monitoring I week prior to KD initiation and, after 3 months of KD treatment. Epileptiform activity was evaluated by automated spike detection. This data was compared with data presented in a previous study published in Epilepsia 2006, on steep structure and different activity stages, clinical data on seizure frequency, seizure severity, QOL and attentional behaviour on the same children [Hallbook, T., Lundgren, J., Rosen, I., 2007. Ketogenic diet improves steep quality in children with therapy resistant epilepsy. Epilepsia 48, 59-65]. Results: After 3 months of KD treatment the number of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) was significantly reduced (p < 0.001). When considering the four activity stages separately, the reduction was significant during non-rapid eye movement steep stage 2, slow wave steep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) steep (p=0.001, 0.001, 0.002), and not significantly so during awake (p=0.07). Beta- hyd roxybutyrate was significantly increased (p<0.001). There was a significant correlation between the reduction in IEDs and clinical seizures (Spearman r=0.6, p=0.005) and between improvement in attentional behaviour and the increase in beta OHb (Spearman r=0.5, p=0.03). There was no significant correlation between changes in attentional behaviour and IEDs or clinical seizures. Conclusion: This study shows that KD reduces the number of IEDs, especially during steep. It shows a correlation between reduction in epileptiform activity and clinical seizures. There were no correlations between reduction in epileptiform activity and clinical seizures and improvement in QOL or attention. The increase in POHb correlated with improvement in attention.

A number of studies have examined the possibility that seizure activity respects a power-law relationship, both in terms of event magnitude and inter-event intervals. Such relationships are found in a variety of natural and man-made systems, such as earthquakes or Internet traffic, and describe the relationship between the magnitude of an event and the number of events. We postulated that human inter-seizure intervals would follow a power-law relationship, and furthermore that evidence for the existence of a long-memory process could be established in this relationship. We performed a post hoc analysis, studying eight patients who had long-term (up to 2 years) ambulatory intracranial EEG data recorded as part of the assessment of a novel seizure prediction device. We demonstrated that a power-law relationship could be established in these patients (beta = 1.5). In five out of the six subjects whose data were sufficiently stationary for analysis, we found evidence of long memory between epileptic events. This memory spans time scales from 30 min to 40 days. The estimated Hurst exponents range from 0.51 to 0.77 +/- 0.01.This finding may provide evidence of phase-transitions underlying the dynamics of epilepsy.

J	Sinnamon, HM; Jassen, AK; Ilch, C				Sinnamon, HM; Jassen, AK; Ilch, C			Hippocampal theta activity and facilitated locomotor stepping produced by GABA injections in the midbrain raphe region	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						locomotion; hippocampal theta activity; median raphe; GABA	ANESTHETIZED RAT; HYPOTHALAMIC-STIMULATION; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; RHYTHM; BEHAVIOR; NUCLEUS; MODULATION; WAVE; AREAS; EEG	Inactivation of neurons in the midbrain raphe region produces increases in locomotor activity, and it appears that they function to suppress locomotion. Inactivation of neurons there also produces hippocampal slow wave (theta) activity and it appears that they also function to inhibit rhythmic activity in the hippocampus. We determined whether the degree of association between the two effects was consistent with the operation of a single mechanism. Stimulation electrodes were implanted into locomotor sites of the hypothalamus of 34 urethane-anesthetized rats. Hindlimb stepping was elicited by 5.12-s trains of perifornical electrical stimulation presented once per minute. Hippocampal theta activity was recorded across the CA1 layer of the dorsal hippocampus. GABA injections were used to locate raphe sites at which neuronal inactivation influenced stepping and hippocampal activity. A glass pipette (80-mu m tip) was inserted into the midbrain, and injections of GABA (50-100 mg/0.1-0.2 mu l) were made in 70 sites in the midbrain. Injections at 34 sites facilitated stimulation-elicited stepping, and at 17 sites, they also produced intertrial stepping. Facilitating injections, but not ineffective or suppressive injections, increased the mean peak frequency of hippocampal activity, and increased power in the 4-5 Hz band during the period that preceded the stimulation trains, but did not change the 5-6 Hz activity produced during the stimulation trains. Priming locomotor stimulation which also facilitated stepping produced generally similar increases in pre-stimulation peak frequency and 4-Hz power. The magnitudes of the increases in stepping and 4-Hz power were uncorrelated. The increase in 4-Hz power appeared earlier than the increase in stepping in 18 of 34 cases, and later in 11 cases; no increases in 4-Hz power were apparent in five cases. The results indicate that pre-locomotor 4-Hz hippocampal activity in the urethane-anesthetized rat is loosely coupled with facilitated locomotor initiation. Neurons in the midbrain raphe region appear to suppress both processes, but the low degree of association between the magnitudes and onset limes of increases in stepping and hippocampal 4-Hz power indicate the operation of multiple mechanisms.

Design: Healthy, prepubertal children (n = 63; mean age 9.56 +/- 0.76 y); ambulatory all-night polysomnography (2 nights); investigating the effect of prior learning (word pair association task; experimental night) versus nonlearning (baseline night) on sleep spindle activity; general cognitive abilities assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV (WISC-IV). Measurements and Results: Analysis of spindle activity during nonrapid eye movement sleep (N2 and N3) evidenced predominant peaks in the slow (11-13 Hz) but not in the fast (13-15 Hz) sleep spindle frequency range (baseline and experimental night). Analyses were restricted to slow sleep spindles. Changes in spindle activity from the baseline to the experimental night were not associated with the overnight change in the number of recalled words reflecting declarative memory consolidation. Children with higher sleep spindle activity as measured at frontal, central, parietal, and occipital sites during both baseline and experimental nights exhibited higher general cognitive abilities (WISC-IV) and declarative learning efficiency (i.e., number of recalled words before and after sleep). Conclusions: Slow sleep spindles (11-13 Hz) in children age 8-11 y are associated with inter-individual differences in general cognitive abilities and learning efficiency.

We developed a small, neck-based, wireless accelerometer system for measuring the sleep and lying time of calves. We collected data from 10 dairy calves and developed a model based on wavelet analysis with a support vector machine classifier for measuring sleep and lying time and were able to record sleep and lying time accurately. For total sleeping time the model was able to distinguish (mean +/- SE) 90 +/- 3% and 85 +/- 4% of the sleeping bouts, and 82 +/- 2% of the occurrence of sleep. Correspondingly, the model distinguished 66 +/- 8% and 70 +/- 6% of the total time for NREM and REM sleep. 70 +/- 6% of the NREM sleep bout lengths and 80 +/- 5% of the REM sleep bouts were predicted. The numbers for NREM and REM bouts were 77 +/- 5% and 79 +/- 4%. respectively. The model correctly predicted 96 +/- 1% of total lying time. 79 +/- 6% of lying bout durations, and 77 +/- 7% of the occurrence of lying bouts. The device provides a method to measure sleep and lying time in calves continuously in a production environment without disturbing the animals. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Healthcare utilization and cost outcomes for a multicenter first seizure and new onset epilepsy clinic	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Epilepsy; Seizures; Cost analysis; Medical care; Healthcare utilization; Follow-up	RECURRENCE; RISK	Rationale: A First Seizure/New Onset Epilepsy (FS/NOE) protocol was implemented to ensure proper evaluation by an epileptologist and improve overall care for patients. We compared healthcare utilization and cost incurred by patients pre and post protocol implementation. Methods: Clinical data were retrospectively collected from the EMR and cost data from the financial database. Patients were identified by FS event and grouped into either the pre-implementation (pre-FSC) or post-implementation cohort (post-FSC). Pre-FSC patients were seen between January 2014-December 2015 and post-FSC between March 2016-January 2018. Utilization outcomes include time from FS to neurology appointment, MRI, and electroencephalogram (EEG). Cost outcomes included the annualized median difference in pre versus post costs for ER, inpatient, outpatient or ambulatory, and total hospital services. Cost and utilization outcomes were collected within 90 days or 6 months post first-seizure event. Pre and post cohorts were compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard models for time-to-event outcomes, multivariable median regression models for cost differences and negative binomial regression models for utilization analyses. Models were adjusted for age, sex, health insurance, and comorbidities. Results: One-hundred and fifty six patients were included with 84 (53.8%) pre-and 72 (46.2%) post-FSC patients. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression results indicated post-FSC patients had significantly faster time-to-first neurology appointment (5.0 vs. 20.9 days, p <.001; Adjusted Hazard Ratio (HR) = 5.98, p < .001), time-to-MRI (9.0 vs. 27.0 days; p = 0.005; HR =1.88, p = .021) and EEG (3.6 vs. 48.6 days, p <.001; HR = 9.01, p < .001). A total of 138 patients had at least one cost in the financial database. For 6-month follow-up period, post-FSC patients had higher adjusted all-cause total median costs (+$830, p = 0.009) and outpatient costs (+$1203, p <.001) but lower ED costs (-245, p = 0.073), not significant. Results were similar for seizure-related costs. Similarly, Post-FSC patients had a significantly higher likelihood of all-cause (Adjusted Rate Ratio (ARR) =1.41, p = .029) and outpatient utilization (ARR = 1.72, p = .008) but lower ED utilization (ARR = 0.54, p < .001). Conclusions: Implementation of the FSC decreased time to evaluation by a neurologist and time to diagnostic workup. Ultimately, total healthcare costs and ambulatory costs increased but ED costs and utilization were reduced. It is our hypothesis that faster access to initial care and diagnosis would result in better control of seizures and reduce long-term costs and utilization. Further research over a longer duration of time across a broader population is needed to evaluate the full implications of an epilepsy specialist-populated FSC. (c) 2021 The Authors.

Methods: Thirteen patients affected by focal epilepsy were recruited to undergo a 24-hour ambulatory polysomnography, Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), and a subjective evaluation of nocturnal sleep by means of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and daytime somnolence by means of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) before and after 3 months of treatment with ZNS as add-on therapy. Results: Twelve patients completed the study. Zonisamide therapy reduced seizures by >50% in 8 out of 12 patients. Zonisamide did not induce any significant changes in nocturnal polysomnographic variables and in PSQI scores. In addition, mean sleep latency and ESS score were unmodified after treatment. Conclusion: Zonisamide seems to be effective and safe in focal epilepsy. Both subjective and objective sleep parameters showed no detrimental effects on nocturnal sleep and daytime somnolence in patients with focal epilepsy using ZNS. Since some AEDs induce sleep impairment, which is known to trigger EEG abnormalities and seizures and to worsen quality of life, our findings suggest a positive profile of ZNS. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

High blood pressure has deleterious consequences on the main target organs (heart, kidney, brain), and several studies have shown that brain damage is more frequent than heart and kidney involvement. Silent lesions can subsequently lead to cognitive decline, dementia or stroke. Nevertheless, screening for subclinical brain deterioration is rarely performed because it requires imaging techniques whose scarcity and high cost rule out routine use by primary care physicians. The challenge is thus early detection of asymptomatic brain lesions with cost-effective techniques to test thousands of patients in the community. In this review we present an update on the status of biomarkers explored as alternatives for early detection of brain damage in arterial hypertension, potentially useful to identify patients needing referrals for brain MRI: ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, quantitative retinal microvascular assessment, quantitative electroencephalography, carotid ultrasonography, neurocognitive studies and blood-based biomarkers. We place special emphasis on blood-based biomarkers, for which our group reported the first preliminary evidence of an association between serum neuron-specific enolase and severity of white matter lesions in patients with essential hypertension. This review consequently explores the potential for blood-based biomarkers to provide a faster, cheaper and more accessible early-detection solution, particularly beneficial in resource-limited settings such as Cuba's.

Previous research shows that nocturnal parasympathetic activity (reflected by heart rate variability [HRV]) is diminished in individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), suggesting hypervigilant sleep. This study investigated differences in nocturnal autonomic activity across sleep stages and explored the association of parasympathetic activity with sleep quality and self-reported physical and psychological wellbeing in individuals with CFS. Methods: Twenty-four patients with medically diagnosed CFS, and 24 matched healthy control individuals participated. Electroencephalography and HRV were recorded during sleep in participants' homes using a minimally invasive ambulatory device. Questionnaires were used to measure self-reported wellbeing and sleep quality. Results: Sleep architecture in patients with CFS differed from that of control participants in slower sleep onset, more awakenings, and a larger proportion of time spent in slow-wave sleep (SWS). Linear mixed-model analyses controlling for age revealed that HRV reflecting parasympathetic activity (normalized high frequency power) was reduced in patients with CFS compared to control participants, particularly during deeper stages of sleep. Poorer self-reported wellbeing and sleep quality was associated with reduced parasympathetic signaling during deeper sleep, but not during wake before sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, or with the proportion of time spent in SWS. Conclusions: Autonomic hypervigilance during the deeper, recuperative stages of sleep is associated with poor quality sleep and self-reported wellbeing. Causal links need to be confirmed but provide potential intervention opportunities for the core symptom of unrefreshing sleep in CFS.

Perspective: Assessing the Flexible Acquisition, Integration, and Deployment of Human Spatial Representations and Information	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						spatial representations; spatial information; navigation; egocentric; allocentric; virtual reality; relative vector discrimination (RVD) task	THETA OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY RETRIEVAL; REFERENCE FRAMES; VIRTUAL-REALITY; HUMAN BRAIN; NAVIGATION; ENVIRONMENTS; LOCOMOTION; ROLES; DIRECTION	Studying human spatial navigation in the lab can be challenging, particularly when including non-invasive neural measures like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and scalp encephalography (EEG). While there is broad consensus that human spatial navigation involves both egocentric (self-referenced) and allocentric (world-referenced) coding schemes, exactly how these can be measured in ecologically meaningful situations remains controversial. Here, we explore these two forms of representation and how we might better measure them by reviewing commonly used spatial memory tasks and proposing a new task: the relative vector discrimination (RVD) task. Additionally, we explore how different encoding modalities (desktop virtual reality, immersive virtual reality, maps, and real-world navigation) might alter how egocentric and allocentric representations manifest. Specifically, we discuss desktop virtual reality vs. more immersive forms of navigation that better approximate real-world situations, and the extent to which less immersive encoding modalities alter neural and cognitive codes engaged during navigation more generally. We conclude that while encoding modality likely alters navigation-related codes to some degree, including egocentric and allocentric representations, it does not fundamentally change the underlying representations. Considering these arguments together, we suggest that tools to study human navigation in the lab, such as desktop virtual reality, provide overall a reasonable approximation of in vivo navigation, with some caveats.

Medium- and long-term functional behavior evaluations in an experimental focal ischemic stroke mouse model	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						Locomotor activity; Motor deficit; Sensory deficit; Neuroscience; Stroke	RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; MIDDLE CEREBRAL-ARTERY; POSTSTROKE DEPRESSION; ANIMAL-MODELS; RESTING EEG; OCCLUSION; DISEASE; OSCILLATIONS; IMPAIRMENT; PREVALENCE	Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide, as well as a major financial burden for health care systems. CVA rodent models provide experimental support to determine possible in vivo therapies to reduce brain injury and consequent sequelae. This study analyzed nociceptive, motor, cognitive and mood functions in mice submitted to distal middle cerebral artery (DMCA) occlusion. Male C57BL mice (n = 8) were randomly allocated to control or DMCA groups. Motor function was evaluated with the tests: grip force, rotarod and open field; and nociceptive threshold with von Frey and hot plate assessments. Cognitive function was evaluated with the inhibitory avoidance test, and mood with the tail suspension test. Evaluations were conducted on the seventh- and twenty-eighth-day post DMCA occlusion to assess medium- and long-term effects of the injury, respectively. DMCA occlusion significantly decreases muscle strength and spontaneous locomotion (p < 0.05) both medium- and long term; as well as increases immobility in the tail-suspension test (p < 0.05), suggesting a depressive-type behavior. However, DMCA occlusion did not affect nociceptive threshold nor cognitive functions (p > 0.05). These results suggest that, medium- and long-term effects of DMCA occlusion include motor function impairments, but no sensory dysfunction. Additionally, the injury affected mood but did not hinder cognitive function.

We developed here local field analyses to detect prodromal oscillatory abnormalities. We identified early band-specific patterns in local field potential recorded from freely-moving rats injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 mg/kg). Theta frequency was significantly reduced and this effect was not related to the decreased locomotion of the animal. Furthermore, LPS-induced alterations show a region specific response when compared between the hippocampal region and medial prefrontal cortex. Delta mean frequency increased in the hippocampal region but not in the prefrontal cortex. We explored also the hypothesis that systemic inflammation increases the propensity of abnormally synchronized brain activity. Our data indicate that the LPS-evoked alteration of delta and theta frequency parameters reflects the formation of abnormal synchronization in similar frequency ranges. The onset of abnormal brain activity was indicated by spike-wave discharges in the range of 1-10 Hz with three main frequency domains. Importantly, the occurrence of spike-wave discharges was observed in the hippocampus but not in the cortex. In summary, the hippocampal theta rhythm is an accurate indicator of the oscillatory changes evoked by LPS application. The findings offer clear patterns of altered brain function that will facilitate mechanistic investigations of brain dysfunction and delirium occurring during sepsis. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

Methods Key findings Anxiolytic activity was studied by elevated plus maze (EPM), open field test (OFT), light/dark box test (LDT) and Vogel's conflict test (VCT). Electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed to know the changes in brain activity instigated by GABA antagonist. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine and norepinephrine levels in brain tissues were estimated by HPLC. The mRNA (CREB, BDNF, GABA, and 5-HT1A) and protein expression (CREB, p-CREB, BDNF, ERK 1/2, p-ERK 1/2, GABA(A)R alpha 1, 5-HT1A and GAPDH) levels in brain tissue were determined by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. Terminalia chebula tannin-rich extract (TCHE) supplementation increased locomotion in mice towards open arm (EPM), time spent in illuminated area (LDT), rearing frequency (OFT) and number of shocks (VCT) compared to PTX (P < 0.05). Furthermore, TCHE down-regulated serum cortisol levels and showed increased levels of 5-HT, DA and NE. Gene expressions such as BDNF, CREB, GABA(A) and 5-HT1A were up-regulated by TCHE treatment compared to PTX. Conclusions Terminalia chebula tannin-rich extract showed significant anxiolytic activity against picrotoxin and could be used as natural therapy in neurodegenerative disorders.

J	Panthi, S; Leitch, B				Panthi, Sandesh; Leitch, Beulah			The impact of silencing feed-forward parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons in the cortico-thalamocortical network on seizure generation and behaviour	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						Feedforward inhibition; Cortico-thalamocortical; Somatosensory cortex; Parvalbumin; GABAergic interneurons; DREADDs; Absence seizures; Motor dysfunction	MOUSE MODEL; POSITIVE INTERNEURONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ABSENCE EPILEPSY; AMPA RECEPTORS; REMOTE-CONTROL; NEURONS; ACTIVATION; STARGAZER; THALAMUS	Feed-forward inhibition (FFI) is an essential mechanism within the brain, to regulate neuronal firing and prevent runaway excitation. In the cortico-thalamocortical (CTC) network, fast spiking parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) inhibitory interneurons regulate the firing of pyramidal cells in the cortex and relay neurons in the thalamus. PV+ interneuron dysfunction has been implicated in several neurological disorders, including epilepsy. Previously, we demonstrated that loss of excitatory AMPA-receptors, specifically at synapses on PV+ interneurons in CTC feedforward microcircuits, occurs in the stargazer mouse model of absence epilepsy. These mice present with absence seizures characterized by spike and wave discharges (SWDs) on electroencephalogram (EEG) and concomitant behavioural arrest, similar to childhood absence epilepsy. The aim of the current study was to investigate the impact of loss of FFI within the CTC on absence seizure generation and behaviour using new Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug (DREADD) technology. We crossed PV-Cre mice with Cre-dependent hM4Di DREADD strains of mice, which allowed Cre-recombinase-mediated restricted expression of inhibitory G(i)-DREADDs in PV+ interneurons. We then tested the impact of global and focal (within the CTC network) silencing of PV+ interneurons. CNO mediated silencing of all PV+ interneurons by intraperitoneal injection caused the impairment of motor control, decreased locomotion and increased anxiety in a dose-dependent manner. Such silencing generated pathological oscillations similar to absence-like seizures. Focal silencing of PV+ interneurons within cortical or thalamic feedforward microcircuits, induced SWD-like oscillations and associated behavioural arrest. Epileptiform activity on EEG appeared significantly sooner after focal injection compared to peripheral injection of CNO. However, the mean duration of each oscillatory burst and spike frequency was similar, irrespective of mode of CNO delivery. No significant changes were observed in vehicle-treated or non-DREADD wild-type control animals. These data suggest that dysfunctional feed-forward inhibition in CTC microcircuits may be an important target for future therapy strategies for some patients with absence seizures. Additionally, silencing of PV+ interneurons in other brain regions may contribute to anxiety related neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Bone Health in Rats With Temporal Lobe Epilepsy in the Absence of Anti-Epileptic Drugs	FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						bone; epilepsy; status epilepticus; animal model; micro-computed tomography	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; MICRO-COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY; MINERAL DENSITY; MODEL; SEIZURES; MASS; FRACTURE; LEPTIN; LEVETIRACETAM; THERAPY	Rationale: Epilepsy patients often exhibit reduced bone mineral density and are at an increased risk of bone fracture. Whether these bone abnormalities are due to the use of anti-epileptic drugs (AED's) or the disease itself is unknown. For example, although decreased bone health in epilepsy patients is generally attributed to the use of AED's, seizures can also trigger a number of physiological processes that have the potential to affect bone. Therefore, to assess whether bone abnormalities occur in epilepsy in the absence of AED's, the current study investigated mechanical characteristics and trabecular bone morphology in rats with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods: Ten-week old male Wistar rats underwent kainic acid-induced status epilepticus (SE; n = 7) or a sham procedure (n = 9). Rats were implanted with EEG recording electrodes at nine weeks post-SE, and video-EEG was continuously recorded for one week at 10- and 22-weeks post-SE to confirm that SE rats had spontaneous seizures. Open-field testing to assess locomotion was conducted at 23-weeks post-SE. At 24-weeks post-SE, rats were euthanized and tibia were extracted to determine trabecular morphology by micro-computed tomography (mu CT), while femurs were used to investigate mechanical properties via 3-point bending. Results: All post-SE rats had spontaneous seizures at 10- and 22-weeks post-SE, while none of the sham rats had seizures. mu CT trabecular analysis of tibia revealed no differences in total volume, bone volume, bone volume fraction, trabecular number, or trabecular separation between post-SE or sham rats, although post-SE rats did have increased trabecular thickness. There were also no group differences in total distance travelled in the open field suggesting that activity levels did not account for the increased trabecular thickness. In addition, no differences in mechanical properties of femurs were observed between the two groups. Conclusion: There was a lack of overt bone abnormalities in rats with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy in the absence of AED treatment. Although further studies are still needed, these findings may have important implications towards understanding the source (e.g., AED treatments) of bone abnormalities in epilepsy patients.

The aim of our study was to characterize the functional neuromarkers, including a new neuromarker, that is high rolandic beta, in Parkinson's disease (PD). Case study: A 76-year-old male patient, a university professor, a widower, in an intimate relationship with a beloved partner, was tested in the Reintegration and Training Center of the Polish Society of Neuropsychology. Results: Five years earlier (when he was 71 years old), following long-term stress, he had had a transient ischemic attack (TIA). In the following years he experienced two neurological episodes, and was diagnosed, on the basis of MRI findings and clinical symptoms, with vascular (multi-infarct) Parkinsonism. A sudden deterioration in his functioning, including hand tremors at rest, bradykinesia (motor slowdown), asymmetrical gait difficulties, postural instability, and falls typical for PD, as well as MRI finding (the appearance of 'a swallow tail' on the left side, and the lack on the right of the substantia nigra within the midbrain) was the cause of further differential diagnosis. He was assessed using the HBI methodology (Kropotov 2016; Pachalska, Kaczmarek, Kropotov 2014). EEG was recorded from 19 scalp sites, in resting state conditions, with eyes open and eyes closed, and during the cued GO/NOGO tasks with animal/plants as GO/NOGO stimuli. The electrodes were applied according to the International 10-20 system. The EEG was recorded referentially to linked ears, allowing for a computational rereferencing of the data (remontaging). Event related potentials (ERPs) were used to assess the functional changes manifested by the patient. To compare our patient with healthy controls we used the normative Human Brain Index (HBI), a database obtained through joint research by Swiss, Norwegian, Polish and Russian neuroscientists (Kropotov 2018). This database included behavioral parameters and ERP measures in 6 different neuropsychological tasks for 1000 healthy subjects. What is striking, no signs of cognitive dysfunction was found; however observed were an asymmetrical frontal lobe alpha (a neuromarker of depression) and excessive Rolandic beta (a neuromarker of Parkinson's disease). We will discuss the results on the basis of recent subject literature findings, including the personal factors that might influenced the process of the diagnosis and treatment of this patient, ones which should be also taken into account in any differential diagnosis. Conclusions: The obtained results show the importance of using HBI methodology in clinical practice. Physicians involved in the diagnosis and treatment of those with progressive ambulatory impairment and an abnormal white matter (WM) signal on neuroimaging, should when formulating any differential diagnosis consider the use of this approach.

The present study sought to determine which clinical factors underlie such consolidation failure for recent autobiographical experience S in patients with focal epilepsy. We enrolled 21 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), with and without hippocampal lesions (TLE(+)=12; TLE(-)=9, respectively), 11 patients with extratemporal epilepsy (ETE) and 29 controls (NC). Recall and recognition were tested at different delays (i.e., 30 min, 24 h and 4 days). During the study interval, most of the patients underwent concurrent ambulatory EEG monitoring. Analyses of variance indicated Group x Delay interval interactions for recall. The TLE( +) group showed significant decline in recall by 24 h delay. On recognition Group by Delay interval was not detected but main effect for Group revealed that the ETE group demonstrated ALF on recognition questions over the interval between 24 h and 4 days. Regression analyses confirmed that a hippocampal, lesion was particularly disruptive to consolidation over the first 24 h, and that seizures were associated with memory decline over longer delays. Our findings show that the retention of autobiographical experiences involves multiple mechanisms, which operate over different timeframes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Its pathogenesis is unclear. One of the factors implicated is enhanced GABA-ergic tone, which is probably related to increased concentrations of cerebral benzodiazepine (BNZ). In the present study, we tested flumazenil, a cerebral BNZ antagonist, in cirrhosis patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Methods: Out of 47 patients, 7 were excluded prior to randomization for various reasons. Twenty patients were included in the flumazenil group and 20 in the placebo group in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients were given. flumazenil (1 mg/h, continuous IV infusion) or an equal volume of saline solution for 5 hours. Before and after treatment, portosystemic encephalopathy (PSE) stage and number connection test (NCT) scores were checked every half hour for 5 hours. EEG was recorded 15 minutes before and I hour after treatment. Results: While significant improvements were determined in PSE stage and NCT score in the flumazenil group, there were no such improvements in the placebo group. There was no statistically significant difference between pre- and post-treatment EEGs in either group. Conclusion: It was concluded that continuous IV infusion of flumazenil had beneficial and safe effects in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy patients.

Seizure Forecasting from Idea to Reality. Outcomes of the My Seizure Gauge Epilepsy Innovation Institute Workshop	ENEURO			English	Article						algorithm; data collection; epilepsy; multimodal input; seizure forecasting; temporal pattern	LONG-TERM; PREDICTION; PATTERNS	The Epilepsy Innovation Institute (Ei(2)) is a new research program of the Epilepsy Foundation designed to be an innovation incubator for epilepsy. Ei(2) research areas are selected based on community surveys that ask people impacted by epilepsy what they would like researchers to focus on. In their 2016 survey, unpredictability was selected as a top issue regardless of seizure frequency or severity. In response to this need, Ei(2) launched the My Seizure Gauge challenge, with the end goal of creating a personalized seizure advisory system device. Prior to moving forward, Ei(2) convened a diverse group of stakeholders from people impacted by epilepsy and clinicians, to device developers and data scientists, to basic science researchers and regulators, for a state of the science assessment on seizure forecasting. From the discussions, it was clear that we are at an exciting crossroads. With the advances in bioengineering, we can utilize digital markers, wearables, and biosensors as parameters for a seizure-forecasting algorithm. There are also over a thousand individuals who have been implanted with ambulatory intracranial EEG recording devices. Pairing up peripheral measurements to brain states could identify new relationships and insights. Another key component is the heterogeneity of the relationships indicating that pooling findings across groups is suboptimal, and that data collection will need to be done on longer time scales to allow for individualization of potential seizure- forecasting algorithms.

Case: We report a case of infantile-onset epilepsy in a 10-month-old Chinese girl who presented with non-specific neurological signs, no radiological abnormalities and no biochemical disturbances. She first presented at birth with twitching movements and convulsions of an unknown aetiology. Ambulatory EEG showed epileptic rhythmic activities, the presence of asynchrony and runs of sharp waves over the right parietal and central areas. Given the non-specific neurological features and negative structural and biochemical findings, we applied clinical whole-exome sequencing (WES) to determine the underlying aetiology. WES revealed a novel heterozygous missense pathogenic variant, GNAO1:NM_020988.2:c.118G>A; NP_066268.1:p.Gly40Arg. A genetic analysis of the family confirmed the variant identified is a de nova mutation. Conclusions: Clinical WES can streamline genetic analysis and sort out pathogenic genes in an unbiased approach. GNAO1 is a disease-causing gene for the autosomal dominant form of early infantile epileptic encephalopathy. The novel pathogenic variant identified in this case should contribute to our understanding of the expanding spectrum of infantile-onset epilepsy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The considered BrainWave processor is completely programmable, while maintaining energy-efficiency by means of a Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array (CGRA). This is demonstrated through the mapping and evaluation of a state-of-the-art non-convulsive epileptic seizure detection algorithm, while ensuring real-time operation and seizure detection accuracy. Exploiting the CGRA leads to an energy reduction of 73.1%, compared to a highly tuned software implementation (SW-only). A total of 9 complex kernels were benchmarked on the CGRA, resulting in an average 4.7 x speedup and average 4.4 x energy savings over highly tuned SW-only implementations. The BrainWave processor is implemented in 28-nm FDSOI technology with 80 kB of Foundry-provided SRAM. By exploiting near-threshold computing for the logic and voltage-stacking to minimize on-chip voltage-conversion overhead, additional 15.2% and 19.5% energy savings are obtained, respectively. At the Minimum-Energy-Point (MEP) (223 mu W, 8 MHz) we report a measured state-of-the-art 90.6% system conversion efficiency, while executing the epileptic seizure detection in real-time.

Despite great advances in neuroscience over the past decades, the precise causative mechanisms at the transmitter, cellular or network level have so far not been unraveled. As a result, individual treatment decisions cannot be tailor-made and the uncertain prognosis is based on clinical characteristics alone. Although a subpopulation of patients have an excellent response to pharmacological monotherapy, other subpopulations have been less well served by the medical system and therefore require more focused attention. In particular individuals at high risk of bipolar disorder, young patients in the early stages of bipolar disorder, patients with an unstable highly relapsing course and patients with acute suicidal ideation have been identified as those in need. Structure: A research consortium of ten universities across Germany has therefore implemented a 4 year research agenda including three randomized controlled trials, one epidemiological trial and one cross-sectional trial to address these areas of unmet needs. The topics under investigation will be the improvement of early recognition, specific psychotherapy, and smartphones as an aid for early episode detection and biomarkers of lithium response. A subset of patients will be investigated utilizing neuroimaging (fMRI), neurophysiology (EEG), and biomaterials (genomics, transcriptomics). Conclusions: This article aims to outline the rationale, design, and methods of these individual studies.

Methods - We describe a male patient who despite a diagnosis of CD from the age of 9 did not comply with the gluten-free diet. At the age of 11 he developed simple and complex partial seizures with visual symptoms, anxiety, and ambulatory automatisms. His epilepsy appeared to be drug resistant, and after having tried nine antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), alone or in combinations, he underwent a presurgical evaluation at the age of 30. Interictal standard electroencephalograms (EEGs) disclosed frequent biparieto-occipital epileptiform discharges. Computed tomography showed cortical-subcortical punctate calcifications in the right parieto-occipital region, where his seizures seemed to start, according to ictal EEG registrations from intracranial strip electrodes. Results - At the age of 31 he underwent epilepsy surgery. A 5 x 6 cm large area of the right parieto-occipital region was resected, including the area with calcifications. Except for a few short-lasting episodes of anxiety (simple partial seizures?) he has now been seizure-free for 12 years. AEDs were withdrawn 5 years ago. Postoperatively he was left with an upper left-sided quadrant anopsia, which is not bothering him. Conclusions - In patients with CD, unilateral occipital calcifications, and drug-resistant epilepsy, epilepsy surgery should be considered, as a lesionectomy might be very successful.

Reducing Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy: Considering Risk Factors, Pathophysiology and Strategies	CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Review						Premature mortality; Seizure; SUDEP	HYPOXIC VENTILATORY RESPONSE; GENERALIZED EEG SUPPRESSION; CAUSE-SPECIFIC MORTALITY; OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP-APNEA; UNEXPLAINED DEATH; HEART-RATE; LONG-TERM; SUDEP RISK; RESPIRATORY DYSFUNCTION; SEROTONERGIC NEURONS	Purpose of Review Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is the commonest cause of epilepsy-related premature mortality in people with chronic epilepsy. It is the most devastating epilepsy outcome. We describe and discuss risk factors and possible pathophysiological mechanisms to elucidate possible preventative strategies to avert SUDEP. Recent Findings Sudden death accounts for a significant proportion of premature mortality in people with epilepsy compared to the general population. Unmodifiable risk factors include a history of neurologic insult, younger age of seizure-onset, longer epilepsy duration, a history of convulsions, symptomatic epilepsy, intellectual disability, and non-ambulatory status. Modifiable risk factors include the presence of convulsive seizures, increased seizure frequency, timely and appropriate use of antiseizure medications, polytherapy, alcoholism, and supervision while sleeping. Pathophysiology is unclear, but several possible mechanisms such as direct alteration of cardiorespiratory function, pulmonary impairment, electrocerebral shutdown, adenosine dysfunction, and genetic susceptibility suggested. Methods to prevent SUDEP include increasing awareness of SUDEP, augmenting knowledge of unmodifiable risk factors, obtaining full seizure remission, addressing lifestyle factors such as supervision and prone positioning, and enacting protocols to increase the detection of and intervention for SUDEP. Further studies are required to characterize precisely and comprehensively SUDEP risk factors and pathophysiological drivers and develop evidence-based algorithms to minimize SUDEP in people with epilepsy.

Epilepsy - Accuracy of patient seizure counts	ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; AMBULATORY EEG; FREQUENCY; AWARENESS; TIME	Objective: To evaluate the effects of a daily patient reminder on seizure documentation accuracy. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: Monitoring unit of an academic department of epileptology. Patients: Consecutive sample of 91 adult inpatients with focal epilepsies undergoing video-electroencephalographic monitoring. Intervention: While all patients were asked to document seizures at the beginning of the monitoring period, patients from the experimental group were reminded each day to document seizures. Main Outcome Measure: Documentation accuracy (percentage of documented seizures). Results: A total of 582 partial seizures were recorded. Patients failed to document 55.5% of all recorded seizures, 73.2% of complex partial seizures, 26.2% of simple partial seizures, 41.7% of secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures, 85.8% of all seizures during sleeping, and 32.0% of all seizures during the awake state. The group medians of individual documentation accuracies for overall seizures, simple partial seizures, complex partial seizures, and secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures were 33.3%, 66.7%, 0%, and 83.3%, respectively. Neither the patient reminder nor cognitive performance affected documentation accuracy. A left-sided electroencephalographic focus or lesion, but not the site (frontal or temporal), contributed to documentation failure. Conclusions: Patient seizure counts do not provide valid information. Documentation failures result from postictal seizure unawareness, which cannot be avoided by reminders. Unchanged documentation accuracy is a prerequisite for the use of patient seizure counts in clinical trials and has to be demonstrated in a subsample of patients undergoing electroencephalographic monitoring.

Bridging the healthcare gap: Building the case for epilepsy virtual clinics in the current healthcare environment	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Review						Telemedicine; Virtual clinic; Epilepsy		Access to quality healthcare remains a challenge that is complicated by mounting pressures to control costs, and now, as we witness, the unprecedented strain placed on our healthcare delivery systems due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Challenges in healthcare access have driven a need for innovative approaches ensuring connectivity to health providers. Telehealth services and virtual clinics offer accessible disease management pathways for patients living in health resource limited areas or, as in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, where there may be potential barriers to existing healthcare resources. Those suffering with serious chronic disorders often cannot be seen by a healthcare specialist due to their limited availability, or the lack of a specialist within a reasonable proximity. Epilepsy represents such a disorder where most of the world's population lacks the availability of necessary specialists. Virtual clinics allow for specialist care and an ability to perform necessary ambulatory electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring by placing the technologies directly in patients' homes or at local clinics near the patients' homes. By moving the diagnostic process out of the hospital or epilepsy center, it becomes possible to overcome growing gaps in neurology services. Virtual clinics have the potential to expand access to high-quality, cost-effective care for the patient. The virtual clinic remotely connects those in need of medical support with specialists anywhere in the world, at any time of the day. Crown Copyright (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Chronic atypical absence seizures were verified in the AY-treated animals by the presence of spontaneous 5- to 6-Hz slow spike-wave discharges (SSWDs) in the neocortex. General behavioral activity, as measured by total movements (TM), movement time (MT), ambulatory movement time (AMT), time spent in center of arena (CT), jumps (JFP), and rotational behavior (TURNS), were continuously recorded under a 12-hour light:12-hour dark photocycle. The average SSWD duration in AY-treated rats varied daily, with two peaks occurring at approximately dark phase and light phase onset. Mice treated with AY exhibited significant increases in all behavioral measures during the light and dark phases, with the exception of light-phase CT, which did not differ from that of controls. Consequently, the daily rhythm of total behavioral activity (TM) exhibited a significantly higher mean oscillation (mesor) and amplitude without evidence of phase shift compared with the TM rhythm of controls. The occurrence of SSWD activity in the AY model appears to be subject to regulation by biological timing mechanisms and, furthermore, associated with motor hyperactivity that does not alter the timing of behavioral rhythmicity.

Severe, childhood-onset, idiopathic, life-long insomnia responding selectively to opiate therapy: case report with 19 year follow-up	SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						Insomnia; Idiopathic/primary insomnia; Familial insomnia; Childhood-onset insomnia; Polysomnography; EEG; Libido/sexuality; Restless legs syndrome; Opiate therapy; Dopaminergic therapy		Background: Idiopathic (primary) insomnia can be difficult to treat; only two prior cases responsive to opiate therapy have been reported. A case is now presented of severe, idiopathic, childhood-onset, familial insomnia, with increased libido, absence of psychopathology, tardive emergence of restless legs syndrome (RLS), and selective response to opiate therapy. Case report: A 39-year-old woman was referred in 1981 by her physician who had discovered 3 years earlier that propoxyphene treatment of migraines also controlled her chronic insomnia. She had experienced severe insomnia since childhood, and during early adulthood the insomnia intensified, as she would sleep 0-3 h nightly and never napped. Daily generalized motor restlessness resulted in her frequently walking around the house while feeling exhausted. The quality of her life was considerably compromised by her insomnia, motor restlessness, and by an increased libido that was present since puberty and that was only partially relieved by having sex repeatedly with her husband. Results: Nightly opiate therapy for 19 years has controlled the insomnia, motor restlessness, and excessive libido without affecting her normal libido. The insomnia had not responded to treatment with >25 agents covering >10 pharmacologic categories. During her first (unmedicated) polysomnographic (PSG) study in 1981, she slept 0 min while spending 436 min in bed. In 1984, four consecutive PSG studies were conducted in a design that confirmed the efficacy of propoxyphene therapy of her insomnia. In 1990, an ambulatory PSG revealed two runs of EEG rhythmic paroxysmal activity arising from sleep and wakefulness, without clinical correlate. Neurologic history was negative for seizures, but positive for complete right carotid artery occlusion and three transient ischemic attacks. At age 55 years, typical RLS emerged that was controlled with levodopa therapy, and a concurrent relapse of insomnia was controlled with oxycodone replacing propoxyphene. Conclusions: Nightly opiate therapy of severe idiopathic (primary) insomnia can remain effective during very long-term clinical follow-up. Guidelines are provided for when to consider such an unusual treatment in other cases of severe, chronic insomnia. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We used the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) to objectively measure the ability of adults with focal-onset epilepsy to maintain wakefulness in soporific conditions. Methods: Adults with epilepsy participating in a study investigating the effects of lacosamide on sleep and wakefulness underwent baseline ambulatory polysomnography (PSG)/EEG followed by MWT. Mean sleep latency (MSL) and mean percent sleep time (MST, mean percentage of non-wake EEG scored in 3-sec bins from lights out to sleep onset averaged over the 4 MWT trials) were quantified. Subjective sleepiness was assessed by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Spearman correlation and linear regression assessed relationships between MWT parameters, ESS and relevant sleep and epilepsy-related variables. Results: Maintenance of wakefulness test MSL in 51 AWE (mean age 43.5 +/- 13 years, 69% female, mean BMI 24.6 +/- 11.2 kg/m2) was 21.7 +/- 11.9 min; 45.1% had an abnormally short MSL <19.4 min and 15.7% <8 min. MST was 9.3% [3.3, 19.1]. Mean ESS score was 8.8 +/- 5.7; 39% had elevated ESS (>10). No correlation between subjective ESS and objective MSL (p = 0.67) or MST (p = 0.61) was found. MSL was significantly shorter in subjects with focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (FBTCS; 7.9 min [13.6, 22.3]) compared to those without (27.4 min [21.2, 33.6], p = 0.013). Younger subjects had shorter MSL; MSL increased 3.2 min for every 10-year increase in age. Conclusion: We found a high prevalence of objective sleepiness/difficulty maintaining wakefulness on the MWT and subjective sleepiness using the ESS in AWE without a correlation between the two. More severe objective sleepiness was found in subjects with a history of FBTCS and younger age. Further research is needed to determine mechanistic underpinnings and optimal measurements of pathological sleepiness in people with epilepsy given the burden of it on quality of life.

Monitoring hypnotic effect and nociception with two EEG-derived indices, qCON and qNOX, during general anaesthesia	ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA			English	Article							EVOKED POTENTIAL INDEX; BISPECTRAL INDEX; PROPOFOL; REMIFENTANIL; PHARMACOKINETICS; DEPTH; PHARMACODYNAMICS; IDENTIFICATION; STIMULATION; ANALGESIA	Background: The objective of the present study was to validate the qCON index of hypnotic effect and the qNOX index of nociception. Both indices are derived from the frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) and implemented in the qCON 2000 monitor (Quantium Medical, Barcelona, Spain). Methods: The study was approved by the local ethics committee, including data from 60 patients scheduled for ambulatory surgery undergoing general anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil, using TCI. The Bis (Covidien, Boulder, CO, USA) was recorded simultaneously with the qCON. Loss of eyelash reflex [loss of consciousness (LOC)] was recorded, and prediction probability for Bis and qCON was calculated. Movement as a response to noxious stimulation [laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion, laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation] was registered. The correlation coefficient between qCON and Bis was calculated. The patients were divided intomovers/non-movers as a response to noxious stimulation. A paired t-test was used to assess significant difference for qCON and qNOX for movers/non-movers. Results: The prediction probability (Pk) and the standard error (SE) for qCON and Bis for detecting LOC was 0.92 (0.02) and 0.94 (0.02) respectively (t-test, no significant difference). The R between qCON and Bis was 0.85. During the general anaesthesia (Ce propofol > 2 mu g/ml, Ce remifentanil > 2 ng/ml), the mean value and standard deviation (SD) for qCON was 45 (8), while for qNOX it was 40 (6). The qNOX pre-stimuli values were significantly different (P < 0.05) for movers/non-movers as a response to LMA insertion [62.5 (24.0) vs. 45.5 (24.1)], tracheal intubation [58.7 (21.8) vs. 41.4 (20.9)], laryngoscopy [54.1 (21.4) vs. 41.0 (20.8)]. There were no significant differences in remifentanil or propofol effect-site concentrations for movers vs. non-movers. Conclusion: The qCON was able to reliably detect LOC during general anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil. The qNOX showed significant overlap between movers and non-movers, but it was able to predict whether or not the patient would move as a response to noxious stimulation, although the anaesthetic concentrations were similar.

FEI's were recorded at 5, 20, 40, and 60 min following subcutaneous injections of saline, and of 0.4, 0.7, and 1.0 mg/kg nicotine on separate days. In the VC, the amplitude of components N-39, N-53, N-67, and P-SS increased, while the amplitude of components N-30 and P-235 decreased following nicotine administration. P-22, P-47, and N-153 were unchanged. In the SC, components P-27, N-48, and N-53 were reduced in amplitude, while P-37 and N-57 were unaffected by nicotine. Many peak latencies in the VC and SC were increased by nicotine, often at all three doses. However, effects of nicotine on FEPs were both dose- and time-dependent. When body temperature was recorded 65 min after drug administration, significant hypothermia was found with both the 0.7- and 1.0-mg/kg nicotine doses. The 1.0-mg/kg dose of nicotine resulted in a significant increase in movement during the recording sessions, but not in subsequent open-field observations. The results demonstrate that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play a differential role in the production/modulation of the various components of FEPs. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Nucleus incertus promotes cortical desynchronization and behavioral arousal	BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION			English	Article						Arousal; Nucleus incertus; Cortical desynchronization; Vigilance; Locomotion	CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING-FACTOR; HIPPOCAMPAL-THETA-RHYTHM; GABAERGIC NEURONS; BRAIN-STEM; RELAXIN-3 NEURONS; RAT; EXPRESSION; STRESS; ACTIVATION; STATE	Arousal and vigilance are essential for survival and relevant regulatory neural circuits lie within the brainstem, hypothalamus and forebrain. The nucleus incertus (NI) is a distinct site within the pontine periventricular gray, containing a substantial population of GABAergic neurons with long-range, ascending projections. Existing neuroanatomical data and functional studies in anesthetized rats, suggest the NI is a central component of a midline behavioral control network well positioned to modulate arousal, vigilance and exploratory navigation, yet none of these roles have been established experimentally. We used a chemogenetic approach-clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) activation of virally delivered excitatory hM3Dq-DREADDs-to activate the NI in rats and examined the behavioral and physiological effects, relative to effects in na < ve rats and appropriate viral-treated controls. hM3Dq activation by CNO resulted in long-lasting depolarization of NI neurons with action potentials, in vitro. Peripheral injection of CNO significantly increased c-Fos immunoreactivity in the NI and promoted cortical electroencephalograph (EEG) desynchronization. These brain changes were associated with heightened arousal, and increased locomotor activity in the homecage and in a novel environment. Furthermore, NI activation altered responses in a fear conditioning paradigm, reflected by increased head-scanning, vigilant behaviors during conditioned fear recall. These findings provide direct evidence that the NI promotes general arousal via a broad behavioral activation circuit and support early hypotheses, based on its connectivity, that the NI is a modulator of cognition and attention, and emotional and motivated behaviors.

The role of delta and theta oscillations during ego-motion in healthy adult volunteers	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Vestibular system; Vestibular stimulation; Reference frames; Hemispheric asymmetry; Alpha activity; Passive motion; Multisensory		The successful cortical processing of multisensory input typically requires the integration of data represented in different reference systems to perform many fundamental tasks, such as bipedal locomotion. Animal studies have provided insights into the integration processes performed by the neocortex and have identified region specific tuning curves for different reference frames during ego-motion. Yet, there remains almost no data on this topic in humans. In this study, an experiment originally performed in animal research with the aim to identify brain regions modulated by the position of the head and eyes relative to a translational ego-motion was adapted for humans. Subjects sitting on a motion platform were accelerated along a translational pathway with either eyes and head aligned or a 20 degrees yaw-plane offset relative to the motion direction while EEG was recorded. Using a distributed source localization approach, it was found that activity in area PFm, a part of Brodmann area 40, was modulated by the congruency of translational motion direction, eye, and head position. In addition, an asymmetry between the hemispheres in the opercular-insular region was observed during the cortical processing of the vestibular input. A frequency specific analysis revealed that low-frequency oscillations in the delta- and theta-band are modulated by vestibular stimulation. Source-localization estimated that the observed low-frequency oscillations are generated by vestibular core-regions, such as the parieto-opercular region and frontal areas like the mid-orbital gyrus and the medial frontal gyrus.

Such imaging approaches neglect a central component that characterizes navigation - the multisensory experience of self-movement. Navigation by active movement through space combines multisensory perception with internally generated self-motion cues. We investigated the spatial microgenesis during free ambulatory exploration of interactive sparse virtual environments using motion capture synchronized to high resolution electroencephalographic (EEG) data as well AS psychometric and self-report measures. In such environments, map-like allocentric representations must be constructed out of transient, egocentric first-person perspective 3-D spatial information. Considering individual differences of spatial learning ability, we studied if changes in exploration behavior coincide with spatial learning of an environment. To this end, we analyzed the quality of sketch maps (a description of spatial learning) that were produced after repeated learning trials for differently complex maze environments. We observed significant changes in active exploration behavior from the first to the last exploration of a maze: a decrease in time spent in the maze predicted an increase in subsequent sketch map quality. Furthermore, individual differences in spatial abilities as well as differences in the level of experienced immersion had an impact on the quality of spatial learning. Our results demonstrate converging evidence of observable behavioral changes associated with spatial learning in a framework that allows the study of cortical dynamics of navigation.

LEV-iv (median 3000 mg/day; range 1000-9000) was administered as a bolus loading (500-2000 mg per 30-60 min, n = 30) or as a continuous pump infusion (n = 6). SE was terminated in 69% ("responders''); 31% ("non-responders'') remained in SE. Factors associated with failure were: dose escalation over 3000 mg/day, lack of bolus loading, treatment latency over 48 h, age over 80 years, non-convulsive SE with coma ("subtle SE''), periodic lateralised epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) on EEG, acute cerebral lesion and intubation narcosis. SE was terminated in all eight patients without brain lesion (p = 0.033), and in all seven patients with complex partial SE (p = 0.051). Outcome was favourable (ambulatory patients) in 48% (responders) compared with 0% (non-responders), and "adverse'' (death or continuing coma/stupor) in 24% (responders) compared with 100% (non-responders). Mortality was 17% (responders 4%, non-responders 45%). No patient had cardiocirculatory side effects or worsening of SE. Two patients experienced nausea and vomiting during LEV-iv loading, leading to aspiration pneumonia in one. This study suggests that LEV-iv may be a safe and efficacious treatment of SE. Prospective and controlled trials are imperative to confirm these preliminary findings.

Quantitative electrocorticographic biomarkers of clinical outcomes in mesial temporal lobe epileptic patients treated with the RNS (R) system	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Refractory epilepsy; Seizure biomarkers; Interictal EEG; Responsive brain stimulation; Mesiotemporal lobe epilepsy	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; SEIZURES; SPIKES; SPIKING; ADULTS	Objectives: Find interictal electrocorticographic (ECoG) biomarkers of clinical outcomes in mesiotemporal lobe (MTL) epilepsy patients. Methods: In the NeuroPace (R) RNS (R) System clinical trials with 256 patients, 20 MTL patients with the most reduction in clinical seizures at Year 7 compared to baseline (upper response quartile; -96.5% median change) and 20 with the least reduction in clinical seizures (lower response quartile; -17.4% median change) were evaluated. Clinical and interictal ECoG features from the two response quartiles were compared. Results: Demographic and clinical features were similar in the upper and lower response quartiles. Interictal spike rate (ISR) was substantially lower (p < 0.0001) in the upper quartile patients, while normalized theta (4-8 Hz) and normalized gamma (> 25 Hz) were also different (p < 0.05) between the two response quartiles. ISR was positively correlated (p < 0.05) with clinical seizure rates in 71% of the channels analyzed. ECoG records captured during months with no clinical seizures had the lowest ISR. Conclusions: ISR is a strong differentiator of clinical response in MTL patients. Normalized theta and gamma also differentiates clinical response. Significance: In MTL patients, the interictal spike rate along with spectral power computed from chronic ambulatory baseline ECoGs may serve as biomarkers of clinical outcomes and maybe used as treatment endpoints.

Deep-learning for seizure forecasting in canines with epilepsy	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						real-time seizure forecasting; epilepsy; canine epilepsy; machine learning; deep learning; convolutional neural networks (CNN); Monte Carlo simulation	LONG-TERM; PREDICTION; SYSTEM	Objective. This paper introduces a fully automated, subject-specific deep-learning convolutional neural network (CNN) system for forecasting seizures using ambulatory intracranial EEG (iEEG). The system was tested on a hand-held device (Mayo Epilepsy Assist Device) in a pseudo-prospective mode using iEEG from four canines with naturally occurring epilepsy. Approach. The system was trained and tested on 75 seizures collected over 1608 d utilizing a genetic algorithm to optimize forecasting hyper-parameters (prediction horizon (PH), median filter window length, and probability threshold) for each subject-specific seizure forecasting model. The trained CNN models were deployed on a hand-held tablet computer and tested on testing iEEG datasets from four canines. The results from the iEEG testing datasets were compared with Monte Carlo simulations using a Poisson random predictor with equal time in warning to evaluate seizure forecasting performance. Main results. The results show the CNN models forecasted seizures at rates significantly above chance in all four dogs (p < 0.01, with mean 0.79 sensitivity and 18% time in warning). The deep learning method presented here surpassed the performance of previously reported methods using computationally expensive features with standard machine learning methods like logistic regression and support vector machine classifiers. Significance. Our findings principally support the feasibility of deploying trained CNN models on a hand-held computational device (Mayo Epilepsy Assist Device) that analyzes streaming iEEG data for real-time seizure forecasting.

The validity of these data has recently been challenged and the question is whether this applies to participants of clinical studies as well. Here we compared self-estimated seizure counting and documentation accuracy in participants and nonparticipants of former epilepsy clinical drug trials. Methods: Adult participants (N = 100) from a total of twenty-two phase II, III or IV clinical drug studies performed at our unit (2002-2015) underwent a structured telephone interview on self-estimated seizure awareness and seizure documentation accuracy. Data were compared to data from a recent study in adult epilepsy patients (N = 132) who never participated in clinical trials and who answered the same questions (Blachut et al., Seizure 2015; 29:97-103). Results: Reported seizure frequencies, self-estimated seizure documentation accuracy (at best 46-53%), and the motivation for seizure-documentation were almost identical in both groups and no group effect was found except for higher self-reported awareness for nocturnal seizures in former study participants. Conclusion: Epilepsy patients having participated in clinical drug trials report comparable erroneous seizure counts as do epilepsy patients in general. These data further corroborate the notion that most clinical trials in epileptology are based on inaccurate measures. Implications and possible solutions for patients, physicians, and research are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Interrater reliability in interpretation of electrocorticographic seizure detections of the responsive neurostimulator	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Electrocorticography; Focal epilepsy; EEG; Brain electrical stimulation; Seizure detection		ObjectiveElectrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings from patients with medically intractable partial-onset seizures treated with a responsive neurostimulator system (the RNS System) that detects and stores physician-specified ECoG events provide a new data resource. Interpretation of these recordings has not yet been validated. The purpose was to evaluate the interrater interpretation of chronic ambulatory ECoG recordings obtained by the RNS System. MethodsFive pairs of five experts independently classified 7,221 ECoG recordings obtained from 128 patients with medically intractable partial seizures who participated in a randomized controlled trial of the safety and efficacy of the RNS System. ECoG detectionslong episodes or saturationswere classified as seizures or not seizures based on a reference definition. Interrater agreement rates and kappa score reliabilities were calculated between rater pairs from the ECoG sample as a whole and within individual patients who had more than the median number of individual ECoG recordings. ResultsThe overall interrater agreement was 79%, with a reliability =0.57 (moderate agreement). Agreement between pairs of reviewers ranged from 0.69 to 0.85. Agreement rates were 94% or better for 50% of patients. Only 25% of patients had ECoG recordings agreement rates worse than 75%. ECoGs with mixed interpretations (one reviewer seizure/the othernot seizure) consisted of periods of low amplitude activity that evolved in amplitude or periodic discharges near 2Hz. SignificanceAlthough reliability as a whole was moderate, for the majority of patients, detections yielded highly reliably interpreted events of either electrographic seizures or nonictal epileptiform activity.

The faster emergence profile of desflurane may reduce the effect of BIS monitoring on recovery from desflurane compared with propofol. This study compared hypnotic drug usage, recovery, patient satisfaction and incidence of inadequate sedation in BIS monitored and nonmonitored women anesthetized with desflurane or propofol. Methods: One hundred and sixty patients scheduled for elective gynecological surgery were randomly assigned to desflurane or propofol anesthesia with and without BIS monitoring. Fentanyl, vecuronium and remifentanil were administered according to clinical criteria. The BIS monitor was used in all patients, but the monitor screen was covered in the controls. A BIS level between 45 and 55 was targeted in the BIS monitored patients whereas depth of anesthesia was assessed by clinical criteria in the controls. Results: The mean (SD) desflurane MAC-hours administered with and without BIS were 0.70 (0.15) and 0.76 (0.12), respectively, resulting in extubation times of 6.5 (4.1) and 8.3 (6.1) min. (NS). Bispectal index monitoring was associated with improved patient satisfaction, reduced postoperative nausea and antiemetic drug requirement, and fewer episodes with sustained BIS levels > 60. The mean (SD) propofol infusion rates were 6.0 (1.4) and 6.6 (0.9) mg kg(-1)h(-1) with and without the BIS monitor (P = 0.023), resulting in mean (SD) extubation times of 6.8 (4.6) and 10.5 min (5.9), respectively (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Bispectal index monitoring reduced propofol usage and hastened recovery after propofol anesthesia, whereas in desflurane anesthesia it was associated with improved patient satisfaction, probably because of decreased postoperative nausea and fewer episodes of inadequate hypnosis.

METHODS: Twenty-five cirrhotic patients (17 M, 8 F, mean age 56 +/- 11 years, 24/25 alcoholic, Child-Pugh A, B, C: 2, 6, 17) were included. The patients were classified into 3 groups: stage 0 group (n = 12), stage 1-2 group (n = 6), and stage 3-4 group (n = 7) of encephalopathy. Over three consecutive days, patients had clinical evaluation 3 times a day with psychometric test, venous ammoniemia, flash visually evoked potentials (VEP), electroencephalogram and continuous actigraphic monitoring for 3 cl, providing 5 parameters: mesor, amplitude, acrophase, mean duration of activity (MDAI) and inactivity (MDII) intervals. RESULTS: Serum ammonia and VEP did not differ among the 3 groups. Electroencephalography mean dominant frequency (MDF) correlated significantly with clinical stages of HE (r=0.65, P=0.003). The best correlation with HE stage was provided by actigraphy especially with MDAI (r=0.7, P < 10(-4)) and mesor (r=0.65, P < 10(-4)). MDAI correlated significantly with MDF (r=0.62, 0.004) and was significantly shorter in case of HE compared to patients without HE (stage 0: 5.33 +/- 1.6 min; stage 1-2: 3.28 +/- 1.4 min; stage 3-4: 2.52 +/- 1.1 min; P < 0.05). Using a threshold of MDAI of less than 4.9 min, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value for HE diagnosis were 85%, 67%, 73% and 80%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Actigraphy may be an objective method to identify HE, especially for early HE detection. Motor activity at the wrist correlates well with clinical stages of HE. MDAI and mesor are the most relevant parameters. (c) 2006 The WJG Press. All rights reserved.

These models were derived from indirect measures such as neuropsychological tests and electroencephalography alpha band power. Objective: To determine if high-arousing stimuli directly modulated activity in attention and arousal-related sensory brain regions in patients with MDD. Design: Between-group comparison (patients with MDD vs healthy control subjects) of neuromagnetic oscillatory activity driven by flickering emotional and neutral pictures (steady-state visual evoked fields [ssVEFs]). Setting: Center of magnetoencephalography at a public university and public ambulatory mental health service. Participants: Fifteen female low-anxious patients with MDD and 15 female controls. The groups were matched with respect to age and handedness. Intervention: Magnetoencephalographic recordings and self-report ratings. Main Outcome Measures: Modulation of current source strengths obtained by frequency domain minimum norm source localization of ssVEFs. Results: Controls and patients with MDD showed enhanced current source strengths at ssVEF frequency in occipital and parietal cortex for high-arousing emotional pictures (P<.05 for permutation statistics). While this arousal modulation in controls was pronounced in the right temporoparietal cortex, weak arousal modulation characterized that brain region in patients with MDD (F-1.28=7.2, P<.05 for interaction group by quadratic contrast). Conclusions: Although emotional pictures engaged the dorsal visual stream to a greater extent than neutral pictures in both study groups, only controls showed strong arousal modulation in the right temporoparietal cortex. Because the right temporoparietal cortex is associated with the arousal dimension of emotion, subjects with depression may have difficulties in activating arousal-related brain areas, whereas basic stimulus processing related to activation of the dorsal visual stream is intact.

J	Li, S; Franken, P; Vassalli, A				Li, Sha; Franken, Paul; Vassalli, Anne			Bidirectional and context-dependent changes in theta and gamma oscillatory brain activity in noradrenergic cell-specific Hypocretin/Orexin receptor 1-KO mice	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							LOCUS-COERULEUS NEURONS; HYPOCRETIN OREXIN; HUMAN SLEEP; IMMUNOREACTIVE FIBERS; CERULEUS ACTIVATION; MEDIAL SEPTUM; WAKING EEG; RAT; AROUSAL; MODULATION	Noradrenaline (NA) and hypocretins/orexins (HCRT), and their receptors, dynamically modulate the circuits that configure behavioral states, and their associated oscillatory activities. Salient stimuli activate spiking of locus coeruleus noradrenergic (NA(LC)) cells, inducing NA release and brain-wide noradrenergic signalling, thus resetting network activity, and mediating an orienting response. Hypothalamic HCRT neurons provide one of the densest input to NA(LC) cells. To functionally address the HCRT-to-NA connection, we selectively disrupted the Hcrtr1 gene in NA neurons, and analyzed resulting (Hcrtr1(Dbh-CKO)) mice', and their control littermates' electrocortical response in several contexts of enhanced arousal. Under enforced wakefulness (EW), or after cage change (CC), Hcrtr1(Dbh-CKO) mice exhibited a weakened ability to lower infra-theta frequencies (1-7 Hz), and mount a robust, narrow-bandwidth, high-frequency theta rhythm (similar to 8.5 Hz). A fast-gamma (55-80 Hz) response, whose dynamics closely parallelled theta, also diminished, while beta/slow-gamma activity (15-45 Hz) increased. Furthermore, EW-associated locomotion was lower. Surprisingly, nestbuilding-associated wakefulness, inversely, featured enhanced theta and fast-gamma activities. Thus HCRT-to-NA signalling may fine-tune arousal, up in alarming conditions, and down during self-motivated, goal-driven behaviors. Lastly, slow-wave-sleep following EW and CC, but not nestbuilding, was severely deficient in slow-delta waves (0.75-2.25 Hz), suggesting that HCRT-to-NA signalling regulates the slow-delta rebound characterizing sleep after stress-associated arousal.

The carryover of this abnormal delta activity into non-rapid eye movement sleep raises the question of whether the observed delta electroencephalographic activity during sleep in Alzheimer disease in any way reflects normal physiologic delta activity slow-wave sleep. The objective of the study was to compare patients with Alzheimer disease with age-matched controls using an experimentally controlled procedure that can test the capacity of the nervous system to generate physiologic delta-frequency responses during sleep. Setting: Research sleep laboratory. Participants: Seven ambulatory patients with Alzheimer disease (mean age = 70.0 +/- 5.77 years) meeting the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable Alzheimer disease and 8 controls (mean age = 69.25 +/- 4.95 years), underwent at least 1 night of evoked-potential recordings. Measurement and Results: Data were collected during stage 2 sleep. Responses to stimuli were classified based on whether they produced a K-complex. Averages of K-complex responses were calculated, latencies and amplitudes of components evaluated, and K-complex incidence was determined. Relative to controls, subjects with Alzheimer disease produced significantly fewer evoked K-complexes (P <.001) and had substantially smaller N550 amplitudes than controls (P <.05). A lower probability of eliciting a K-complex correlated with greater dementia severity, as measured by the Mini Mental State Examination and Dementia Rating Scale. Conclusions: Despite observed increases in pathologic delta-frequency electroencephalographic activity, patients with Alzheimer disease have an impaired capacity to generate normal physiologic delta responses during non-rapid eye movement sleep.

Patient and methods: A 33-year-old male patient with ALMA. The patient underwent a complete and detailed study of his neurophysiological parameters during sleep, before and after treatment with pramipexole. Results: The treatment with pramipexole was followed by a significant reduction in the rate of occurrence of ALMA, in reported insomnia, and in daytime sleepiness. The ALMA generally were preceded by cyclic alternating pattern A phases and increased heart rate in most instances. Visual scoring and spectral analyses suggested that after pramipexole more intense arousal was required to trigger ALMA. Conclusion: The evident beneficial effect induced by the treatment with pramipexole indicates that the spinal networks involved in the generation of ALMA might also be under the inhibitory control of dopaminergic networks. We suggest that ALMA can be seen even in the absence of other factors such as antidepressant therapy, sleep apnea or periodic leg movements during sleep, and might be considered as an additional phenomenon influenced by sleep instability. Our patient seems to indicate also that treatment with dopamine agonists can be useful in such patients because the treatment can be followed by a good clinical response. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

It remains unclear whether oscillations may play a similar role in the insect brain. We describe a novel "whole brain" readout for Drosophila melanogaster using a simple multichannel recording preparation to study electrical activity across the brain of flies exposed to different sensory stimuli. We recorded local field potential (LFP) activity from >2,000 registered recording sites across the fly brain in >200 wild-type and transgenic animals to uncover specific LFP frequency bands that correlate with: 1) brain region; 2) sensory modality (olfactory, visual, or mechanosensory); and 3) activity in specific neural circuits. We found endogenous and stimulus-specific oscillations throughout the fly brain. Central (higher-order) brain regions exhibited sensory modality-specific increases in power within narrow frequency bands. Conversely, in sensory brain regions such as the optic or antennal lobes, LFP coherence, rather than power, best defined sensory responses across modalities. By transiently activating specific circuits via expression of TrpA1, we found that several circuits in the fly brain modulate LFP power and coherence across brain regions and frequency domains. However, activation of a neuromodulatory octopaminergic circuit specifically increased neuronal coherence in the optic lobes during visual stimulation while decreasing coherence in central brain regions. Our multichannel recording and brain registration approach provides an effective way to track activity simultaneously across the fly brain in vivo, allowing investigation of functional roles for oscillations in processing sensory stimuli and modulating behavior.

This study compared the declines of these theta parameters and related them to behavioral events. Theta activity was recorded with bipolar electrodes spanning cornu Ammon, sector 1 or cornu Ammon, sectors 2/3 cell layers of the dorsal hippocampus in 12 rats trained to approach and depress a treadle which exposed a milk dipper. Behavioral events were identified using a video capture system (20-ms sampling) synchronized to the hippocampal recording system (10-ms sampling). Peri-event averages of theta activity were made around the initial paw contact with the treadle, the presentation of the dipper, and the first lick at the dipper. Phase relationships between averaged hippocampal slow wave activity and behavioral events occasionally were found but they were inconsistent. In averages of both amplitude and frequency, times of minimum were less variable around paw contact indicating that compared with reward presentation and consummatory behavior, it more closely related to the processes determining the declines. Theta amplitude declined more rapidly than frequency and reached an earlier minimum in averages around initial paw contact and dipper presentation. Mean amplitude minimum occurred after the paw contact at 159 ms but the decline of frequency continued into the licking bout with its minimum occurring at 343 ms. The findings indicate that during the termination of approach locomotion, the amplitude of hippocampal theta activity is closely related to specific expected sensorimotor events.

"Photosomnolence" is mediated by classical and ganglion cell photoreceptors and occurs despite the ongoing high levels of locomotion at the time of stimulus onset. Brief photic stimuli trigger rapid locomotor suppression, sleep, and a large drop in core body temperature (Tc; Phase 1), followed by a relatively fixed duration interval of sleep (Phase 2) and recovery (Phase 3) to pre-sleep activity levels. Additional light can lengthen Phase 2. Potential retinal pathways through which the sleep system might be light-activated are described and the potential roles of orexin (hypocretin) and melanin-concentrating hormone are discussed. The visual input route is a practical avenue to follow in pursuit of the neural circuitry and mechanisms governing sleep and arousal in small nocturnal mammals and the organizational principles may be similar in diurnal humans. Photosomnolence studies are likely to be particularly advantageous because the timing of sleep is largely under experimenter control. Sleep can now be effectively studied using uncomplicated, nonintrusive methods with behavior evaluation software tools; surgery for EEG electrode placement is avoidable. The research protocol for light-induced sleep is easily implemented and useful for assessing the effects of experimental manipulations on the sleep induction pathway. Moreover, the experimental designs and associated results benefit from a substantial amount of existing neuroanatomical and pharmacological literature that provides a solid framework guiding the conduct and interpretation of future investigations.

In familial cases, a gene at chromosomal location 9p-24-22 is linked to RLS and the expressed mutation is Dopamine Receptor Specific Individual Sensitivity (DRSIS). The symptoms are triggered during changes in alertness, generally at sleep hours, resulting from insufficient dopamine transmission. The conscious experience of sensory abnormalities are described as 'an urge to move the limbs with or without paresthesias' leading to motor signs such as periodic limb movements and motor restlessness which exhibit temporary loss of extensor motor system dominance over the flexor motor system of the upright posture. The relationship of the expressed mutation to EEG alpha activity makes RLS a sleep disorder as well as a cognitive dysfunction. The recurrent character of sensorimotor symptoms impede the patient's ability to sleep, wake and force to move leading to insomnia. In Oner Tan Syndrome, the nonsense mutation in the same gene leads to underdevelopment of the neural substrates of upright posture. The defects include dopamine receptor deficiency (DRD) leading to severe cognitive dysfunctions and motor disorders-complete loss of extensor motor system dominance over the flexor motor system-quadrupedality, primitive speech, cerebellar symptoms, and strabismus. Comparisons between the neural substrates of sensorimotor symptoms seen in RLS and MRI findings for cases of Oner Tan Syndrome show cortico-cerebellar hypoplasias in the neural networks involved in upright posture. Both RLS and Oner Tan Syndrome seem to be due to different mutations in the dopamine receptor gene at 9p-24 locus, affecting the diencephalon dopaminergic system and the neural networks involved in upright posture.

NMDA antagonist MK801 recreates auditory electrophysiology disruption present in autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Autism; Electrophysiology; Endophenotype; Animal models; NMDA receptor antagonist	RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; MICE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; MK-801; OSCILLATIONS; IMPAIRMENT; POTENTIALS; LOCOMOTION; STEREOTYPY; BIOMARKER	Autism is a highly disabling neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social deficits, language impairment, and repetitive behaviors. There are few effective biological treatments for this disorder, partly due to the lack of translational biomarkers. However, recent data suggest that autism has reliable electrophysiological endophenotypes, along with evidence that some deficits may be caused by NMDA receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction. Similarly, the NMDAR antagonist MK801 has been used in behavioral animal models of autism. Since MK801 has also been used as a model of schizophrenia, this paper examines the independent and overlapping ways in which MK801 recreates the electrophysiogical changes present in both diseases. Mouse EEG was recorded in response to auditory stimuli after either vehicle or MK801 and the dose-response relationship for each measure was determined. ERP component amplitude and latency analysis was performed along with time-frequency analysis of gamma frequency inter-trial coherence and evoked power. Evoked gamma power and ITC were decreased by MK801 at the highest dose. P1, Ni latency and gamma baseline power were increased in dose dependent fashion following MK801. There were no amplitude changes in P1 or NI. MK801 caused alterations in evoked gamma activity, gamma ITC, gamma baseline power, P1 and Ni latency similar to findings in autism. These data provide evidence indicating that NMDAR dysfunction may contribute to deficits specific to autism and some that overlap with other disorders such as schizophrenia. Such observations could be important for developing novel therapeutics, as electrophysiological endophenotypes associate with functional measures and may provide early biomarkers for efficacy in clinical trials.

Methods. Eight patients underwent thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair with this new technique from 2005 to 2006. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 14 months. All patients had a previous type B dissection with subsequent aneurysmal degeneration into an extent I TAAA. Aneurysm repair was performed through a thoracoabdominal incision and circulatory arrest in seven and left atrial-left femoral (LA-FA) bypass in one. The grafts extended from the distal arch at the subclavian artery to the visceral and renal arteries. An 8 mm graft was then extended from the proximal to the distal graft with a spatulation of the graft allowing a side-to-side anastomosis of the graft to the posterior aortic wall incorporating multiple pairs of intercostal arteries. Intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) were monitored during each operation. Results. All patients were ambulatory at the time of admission. One patient had suffered a previous spinal cord infarction from the original dissection and had residual unilateral leg weakness prior to the TAAA repair. There was an average of seven pairs of patent intercostal arteries upon opening the aorta. We reimplanted an average of five pairs of vessels. There were no perioperative complications. No patients sustained transient or permanent paraplegia in the postoperative or follow-up period. The one patient with preoperative leg weakness had reported subjective increased strength in the affected leg after the operation. In four cases, normalization of SSEP waveforms did not occur until after reimplantation of the intercostal arteries despite full return of EEG waveforms, restoration of lower extremity perfusion, and rewarming of the patient. Follow-up CT scan angiogram demonstrated that all reconstructions were patent through the follow-up period. Conclusions. Paraplegia is an extremely morbid complication associated with TAAA repair. We describe a technique that allows reimplantation of almost all intercostal arteries as one patch circumventing the need for selective reimplantation. Furthermore, our technique ensures continued patency of this patch graft as the outflow resistance is decreased by creating a continuous flow loop. Although this is a small case series, we had no incidence of acute or delayed paraplegia in this high risk group. Our technique of intercostal reimplantation is applicable to all open TAAA repair at high-risk for paraplegia and may be an important adjunct in preventing spinal cord ischemia.

Automated seizure detection by mobile monitoring devices promises to settle this serious methodological issue. Here, we explored attitudes and preferences towards future devices for seizure detection in adult patients with therapy-refractory epilepsies. Methods: A total of 102 inpatients enrolled and underwent a newly constructed semistructured 30-minute interview on automated seizure registration. Results: Most patients would generally apply and permanently use seizure registration devices. Removable devices were preferred (e.g., wristband sensors), but also patch electrodes at invisible body sites appeared acceptable. Only a minority of patients would accept implantations for seizure registration (especially of depth electrodes). Also, permanent optical or acoustical surveillance were accepted by a few patients only. Most patients were ready to care for the device (e.g., charging battery), to have doctor's appointments for device control, and even to pay for the device. Seizure prediction was evaluated as an essential additional function. Only half of the patients wanted emergency calls in case of a seizure. Significance: Patients would accept automated seizure registration if the device had as little as possible negative effect on daily living. High acceptance might, therefore, be expected for hardware equipment as it is nowadays used by many healthy subjects for physiological self-monitoring and life-logging. The proper medical engineering task of the future, therefore, is to optimize sensors in those highly feasible devices and to establish reliable biomarkers and outcome measures for a diversity of diseases (including epilepsy) from data obtained by this generic hardware.

J	O'Brien, LM; Gozal, D				O'Brien, Louise M.; Gozal, David			Potential Usefulness of Noninvasive Autonomic Monitoring in Recognition of Arousals in Normal Healthy Children	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						Arousal; pulse transit time; pulse arterial tonometry	PULSE TRANSIT-TIME; OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP-APNEA; PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL TONOMETRY; RESPIRATORY EVENTS; INSPIRATORY EFFORT; EEG CHANGES; FRAGMENTATION; PRESSURE; SYMPTOMS; MARKERS	Introduction: Current methods employed for scoring arousals in children may not be sensitive enough. Because arousals are associated with increases in sympathetic tone, measurement of sympathetic activity using noninvasive techniques could provide useful surrogate markers for arousals in children. Methods: Ten healthy children underwent overnight polysomnographic assessment with simultaneous pulse transit time (PTT) and peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) measurements. Arousals (electroencephalogram and/or movement) and PTT and PAT events were identified independently, with scorers blinded to the other signals. Results: A total of 1985 events were identified in 10 records. Of these, 657 were electroencephalographic arousals, of which 548 (83%) were identified by either PTT and/or PAT. The sensitivity and specificity of PTT for recognizing arousals were 0.74 and 0.25, respectively, whereas the sensitivity and specificity of PAT for recognizing arousals were 0.57 and 0.13, respectively. Because movement arousals result in brief periods of artifact on the PTT and PAT signals, we reanalyzed the PTT and PAT events to include artifact events. Reanalysis increased the sensitivity of PTT for recognizing arousals to 0.96 and that of the PAT to 0.92 and increased PTT and PAT specificity to 0.30 and 0.19, respectively. Conclusion: Both PTT and PAT events are extremely sensitive techniques for arousal recognition in children. Furthermore, a substantial proportion of autonomic events occur in children without any accompanying visually recognizable electroencephalographic changes, suggesting that PTT and PAT may provide useful alternatives for arousal recognition during ambulatory sleep monitoring in children.

The contributions of ambulatory, vestibular, and optic self-motion signals to CA1 unit activity and EEG were studied while rats either walked or drove a car between locations on a circular track ( referred to as WALK and CAR, respectively) or experienced pseudomotion, in which the animal was stationary and the environment was rotated ( WORLD). Fewer pyramidal cells expressed place fields during CAR and those that did exhibited substantially larger place fields. The number of theta cycles required to traverse a place field increased, whereas the slope of the theta phase of firing versus position function was reduced. The presence and/or location of place fields were not well correlated between conditions. These effects were even more accentuated during WORLD. These results are not explainable by a simple " smearing out" of place fields but, in terms of size of place fields relative to the track size, are comparable with what would be observed if the track circumference was reduced and the animal moved around it at a correspondingly slower speed. Theta ( and its 14-18 Hz harmonic) power were dependent on velocity, but the gain of this function was substantially reduced during CAR and WORLD, again as if the rat were moving more slowly. The spatial scale over which the hippocampal population vector is updated appears to be derived primarily from the gain of a self-motion velocity signal with approximately equal components derived from ambulation, vestibular, and optic-flow signals.

Methods: We reviewed 59 nocturnal video-polysomnographic (VPSG) recordings of 30 adult patients (> 15 years) with a history of sleepwalking (SW). We scrutinized the semeiology of all 184 episodes recorded, classifying them into three groups according to three semeiological motor patterns characterized by increasing intensity and complexity: simple arousal movements (pattern I), characterized by head flexion/extension, head flexion/extension and limb movement or head flexion/extension and partial trunk flexion/extension; rising arousal movements (pattern II), characterized by a complete trunk flexion with patient sitting up in bed; and complex arousal with ambulatory movements (pattern III) characterized by SW. The VPSG recordings were compared to those of 10 healthy controls. Results: AD patients presented with 169 pattern I, 37 pattern II, and nine pattern III episodes. Pattern I developed into pattern II in 17 cases and into pattern II followed by pattern III in five patients. Pattern II developed into pattern III in four patients. Onset was abrupt in 55% of the episodes. Episodes lasted a mean (+/- standard deviation) of 33 +/- 35 s. Movements tended to halt temporarily during 72% of the episodes. We recorded 248 movements during sleep in the healthy controls, none of whom presented with AD patterns. Conclusion: We identified three specific motor patterns in AD patients not previously reported and not observed in healthy controls. Identification of these patterns could be important for diagnosis and serve as the basis for a new definition of AD in adults. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
