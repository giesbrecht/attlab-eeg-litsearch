Here, we tested whether frontal asymmetry at rest and during exposure to neutral, positive, negative, and trauma-related images would be associated with PTSD, and particularly with characteristic reexperiencing symptoms. Symptoms were assessed in trauma victims with (n=24) and without PTSD (n=15), using both retrospective measures and 1-week ambulatory assessments with a diary and a smartphone. While resting frontal asymmetry was unrelated to all retrospective measures, left-sided activation in response to the negative picture correlated with lower levels of psychopathology. Left-sided activation in the trauma-related picture condition was more specifically associated with less emotionally intense intrusions and responses to viewing the picture, even when corrected for other symptoms of psychopathology. These effects tended to increase when participants with possible overreporting tendencies were removed from the analyses. Moreover, trauma victims without PTSD (i.e., relatively more resilient individuals) displayed higher left-sided frontal activation in response to the negative picture, also when compared with a third group of healthy, trauma-free individuals (n=15). Our findings suggest that state-dependent changes in frontal asymmetry could serve as a biological marker of PTSD symptoms and could eventually be used for diagnostic purposes or as a target for neuromodulation interventions. Future studies should establish whether this marker can serve as an early predictor of psychopathology in recently traumatized individuals.

Nocturnal Dipping Is Preserved in Children With Sleep Disordered Breathing Regardless of Its Severity	PEDIATRIC PULMONOLOGY			English	Article						blood pressure; pediatrics; sleep	AMBULATORY BLOOD-PRESSURE; EEG SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; APNEA SYNDROME; HYPERTENSION; QUALITY; DISEASE; WAKE	ObjectiveSleep disordered breathing (SDB) in adults has been associated with a loss of nocturnal dipping in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate, however, there have been limited studies in children. We measured BP non-invasively and continuously overnight in 105 children aged 7-12 with a range of severities of SDB and 36 non-snoring controls to examine nocturnal dipping profiles. Study DesignChildren with SDB were divided into three severity groups according to their obstructive apnea hypopnea index. Nocturnal dipping profiles across sleep stages were described both as a proportion of children exhibiting a 10% fall in systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and heart rate (HR) from wake to sleep and according to SAP sleep/SAP wake ratio as extreme dippers (ratio0.8), dippers (ratio<0.8 and 0.9), non-dippers (ratio<0.9 and 1.0), and reverse dippers (ratio>1.0). ResultsThe mean fall in BP between wake and NREM 1/2, SWS, and REM sleep was not different between the groups and there were no differences between the dipping profiles of children in each group. ConclusionsSDB did not alter nocturnal dipping patterns of BP and HR compared to controls, a finding which may suggest that these young children have not been exposed to the effects of SDB long enough or that SDB severity was not great enough to affect nocturnal dipping profiles. However, further studies are required to determine if the elevated BP previously reported in this group of children will have long-term effects on the cardiovascular system.

A new algorithm for quadratic sample entropy optimization for very short biomedical signals: Application to blood pressure records	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Quadratic sample entropy; Blood pressure time series; Biosignal classification	DETRENDED FLUCTUATION ANALYSIS; PHYSIOLOGICAL TIME-SERIES; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; HEART-RATE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; COMPLEXITY; EEG	This paper describes a new method to optimize the computation of the quadratic sample entropy (QSE) metric. The objective is to enhance its segmentation capability between pathological and healthy subjects for short and unevenly sampled biomedical records, like those obtained using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). In ABPM, blood pressure is measured every 20-30 min during 24h while patients undergo normal daily activities. ABPM is indicated for a number of applications such as white-coat, suspected, borderline, or masked hypertension. Hypertension is a very important clinical issue that can lead to serious health implications, and therefore its identification and characterization is of paramount importance. Nonlinear processing of signals by means of entropy calculation algorithms has been used in many medical applications to distinguish among signal classes. However, most of these methods do not perform well if the records are not long enough and/or not uniformly sampled. That is the case for ABPM records. These signals are extremely short and scattered with outliers or missing/resampled data. This is why ABPM Blood pressure signal screening using nonlinear methods is a quite unexplored field. We propose an additional stage for the computation of QSE independently of its parameter r and the input signal length. This enabled us to apply a segmentation process to ABPM records successfully. The experimental dataset consisted of 61 blood pressure data records of control and pathological subjects with only 52 samples per time series. The entropy estimation values obtained led to the segmentation of the two groups, while other standard nonlinear methods failed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study examines the naturalistic, longitudinal effects of paroxetine and fluvoxamine on sleep quality in the home setting. Method: Fourteen healthy volunteers free of medical and neuropsychiatric symptoms entered a 31-day protocol: 7 days of drug-free baseline (days 1-7). 19 days of drug treatment (steady state during days 18-26), and 5 days of acute withdrawal (days 27-31). On day 8, the subjects were randomly assigned to receive either 100 mg/day of fluvoxamine or 20 mg/day of paroxetine (half receiving each drug) in divided morning and evening oral doses. Investigators remained blinded to drug assignment until sleep data had been analyzed. Sleep was monitored using the Nightcap ambulatory sleep monitor. Four standard and 3 novel measures were computed and compared using multivariate analysis of variance, analysis of variance, and Bonferroni-corrected comparison of means. Results: Sleep disruption was most clearly important demonstrated using the novel measures eyelid quiescence index. rhythmicity, and eyelid movements per minute in non-rapid eye movement sleep but was also apparent as determined by standard measures of sleep efficiency, number of awakenings, and sleep onset latency. Paroxetine disrupted sleep more than fluvoxamine, and, paroxetine- induced sleep disruption persisted into the withdrawal phase, Rapid eye movement sleep was suppressed during treatment (especially for fluvoxamine) and rebounded during withdrawal (especially for paroxetine). Conclusion: We confirm laboratory polysomnographic findings of SSRI-induced sleep quality changes and demonstrate the Nightcap's efficacy as an inexpensive longitudinal monitor for objective sleep changes induced by psychotropic medication.

Effects of caffeine on sleep and circadian timing in male adolescents-A randomized crossover trial	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Caffeine; Adolescence; Sleep; Circadian; Melatonin; Sleepiness	SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; NIGHTTIME MELATONIN; TEMPERATURE LEVELS; TEMPORAL PATTERNS; UNITED-STATES; ENERGY DRINKS; CHILDREN; LIGHT; HOMEOSTASIS; ADENOSINE	Adolescents often suffer from short and mistimed sleep. To counteract the resulting daytime sleepiness they frequently consume caffeine. However, caffeine intake may exaggerate sleep problems by disturbing sleep and circadian timing. In a 28-hour double-blind randomized crossover study, we investigated to what extent caffeine disturbs slow-wave sleep (SWS) and delays circadian timing in teenagers. Following a 6-day ambulatory phase of caffeine abstinence and fixed sleep-wake cycles, 18 male teenagers (14-17 years old) ingested 80 mg caffeine vs. placebo in the laboratory four hours prior to an electro-encephalographically (EEG) recorded nighttime sleep episode. Data were analyzed using both frequentist and Bayesian statistics. The analyses suggest that subjective sleepiness is reduced after caffeine compared to placebo. However, we did not observe a strong caffeine-induced reduction in subjective sleep quality or SWS, but rather a high inter-individual variability in caffeine-induced SWS changes. Exploratory analyses suggest that particularly those individuals with a higher level of SWS during placebo reduced SWS in response to caffeine. Regarding salivary melatonin onsets, caffeine-induced delays were not evident at group level, and only observed in participants exposed to a higher caffeine dose relative to individual bodyweight (i.e., a dose > 1.3 mg/kg). Together, the results suggest that 80 mg caffeine are sufficient to induce alertness at a subjective level. However, particularly teenagers with a strong need for deep sleep might pay for these subjective benefits by a loss of SWS during the night. Thus, caffeine-induced sleep-disruptions might change along with the maturation of sleep need.

However, they undergo drastic maturational changes during adolescence. Here we used a longitudinal approach (across 7 years) to explore whether developmental changes in sleep spindle density can explain individual differences in sleep-dependent memory consolidation and general cognitive abilities. Ambulatory polysomnography was recorded during four nights in 34 healthy subjects (24 female) with two nights (baseline and experimental) at initial recording (age range 8-11 years) and two nights at follow-up recording (age range 14-18 years). For declarative learning, participants encoded word pairs with a subsequent recall before and after sleep. General cognitive abilities were measured by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale. Higher slow (11-13 Hz) than fast (13-15 Hz) spindle density at frontal, central, and parietal sites during initial recordings, followed by a shift to higher fast than slow spindle density at central and parietal sites during follow-up recordings, suggest that mature spindle topography develops throughout adolescence. Fast spindle density increases from baseline to experimental night were positively related to sleep-dependent memory consolidation. In addition, we found that the development of fast spindles predicted the improvement in memory consolidation across the two longitudinal measurements, a finding that underlines a crucial role for mature fast spindles for sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Furthermore, slow spindle changes across adolescence were related to general cognitive abilities, a relationship that could indicate the maturation of frontal networks relevant for efficient cognitive processing.

Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed data from the California State Inpatient Sample, the State Ambulatory Surgery Database, and the State Emergency Department Database, that were linked with the 2009 Area Resource File and the location of the National Association of Epilepsy Center's epilepsy centers. The receipt of video-EEG monitoring was measured and used to indicate access to specialized epilepsy care in subjects with persistent seizures, identified as those who had frequent seizure-related hospital admissions and/or ER visits. A hierarchical logistic regression model was employed to assess barriers to high quality care at both individual and contextual levels. Results: Among 115,632 persons with persistent seizures, individuals who routinely received care in an area where epilepsy centers were located were more likely to have access to specialized epilepsy care (OR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.20, 2.72). Interestingly, the availability of epilepsy centers did not influence access to specialized epilepsy care in people who had private insurance. In contrast, uninsured individuals and those with public insurance programs including Medicaid and Medicare had significant gaps in access to specialized epilepsy care. Other individual characteristics such as age, race/ethnicity, and the presence of comorbid conditions were also associated with disparities in access to specialized care in PWE. Conclusion: Both individual and community characteristics play substantial roles in access to high quality epilepsy care.

J	Weitzman, JB				Weitzman, JB			Electronic medical devices - A primer for pathologists	ARCHIVES OF PATHOLOGY & LABORATORY MEDICINE			English	Review							IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER-DEFIBRILLATORS; SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; LONG QT SYNDROME; PRACTICE GUIDELINES COMMITTEE; RIGHT-VENTRICULAR DYSPLASIA; BLOOD-INSTITUTE WORKSHOP; PARKINSON-WHITE-SYNDROME; AMBULATORY CASSETTE-EEG; ASSOCIATION TASK-FORCE	Context.-Electronic medical devices (EMDs) with downloadable memories, such as implantable cardiac pacemakers, defibrillators, drug pumps, insulin pumps, and glucose monitors, are now an integral part of routine medical practice in the United States, and functional organ replacements, such as the artificial heart, pancreas, and retina, will most likely become commonplace in the near future. Often, EMDs end up in the hands of the pathologist as a surgical specimen or at autopsy. No established guidelines for systematic examination and reporting or comprehensive reviews of EMDs currently exist for the pathologist. Objective.-To provide pathologists with a general overview of EMDs, including a brief history; epidemiology; essential technical aspects, indications, contraindications, and complications of selected devices; potential applications in pathology; relevant government regulations; and suggested examination and reporting guidelines. Data Sources.-Articles indexed on PubMed of the National Library of Medicine, various medical and history of medicine textbooks, US Food and Drug Administration publications and product information, and specifications provided by device manufacturers. Study Selection.-Studies were selected on the basis of relevance to the study objectives. Data Extraction.-Descriptive data were selected by the author. Data Synthesis.-Suggested examination and reporting guidelines for EMDs received as surgical specimens and retrieved at autopsy. Conclusions.-Electronic medical devices received as surgical specimens and retrieved at autopsy are increasing in number and level of sophistication. They should be systematically examined and reported, should have electronic memories downloaded when indicated, will help pathologists answer more questions with greater certainty, and should become an integral part of the formal knowledge base, research focus, training, and practice of pathology.

Methods: We prospectively performed 24-hour ambulatory EEGs in a cohort of patients with genetic generalized epilepsy diagnosed and classified according to the International League against Epilepsy criteria. Overlapping of epileptiform discharges with K-complexes and sleep spindles was defined as epileptiform K-complexes and epileptiform sleep spindles. The presence of epileptiform K-complexes and sleep spindles was tabulated for each patient, and frequencies were calculated. We performed multiple regression analysis to study the influence of clinical predictors on the occurrence of epileptiform K-complexes and sleep spindles. The predictor variables tested in the model were seizure-free duration, epilepsy duration, genetic generalized epilepsy syndrome, number of antiepileptic drugs, use of sodium valproate, and use of lamotrigine. Results: A total of 107 patients (37 males and 70 females) were studied. The mean age was 28.5 +/- 10.7 years (range, 13-58). Juvenile absence epilepsy was the most common epilepsy syndrome in the cohort (31.8%), followed by generalized epilepsy with tonic-clonic seizures only (26.2%), juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (26.2%), and childhood absence epilepsy (14%). Epileptiform K-complexes and sleep spindles were seen in 65.4% and 10.3% of patients, respectively. None of the clinical variables had any significant impact on the occurrence of epileptiform K-complexes and sleep spindles in our multivariable analysis. Conclusions: Epileptiform K-complexes are common in the sleep EEGs of patients diagnosed with genetic generalized epilepsy. This underreported phenomenon highlights the important association of arousals and epileptiform discharges in genetic generalized epilepsy.

J	Hencel, M; Saniova, B				Hencel, Milan; Saniova, Beata			The comparison of general anaesthesia using the bispectral analysis (BIS) and spinal anaesthesia in terms of the one-day health care for haemorrhoid surgery using the HAL-RAR method	NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						one-day surgery; HAL-RAR; spinal anaesthesia; general anaesthesia; BIS		OBJECTIVES: The gradual advancement of one-day surgery and conjoint ambulatory anaesthesia results from possibilities to execute mini-invasive surgeries. Such surgeries offer great benefits to the patient due to faster reconvalescence and less pain as well as faster return to normal life. The HAL-RAR method for haemorrhoid surgery, introduced as early as in 1995 by Dr. Morigan in Japan. DESIGN AND SETTING: The goal of our study including 137 patients was research of effects of the spinal and general anaesthesia while monitoring the Bispectral Index (BIS) during the surgery. We focused mainly on the need of postoperative analgesia and possibility to discharge patient to home care after the surgery with the above mentioned type of anaesthesia. BIS helped us to monitor the sufficiency of anaesthesia and anaesthetics dosage regulation that was reflected in earlier awakening and faster reconvalescence, as well as saving anaesthetics. RESULTS: The length of surgery was not affected by the particular type of anaesthetic procedures (25.7 minutes for the general anaesthesia and 30.2 minutes for the spinal anaesthesia). The need for postoperative analgesia was necessary for the period of 240.0 minutes after the completion of surgery for the general anaesthesia and 313.0 minutes for the spinal anaesthesia after the administration of anaesthetics intrathecally. CONCLUSIONS: BIS is a processed EEG parameter measuring the hypnotic effect of hypnotics and sedatives in brain. BIS helps to reduce the use of anaesthetics during anaesthesia. Our results are promising and we continue in the study, monitoring also other possible parameters.

J	Bailine, SH; Petrides, G; Doft, M; Lui, G				Bailine, SH; Petrides, G; Doft, M; Lui, G			Indications for the use of propofol in electroconvulsive therapy	JOURNAL OF ECT			English	Article						ECT; anesthesia; propofol; prolonged seizures; nausea; vomiting; adolescents	SEIZURE DURATION; ECT; ANESTHESIA; ADOLESCENTS	Background: Propofol is an anesthetic agent commonly used for ambulatory surgery because is associated with rapid recovery and a benign side effect profile. In electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), its use is limited because of its seizure-shortening effects, and is recommended only for patients with preexisting cardiac conditions requiring attenuated hemodynamic response during treatment. We have identified two additional significant indications for propofol: to induce shorter seizures in patients with prolonged seizures and to minimize post-ictal nausea and vomiting. Methods: We reviewed the records of 340 patients treated with ECT. We identified 28 patients who were switched from methohexital to propofol anesthesia due to adverse effects or to avoid prolonged seizures. Results: Twenty-two patients were switched from methohexital anesthesia to propofol because they had already experienced long seizures. Nine patients had seizures longer than 180 seconds requiring termination with a benzodiazepine. The switch resulted in an average shortening of the EEG recorded seizures by 38.7%. Eight of the 22 (36.4%) patients were adolescents. These 8 comprised 53% of the total of 15 adolescents treated with ECT in our service. Five of the 15 (33%) had seizures longer than 180 seconds. Finally, 7 of the 28 patients were switched to propofol because of nausea and vomiting, which was sianificantly reduced. No side effects were noted, and none of these patients needed to switch back to methohexital. Conclusion: Propofol may be a useful alternative to methohexital for the treatment of patients who have excessively long seizures and/or severe nausea and vomiting after ECT. Such seizures are more common among adolescents.

A multi-disciplinary clinic for SCN8A-related epilepsy	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						Epileptic encephalopathy; SCN8A; Ion channel gene defects; Neuropsychological assessment; Levetiracetam	DE-NOVO MUTATIONS; SCN8A MUTATION; ONSET; ENCEPHALOPATHY; ATROPHY; PATIENT; FAMILY	Objective: We endeavored to evaluate a cohort of patients diagnosed with SCN8A-related epilepsy in a multi-disciplinary clinic and to create a bio-repository. Methods: We recruited patients with epilepsy due to SCN8A variants at Children's National Medical Center, through family organizations, or SCN8A.net. Study procedures included medical record review, review of EEG and MRI data, clinical evaluation, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Third Edition (VABS-3), DNA extraction, and preparation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Results: Seventeen patients (9 months - 19 years) completed the study. Age at seizure onset was 1 day to 4 years old (median age 4 months). Epilepsy phenotype ranged from mild epilepsy to severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Medications targeting the voltage-gated sodium channel were most often effective, while levetiracetam resulted in worsening seizures and/or developmental regression in 7/16 (p < 0.05). VABS-3 scores were below age expectations for most children; older children had lower scores. Neurological examination revealed hypotonia (13), spastic quadriparesis (1), ataxia (9), dyskinesia (2)/dystonia (7), and four non-ambulatory. Conclusions: This is the first report of a large series of patients with epilepsy due to SCN8A variants evaluated in a single multi-disciplinary clinic. By utilizing a more comprehensive and consistent evaluation, we clarify specific seizure and epilepsy types, describe a distinct epilepsy phenotype in a patient with a nonsense variant, delineate patterns of developmental delay, language, and swallow function (specifically anomie aphasia and flaccid dysarthria), identify and characterize movement disorders, report common findings on physical exam, and demonstrate clinical worsening with levetiracetam.

Nonlinear surrogate modeling of tibio-femoral joint interactions	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Surrogate model; Data-driven model; Nonlinear dynamic model; System identification; Tibio-femoral interaction; Ensemble	NEURAL-NETWORK MODEL; BIOLOGICAL-SYSTEMS; MUSCLE FORCES; IDENTIFICATION; WIENER; MOMENTS; EEG	Musculoskeletal modeling can predict muscle forces and the resulting motion and loading during human ambulatory activities. A better understanding of the loading environment on hard and soft tissues can enhance our understanding of ligament injury and prevention, tissue engineering, prosthetic design, osteoporosis, and osteoarthritis. The current state-of-the-art in movement simulation is to use simplified representation of the joints, such as representing the knee as a simple hinge joint. The aim of this study is to produce data-driven surrogate models which effectively capture the complex three-dimensional behavior of tibio-femoral joint interactions and that have the ease of use and computational efficiency required for incorporation in existing neuromusculoskeletal simulations. In order to meet our objective, we explored and compared the performance and sensitivity of nonlinear Hammerstein-Wiener, nonlinear autoregressive, and time delay neural network models under different configurations, individually and in ensembles. These models learned from solutions calculated by a validated multibody model of the knee. Inputs to the surrogate models were positions and orientations of the tibia relative to the femur, and the outputs were resulting forces and torques at the tibia with respect to the femur. Models were mixed using mean (sum) rule, weighted mean, and stacked generalization ensemble methods. It was observed that individually, time delay neural network models performed better than other models with normalized mean square errors between 0.0509 and 0.0889 on test data. Among the ensembles, stacked generalization provided the best results reducing test errors by 13-40%. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An improved surrogate method for detecting the presence of chaos in gait	JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS			English	Article						locomotion; nonlinear analysis; gait; chaos; surrogation	TIME-SERIES; WALKING; STABILITY; DYNAMICS	It has been suggested that the intercycle variability present in the time series of biomechanical gait data is of chaotic nature. However, the proper methodology for the correct determination of whether intercycle fluctuations in the data are deterministic chaos or random noise has not been identified. Our goal was to evaluate the pseudoperiodic surrogation (PPS) [Small et al., 2001. Surrogate test for pseudoperiodic time series data. Physical Review Letters 87(18), 188,101-188,104], and the surrogation algorithms of Theiler et al. [1992. Testing for nonlinearity in time series: the method of surrogate data. Physica D 58(1-4), 77-94] and of Theiler and Rapp [1996. Re-examination of the evidence for low-dimensional, nonlinear structure in the human electroencephalogram. Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology 98, 213-222], to determine which is the more robust procedure for the verification of the presence of chaos in gait time series. The knee angle kinematic time series from six healthy subjects, generated from a 2-min walk, were processed with both algorithms. The Lyapunov exponent (LyE) and the approximate entropy (ApEn) were calculated from the original data and both surrogates. Paired t-tests that compared the LyE and the ApEn values revealed significant differences between both surrogated time series and the original data, indicating the presence of deterministic chaos in the original data. However, the Theiler algorithm affected the intracycle dynamics of the gait time series by changing their overall shape. This resulted in significantly higher LyE and ApEn values for the Theiler-surrogated data when compared with both the original and the PPS-generated data. Thus, the discovery of significant differences was a false positive because it was not based on differences in the intercycle dynamics but rather on the fact that the time series was of a completely different shape. The PPS algorithm, on the other hand, preserved the intracycle dynamics of the original time series, making it more suitable for the investigation of the intercycle dynamics and the identification of the presence of chaos in the gait time series.

Each subject received a standardized evaluation, which included the following: 1) Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire; 2) interview regarding child's medical and sociofamilial history, orthodontic history, schooling, psychological difficulties, medication intake, and family history of medical and sleep disorders; 3) general pediatric physical examination and neurologic, otolaryngological, and craniofacial examination by a specialist; 4) obtaining medical history on variables relevant to early life sleep disorders; 5) polysomnography, which included electroencephalogram (EEG; C3/A2, Fp1/T1, T1/O1, O1/C3, C4/A1, Fp2/T2, T2/O2, O2/C4), chin and leg electromyelogram, right and left electro-oculogram, and electrocardiogram (modified V2 lead); respiration was monitored with a nasal cannula/pressure transducer system, mouth thermistor, chest and abdominal bands, pulse oximeter, and neck microphone; respiratory effort was monitored with calibrated esophageal manometry; variables were collected on a computerized sleep system; and 6) available family members with a positive history of sleep terrors and sleepwalking received clinical evaluations similar to those used for index cases; they also underwent ambulatory monitoring with an Edentrace system, which monitors heart rate, body position, oro-nasal flow, chest impedance, breathing noises (neck microphone), and pulse oximetry. Movements are deduced from artifact, and leg movements may be recorded on one channel if the equipment is preset for such recording. Subjects used logs to record "lights out" time, "lights on" time, nocturnal awakenings, and other events that occurred during the night. All original and follow-up recordings were rescored by 2 of 4 randomly selected specialists who were blind to subject identity. Mann-Whitney U test was used for group comparison. Nonparametric chi(2) test was used to compare percentages of symptoms in symptomatic children versus control children. Results. Eighty-four children (5 with sleep terrors and 79 with both sleep terrors and sleepwalking) and 36 normal control children formed the studied population. All subjects were Tanner stage 1 (prepubertal). None of the control children had any parasomnias. Fifty-one (61%) of 84 children with parasomnia had a diagnosis of an additional sleep disorder: 49 with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and 2 with restless leg syndrome (RLS). Twenty-nine of the children with both parasomnia and SDB had a positive family history of parasomnias, and 24 of the 29 also had a positive family history of SDB. Of the 51 children with associated sleep disorders, 45 were treated. Forty-three of 49 children with SDB were treated with tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, and/or turbinate revision, and 2 of 2 children with RLS were treated with Pramipexole, a dopamine agonist, at bedtime. Treatment of the precipitating sleep disorder eliminated parasomnias in all 45 children. In all 43 children who received surgery, polysomnography performed 3 to 4 months later indicated the disappearance of SDB. The recordings also showed an absence of confusional arousals. The number of EEG arousals significantly decreased from a mean of 9 +/- 2.6 EEG arousals greater than or equal to 3 seconds/hour during total sleep time to 3 +/- 1.5. The number of EEG arousals greater than or equal to 3 seconds during the first sleep cycle of slow wave sleep (stage 3-4 non-rapid eye movement sleep) decreased from 4 +/- 1.4 to 1 +/- 0.2. In all surgically treated cases, parents also reported subsequent absence of the parasomnia. The 2 symptomatic children who were treated with Pramipexole had a complete absence of confusional arousals on the follow-up recording and reported no parasomnia since treatment. The periodic limb movement syndrome arousal index (number of EEG arousals associated with periodic limb movement/hour) decreased from 11 and 16 to 0 and 0.2, respectively. Parasomnia persisted in the 6 children who were untreated for SDB. Surgeons had refused to perform surgery on these children because of lack of data on the relationship between parasomnia and SDB-related tonsil and adenoid enlargement. Conclusion. Children with chronic parasomnias may often also present SDB or, to a lesser extent, RLS. Furthermore, the disappearance of the parasomnias after the treatment of the SDB or RLS periodic limb movement syndrome suggests that the latter may trigger the former. The high frequency of SDB in family members of children with parasomnia provided additional evidence that SDB may manifest as parasomnias in children. Children with parasomnias are not systematically monitored during sleep, although past studies have suggested that patients with sleep terrors or sleepwalking have an elevated level of brief EEG arousals. When children receive polysomnographies, discrete patterns (eg, nasal flow limitation, abnormal respiratory effort, bursts of high theta or slow alpha EEG frequencies) should be sought; apneas are rarely found in children. Children's respiration during sleep should be monitored with nasal cannula/pressure transducer system and/or esophageal manometry, which are more sensitive than the thermistors or thermocouples currently used in many laboratories. The clear, prompt improvement of severe parasomnia in children who are treated for SDB, as defined here, provides important evidence that subtle SDB can have substantial health-related significance. Also noteworthy is the report of familial presence of parasomnia. Studies of twin cohorts and families with sleep terror and sleepwalking suggest genetic involvement of parasomnias. RLS and SDB have been shown to have familial recurrence. RLS has been shown to have genetic involvement. It remains to be investigated whether a genetic factor directly influences sleep terror and sleepwalking or instead influences other disorders that fragment sleep and lead to confusional arousals. Additional studies are needed to investigate the association between SDB and non-rapid eye movement parasomnias in the general population.

Aged rats show dominant modulation of lower frequency hippocampal theta rhythm during running	EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY			English	Article						Aging; Treadmill running; Hippocampal theta rhythm; Physical activity; Heart rate	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; MOTOR-ACTIVITY; SLOW ACTIVITY; SENSORIMOTOR INTEGRATION; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; OSCILLATIONS REFLECT; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; WORKING-MEMORY; HEART-RATE; SLEEP	Aging causes considerable decline in both physiological and mental functions, particularly cognitive function. The hippocampal theta rhythm (4-12 Hz) is related to both cognition and locomotion. Aging-related findings of the frequency and amplitude of hippocampal theta oscillations are inconsistent and occasionally contradictory. This inconsistency may be due to the effects of the sleep/wake state and different frequency subbands being overlooked. We assumed that aged rats have lower responses of the hippocampal theta rhythm during running, which is mainly due to the dominant modulation of theta frequency subbands related to cognition. By simultaneously recording electroencephalography, physical activity (PA), and the heart rate (HR), this experiment explored the theta oscillations before, during, and after treadmill running at a constant speed in 8-week-old (adult) and 60-week-old (middle-aged) rats. Compared with adult rats, the middle-aged rats exhibited lower theta activity in all frequency ranges before running. Running increased the theta frequency (Frq, 4-12 Hz), total activity of the whole theta band (total power, TP), activity of the middle theta frequency (MT, 6.5-9.5 Hz), and PA in both age groups. However, the middle-aged rats still showed fewer changes in these parameters during the whole running process. After the waking baseline values were substracted, middle-aged rats showed significantly fewer differences in Delta Frq, Delta TP, and Delta MT but significantly more differences in low-frequency theta activity (4.0-6.5Hz) and HR than the adult rats did. Therefore, the decreasing activity and response of the whole theta band in the middle-aged rats resulted in dominant modulation of the middle to lower frequency (4.0-9.5 Hz) theta rhythm. The different alterations in the theta rhythm during treadmill running in the two groups may reflect that learning decline with age. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Eguren, D; Contreras-Vidal, JL				Eguren, David; Contreras-Vidal, Jose Luis			Navigating the FDA Medical Device Regulatory Pathways for Pediatric Lower Limb Exoskeleton Devices	IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL			English	Article						Pediatrics; Medical treatment; Legged locomotion; Sociology; Statistics; Injuries; Assistive technology; brain computer interfaces; medical robotics; pediatrics; rehabilitation robotics	CHILDREN; GAIT; WALKING	There have been significant advances in the technologies for robot-assisted lower limb rehabilitation in the past decade. However, the development of similar systems for children has been slow despite the fact that children with conditions, such as cerebral palsy, spina bifida, and spinal cord injury (SCI), can benefit greatly from these technologies. Robotic-assisted gait therapy (RAGT) has emerged as a way to increase gait training duration and intensity while decreasing the risk of injury to therapists. Robotic walking devices can be coupled with motion sensing, electromyography, scalp electroencephalography, or other noninvasive methods of acquiring information about the user's intent to design brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for neuromuscular rehabilitation and control of powered exoskeletons. For users with SCI, BCIs could provide a method of overground mobility closer to the natural process of the brain controlling the body's movement during walking than mobility by wheelchair. For adults, there are currently four Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved lower limb exoskeletons that could be incorporated into such a BCI system, but there are no similar devices specifically designed for children, who present additional physical, neurological, and cognitive developmental challenges. The current state-of-the-art for pediatric RAGT relies on large clinical devices with high costs that limit accessibility. This can reduce the amount of therapy a child receives and slow the rehabilitation progress. In many cases, the lack of gait training can result in a reduction in the mobility, independence, and overall quality of life for children with lower limb disabilities. Thus, it is imperative to facilitate and accelerate the development of pediatric technologies for gait rehabilitation, including their regulatory path. In this article, an overview of the U.S. FDA clearance/approval process is presented. An example device has been used to navigate important questions facing device developers focused on providing lower limb rehabilitation to children in home based or other settings beyond the clinic.

Some studies have reported that 5-HT acts as a sleeppromoting agent, but several studies have suggested that DRN 5-HT neurons function predominantly to promote wakefulness and inhibit rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Furthermore, recent studies have reported that there is a clear neurobiological difference between a waking state that includes alertness and active exploration (i.e., active wakefulness) and a waking state that is devoid of locomotion (i.e., quiet wakefulness). These states have also been shown to differ clinically in terms of memory consolidation. However, the effects of 5-HT neurons on the regulation of these two different waking states have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we attempted to examine the physiological role of DRN 5-HT neurons in various sleep/wake states using optogenetic methods that allowed manipulation of cell-type specific neuronal activation with high temporal and anatomical precision. We crossed TPH2-tTA and TetO-ChR2(C128S) mice to obtain mice with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) [C128S]-expressing central 5-HT neurons, and we activated DRN-5HT neurons or medullary 5-HT neurons. Optogenetic activation of DRN 5-HT neurons caused rapid transition from non-REM sleep to active wakefulness, not quiet wakefulness, whereas activation of medullary 5-HT neurons did not appear to affect sleep/wake states or locomotor activity. Our results may shed light on the physiological role of DRN 5-HT neurons in sleep/wake architecture and encourage further investigations of the cortical functional connectivity involved in sleep/wake state regulation.

Continuous wheel running is predictive but not necessary for phase shifts of this "nonphotic" type; hamsters aroused by gentle handling without running can also show maximal shifts. By contrast, physical restraint, a standard stress procedure and thus presumably arousing, is ineffective. To resolve this apparent paradox, phase-shifting effects of 3-h sessions of restraint or other stress procedures were assessed. In a preliminary study, phase shifts to arousal by gentle handling were significantly potentiated by the cortisol synthesis inhibitor metyrapone, suggesting that stress-related cortisol release may inhibit phase shifts to arousal. Next, it was confirmed that restraint in the subjective day does not induce phase shifts, but behavioral observations revealed that it also does not sustain arousal. Restraint combined with noxious compressed air blasts did sustain arousal and induced a significant cortisol response compared with arousal by gentle handling but did not induce shifts. Restraint combined with continuous horizontal rotation was also ineffective, as was EEG-validated arousal via confinement to a pedestal over water. However, 3 h of resident-intruder interactions (an intense psychosocial stress) or exposure to an open field (a mild stress) did induce large shifts that were positively correlated with indexes of forward locomotion. The results indicate that large phase shifts associated with arousal in the usual sleep period are neither induced nor prevented by stress per se, but are dependent on the expression of at least low levels of locomotor activity. Sustained arousal alone is not sufficient.

Recent research has suggested that GABA released from the histamine/GABA neurons acts on extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors and balances the excitatory effect of histamine. In the current study, we show the presence of vesicular GABA transporter mRNA in a majority of quantified hypothalamic histaminergic neurons, which suggest vesicular release of GABA. As histamine/GABA neurons form conventional synapses infrequently, it is possible that GABA released from these neurons diffuses to target areas by volume transmission and acts on extrasynaptic GABA receptors. To investigate this hypothesis, mice lacking extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptor delta subunit (Gabrd KO) were used. A pharmacological approach was employed to activate histamine/GABA neurons and induce histamine and presumably, GABA, release. Control and Gabrd KO mice were treated with histamine receptor 3 (Hrh3) inverse agonists ciproxifan and pitolisant, which block Hrh3 autoreceptors on histamine/GABA neurons and histamine-dependently promote wakefulness. Low doses of ciproxifan (1 mg/kg) and pitolisant (5 mg/kg) reduced locomotion in Gabrd KO, but not in WT mice. EEG recording showed that Gabrd KO mice were also more sensitive to the wake-promoting effect of ciproxifan (3 mg/kg) than control mice. Low frequency delta waves, associated with NREM sleep, were significantly suppressed in Gabrd KO mice compared with the WT group. Ciproxifan-induced wakefulness was blocked by histamine synthesis inhibitor alpha-fluoromethylhistidine (alpha FMH). The findings indicate that both histamine and GABA, released from histamine/GABA neurons, are involved in regulation of brain arousal states and delta-containing subunit GABA(A) receptors are involved in mediating GABA response.

Post-exposure therapy with human butyrylcholinesterase following percutaneous VX challenge in guinea pigs	CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						Bioscavenger; Nerve agent; Percutaneous; Guinea pig; VX; Medical countermeasures	NERVE AGENT VX; MICROINSTILLATION INHALATION EXPOSURE; MEDICAL COUNTERMEASURES; CYNOMOLGUS MONKEYS; DOMESTIC SWINE; PROTECTION; ATROPINE; SARIN; SOMAN; PHYSOSTIGMINE	Context. Human butyrylcholinesterase (huBuChE) has potential utility as a post-exposure therapy following percutaneous nerve agent poisoning as there is a slower absorption of agent by this route and hence a later onset of poisoning. Methods. We used surgically implanted radiotelemetry devices to monitor heart rate, EEG, body temperature and locomotor activity in guinea pigs challenged with VX via the percutaneous route. Results. Treatment with huBuChE (24.2 mg/kg, i.m.) at 30 or 120 min following percutaneous VX (similar to 2.5 6 LD50) protected 9 out of 10 animals from lethality. When i.m. huBuChE administration was delayed until the onset of observable signs of systemic cholinergic poisoning, only one out of six animals survived to 7 days. Survival increased to 50% when the same dose of huBuChE was given intravenously at the onset of signs of poisoning. This dose represents approximately 1/10th the stoichiometric equivalent of the dose of VX administered (0.74 mg/kg). Intramuscular administration of huBuChE (24.2 mg/kg) alone did not produce any changes in heart rate, brain electrical activity, temperature or locomotion compared to saline control. Survival following VX and huBuChE treatment was associated with minimal incapacitation and observable signs of poisoning, and the mitigation or prevention of detrimental physiological changes (e.g. seizure, bradycardia and hypothermia) observed in VX + saline-treated animals. At 7 days, cholinesterase activity in the erythrocytes and most brain areas of guinea pigs that received huBuChE at either 18 h prior to or 30 min following VX was not significantly different from that of naive, weight-matched control animals. Conclusion. Percutaneous VX poisoning was successfully treated using post-exposure therapy with huBuChE bioscavenger. The opportunity for post-exposure treatment may have particular relevance in civilian settings, and this is a promising indication for the use of huBuChE.

In this family seven out of nine members from one generation had dementia. Three showed slowly progressive course, two with typical clinical features of CJD, and two without details. The probaband is a 62 year old man, who initially presented with abnormal behavior at age 52. The symptoms gradually deteriorated into a bed-ridden state with no verbal expression at age 59. There was no 14-3-3- protein in CSF or PSD in EEG. MRI showed cerebral atrophy with T2 high intensity of the white matter. At age 62, he still responds to a call for his name. The proband's oldest brother showed similar clinical features, starting difficulty in word recall around age 64, followed by progressive mental deterioration but was ambulatory even just prior to death. He died unexpectedly and no autopsy was done. The other two brothers showed typical clinical features of CJD, with onset at age 41 and 51, respectively. Their clinical course wasabout one year, accompanying myoclonus, PSD and akinetic mutism. The brain weight was 1,320g and 1,260g respectively. In the cerebral cortex, severe neuronal loss and gliosis with spongiformic changes were present. Hippocampus was relatively spared. The cerebellum showed severe depletion of granular cells. Immunocytochemically the deposition of prion protein was of synaptic pattern in the cerebral cortex and confluent granular one in the cerebellar cortex. In addition, degeneration of the cerebral white matter was diffuse in one case but focal in another. In the latter case, 50RI was detected. So far, the results ofthe sequence analysis differ in two other reported families with 50RI. A current family may provide a direct evidence that two distinct phenotypes of rapidly or slowly progressive clinical course may arise from the same 50RI sequenceabnormality.

Improving the anesthetic process by a fuzzy rule based medical decision system	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Knowledge-based system; Fuzzy control; Intelligent devices; Drug delivery; Anesthesia	CLOSED-LOOP CONTROL; BISPECTRAL INDEX VALUES; PROPOFOL ANESTHESIA; PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT; CLINICAL-EVALUATION; HYPNOSIS CONTROL; LOGIC CONTROL; PID CONTROL; DEPTH; REMIFENTANIL	Objective: The main objective of this research is the design and implementation of a new fuzzy logic tool for automatic drug delivery in patients undergoing general anesthesia. The aim is to adjust the drug dose to the real patient needs using heuristic knowledge provided by clinicians. A two-level computer decision system is proposed. The idea is to release the clinician from routine tasks so that he can focus on other variables of the patient. Methods: The controller uses the Bispectral Index (BIS) to assess the hypnotic state of the patient. Fuzzy controller was included in a closed-loop system to reach the BIS target and reject disturbances. BIS was measured using a BIS VISTA monitor, a device capable of calculating the hypnosis level of the patient through EEG information. An infusion pump with propofol 1% is used to supply the drug to the patient. The inputs to the fuzzy inference system are BIS error and BIS rate. The output is infusion rate increment. The mapping of the input information and the appropriate output is given by a rule-base based on knowledge of clinicians. Results: To evaluate the performance of the fuzzy closed-loop system proposed, an observational study was carried out. Eighty one patients scheduled for ambulatory surgery were randomly distributed in 2 groups: one group using a fuzzy logic based closed-loop system (FCL) to automate the administration of propofol (42 cases); the second group using manual delivering of the drug (39 cases). In both groups, the BIS target was 50. Conclusions: The FCL, designed with intuitive logic rules based on the clinician experience, performed satisfactorily and outperformed the manual administration in patients in terms of accuracy through the maintenance stage.

However, information is insufficient on the comparative costs of different disease varieties. The purpose of this study was to compare the direct costs of epilepsy in referral patients with disease of different severity and duration. Methods: Patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy (NDE), seizure remission (SR), occasional seizures (OS), frequent non-drug-resistant (NDR) and drug-resistant (DR) seizures, and surgical candidates (SC) from 14 epilepsy centers were the target population. All patients were followed prospectively for 12 months and all medical and paramedical contacts for diagnostic and therapeutic services were noted with details, using ad-hoe diaries and semistructured questionnaires. Results: The study population comprised 525 consecutive children and adults with partial (68%), generalized (25%) and undetermined epilepsy (4%) as follows: NDE 70; SR 131; OS 108; NDR 101; DR 107; SC 8. Ambulatory visits (mean 2.8 per patient per year) were the leading service in all groups, followed by EEG recordings (1.8) and biochemical assays (1.1). At entry, the commonest drugs were carbamazepine (50%), valproate (37%), phenobarbital (21%), vigabatrin (14%) and lamotrigine (11%). New antiepileptic drugs (AED) were used increasingly with the severity of the disease. The total annual costs varied significantly across groups: 3945 Euro (SC), 2198 Euro (DR), 1626 Euro (NDR), 1002 Euro (NDE), 558 Euro (OS), 412 Euro (SR). The main item of expenditure was hospital stay (including day-hospital), followed by drug treatment and outpatient visits. The costs of outpatient services, hospital services and drugs varied significantly across groups. Conclusions: The direct costs of epilepsy vary significantly depending on the severity of the disease and the response to treatment. Hospital admissions and drugs are the commonest items of expenditure. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Methods: Eighteen children were examined with ambulatory polysomnographic recordings initially and after 3 months of KD treatment. Eleven children continued with the KD and were also evaluated after 12 months. Sleep parameters were estimated. Seizure frequency was recorded in a diary and seizure severity in the National Health Seizure Severity Scale (NHS3). QOL was assessed with a visual analogue scale. Child behavior checklist and Ponsford and Kinsella's rating scale of attentional behavior were used. Results: KD induced a significant decrease in total sleep (p = 0.05) and total night sleep (p = 0.006). Slow wave sleep was preserved, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep increased (p = 0.01), sleep stage 2 decreased (p = 0.004), and sleep stage 1 was unchanged. Eleven children continued with the KD and were also evaluated after 12 months. They showed a significant decrease in daytime sleep (p = 0.01) and a further increase in REM sleep (p = 0.06). Seizure frequency (p = 0.001, p = 0.003), seizure severity (p < 0.001, p = 0.005) and QOL (p < 0.001, p = 0.005) were significantly improved at 3 and 12 months. Attentional behavior was also improved, significantly so at 3 months (p = 0.003). There was a significant correlation between increased REM sleep and improvement in QOL (Spearman r = 0.6, p = 0.01) at 3 months. Conclusion: KD decreases sleep and improves sleep quality in children with therapy-resistant epilepsy. The improvement in sleep quality, with increased REM sleep, seems to contribute to the improvement in QOL.

The objective was to determine the degree of agreement between the two monitors. Methods: Anaesthesia was induced with propofol and fentanyl (0.1 mg) in 38 patients undergoing general anaesthesia for routine day-surgery. Maintenance anaesthesia (sevoflurane (20/38), desflurane (10/38) or propofol (8/38)) titrated by BIS XP (Aspect Medical, Natwick, MA, USA) and BIS and CSI (cerebral State Monitor, Danmeter; Odense, Denmark) index values were recorded every minute. No patient received muscle relaxation. Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation rating scale was used to assess level of sedation. Results: Pair-wise recordings (914) of CSI and BIS were collected. The indices showed similar pattern and decreased with increasing level of sedation, however with large ranges for each level of sedation. Median indices were similar during surgery (BIS: 50 (14-89); CSI: 51 (7-88)) and both indices increased (P < 0.01) when minor movements occurred (BIS 65 (40-83); CST 67 (40-89)). During maintenance of anaesthesia CSI > 20% from BIS-Index in 24% of readings, and on rare occasions CSI indices deviated > 100% from the BIS reading. When BIS < 40, CSI decreased slower than BIS and with wider spreading. Conclusions: When used for day-surgery anaesthesia without muscle relaxation, CSI and BIS show similar patterns and numerical values but with the incidence of occasionally large discrepancies between pair-wise readings. Which monitor is the more dependable remains to be established and cannot be implied from this initial explorative study.

Design: A 48-hour session in the laboratory, including 2 nights of polysomnography, preceded by 7 days of ambulatory actigraphy. Setting: Chronobiology laboratory. Participants: Twenty-four healthy young subjects: 12 morning types and 12 evening types selected by questionnaire. Each group included 6 men and 6 women. Interventions: None. Measurements and Results: A polysomnography night of 8 hours in duration was recorded according to preferred sleep schedule. Sleep-stage analysis revealed that morning types and evening types did not differ in sleep architecture. However, morning-type men showed a higher percentage of stage I sleep and lower sleep efficiency than evening-type men. Electroencephalogram spectral analysis was conducted in non-rapid eye movement sleep for 6 frequency bands. Morning types had more spectral power in low sigma (12-14 Hz) compared with evening types. The most robust difference between women and men was found in high sigma (14-16 Hz) and was not present between chronotypes. The decay rate of slow-wave activity (1-5 Hz) tended to be faster in morning types compared with evening types (P =.06). This rate was almost identical for women and men. Conclusions: These results agree with the hypothesis that homeostatic sleep regulation differs between morning types and evening types, with morning types showing indications of a higher rate of dissipation of sleep pressure during the night. Morningness-eveningness seems to affect sleep in a sex-specific manner, with men being more affected by their chronotype.

BIS correlates with the depth of sedation and anesthesia and with the end tidal volatile agent concentrations. The importance of monitoring the hypnotic state is that in combination with the currently monitored parameters and the clinical signs, it allows better balancing of the hypnotic and analgesic drugs, thus facilitating balance of anesthetic components. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To monitor the depth of the anesthesia with Bispectral EEG analysis and compare a pre-determined dose of propofol vs. a target oriented dose of propofol to obtain a BIS of 40-60, in total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: After institutional ethical committee approval and informed consent, this study was undertaken on fifty patients of either sex, aged between 18-65 years, belonging to ASA physical status 1 and 2, scheduled for elective ambulatory, and short surgical procedures between October 2010 to April 2012. The patients were randomly allocated into two groups A and B of 25 each. The patients were explained about the procedure and pre -medicated with tablet Alprazolam 0.5 mg at bedtime and 6 am on the day of the surgery with sips of water. The anesthetic technique employed was Total intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA). RESULTS: In our study we found that in group A there was a statistically significant fall in mean diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure. The mean BIS value in group A compared to group B showed a statistically significant decrease between 8-45 min, with the decrease between 10-25 min. being statically significant. This correlated with the higher rates of propofol infusion during first 20 minutes as per predetermine The Spo2 in both groups was statistically comparable (p> 0.05). The OAA/S score correlated well with the BIS score. A score of 5 correlated with a BIS of 94+-1.45 and 1 correlated with BIS of 60-+ 5d dose in group A. The emergence time was shorter in group B, compared to group A, there was a statistically highly significant (t: 6.6063, p: 0.000) difference. The recovery time was shorter in group B, compared to group A and there was a statistically highly significant difference. In our study, we found that by monitoring the Depth of anesthesia and titrating the dose of propofol to a targeted BIS of 40-60 in group B resulted in a lesser induction dose of 1.88+-0.230mg compared to 2.07-+ 0.170mg in group A where a predetermined dose of propofol was used. The total dose of propofol in group B of 5.94-+ 1.10 mg/kg was lower than 7.28 +-1.59 mg/kg in group A. The total dose requirement of 10.49+-2.66 mg/kg/hr. in group B was lower than the 13.66+-3.65 mg/kg/hr. in group A. In this study, in group B, by titrating the dose of propofol to obtain targeted BIS of 40-60, better optimization of drug dosage has been achieved with greater hemodynamic stability with adequate surgical anesthesia. CONCLUSION: In this study monitoring the depth of anesthesia with a BIS monitoring and titrating the dose of propofol to a targeted BIS value of 40-60 in TIVA resulted in adequate depth of surgical anesthesia with greater hemodynamic stability, lesser incidence of intraoperative and post-operative complications, leading to a faster emergence and recovery and reduced requirement of anesthetic drugs and cost effectiveness. All this ensured better patient satisfaction.	[Sreeraghu, G. M.; Narendra, Babu M.

We sought to determine whether these data could predict the clinical response to antiseizure drugs (ASDs). Methods First, newly added medications were identified in RNS System patients followed at a single epilepsy center. Daily detection rates including "episode starts" (predominantly interictal activity) and "long episodes" (often electrographic seizures) were compared before and after ASD initiation. Efficacy was determined from documentation of clinical improvement and medication retention. Next, the analysis was repeated on an independent sample of patients from a multicenter long-term treatment trial, using an efficacy measure of >= 50% reduction in diary-recorded seizure frequency after 3 months. Results In the single center cohort, long episodes, but not episode starts, had a significantly greater reduction in the first week for clinically efficacious compared to inefficacious medications. In this cohort, having no long episodes in the first week was highly predictive of ASD efficacy. In the multicenter cohort, both long episodes and episode starts had a significantly greater reduction for effective medications starting in the first 1-2 weeks. In this larger dataset, a >= 50% decrease in episode starts was 90% specific for efficacy with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 67%, and a >= 84% decrease in long episodes was 80% specific with a PPV of 48%. Conversely, a <25% decrease in long episodes (including any increase) or a 80%. Significance In RNS System patients with stable detection settings, when new ASDs are started, detection rates within the first 1-2 weeks may provide an early, objective indication of efficacy. These data could be used to identify responses to medication trials early to allow more rapid medication adjustments than conventionally possible.

The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the recording of the electrical activity generated by the heart. Its low cost and simplicity have made it an essential test for monitoring heart disease, especially for the identification of arrhythmias. With the advances in electronic technology, there are nowadays sensors that enable the recording of the ECG during the daily life of the patient and its wireless transmission to healthcare facilities. This type of information has a great potential to detect cardiac diseases in their early stages and to permit early interventions before the patient's health deteriorates. However, to usefully exploit the large volume of information obtained from ambulatory ECG, pattern recognition techniques that are capable of automatically analyzing it are required. Tandem feature extraction techniques have proven to be useful for the processing of physiological parameters such as the electroencephalogram (EEG) and speech. However, to the best of our knowledge, they have never been applied to the ECG. In this paper, the utility of tandem feature extraction for the identification of arrhythmias is studied. The coefficients of a regression using Hermite functions are used to create a feature vector that represents the heartbeat. A multiple-layer perceptron (MLP) is trained using these features and its posterior probability outputs are used to extend the original feature vector. Finally, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is trained on the extended feature vectors, which is then used in a GMM-based arrhythmia identification system. This approach has been validated using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. The accuracy of the Gaussian mixture model increased by 15.8% when applied over the extended feature vectors, compared to its application over the original feature vectors, showing the potential of tandem feature extraction for ECG analysis and arrhythmia identification.

Impact of Ramadan intermittent fasting on cognitive function in trained cyclists: a pilot study	BIOLOGY OF SPORT			English	Article						riders; fasters; intermittent fasting	PERFORMANCE; FATIGUE; BATTERY; TIME; EXPERTISE; PATTERNS; SPORT; LOAD	This study assessed selected measures of cognitive function in trained cyclists who observed daylight fasting during Ramadan. Eleven cyclists volunteered to participate (age: 21.6 +/- 4.8 years, VO(2)max: 57.7 +/- 5.6 ml.kg(-1).min(-1)) and were followed for 2 months. Cognitive function (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), Reaction Time index (RTI) and Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP) tests) and sleep architecture (ambulatory EEG) were assessed: before Ramadan (BR), in the 1st week (RA1) and 4th week of Ramadan (RA4), and 2 weeks post-Ramadan (PR). Both cognitive tests were performed twice per day: before and after Ramadan at 8-10 a. m. and 4-6 p. m., and during Ramadan at 4-6 p. m. and 0-2 a. m., respectively. Training load (TL) by the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) method and wellness (Hooper index) were measured daily. If the TL increased over the study period, this variable was stable during Ramadan. The perceived fatigue and delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) increased at RA4. Sleep patterns and architecture showed clear disturbances, with significant increases in the number of awakenings and light sleep durations during Ramadan (RA1 and RA4), together with decreased durations of deep and REM sleep stages at PR. RTI (simple and multiple reaction index) reaction and movement times did not vary over the study period. The RVP test showed reduced false alarms during Ramadan, suggesting reduced impulsivity. Overall accuracy significantly increased at RA1, RA4 and PR compared to baseline. At RA4, the accuracy was higher at 0-2 a. m. compared to 4-6 p. m. Despite the observed disturbances in sleep architecture, Ramadan fasting did not negatively impact the cognitive performance of trained cyclists from the Middle East.

This is important both ethically and from a design perspective. Imposing additional stress by using experimental methods can confound the usefulness of the results obtained. Collecting baseline data from unrestrained or minimally restrained animals is also essential if contextual stress is to be understood. We have been developing three parallel methodological pathways in an attempt to reduce invasiveness and increase data content. The first of these is an ambulatory physiological monitor (free-range physiological monitor - FRPM) that sits on an animal's back. It is both solar and battery powered and once fitted, can provide up to two weeks of data collection in the field, without further intervention. The FRPM enables processing of raw data from transducers collecting various physiological parameters, reducing the data stream volume and thus allowing sensible collection over a long period of time. The FRPM is controllable by radio-link;age, enabling downloading, on-line information collection, or allowing data collection to be turned off at anytime. The FRPM has been used successfully, longterm. to monitor the electroencephalogram (EEG). electrocardiogram (ECG), body temperatures and central nervous system evoked responses from animals freely behaving in the field. Our second pathway of development has focused on the construction of a microprobe that enables sampling and on-line measurement in the brain, the circulatory system and in other organs. Although this is an invasive technique, it offers advantages over current alternatives in terms of the quality of data obtained and the low level of invasiveness. The third methodological development we have been exploring is "sonophoresis", This method utilises the ability of ultrasound to allow certain compounds to "transit" from veins to the skin surface, where they can be collected and analysed. We have successfully used this technique to non-invasively sample several hormones in humans.

Fifteen children were examined with ambulatory polysomnographic recordings initially, and after 3 and 9 months of VNS-treatment. Sleep parameters, all-night delta power activity and movement times (MTs), used to account for arousals were estimated. Epileptiform activity was evaluated by spike detection. Seizure frequency was recorded in a diary. The severity of the seizures was scored with the National Hospital Seizure Severity Scale (NHS3). Quality of life (QOL) was assessed by a visual analogue scale. Behaviour problems were quantified by using the total score of the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL). VNS induces a significant increase in slow wave sleep (SWS) and a decrease in sleep latency and in stage 1 sleep. The number and density of MTs during total night sleep were significantly increased. There was also a significant increase in the number of MTs immediately related to the VNS stimulation periods. Of the 14 children with increased MTs, 10 had a reduction in epileptiform activity, and in clinical seizures, all had an improvement in NHS3, and 11 in QOL. Of the 10 children with increased SWS, eight also improved in QOL and eight in behaviour. Our findings indicate that VNS counteracts known adverse effects of epilepsy on sleep and increases slow wave sleep. This possibly contributes to the reported improvement in well-being. We also see an increase in MTs. This arousal effect seems to be of minor importance for QOL and could possibly be related to the antiepileptic mechanisms in VNS.

Thereafter, doses have been increased in 1-mg/kg/day increments up to 9-12 mg/kg/day in accordance with the clinical response. Each patient underwent an ambulatory (24 h) EEG monitoring before starting LTG therapy (time 0) and during the maintenance period at the end of LTG titration (time 1). After a mean follow-up period of 10.8 months (range 3 -28 months), a 100% seizure control was obtained in I I children (55.5%), a more than 75% seizure decrease was present in four (20%), and a > 50% seizure decrease in five (25%), with a mean LTG dose of 6.2 mg/kg/day (range 1.2-11) in the controlled group. Adverse events were present in three patients (15%); they were generally mild and transient. Our series confirms that LTG monotherapy may control typical childhood absence seizures in about half the children as well as it may decrease interictal generalized spike and wave discharges both in seizure-free and uncontrolled patients. The slow titration phase of the drug due to the risk of the skin rash may eventually reduce compliance. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is now possible to measure depth of anaesthesia using electroencephalography (EEG). Entropy, an EEG-based monitor can be used to assess the depth of anaesthesia using a strip of electrodes applied to the forehead, and this can guide intraoperative anaesthetic drug administration. Objectives The primary objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of entropy monitoring in facilitating faster recovery from general anaesthesia. We also wanted to assess mortality at 24 hours, 30 days, and one year following general anaesthesia with entropy monitoring. The secondary objectives were to assess the effectiveness of the entropy monitor in: preventing postoperative recall of intraoperative events (awareness) following general anaesthesia; reducing the amount of anaesthetic drugs used; reducing cost of the anaesthetic as well as in reducing time to readiness to leave the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE via Ovid SP (1990 to September 2014) and EMBASE via Ovid SP (1990 to September 2014). We reran the search in CENTRAL, MEDLINE via Ovid SP and EMBASE via Ovid SP in January 2016. We added one potential new study of interest to the list of 'Studies awaiting Classification' and we will incorporate this study into the formal review findings during the review update. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in adults and children (aged greater than two years of age), where in one arm entropy monitoring was used for titrating anaesthesia, and in the other standard practice (increase in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, lacrimation, movement in response to noxious surgical stimuli) was used for titrating anaesthetic drug administration. We also included trials with an additional third arm, wherein another EEG monitor, the Bispectral index (BIS) monitor was used to assess anaesthetic depth. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently extracted details of trial methodology and outcome data from trials considered eligible for inclusion. All analyses were made on an intention-to-treat basis. We used a random-effect model where there was heterogeneity. For assessments of the overall quality of evidence for each outcome that included pooled data from RCTs, we downgraded evidence from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two for very serious) study limitations (risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect or potential publication bias). Main results We included 11 RCTs (962 participants). Eight RCTs (762 participants) were carried out on adults (18 to 80 years of age), two (128 participants) involved children (two to 16 years) and one RCT (72 participants) included patients aged 60 to 75 years. Of the 11 included studies, we judged three to be at low risk of bias, and the remaining eight RCTs at unclear or high risk of bias. Six RCTs (383 participants) estimated the primary outcome, time to awakening after stopping general anaesthesia, which was reduced in the entropy as compared to the standard practice group (mean difference (MD) -5.42 minutes, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.77 to -2.08; moderate quality of evidence). We noted heterogeneity for this outcome; on performing subgroup analysis this was found to be due to studies that included participants undergoing major, long duration surgeries (off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, major urological surgery). The MD for time to awakening with four studies on ambulatory procedures was -3.20 minutes (95% CI -3.94 to -2.45). No trial reported the second primary outcome, mortality at 24 hours, 30 days, and one year with the use of entropy monitoring. Eight trials (797 participants) compared the secondary outcome, postoperative recall of intraoperative events (awareness) in the entropy and standard practice groups. Awareness was reported by only one patient in the standard practice group, making meaningful estimation of benefit of entropy monitoring difficult; moderate quality of evidence. All 11 RCTs compared the amount of anaesthetic agent used between the entropy and standard practice groups. Six RCTs compared the amount of propofol, four compared the amount of sevoflurane and one the amount of isoflurane used between the groups. Analysis of three studies (166 participants) revealed that the MD of propofol consumption between the entropy group and control group was -11.56 mcg/kg/min (95% CI -24.05 to 0.92); low quality of evidence. Analysis of another two studies (156 participants) showed that the MD in sevoflurane consumption in the entropy group compared to the control group was -3.42 mL (95% CI -6.49 to -0.35); moderate quality of evidence. No trial reported on the secondary outcome of the cost of general anaesthesia. Three trials (170 participants) estimated MD in time to readiness to leave the PACU of the entropy group as compared to the control group (MD -5.94 minutes, 95% CI -16.08 to 4.20; low quality of evidence). Heterogeneity was noted, which was due to the difference in anaesthetic technique (propofol-based general anaesthesia) in one study. The remaining two studies had used volatile-based general anaesthesia. The MD in time to readiness to leave the PACU was -4.17 minutes (95% CI -6.84 to -1.51) with these two studies. Authors' conclusions The evidence as regards time to awakening, recall of intraoperative awareness and reduction in inhalational anaesthetic agent use was of moderate quality. The quality of evidence of as regards reduction in intravenous anaesthetic agent (propofol) use, as well as time to readiness to leave the PACU was found to be of low quality. As the data are limited, further studies consisting of more participants will be required for ascertaining benefits of entropy monitoring. Further studies are needed to assess the effect of entropy monitoring on focal issues such as short-term and long-term mortality, as well as cost of general anaesthesia.

J	Amatya, B; Young, J; Khan, F				Amatya, Bhasker; Young, Jamie; Khan, Fary			Non-pharmacological interventions for chronic pain in multiple sclerosis	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review							QUALITY-OF-LIFE; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; LOW-BACK-PAIN; ELECTRICAL NERVE-STIMULATION; SELF-MANAGEMENT; SCALE; IMPACT; INDIVIDUALS; PREVALENCE; FATIGUE	Background Chronic pain is common and significantly impacts on the lives of persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). Various types of non-pharmacological interventions are widely used, both in hospital and ambulatory/mobility settings to improve pain control in pwMS, but the effectiveness and safety of many non-pharmacological modalities is still unknown. Objectives This review aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of non-pharmacological therapies for the management of chronic pain in pwMS. Specific questions to be addressed by this review include the following. Are non-pharmacological interventions (unidisciplinary and/or multidisciplinary rehabilitation) effective in reducing chronic pain in pwMS? What type of non-pharmacological interventions (unidisciplinary and/or multidisciplinary rehabilitation) are effective (least and most effective) and in what setting, in reducing chronic pain in pwMS? Search methods A literature search was performed using the specialised register of the Cochrane MS and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Review Group, using the Cochrane MS Group Trials Register which contains CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACUS, Clinical trials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 10 December 2017. Handsearching of relevant journals and screening of reference lists of relevant studies was carried out. Selection criteria All published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cross-over studies that compared non-pharmacological therapies with a control intervention for managing chronic pain in pwMS were included. Clinical controlled trials (CCTs) were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis All three review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the studies using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool for best-evidence synthesis. Pooling data for meta-analysis was not possible due to methodological, clinical and statistically heterogeneity of the included studies. Main results Overall, 10 RCTs with 565 participants which investigated different non-pharmacological interventions for the management of chronic pain in MS fulfilled the review inclusion criteria. The non-pharmacological interventions evaluated included: transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), psychotherapy (telephone self-management, hypnosis and electroencephalogram (EEG) biofeedback), transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS), transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS), hydrotherapy (Ai Chi) and reflexology. There is very low-level evidence for the use of non-pharmacological interventions for chronic pain such as TENS, Ai Chi, tDCS, tRNS, telephone-delivered self-management program, EEG biofeedback and reflexology in pain intensity in pwMS. Although there were improved changes in pain scores and secondary outcomes (such as fatigue, psychological symptoms, spasm in some interventions), these were limited by methodological biases within the studies. Authors' conclusions Despite the use of a wide range of non-pharmacological interventions for the treatment of chronic pain in pwMS, the evidence for these interventions is still limited or insufficient, or both. More studies with robust methodology and greater numbers of participants are needed to justify the effect of these interventions for the management of chronic pain in pwMS.

Epilepsy: Seizure Diaries in Research and Clinical Practice	AKTUELLE NEUROLOGIE			German	Review						Epilepsie; Anfallskalender; Anfallshaufigkeit; automatische Anfallsdetektion; epilepsy; seizure calendar; seizure frequency; automated seizure registration	ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS; TRACKING EPILEPSY; AMBULATORY EEG; DOUBLE-BLIND; LEVETIRACETAM; FREQUENCY; AWARENESS; EFFICACY; TOLERABILITY; CONVULSIONS	Zusammenfassung Fur die Steuerung der Pharmakotherapie einer medikamentenresistenten Epilepsie ist der Neurologe auf den Bericht des Patienten uber dessen Anfallssituation notwendig angewiesen. Patienten sind daher angehalten, einen Anfallskalender zu fuhren. Auch aus klinischen Studien sind Anfallskalender kaum wegzudenken. Mehrere EEG-gestutzte Validierungsstudien aus den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten haben jedoch ubereinstimmend gezeigt, dass Epilepsiepatienten einen wesentlichen Teil (30-70%) ihrer Anfalle nicht dokumentieren. Vor allem Anfalle aus dem Schlaf sowie komplex-partielle Anfalle werden in erheblichem Umfang nicht berichtet. Viele Patienten erkennen selbst unmittelbar nach einem Anfall nicht, dass sie gerade einen Anfall erlitten haben. Diese Beobachtung legt nahe, dass eine infolge des Anfalls eingeschrankte Bewusstheit fur das Anfallsgeschehen die entscheidende Ursache fur die fehlende Validitat der Patientenaufzeichnungen darstellt. In der klinischen Praxis sollte daher insbesondere eine vom Patienten berichtete Anfallsfreiheit zunachst kritisch betrachtet werden. Eine berichtete Anfallshaufigkeit muss im Durchschnitt um den Faktor 1,4-3,0 nach oben korrigiert werden. Fur die klinische Forschungspraxis sind die Folgen noch nicht absehbar. Die Validitat der meistgenutzten Therapieergebnisma ss e - Anfallsfreiheit, %-Reduktion der Anfallshaufigkeit im Verlauf der Studie sowie Responderrate (%-Patienten mit50%-Reduktion ihrer Anfallshaufigkeit) - hangt jedenfalls von der fragwurdigen Annahme ab, dass die Qualitat der Anfallsdokumentation durch die Patienten im Verlauf der Studie konstant bleibt und durch die Studienmedikation nicht beeinflusst wird. Derzeit werden verschiedene physiologische Ansatzpunkte fur eine praktikable automatische Anfallsregistrierung evaluiert. Patienten zeigten sich bei einer Befragung an einer solchen neuartigen Technologie durchaus interessiert, vorausgesetzt dass das Verfahren wie moderne Fitnessarmbander unauffallig angewendet werden kann. Abstract Patient seizure status reports are critical for the therapeutic management of drug- resistant epilepsy. For this purpose, seizure diaries have been established for use in clinical practice and also research. Several studies from the last two decades, however, showed that patients fail to document a substantial percentage (30-70%) of their seizures. In particular, nocturnal and complex-partial seizures are underreported. Many patients do not become aware of a seizure even shortly thereafter. This observation provides evidence for seizure unawareness as induced by the seizure itself as the most important cause for the lack of validity of patient seizure records. In contrast, noticed seizures are documented carefully. In clinical practice, especially patient-reported seizure freedom must be evaluated critically. Reported seizure frequencies must be corrected by a factor of 1.4-3.0 on average to achieve a more realistic estimate. Implications for clinical research are not fully clear yet. In any case, the validity of the most established therapy outcome measures, namely seizure freedom, % reduction of seizure frequency during the study and seizure responder rate (i.e. percentage of patients with 50% reduction of seizure frequency) depends on the critical assumption that seizure documentation accuracy remains stable during the study and is unaffected by the study medication. Currently several physiological approaches to feasible automated seizure registration are under assessment. In a recent survey, patients showed their general interest in such novel technologies if the device can be applied as inconspiculously and easily as modern wristband fitness trackers.

Multicenter clinical assessment of improved wearable multimodal convulsive seizure detectors	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Epilepsy; Convulsive seizures; Electrodermal activity; Machine learning	POSTICTAL EEG SUPPRESSION; SUDDEN UNEXPECTED DEATH; TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURES; WRIST ACCELEROMETER; AUTONOMIC CHANGES; DETECTION SYSTEMS; AUTOMATED SEIZURE; EPILEPSY; SUDEP; CHILDREN	Objective: New devices are needed for monitoring seizures, especially those associated with sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). They must be unobtrusive and automated, and provide false alarm rates (FARs) bearable in everyday life. This study quantifies the performance of new multimodal wrist-worn convulsive seizure detectors. Methods: Hand-annotated video-electroencephalographic seizure events were collected from 69 patients at six clinical sites. Three different wristbands were used to record electrodermal activity (EDA) and accelerometer (ACM) signals, obtaining 5,928 h of data, including 55 convulsive epileptic seizures (six focal tonic-clonic seizures and 49 focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures) from 22 patients. Recordings were analyzed offline to train and test two new machine learning classifiers and a published classifier based on EDA and ACM. Moreover, wristband data were analyzed to estimate seizure-motion duration and autonomic responses. Results: The two novel classifiers consistently outperformed the previous detector. The most efficient (Classifier III) yielded sensitivity of 94.55%, and an FAR of 0.2 events/day. No nocturnal seizures were missed. Most patients had <1 false alarm every 4 days, with an FAR below their seizure frequency. When increasing the sensitivity to 100% (no missed seizures), the FAR is up to 13 times lower than with the previous detector. Furthermore, all detections occurred before the seizure ended, providing reasonable latency (median = 29.3 s, range = 14.8-151 s). Automatically estimated seizure durations were correlated with true durations, enabling reliable annotations. Finally, EDA measurements confirmed the presence of postictal autonomic dysfunction, exhibiting a significant rise in 73% of the convulsive seizures. Significance: The proposed multimodal wrist-worn convulsive seizure detectors provide seizure counts that are more accurate than previous automated detectors and typical patient self-reports, while maintaining a tolerable FAR for ambulatory monitoring. Furthermore, the multimodal system provides an objective description of motor behavior and autonomic dysfunction, aimed at enriching seizure characterization, with potential utility for SUDEP warning.

Baseline elevation and reduction in cardiac electrical instability assessed by quantitative T-wave alternans in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy treated with vagus nerve stimulation in the AspireSR E-36 trial	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Epilepsy; Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy; T-wave alternans; Biomarker; Risk reduction	SUDDEN UNEXPECTED DEATH; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; RISK; REPOLARIZATION; MECHANISMS; MORTALITY; ARREST; SYSTEM	Objective: Reports of cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac pathology at postmortem examination of patients with epilepsy suggest a possible cardiac component of risk for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). T-wave alternans (TWA) is an established marker of cardiac electrical instability and risk for sudden death in patients with cardiovascular disease. We determined the TWA level before vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) system implantation and subsequently the effect of VNS on TWA in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Methods: Patients (n = 28) from the Seizure Detection and Automatic Magnet Mode Performance Study (E-36), a clinical trial of the AspireSR (R) VNS Therapy System (R) (NCT01325623), were monitored with ambulatory electrocardiograms (ECGs) similar to 2 weeks before de novo VNS system implantation and following 2- to 4-week VNS titration during a protocol-specified 3- to 5-day epilepsy monitoring unit stay with concurrent EEG/ECG recordings. The TWA level was assessed interictally by the Modified Moving Average (MMA) method. Results: At preimplantation baseline, TWA was elevated above the 47-mu V abnormality cutpoint in 23 (82%) patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. In 16 (70%) patients, TWA level was reduced during VNS treatment to <47 mu V, thereby converting positive TWA test results to negative. Peak TWA level in all 28 patients improved (group mean, 43%, from 72 +/- 4.3 to 41 +/- 2.3 mu V; p < 0.0001). Vagus nerve stimulation was not associated with reduced heart rate (77 +/- 1.4 to 75 +/- 1.4 beats/min; p = 0.18). Heart rate variability was unchanged. Significance: These findings suggest significant interictal cardiac electrical instability in this population of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and suggest that VNS may be a novel approach to reducing risk.

BRAIN NETWORKS ENCODING RECTAL SENSATION IN TYPE 1 DIABETES	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						diabetes; operculum; cingulate; rectal-evoked potentials; brain source analysis	PAINFUL ESOPHAGEAL STIMULATION; AUTONOMIC NEUROPATHY; GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; VISCERAL AFFERENT; INSULAR CORTEX; MELLITUS; EEG; GASTROPARESIS	Introduction: It has been shown that patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and gastrointestinal (01) symptoms have abnormal processing of sensory information following stimulation in the oesophagus. In order to find less invasive stimuli to study visceral afferent processing and to further elaborate the gut-brain network in diabetes, we studied brain networks following rectal electrical stimulations. Methods: Twelve type 1 diabetes patients with GI symptoms and twelve healthy controls were included. A standard ambulatory 24-h electrocardiography was performed. 122-channel-evoked brain potentials to electrical stimulation in the rectum were recorded. Brain source-connectivity analysis was done. GI symptoms were assessed with the gastroparesis cardinal symptom index and quality of life (QOL) with SF-36. Any changes in brain source connectivity were correlated to duration of the disease, heart beat-to-beat intervals (RRs), clinical symptoms, and QOL of the patients. Results: Diabetic patients with GI symptoms showed changes relative to controls in the operculum-cingulate network with the operculum source localized deeper and more anterior (P <= 0.001) and the cingulate source localized more anterior (P = 0.03). The shift of operculum source was correlated with the duration of the disease, severity of GI symptoms, and decreased RR (P < 0.05). The shift of the cingulate source was correlated with the mental QOL (P = 0.04). In healthy controls, the contribution of the cingulate source to the network was higher than the contribution of the operculum source (P <= 0.001), whereas in patients the contribution of the two sources was comparable. Conclusion: This study gives further evidence for CNS involvement in diabetes. Since network reorganizations were correlated to GI symptoms, irregularities of rectal-evoked potentials can be viewed as a proxy for abnormal bottom-up visceral afferent processing. The network changes might serve as a biomarker for disturbed sensory visceral processing of GI symptoms in diabetes patients. (C) 2013 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The effects of Ramadan on sleep and rectal temperature (Tre) were examined in eight healthy young male subjects who reported at the laboratory on four occasions: (i) baseline 15 days before Ramadan (BL); (ii) on the eleventh day of Ramadan (beginning of Ramadan, BR); (iii) on the twenty-fifth day of Ramadan (end of Ramadan, ER); and (iv) 2 weeks after Ramadan (AR). Although each session was preceded by an adaptation night, data from the first night were discarded. Polysomnography was taken on ambulatory 8-channel Oxford Medilog MR-9000 II(R) recorders. Standard electroencephalogram (EEG), electro-oculogram (EOG) and electromyogram (EMG) recordings were scored visually with the PhiTools ERA(C) software. The main finding of the study was that during Ramadan sleep latency is increased and sleep architecture modified. Sleep period time and total sleep time decreased in BR and ER. The proportion of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep increased during Ramadan and its structure changed, with an increase in stage 2 proportion and a decrease in slow wave sleep (SWS) duration. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep duration and proportion decreased during Ramadan. These changes in sleep parameters were associated with a delay in the occurrence of the acrophase of Tre and an increase in nocturnal Tre during Ramadan. However, the 24-h mean value (mesor) of Tre did not vary. The nocturnal elevation of Tre was related to a 2-3-h delay in the acrophase of the circadian rhythm. The amplitude of the circadian rhythm of Tre was decreased during Ramadan. The effects of Ramadan fasting on nocturnal sleep, With an increase in sleep latency and a decrease in SWS and REM sleep, and changes in Tre, were attributed to the inversion of drinking and meal schedule, rather than to an altered energy intake which was preserved in this study.

Medical care of chronic neurological diseases, such as Epilepsy, is being neglected. In this survey, we aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the care of people with Epilepsy (PwE) and to identify their risk factors for seizure worsening to direct better future medical care. We administered a web-based survey (submitted on August 5, 2020). It included socio-demographic, Epilepsy-related, and psychometric data (The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 Items(DASS21) and The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Regression analysis identified predictors of seizure worsening. We collected responses from an online survey of PwE during the pandemic. Out of 151 responders, 71 patients complained of issues related to Epilepsy management and all of whom reached the treating physician and solved their problems. Sleep quality was compromised in 84 patients (55.6%). Two-thirds of the patients in our cohort (66.2%) reported depression, 72.2% reported anxiety, and 75.5% reported stress. Eight patients (5.3%) got COVID-19 infection, and only one patient suffered from mild worsening of the seizure. The main concerns were shortage of medications for 46 (30.5%) patients, getting Coronavirus infection for 67 (44.4%) patients, and seizure worsening for 32 (21.3%) patients. Thirty-five patients (23.2%) reported seizure worsening, which was best explained by retirement or jobless state, having moderate or severe stress, poor sleep quality, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), fear of getting COVID-19 infection, fear of worsening of seizures, or shortage of medication. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, a significant percentage of PwE experienced worsening of their seizures. This unusual, challenging experience clarifies the urgent need to establish telemedicine services and home-based management of Epilepsy, including ambulatory EEG, home video, and medication delivery to patients' homes to provide continuous medical care.

The definition of RLS has evolved until certain key clinical features have been defined as diagnostic, while others are strongly associated: the urge to move is seen as primary. Epidemiology suggests ethnic variation with highest frequency in populations of European origin; family and genetic studies support a genetic basis to many idiopathic cases while links to secondary disorders usually involving low iron stores are also known. Abnormalities of brain iron transport and consequent dysfunction of the dopamine system are suspected sources of the disorder. Methods: The literature was searched for all references relating clinical neurophysiologic investigations to the diagnosis, assessment, and characterization of RLS. Results: RLS is defined clinically and diagnosed by medical history while its frequent concomitant, periodic limb movements (PLM), must be diagnosed by polysomnography or movement recording. Severity of RLS is generally assessed by subjective measures, but sleep recording and measurement of PLM frequency and association with sleep disruption are also used to measure severity. A provocative test, the suggested immobilization test, can also be used with both subjective and movement recording. RLS and PLM in RLS are both associated with the circadian cycle and are maximal early in the sleep period. PLM appear to be associated both with unstable EEG phases involving the cyclic alternating pattern and cyclical autonomic changes whose initiation may precede the muscle activity. Conclusions: While RLS remains a subjective disorder, neurophysiologic measures have been important, especially for assessment. Ambulatory methodologies may offer the most accurate and economical means of assessing motor activity as a key marker of RLS and of accurately measuring PLM from night to night. As the pathophysiology of RLS is better understood, more focused techniques may be developed to measure its presence and severity in individual patients.

Neuroprosthetics are being developed to manage this condition and thus improve the lives of patients. We aimed to test the feasibility of a semi-invasive technique that uses brain signals to drive an exoskeleton. Methods We recruited two participants at Clinatec research centre, associated with Grenoble University Hospital, Grenoble, France, into our ongoing clinical trial. Inclusion criteria were age 18-45 years, stability of neurological deficits, a need for additional mobility expressed by the patient, ambulatory or hospitalised monitoring, registration in the French social security system, and signed informed consent. The exclusion criteria were previous brain surgery, anticoagulant treatments, neuropsychological sequelae, depression, substance dependence or misuse, and contraindications to magnetoencephalography (MEG), EEG, or MRI. One participant was excluded because of a technical problem with the implants. The remaining participant was a 28-year-old man, who had tetraplegia following a C4-C5 spinal cord injury. Two bilateral wireless epidural recorders, each with 64 electrodes, were implanted over the upper limb sensorimotor areas of the brain. Epidural electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals were processed online by an adaptive decoding algorithm to send commands to effectors (virtual avatar or exoskeleton). Throughout the 24 months of the study, the patient did various mental tasks to progressively increase the number of degrees of freedom. Findings Between June 12,2017, and July 21,2019, the patient cortically controlled a programme that simulated walking and made bimanual, multi-joint, upper-limb movements with eight degrees of freedom during various reach-andtouch tasks and wrist rotations, using a virtual avatar at home (64.0% [SD 5.1] success) or an exoskeleton in the laboratory (70.9% [11.6] success). Compared with rnicroelectrodes, epidural ECoG is semi-invasive and has similar efficiency. The decoding models were reusable for up to approximately 7 weeks without recalibration. Interpretation These results showed long-term (24-month) activation of a four-limb neuroprosthetic exoskeleton by a complete brain-machine interface system using continuous, online epidural ECoG to decode brain activity in a tetraplegic patient. Up to eight degrees of freedom could be simultaneously controlled using a unique model, which was reusable without recalibration for up to about 7 weeks. Copyright (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Time domain HRV parameters of 24-hour data, frequency and non-linear domain HRV parameters were calculated using a 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) from subjects in a resting and awake state (5-min data from 9:00-10:00 a.m.). Circadian fluctuation (24 one-hour segments) and the night (00:00 - 05:00)/day (07:30 - 09:30) ratio of each HRV parameter were measured in (i) refractory epilepsy (n = 51) and (ii) healthy, age and sex matched controls (n = 50). Cosinor fit method was used to quantify the pattern of the circadian rhythm of HRV. Results: Compared to healthy controls, patients with drug-resistant epilepsy had significantly decreased time domain (mean_RR, STDRR, RMSSD, pNN50, HRV_triangular_index), frequency domain (VLF_power, LF_power, HF_power, Total_power) and non-linear domain (Poincare SD1, SD2, D-2) HRV measurements. There were also overall reductions in amplitude and the baseline of circadian curves of HRV parameter in the patients group, especially nocturnal inhibition of cardiac autonomic modulations was stronger than that in daytime. The majority of differences in HRV values between the two groups reached a maximum in early morning (usually 5:00 or 6:00 am.). No significant differences were found in the night/day ratios of multi-domain HRV measurements between patients and healthy controls (p = 0.862). Conclusions: The significant suppression of HRV parameters in patients with refractory epilepsy may reflect the inhibitions of both sympathetic and parasympathetic activities. This is notably the first time that marked circadian diversity of HRV measurments between the patient and control groups were found and quantified by cosinor fit method. The difference in amplitude increased during night with peak occurrence between 5:00 or 6:00 a.m. These findings may be linked to cardiac autonomic dysfunction and subsequent sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), which is reported to often occur during night or early morning. Taken together, HRV parameters may be potential bio-markers for predicting SUDEP.

A high-performance 8 nV/root Hz 8-channel wearable and wireless system for real-time monitoring of bioelectrical signals	JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						Neurological disorders; Bioelectrical signals; Analog front-end; High-performance; Wearable; Wireless; Bioinstrumentation	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; ATRIAL-FIBRILLATION; AMPLIFIER; DISORDERS; DESIGN; DEVICE	Background: It is widely accepted by the scientific community that bioelectrical signals, which can be used for the identification of neurophysiological biomarkers indicative of a diseased or pathological state, could direct patient treatment towards more effective therapeutic strategies. However, the design and realisation of an instrument that can precisely record weak bioelectrical signals in the presence of strong interference stemming from a noisy clinical environment is one of the most difficult challenges associated with the strategy of monitoring bioelectrical signals for diagnostic purposes. Moreover, since patients often have to cope with the problem of limited mobility being connected to bulky and mains-powered instruments, there is a growing demand for small-sized, high-performance and ambulatory biopotential acquisition systems in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and in High-dependency wards. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, there are no commercial, small, battery-powered, wearable and wireless recording-only instruments that claim the capability of recording electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals. Methods: To address this problem, we designed and developed a low-noise (8 nV/root Hz), eight-channel, battery-powered, wearable and wireless instrument (55 x 80 mm(2)). The performance of the realised instrument was assessed by conducting both ex vivo and in vivo experiments. Results: To provide ex vivo proof-of-function, a wide variety of high-quality bioelectrical signal recordings are reported, including electroencephalographic (EEG), electromyographic (EMG), electrocardiographic (ECG), acceleration signals, and muscle fasciculations. Low-noise in vivo recordings of weak local field potentials (LFPs), which were wirelessly acquired in real time using segmented deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes implanted in the thalamus of a non-human primate, are also presented. Conclusions: The combination of desirable features and capabilities of this instrument, namely its small size (similar to one business card), its enhanced recording capabilities, its increased processing capabilities, its manufacturability (since it was designed using discrete off-the-shelf components), the wide bandwidth it offers (0.5-500 Hz) and the plurality of bioelectrical signals it can precisely record, render it a versatile and reliable tool to be utilized in a wide range of applications and environments.

To date, less than 25 different mutations have been reported. So far, there are still little data on the key clinical diagnosis criteria and on the natural history of CDKL5-associated encephalopathy. We screened the entire coding region of CDKL5 for mutations in 183 females with encephalopathy with early seizures by denaturing high liquid performance chromatography and direct sequencing, and we identified in 20 unrelated girls, 18 different mutations including 7 novel mutations. These mutations were identified in eight patients with encephalopathy with RTT-like features, five with infantile spasms and seven with encephalopathy with refractory epilepsy. Early epilepsy with normal interictal EEG and severe hypotonia are the key clinical features in identifying patients likely to have CDKL5 mutations. Our study also indicates that these patients clearly exhibit some RTT features such as deceleration of head growth, stereotypies and hand apraxia and that these RTT features become more evident in older and ambulatory patients. However, some RTT signs are clearly absent such as the so called RTT disease profile (period of nearly normal development followed by regression with loss of acquired fine finger skill in early childhood and characteristic intensive eye communication) and the characteristic evolution of the RTT electroencephalogram. Interestingly, in addition to the overall stereotypical symptomatology (age of onset and evolution of the disease) resulting from CDKL5 mutations, atypical forms of CDKL5-related conditions have also been observed. Our data suggest that phenotypic heterogeneity does not correlate with the nature or the position of the mutations or with the pattern of X-chromosome inactivation, but most probably with the functional transcriptional and/or translational consequences of CDKL5 mutations. In conclusion, our report show that search for mutations in CDKL5 is indicated in girls with early onset of a severe intractable seizure disorder or infantile spasms with severe hypotonia, and in girls with RTT-like phenotype and early onset seizures, though, in our cohort, mutations in CDKL5 account for about 10% of the girls affected by these disorders.

The AAI1.6 algorithm extracts information from the midlatency auditory evoked potentials, the spontaneous electroencephalographic activity, and the detection of burst suppression. The former version of this monitor, the A-Line (R) auditory evoked potential index version 1.5, is only based on fast extracted midlatency auditory evoked potential information. Methods: After institutional ethics committee approval (University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium), informed consent was obtained from 13 patients (10 women, 3 men) with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status of 1, aged 18-65 yr, who were scheduled to undergo ambulatory gynecologic or urologic surgery. The authors evaluated for Bispectral index, A-Line (R) auditory evoked potential index, version 1.5, AAI(1.6) scaled from 0 to 100 and AAI(1.6) scaled from 0 to 60, the interpatient stability at baseline, the detection of burst suppression, prediction probability, and correlation with Ce-PROP, during a constant infusion of 1% propofol at 300 ml/h. The authors developed pharmacodynamic models relating the predicted Ce-PROP to each measure of cerebral anesthetic drug effect. Results: Bispectral index had the lowest interindividual baseline variability. No significant difference was found with prediction probability analysis for all measures. Comparisons for correlation were performed for all indices. The AAI(1.6) scaled to 60 had a significantly higher correlation with CePROP compared with all other measures. The AAI(1.6) scaled to 100 had a significant higher correlation with Ce-PROP compared with the A-Line (R) auditory evoked potential index version 1.5 (P < 0.05) Conclusions: The authors found that the application of AAI(1.6) has a better correlation with a calculated CepR,,p compared with a solitary fast extracting midlatency auditory evoked potential measure. Whether this improvement in pharmacodynamic tracing is accompanied by an improved clinical performance should be investigated using clinical endpoints.

Since there are currently no restorative treatments for this population, novel approaches such as brain-controlled prostheses have been sought. Our recent studies show that a brain-computer interface (BCI) can be used to control ambulation within a virtual reality environment (VRE), suggesting that a BCI-controlled lower extremity prosthesis for ambulation may be feasible. However, the operability of our BCI has not yet been tested in a SCI population. Methods: Five participants with paraplegia or tetraplegia due to SCI underwent a 10-min training session in which they alternated between kinesthetic motor imagery (KMI) of idling and walking while their electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded. Participants then performed a goal-oriented online task, where they utilized KMI to control the linear ambulation of an avatar while making 10 sequential stops at designated points within the VRE. Multiple online trials were performed in a single day, and this procedure was repeated across 5 experimental days. Results: Classification accuracy of idling and walking was estimated offline and ranged from 60.5% (p = 0.0176) to 92.3% (p = 1.36x10(-20)) across participants and days. Offline analysis revealed that the activation of mid-frontal areas mostly in the mu and low beta bands was the most consistent feature for differentiating between idling and walking KMI. In the online task, participants achieved an average performance of 7.4 +/- 2.3 successful stops in 273 +/- 51 sec. These performances were purposeful, i.e. significantly different from the random walk Monte Carlo simulations (p < 0.01), and all but one participant achieved purposeful control within the first day of the experiments. Finally, all participants were able to maintain purposeful control throughout the study, and their online performances improved over time. Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that SCI participants can purposefully operate a self-paced BCI walking simulator to complete a goal-oriented ambulation task. The operation of the proposed BCI system requires short training, is intuitive, and robust against participant-to-participant and day-to-day neurophysiological variations. These findings indicate that BCI-controlled lower extremity prostheses for gait rehabilitation or restoration after SCI may be feasible in the future.

We did a multicentre clinical feasibility study to assess the safety and efficacy of a long-term implanted seizure advisory system designed to predict seizure likelihood and quantify seizures in adults with drug-resistant focal seizures. Methods We enrolled patients at three centres in Melbourne, Australia, between March 24, 2010, and June 21, 2011. Eligible patients had between two and 12 disabling partial-onset seizures per month, a lateralised epileptogenic zone, and no history of psychogenic seizures. After devices were surgically implanted, patients entered a data collection phase, during which an algorithm for identification of periods of high, moderate, and low seizure likelihood was established. If the algorithm met performance criteria (ie, sensitivity of high-likelihood warnings greater than 65% and performance better than expected through chance prediction of randomly occurring events), patients then entered an advisory phase and received information about seizure likelihood. The primary endpoint was the number of device-related adverse events at 4 months after implantation. Our secondary endpoints were algorithm performance at the end of the data collection phase, clinical effectiveness (measures of anxiety, depression, seizure severity, and quality of life) 4 months after iniation of the advisory phase, and longer-term adverse events. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01043406. Findings We implanted 15 patients with the advisory system. 11 device-related adverse events were noted within four months of implantation, two of which were serious (device migration, seroma); an additional two serious adverse events occurred during the first year after implantation (device-related infection, device site reaction), but were resolved without further complication. The device met enabling criteria in 11 patients upon completion of the data collection phase, with high likelihood performance estimate sensitivities ranging from 65% to 100%. Three patients' algorithms did not meet performance criteria and one patient required device removal because of an adverse event before sufficient training data were acquired. We detected no significant changes in clinical effectiveness measures between baseline and 4 months after implantation. Interpretation This study showed that intracranial electroencephalographic monitoring is feasible in ambulatory patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. If these findings are replicated in larger, longer studies, accurate definition of preictal electrical activity might improve understanding of seizure generation and eventually lead to new management strategies.

Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome: Comparison between polysomnography and portable sleep monitoring based on jaw recordings	NEUROPHYSIOLOGIE CLINIQUE-CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Sleep disorders; Sleep disorders breathing; Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome; Mandibular movements; Jaw activity; Polysomnography; Polygraphic recordings	ACTIVATION; ASSOCIATION; POLYGRAPHY; DIAGNOSIS; MASSETER	Introduction.-Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) constitutes a new major public health problem because of its several pathophysiologic consequences such as cognitive disorders, excessive daytime sleepiness with risks of traffic accidents, cardiovascular implications, and decrease of quality of life. The necessity of a gold-standard polysomnography to ensure an accurate diagnosis implies an expensive, technical and time-consuming examination. Thus, it seems logical to develop new systems so as to diagnose SAS and to make it possible to detect apnoeas/hypopnoeas easily during sleep even at home. Aim of the study.-To assess a novel type-3 portable monitoring (PM) device, the Somnolter, and dedicated automatic analysis of several signals, one of which is the mandibular movement signal. Method.-We studied patients suffering from OSAS. For all the patients, a nocturnal diagnosis polysomnography (PSG) was recorded in hospital settings, based on six EEG channels, two EOG channels, chin EMG channel, EKG, and respiratory parameters. At the same time, the Somnolter PM device recorded the physiological parameters from its own nasal prongs, thoracic belt, pulse oxymeter, body position, and jaw movement sensors. A visual analysis of PSG recordings was made leading to the detection of apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI-PSG) and an automatic analysis of the Somnolter traces was performed to get automatic apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI-A). The added value of the mandible movement signals was the particular jaw movements related to arousals, to respiratory efforts and to sleep/wake state. A comparison was made between the automatic and gold AHls standard and the correlation was calculated between them. Results.-Ninety patients, aged between 47 and 70 years (mean age: 55.4 +/- 8.7) took part in the study. The linear regression and the correlation coefficient between AHI-PSG and AHI-A showed the good reliability of the automatic method. The Bland Altman analysis shows a correlation of 0.95 with a sensitivity of 83.6 and specificity of 81.8. Conclusion.-The dedicated automatic analysis based on mandibular movements presents a good potential for the diagnosis of OSAS. The AHI computed by the automatic method is correlated with the AHI-PSG and the Somnolter could easily be used both in hospital, and in ambulatory settings. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

A world wide network of professionals Must focus on basic scientific research programs and clinical and epidemiology Studies. Team work among different multidisciplinary professionals in clinical settings and within and among laboratories should address the global issues of SUDEP. if the correct term 'SUDEP' is used on autopsy reports and if verbal autopsies postmortem are conducted when needed, the true incidence of SUDEP may be found to be much higher than previously thought and the market for new antiepileptics and other drugs to prevent SUDEP will be larger. Symposia should discuss new data and lessons learned from the last 20 to 30 years to be applied by scientists and clinicians worldwide to gain a better understanding of SUDEP. 'Think Out of the box' when evaluating an established animal model with potential for modification(s) to study mechanism(s) of SUDER Multiple relevant animal models are needed to understand the pathophysiology of SUDEP, hypothesize about effective treatments, develop small pilot studies in persons with epilepsy, and conduct Confirmatory large-scale clinical trials. The fields of pharmacology, clinical pharmacology, and cardiology have much to offer as we work to improve compliance, develop new antiepileptic drugs, and apply different categories of drugs to resolve the mystery of SUDEP. Ambulatory simultaneous EKG and EEG telemetry monitoring of patients at risk for Sudden death will help identify cardiac vs. brain epileptogenic triggers for treatment to decrease risk of SUDEP. Respiratory function monitoring is also needed. Academic fellowships and competitions for medical Students, postdoctoral fellows, residents and faculty will attract medical and graduate trainees to work on SUDEP. Grant funding is essential to move the SUDEP knowledge base forward. Leaders Must solve the global mystery of SUDEP using a leadership philosophy foundation that provides innovative vision and approaches for SUDEP research and teaching programs. The interaction of teaching and research is essential: while a student is learning how to conduct research he must simultaneously learn to become a teacher. Medical and graduate leaders must provide vision and a fertile environment to teach students of today to become the self learners and leaders of tomorrow to find Solutions for SUDEP.

The use of bispectral index (BIS) to guide the dose of anaesthetic may have certain advantages over clinical signs. This is the second update of a review originally published in 2007. Objectives The primary objective of this review focused on whether the incorporation of BIS into the standard practice for management of anaesthesia can reduce the risk of intraoperative awareness, consumption of anaesthetic agents, recovery time and total cost of anaesthesia in surgical patients undergoing general anaesthesia. Search methods In this updated version, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1990 to 31 January 2013), EMBASE (1990 to 31 January 2013) and reference lists of articles. Previously, we searched to May 2009. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials comparing BIS with standard practice criteria for titration of anaesthetic agents. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality, extracted data and analysed the data. We contacted study authors for further details. Main results We included 36 trials. In studies using clinical signs as standard practice, the results demonstrated a significant effect of the BIS-guided anaesthesia in reducing the risk of intraoperative awareness among surgical patients at high risk for awareness (7761 participants; odds ratio (OR) 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.48). This effect was not demonstrated in studies using end tidal anaesthetic gas (ETAG) monitoring as standard practice (26,530 participants; OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.56 to 2.26). BIS-guided anaesthesia reduced the requirement for propofol by 1.32 mg/kg/hr (672 participants; 95% CI -1.91 to -0.73) and for volatile anaesthetics (desflurane, sevoflurane, isoflurane) by 0.65 minimal alveolar concentration equivalents (MAC) (95% CI -1.01 to -0.28) in 985 participants. Irrespective of the anaesthetics used, BIS reduced the following recovery times: time for eye opening (2557 participants; by 1.93 min, 95% CI -2.70 to -1.16), response to verbal command (777 participants; by 2.73 min, 95% CI -3.92 to -1.54), time to extubation (1501 participants; by 2.62 min, 95% CI -3.46 to -1.78), and time to orientation (373 participants; by 3.06 min, 95% CI -3.63 to -2.50). BIS shortened the duration of postanaesthesia care unit stay by 6.75 min (1953 participants; 95% CI -11.20 to -2.31) but did not significantly reduce the time to home readiness (329 participants; -7.01 min, 95% CI -30.11 to 16.09). Authors' conclusions BIS-guided anaesthesia can reduce the risk of intraoperative awareness in surgical patients at high risk for awareness in comparison to using clinical signs as a guide for anaesthetic depth. BIS-guided anaesthesia and ETAG-guided anaesthesia may be equivalent in protection against intraoperative awareness but the evidence for this is inconclusive. In addition, anaesthesia guided by BIS kept within the recommended range improves anaesthetic delivery and postoperative recovery from relatively deep anaesthesia.

Chronic unlimited recording electrocorticography-guided resective epilepsy surgery: technology-enabled enhanced fidelity in seizure focus localization with improved surgical efficacy Clinical article	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						intracranial monitoring; subdural electrodes; epilepsy surgery; intracranial electrodes; seizure focus localization; chronic monitoring	SUBDURAL ELECTRODES; LONG-TERM; EEG	Object. Epilepsy surgery is at the cusp of a transformation due to the convergence of advancements in multiple technologies. Emerging neuromodulatory therapies offer the promise of functionally correcting neural instability and obviating the need for resective or ablative surgery in select cases. Chronic implanted neurological monitoring technology, delivered as part of a neuromodulatory therapeutic device or as a stand-alone monitoring system, offers the potential to monitor patients chronically in their normal ambulatory setting with outpatient medication regimens. This overcomes significant temporal limitations, pharmacological perturbations, and infection risks inherent in the present technology comprising subacute percutaneous inpatient monitoring of presurgical candidates in an epilepsy monitoring unit. Methods. As part of the pivotal study for the NeuroPace Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS) System, the authors assessed the efficacy of the RNS System to control seizures in a group of patients with medically refractory epilepsy. Prior to RNS System implantation, these patients were not candidates for further resective surgery because they had temporal lobe epilepsy with bilateral temporal sources, frontal lobe reflex epilepsy with involvement of primary motor cortex, and occipital lobe epilepsy with substantial involvement of eloquent visual cortex. Without interfering with and beyond the scope of the therapeutic aspect of the RNS System study, the authors were able to monitor seizure and epileptiform activity from chronically implanted subdural and depth electrodes in these patients, and, in doing so, they were able to more accurately localize the seizure source. In 5 of these study patients, in whom the RNS System was not effective, the notion of resective surgery was revisited and considered in light of the additional information gleaned from the chronic intracranial recordings obtained from various permutations of electrodes monitoring sources in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. Results. Through long-term analysis of chronic unlimited recording electrocorticography (CURE) from chronically implanted electrodes, the authors were able to further refine seizure source localization and sufficiently increase the expected likelihood of seizure control to the extent that 4 patients who had previously been considered not to be candidates for surgery did undergo resective surgery, and all have achieved seizure freedom. A fifth patient, who had a double-band heterotopia, underwent surgery but did not achieve significant seizure reduction. Conclusions. Chronic unlimited recording electrocorticography guided resective epilepsy surgery employs new monitoring technology in a novel way, which in this small series was felt to improve seizure localization and consequently the potential efficacy of resective surgery. This suggests that the CURE modality could improve outcomes in patients who undergo resective surgery, and it may expand the set of patients in whom resective surgery may be expected to be efficacious and therefore the potential number of patients who may achieve seizure freedom. The authors report 4 cases of patients in which this technique and technology had a direct role in guiding surgery that provided seizure freedom and that suggest this new approach warrants further study to characterize its value in presurgical evaluation.
