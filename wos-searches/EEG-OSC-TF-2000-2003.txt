This paper investigates three applications of these techniques to multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) for the diagnosis of epilepsy. Wavelet transforms are utilized to detect the onset of seizures at different sites of subdural electrodes, and to extract spike patterns from EEG data recorded from the scalp, Time-frequency distributions are applied to characterize the early activity of seizures.

The method is based on the smooth localized complex exponentials (SLEX) functions which are time-frequency localized versions of the Fourier functions and, hence, are ideal for analyzing nonstationary signals whose spectral properties evolve over time. The SLEX functions are simultaneously orthogonal and localized in time and frequency because they are obtained by applying a projection operator rather than a window or taper. In this paper, we present the Auto-SLEX method which is a statistical method that 1) computes the periodogram using the SLEX transform, 2) automatically segments the signal into approximately stationary segments using an objective criterion that is based on log energy, and 3) automatically selects the optimal bandwidth of the spectral smoothing window. The method is applied to the intracranial EEG from a patient with temporal lobe epilepsy. This analysis reveals a reduction in average duration of stationarity in preseizure epochs of data compared to baseline. These changes begin up to hours prior to electrical seizure onset in this patient.

In comparison to pre-stimulus baseline conditions, auditory stimulation synchronized EEG activity in delta, theta and alpha frequency bands. Event-related synchronization (ERS) effects were greatest at approximately 3 Hz (theta frequency band), and their magnitude depended on stimulus and task demands. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) of EEG activity was observed in the beta frequency band. This effect was greatest at approximately 21 Hz but occurred only for easily discriminable stimuli inattention-related target conditions. Because active discrimination tasks also required a button-press response with the right hand, ERDs involved more complex responses that may be related to a combination of perceptual, motor and cognitive processes. These results demonstrate that oddball and attention-related EEG responses to auditory stimulation could be characterized in the frequency domain. The specific design and analysis features described herein may prove useful since they provide a simple index of the brain's response to stimulation while at the same time provide powerful information not contained in typical time domain analysis.

To evaluate co-existent multi-frequency oscillations, EEG responses to unimodal (auditory or visual) and bimodal (combined auditory and visual) stimuli were analyzed by applying a new method called wavelet entropy (WE). The method is based on the wavelet transform (WT) and quantifies entropy of short segments of the event-related brain potentials (ERPs). For each modality, a significant transient decrease of WE emerged in the post-stimulus EEG epoch indicating a highly-ordered state in the ERP. WE minimum was always determined by a prominent dominance of theta (4-8 Hz) ERP components over other frequency bands. Event-related 'transition to order' was most pronounced and stable at anterior electrodes, and after bimodal stimulation. Being consistently observed across different modalities, a transient theta-dominated state may reflect a processing stage that is obligatory for stimulus evaluation, during which interfering activations from other frequency networks are minimized.

J	Yordanova, J; Rosso, OA; Kolev, V				Yordanova, J; Rosso, OA; Kolev, V			A transient dominance of theta event-related brain potential component characterizes stimulus processing in an auditory oddball task	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						event-related brain potentials; time-frequency analysis; entropy; multi-frequency oscillations; electroencephalography; brain microstates	TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; MULTIPLE FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS; WAVELET ENTROPY; DEVELOPMENTAL-CHANGES; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; EEG ALPHA; MEMORY; P300; INFORMATION; GAMMA	Objective: Following external stimulation, electroencephalographic (EEG) responses from different frequency bands occur simultaneously, but little is known about whether and how concurrent multi-frequency responses depend on each other during stimulus information processing. The present study assessed the effects of task stimulus relevance on locally co-existent time-frequency components of event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Methods: The wavelet entropy (WE) of ERPs was used as an analytical tool because low entropy values correspond to a narrow-band (mono-frequency) activity characterizing highly ordered (regularized) bioelectric states. The minimum of WE in the ERPs (WEmin) was identified to reflect a transient dominance of one particular frequency ERP component over other frequency components. In an auditory oddball condition, effects of stimulus relevance were analyzed for the timing, rate of decrease, and frequency determinants of WEmin in 10 subjects. Results: Major results demonstrate that a highly ordered EEG microstate emerged in response to both target and non-target stimuli, as evidenced by the substantial decrement of ERP entropy. This microstate (1) was short lasting as indexed by the transitory entropy decrease, (2) had a functionally specific time-localization as reflected by stimulus and electrode effects on WEmin latency, and (3) for both stimulus types was determined by a pronounced dominance of locally synchronized theta (4-8 Hz) oscillations. Conclusions: These results reveal a new neuroelectric correlate of stimulus processing and suggest that a theta-dominated microstate in the ERP may reflect a basic processing stage of stimulus evaluation, during which interfering activations from other frequency networks are minimized. Significance: In the framework of event-related brain dynamics, this study provides evidence that during stimulus processing, there is an interaction of locally co-existent multiple frequency ERP components. It is characterized by a transitory dominance of synchronized theta oscillations over other frequency ERP components emerging irrespective of stimulus task relevance and frequency ERP content, which may reflect basic processing mechanisms.

In practical medical measurements and analysis, the detection of transient time-varying electroencephalography (EEG) is quite important for further understanding the brain function. In order to classy different kinds of non-stationary EEG rhythms, wavelet packet analysis is used for designing sub-band filters with specified band-passed characteristics. Four kinds of wavelet packet decomposition using optimal wavelet are employed to investigate the nonstationarity of the signals. Several real signals are analyzed and compared to indicate that the non-stationary EEG signals can be classified by using wavelet packet decomposition.

By applying quantifiers based on wavelet entropy, it is demonstrated that a short-lasting ordering of the complex post-stimulus EEG signal occurs as a result of a transient synchronization in the theta frequency channel. Further, by using a developmental model it is shown that, independently of the frequency content of the background EEG and ERPs, a highly-ordered microstate in the ERP is always determined by theta frequency. Thus, transient dominance of synchronized theta oscillations may reflect an important functional mechanism subserving stimulus information processing.

Multi-resolution decomposition is used to investigate the transition of clinical EEG signals. Wavelet packet transformation is applied to design the filters with different frequency characteristics in order to extract different kinds of dynamic EEG rhythms. Several actual EEG signals with different brain function states are tested and analysed. The parameters of the wavelet packet transform corresponding to the rhythms are developed to reconstruct the time-varying electrical brain activity mapping. From the experimental results, the dynamic characteristics of clinical bl ain electrical activities can be demonstrated by using wavelet packet decomposition. The presented method can be used for the analysis of other biomedical signals.

Time-scale methods, or wavelet transforms, allow a time versus duration analysis to be performed whereas time-frequency methods allow spectral contents to be analyzed as a function of time. These two types of transform are well suited to the study of changes either localized or progressive that may be observed in EEG signal dynamics and that sign the evolution of underlying physiological mechanisms. The potential interest of these methods in nonstationary signal representation is illustrated through several academic examples. Then, methods are applied on real EEG signals to solve problems such that the detection of interictal transient signals (like spikes or spike-waves) and the recognition of signatures during ictal periods.

Although it is quite useful, of course, one has to acknowledge its subjective nature that hardly allows for a systematic protocol. In order to overcome this undesirable feature, a quantitative EEG analysis has been developed over the years that introduces objective measures, reflecting not only the characteristics of the brain activity itself but also giving clues conceming the underlying associated neural dynamics. The processing of information by the brain is reflected in dynamical changes of the electrical activity in (i) time, (ii) frequency, and (iii) space. Therefore, the concomitant studies require methods capable of describing the qualitative variation of the signal in both time and frequency. In the present work we introduce new information tools based on the wavelet transform for the assessment of EEG data as adapted to a non-extensive scenario. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Research using EEG, as well as event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related oscillations (EROs), which measure brain activity in response to a specific stimulus, have shown that the brain activity of alcoholics and nonalcoholics differs in some characteristic ways. These differences are consistent with an imbalance between excitation and inhibition processes in the brains of alcoholics.

Methods: Seven patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease suffering from unilateral tremor participated in the study. Electromyography (EMG) signals arising from the wrist extensor and flexor muscles as well as a high resolution EEG were recorded simultaneously. Coherencies between EEG and EMG were calculated. Results: In all patients, we found highly significant coherencies at the tremor frequency or its first harmonic between the tremor EMG and contralateral EEG channels. There were no significant coherencies between the tremor EMG and ipsilateral EEG channels. Isocoherency maps illustrating the topography of the coherencies over the scalp showed that the maximum coherencies were situated over the cortical motor areas. In one case, a high coherency was also found over the parietal cortex. Conclusions: The results show for the first time that tremor-correlated cortical activity can be detected by electroencephalography. The findings underline that motor areas of the cerebral cortex are involved in the neuronal network generating resting tremor in Parkinson's disease. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

We demonstrated that data of the periodometric analysis can be used for objective classification of EEG patterns. In children of different age groups, five types of background EEG activity were classified and described; we also demonstrated that the intragroup frequencies of these EEG types vary in healthy children with age. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the periodometric analysis of EEG, as well as the prospects and expediency of use of this analysis in physiological studies and in clinics.

To the extent that both types of oscillations represent the activity of temporally and topographically separable neural populations, time averaging can cause a loss of brain activity information that is important both conceptually and for multimodal integration with hemodynamic techniques. To address this issue for recognition memory, simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings of explicit word recognition from 11 healthy subjects were analyzed in two different ways. First, the time course of neural oscillations ranging from theta (4.5 Hz) to gamma (42 Hz) frequencies were identified using single-trial continuous wavelet transforms. Second, traditional analyses of amplitude variations of time-averaged EEG and MEG signals, event-related potentials (ERPs), and fields (ERFs) were performed and submitted to distributed source analyses. To identify data patterns that covaried with the difference between correctly recognized studied (old) words and correctly rejected nonstudied (new) words, a multivariate statistical tool, partial least squares (PLS), was applied to both types of analyses. The results show that ERPs and ERFs are mainly displaying those neural indices of recognition memory that oscillate in the theta (4.5-7.5 Hz), alpha (8-11.5), and to some extent in the betal (12-19.5 Hz) frequency range. The sources of the ERPs/ERFs were in good agreement with the topography of theta/alpha/beta I oscillations in being confined to the anterior temporal lobe at 400 ms and being distributed across temporal, parietal, and occipital areas between 500 and 700 ms. Gamma oscillations covaried either positively or negatively with theta/alpha/beta1 oscillations. A positive covariance, for instance, was detected over left anterior temporal sensors as early as 200-350 ms and is compatible with studies in rodents showing that gamma and theta oscillations emerge together out of the interaction of the hippocampus and the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices. Fast beta oscillations (20-29.5 Hz), on the other hand, did not strongly covary with slow oscillations and were likely to arise from neural populations not adequately represented in ERPs/ERFs. In summary, by providing a more comprehensive description of electromagnetic signals, time-frequency data are of potential benefit for integrating electrophysiological and hemodynamic indices of brain activity and also for integrating human and animal electrophysiology.

Methods: EEG power values were calculated across a 1.00-25.75 Hz frequency range during time intervals preceding and following REM onset of the first 4 sleep cycles of 10 normal subjects. Topographical changes were assessed through Fpz-A1, Fz-A1, Cz-A1, Pz-A1, Oz-A1 recordings during NREM-REM-NREM transitions. Results: The temporal dynamics of REM onset is characterized by a specific topographical pattern of EEG changes with a relatively higher EEG activity at posterior sites: Oz does not show any clear change within the alpha and beta frequencies, at variance with the marked reductions of the other sites, while it shows reductions of power in the delta/theta and sigma frequency ranges of smaller size as compared to the other sites. REM offset does not appear as a mirror-image of REM onset, since the pattern of regional differences characterizing the NREM sleep preceding REM onset is not fully reached. Conclusions: REM onset is characterized by a general change of EEG activity toward a relative occipital diffusion of power, specifically distinguished by a posterior dominance of middle and high frequencies.

Power spectra from wakefulness, stage 2, stage 4 and paradoxical sleep of 8 young adults were submitted to Principal Component Analyses to investigate which frequencies covaried together. Two identical eigenvectors were identified for stage 2 and stage 4. 1 to 8 Hz and 5 to 15 Hz (87.95 and 84.62 % of the total variance respectively). Two eigenvectors were extracted for PS: 1 to 9 Hz and 10 to 15 Hz (81.62% of the total variance). Three eigenvectors were obtained for W: with frequencies between 1 to 7 Hz, 7 to 11 Hz, and 12 to 15 Hz (78.32% of the total variance). Power for all frequencies showed significant differences among vigilance states. These results indicate that slow wave activity can oscillate at higher frequencies, up to 8 Hz, and that spindle oscillations have a wider range down to 5 Hz. No theta band was independently identified, suggesting either that delta and theta oscillations are two rhythms under the same global influence, or that the traditional division of theta band in the human cortical EEG is artificial. Alpha as a band was identified only during wakefulness. Principal component analysis upon spectral densities extracted broad bands different for each vigilance state and from traditional bands, consistent with functional significance of EEG and with frequencies of generators of rhythmic activity obtained in cellular studies in animals.

Multiresolution decomposition is used to investigate the transition of clinical EEG signals. Wavelet packet transformation is used to design the filters with different frequency characteristics in order to extract different kinds of dynamic EEG rhythms. Several actual EEG signals with different brain function states are tested and analyzed. The parameters of the wavelet packet transformation corresponding to the rhythms are developed to construct the time-varying electrical brain activity mapping (TVBEAM). From the experimental results, the dynamic characteristics of clinical brain electrical activities can be demonstrated by using wavelet packet decomposition. The method presented in this paper can be used as a new way for the analysis of other biomedical signals.

Evidence supporting the fact that high-frequency neuronal oscillations are involved in several aspects of visual processing is presented, with a focus on bottom-up and top-down visual feature processing, selective attention, and emotional evaluation. This evidence suggests that visual processing involves the integrated activity of wide spread neuronal assemblies that can be studied with respect to time course and topography, employing frequency-domain analyses. Possible mechanisms underlying these phenomena are considered. Furthermore, the effects of attention and motivation, as well as characteristics of experimental paradigms are discussed as determinants of reliability and validity of measures of high-frequency oscillations.

The first one, based on matching pursuit approach provided high-resolution distributions of power in time-frequency space. The phenomena of event related desynchronization (ERD) and synchronization (ERS) were investigated without the need of band-pass filtering. Time evolution of mu- and beta -components was observed in a detailed way. The second method was based on a multichannel autoregressive model (MVAR) adapted for investigation of short-time changes in EEG signal. The direction and spectral content of the EEG activity propagation was estimated by means of short-time directed transfer function (SDTF). The evidence of 'cross-talk' between different areas of motor and sensory cortex was found. The earlier known phenomena, connected with voluntary movements, were confirmed and a new evidence concerning focal ERD/surround ERS and beta activity post-movement synchronization was found.

These obscure trial to trial variability. A new analysis technique is presented here which leads to single trial analysis and to insight into the mechanisms of EP generation. Methods: This technique is based on the identification of the EEG deflections recorded on the scalp before (background) and immediately after visual stimuli. A statistical description of the time and amplitude distributions of these deflections is defined and leads to the differentiation between background and evoked activity. Results: In response to stimuli, the time and amplitude of ongoing deflections (background) are re-organized (time locking) and amplified, generating the EP. Not all stimulus trials are accompanied by an appropriate response. Separate analysis of those single trials that do contain a response deflection provides information on the exact timing, variability, amplitude, etc., of those EEG deflections which contribute to the EP. Conclusions: New EEG analysis techniques are described which provide single trial EP analysis and insight into mechanisms of EP generation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim of this paper is to study the spindle activity in different cycles of NREM-REM sleep. Higher order spectral analysis, particularly the bispectrum, is used to analyze the quadratic nonlinear interaction. Ten one-second spindles from the first and the last NREM-REM cycles, with two normal subjects, are analyzed. Spindle waves are. characterized using the power spectral density (PSD) function and the bispectrum to obtain: 1) differences between sleep spindles of the first and the last NREM-REM cycles, and 2) the interaction between the different components in EEG signal. Similar results were obtained in both subjects and channels presented: no differences are observed neither in time nor in frequency domain with PSD function between spindles from the first and the last NREM-REM cycles. However, more frequency couplings were observed in the last cycle than in the first one by means of the bispectrum.

Moreover, electroencephalogram (EEG)-based classification of the vigilance states [active sleep (AS), quiet sleep (QS), or awake (W)] has been thought to be possible only after the second postnatal week. We now report the presence of spontaneous hippocampal gamma oscillations in the area CA3 of freely moving rats at postnatal days (P) 5-10. Initially, at P5, the gamma oscillations were seen in time-frequency analyses of intrahippocampal EEG recordings as brief (<500 ms) bursts at 20-30 Hz. The early gamma rhythmicity was most pronounced during periods of AS but was occasionally detected also during QS. Toward P10, the gamma oscillations gained amplitude and extended also to higher (<= 60 Hz) frequencies. In parallel, the gamma oscillations were progressively more and more confined to AS. To further consolidate these findings, we compared amplitude spectra averaged within the behavioral categories. AS was characterized by the appearances of gamma (20-30 Hz) and theta (3-5 Hz) peaks at P6 and at P8, respectively. QS, on the other hand, had considerably smoother amplitude distributions between 1 and 100 Hz for P5-P10, with no peaks in gamma or theta bands. Hippocampal gamma rhythm thus seems to hallmark early AS. Our data provide the first in vivo evidence for both the presence and the behavioral correlate of spontaneous gamma oscillations in the newborn rat.

Here, we present evidence for dynamic beta-range (16-28 Hz) synchronization between cortical activity and muscle activity, starting after termination of the movement. In the same time range, increased tonic activity in the activated muscle was found. During the movement execution a low-frequency (2-14 Hz) synchronization was found. Using a novel analysis, phase-reference analysis, we were able to extract the EMG-coherent EEG maps for both, low- and high-frequency beta range synchronization. The electrical source reconstruction of the EMG-coherent EEG maps was performed with respect to the individual brain morphology from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a distributed source model (cortical current density analysis) and a realistic head model. The generators of the beta-range synchronization were not only located in the primary motor area, but also in premotor areas. The generators of the low- frequency synchronization were also located in the primary motor and in premotor areas, but with additional participation of the medial premotor area. These findings suggest that the dynamic beta-range synchronization between multiple cortical areas and activated muscles reflects the transition of the collective motor network into a new equilibrium state, possibly related to higher demands on attention, while the low- frequency synchronization is related to the movement execution.

The advent of whole-scalp MEG systems allowing rapid non-invasive recording from the entire cortex and accurate localisation of neural sources, and the development of refined signal analysis methods are important factors that led to an increasing interest in studies of sensorimotor oscillations during the last 10 years. Investigations on healthy subjects revealed frequency-specific localisation and modality-specific reactivity of 10 Hz and 20 Hz sensorimotor oscillations. Task-specific coherence between motor cortical and electromyographic oscillations, reflecting cortico-motoneuronal coupling, point towards a functional role of precentral oscillations in the cortical control of voluntary movements. Furthermore, abnormal cortico-motoneuronal coupling may underlie clinical symptoms of motor disorders, such as tremor. Thus, investigation of oscillatory sensorimotor activity proceeds from phenomenology to function and provides an interesting approach to address questions in human motor physiology and pathophysiology.

Methods: EEG feedback training was performed in the patient's home (clinic), supervised from a distant laboratory with the help of a 'telemonitoring system'. Online feedback computation was based on single-trial analysis and classification of specific band power features of the spontaneous EEG. Task-related changes in brain oscillations over the course of training steps was investigated by quantifying time-frequency maps of event-related (de-)synchronization (ERD/ERS). Results: The patient learned to 'produce' two distinct EEG patterns, beta band ERD during movement imagery vs. no ERD during relaxing, and to use this for BCI-controlled spelling. Significant learning progress was found as a function of training session, resulting in an average accuracy level of 70% (correct responses) for letter selection. 'Copy spelling' was performed with a rate of approximately one letter per min. Conclusions: The proposed BCI training procedure, based on electroencephalogram (EEG) biofeedback and concomitant adaptation of feature extraction and classification, may improve actual levels of communication ability in locked-in patients. 'Telemonitoring-assisted' BCI training facilitates clinical application in a larger number of patients. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Thaler, I; Boldes, R; Timor-Tritsch, I				Thaler, I; Boldes, R; Timor-Tritsch, I			Real-time spectral analysis of the fetal EEG: A new approach to monitoring sleep states and fetal condition during labor	PEDIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article							CEREBRAL FUNCTION MONITOR; HUMAN-FETUS; ELECTROCORTICAL ACTIVITY; BEHAVIORAL STATES; BIRTH ASPHYXIA; EDGE FREQUENCY; TERM; LAMB; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; ENCEPHALOPATHY	Adverse perinatal events affecting cerebral functions are a major cause of neonatal mortality, morbidity, and long-term neurologic deficit. Intrapartum fetal EEG, which records fetal brain electrical activity, provides a monitoring modality for evaluating the fetal CNS during labor. In this study, we describe a new approach to such monitoring that is based on real-time spectral analysis of the fetal EEG during labor. Fourteen pregnant women with uncomplicated term pregnancies who went into labor participated in the study. Two suction-cup electrodes were applied to the fetal scalp at the occipitoparietal or parietal region after rupture of membranes. Real-time spectral analysis was used to determine the frequency and amplitude of the fetal EEG signal. The spectral edge frequency (SEF) was calculated as the frequency below which 90% of the power in the power spectrum resides. The average EEG amplitude and the SEF were displayed using the density spectral array technique. Fetal heart rate and intrauterine pressure were also measured. Two fundamental EEG patterns were identified: high-voltage slow activity and low-voltage fast activity. The SEF was found to be an excellent index of cyclic EEG activity. Fetal heart rate demonstrated increased variability and an elevated baseline during low-voltage fast activity, whereas both parameters decreased during high-voltage slow activity. During episodes of variable decelerations in the fetal heart rate, a decrease in the SEF was observed, accompanied by an increased EEG voltage. The results obtained substantiate the presence of sleep cycles in the human fetus. This kind of cortical activity monitoring may enable rapid alertness to cerebral hypoxia and allow for prompt intervention thereby decreasing the risk for birth asphyxia and subsequent brain damage.

TMS was applied over the left primary motor cortex (Ml) of healthy volunteers, intermixing single suprathreshold pulses with pairs of sub- and suprathreshold pulses and simultaneously recording EEG from 60 scalp electrodes. Averaging of EEG data time locked to the onset of TMS pulses yielded a waveform. consisting of a positive peak (30 ms after the pulse P30), followed by two negative peaks [at 45 (N45) and 100 ms]. Peak-to-peak amplitude of the P30-N45 waveform was high, ranging from 12 to 70 muV; in most subjects, the N45 potential could be identified in single EEG traces. Spectral analysis revealed that single-pulse TMS induced a brief period of synchronized activity in the beta range (15-30 Hz) in the vicinity of the stimulation site; again, this oscillatory response was apparent not only in the EEG averages but also in single traces. Both the N45 and the oscillatory response were lower in amplitude in the 12-ms (but not 3-ms) paired-pulse trials, compared with the single-pulse trials. These findings are consistent with the possibility that TMS applied to MI induces transient synchronization of spontaneous activity of cortical neurons within the 15- to 30-Hz frequency range. As such, they corroborate previous studies of cortical oscillations in the motor cortex and point to the potential of the combined TMS/EEG approach for further investigations of cortical rhythms in the human brain.

This VEP is known to contain strong oscillatory activity around 120 Hz, which ceases 100 ms after the flash. It was unclear so far whether this time limit represents an averaging artifact due to loss of intertrial phase coherence or indicates a veridical cessation. Here we present results obtained from single-trial analysis of the EEG. These show that the oscillations exhibit virtually perfect phase locking and do in fact cease around 100 ins after the stimulus. Thus, the cessation of oscillatory activity in the VEP is not due to increasing intertrial phase jitter. Comparison with simultaneous retinal recordings exclude the possibility of direct crosstalk from the retina, but suggest that the oscillations are propagated from the retina to the cortex with a time lag of 48 ms.

One month after TIPSS implantation, all patients showed an increase in the power of the theta frequency band as well as a decrease in the power of the alpha frequency band. To reduce the error variance, we formed the quotient of the relative power of the theta and alpha frequency band. Theta/alpha quotient values over 0.7 indicate a general change of the EEG with a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 87%. The results we have to hand indicate a correlation between the albumin concentration and the theta/alpha quotient 1 and 3 months after TIPSS. No significant correlation was revealed with regard to the Child-Pugh score or the liver function parameters cholinesterase, bilirubin, and prothrombin time. Neither the arterial ammonia concentration nor the performance in the psychometric test showed significance in relation to the theta/alpha quotient. Substances with a high albumin bond and potential neurotoxicity may-in the case of lower albumin levels-be absorbed with increased frequency in the CNS and may be responsible for the observed EEG change.

Methods: EEG-EMG auto-spectra, coherence and phase functions were estimated by means of bivariate and time varying autoregressive (AR) models in 15 patients: 8 with Unverricht-Lundborg, 4 with Lafora body disease, and 3 with sialidosis. Results: The coherence spectra of the EMG epochs including action myoclonus and contralateral frontocentral EEG derivations showed a main beta peak (average coherence: 0.60-0.79) in all patients, regardless of the type of PME. The time lag from cortex to muscle was 13.0-21.3 ms. Significantly, coherent gamma activity was consistently found only in the 3 patients with sialidosis; the most heterogeneous results were obtained in the patients with Lafora disease, who showed a more complex coherence profile. Periods of normal muscle contractions, which could be recorded in patients with Unverricht-Lundborg PME, were characterised by the presence of an EEG-EMG beta coherence peak on the same frequency as in the case of action myoclonus, but with a lower coherence value. Conclusions: AR models were capable of describing EEG-EMG relationships in patients with PME, and indicated that coherent cortical and EMG beta oscillations are crucially involved in the generation of myoclonus. Moreover, they could detect the uneven spectral profiles characterising the different forms of PME. (C) 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

We applied a wavelet time-frequency analysis to differentiate the brain dynamics between painful and non-painful somatosensory stimulation. The observed pattern to pain-induced effects exhibited a stepwise decrease of frequencies over time, starting around 26 ms over somatosensory cortex at 80 Hz, intermediate oscillations at 40 and 20 Hz around 40 ms, and reaching down to 10 Hz after 160 ms. This step-wise frequency decrease of ERO, coincident with spatial shift from the contralateral somatosensory area at 80 Hz to the centro-frontal brain at 40/20 Hz and final spatial expansion to the large region of centro-parietal areas at 10 Hz, may represent the cortical processes necessary to transfer sensory information from perceptual stages to subsequent cognitive stages in consciousness.

J	Koenig, T; Marti-Lopez, F; Valdes-Sosa, P				Koenig, T; Marti-Lopez, F; Valdes-Sosa, P			Topographic time-frequency decomposition of the EEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							ADAPTIVE SEGMENTATION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; MAP SERIES; BRAIN; MICROSTATE; STATES; SLEEP; MILD	Frequency-transformed EEG resting data has been widely used to describe normal and abnormal brain functional states as function of the spectral power in different frequency bands. This has yielded a series of clinically relevant findings. However, by transforming the EEG into the frequency domain, the initially excellent time resolution of time-domain EEG is lost. The topographic time-frequency decomposition is a novel computerized EEG analysis method that combines previously available techniques from time-domain spatial EEG analysis and time-frequency decomposition of single-channel time series. It yields a new, physiologically and statistically plausible topographic time-frequency representation of human multichannel EEG. The original EEG is accounted by the coefficients of a large set of user defined EEG like time-series, which are optimized for maximal spatial smoothness and minimal norm. These coefficients are then reduced to a small number of model scalp field configurations, which vary in intensity as a function of time and frequency. The result is thus a small number of EEG field configurations, each with a corresponding time-frequency (Wigner) plot. The method has several advantages: It does not assume that the data is composed of orthogonal elements, it does not assume stationarity, it produces topographical maps and it allows to include user-defined, specific EEG elements, such as spike and wave patterns. After a formal introduction of the method, several examples are given, which include artificial data and multichannel EEG during different physiological and pathological conditions.

A biphasic effect, that is, an initial increase of the effect variable followed by a decrease at higher concentrations, during the transition from consciousness to unconsciousness was found in EEG amplitude (both frequency bands) and in SEF95 for all anaesthetics except midazolam. There was a concentration-related decrease in BIS for all anaesthetics. There was no consistent relationship between the time of occurrence of the peak EEG effect, or the value of the EEG variable and the moment of loss of consciousness. With rapidly changing drug concentrations during the induction of anaesthesia, none of these EEG effect variables could be correlated to the moment of loss of consciousness.

Numerous studies have observed an increase in induced gamma band energy with increases in covert selective attention and visual perception. The current study investigated the modulation of visually induced gamma band oscillations by top-down processes associated with task complexity. Fourteen human subjects performed a reaction time task under two experimental conditions that differed in task complexity. In one, subjects simply had to press one of four buttons that corresponded to a colour stimulus shown to the subject. In the second, the stimulus response mapping was altered by the implementation of a rule, thus increasing task complexity. Cortical electrical activity was recorded using a 65 electrode whole scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) net. The EEG activity was analysed using Morlet wavelets to produce time-frequency maps. Although induced gamma band activity was observed in both conditions, there was significantly greater energy during the rule-operation condition at approximately 276 ms after the appearance of the stimulus. This increase was localized to electrodes overlying the right-central parietal scalp. The results of this study show that top-down processes modulate the level of induced gamma band activity. We discuss these findings in terms of the role of gamma oscillations in the construction of a sensory representation useful for a correct motor response.

However due to the nonstationarity of the EEG signals, the time-frequency methods proved to be superior. This paper presents a new method for detection of newborn EEG seizure activity in the time-frequency domain. The proposed approach utilises 30-second epochs of EEG signal and analyses one frequency slice of their time-frequency representations at about 75 Rz. Spiking activity in these high frequency slices are used to distinguish between seizure and nonseizure activities. Using histograms of intervals between successive spikes, we were able to show the dramatic difference between spikes originating from seizure and those from nonseizure. This finding led to this novel method of seizure detection in newborn babies.

From wavelets to adaptive approximations: time-frequency parametrization of EEG	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE			English	Article								C This paper presents a summary of time-frequency analysis of the electrical activity of the brain (EEG). It covers in details two major steps: introduction of wavelets and adaptive approximations. Presented studies include time-frequency solutions to several standard research and clinical problems, encountered in analysis of evoked potentials, sleep EEG, epileptic activities, ERD/ERS and pharmaco-EEG. Based upon these results we conclude that the matching pursuit algorithm provides a unified parametrization of EEG, applicable in a variety of experimental and clinical setups. This conclusion is followed by a brief discussion of the current state of the mathematical and algorithmical aspects of adaptive time-frequency approximations of signals.

If so they should emerge at about threshold. In the present investigation we examined the latter proposal. Visual responses were recorded in occipital, temporal and parietal areas (stimulus duration 512 ms). Oscillation strength and frequency were derived from FFT analysis and wavelet transforms. The specific goals of the present study are: 1: To examine the parallel between gamma oscillations and the psychometric threshold of perception of Kanizsa square (KS). The latter is gradually altered by a progressive misalignment of lower inducers (pacmen). Results show that the perception of the KS is altered by lateral displacements of the lower inducers as small as 0.1 to 0.2degrees. In parallel, high frequency components of cortical responses gain in strength with misalignments. 2: Gamma oscillations emerge at or about the psychometric threshold. In addition, our data analysis demonstrates that gamma oscillations appear in short bursts (approx. 50 ms) in the time window between 200 and 500 ms after stimulus onset. Furthermore, controls indicated that these oscillations are of the induced-gamma type. Thus, our experiments suggest that gamma oscillations are associated with image structures and may be induced by local properties of the target. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This problem results from a masking effect on these components caused by the presence of high-energy slow waves and sharp patterns in the input which produce large values in the time-frequency distribution. These large values often appear in the time-frequency plane as irregular patterns in the low-frequency range (due to slow waves), and as wide-band, impulsive components at certain points in time (due to sharp patterns). In this work we present an effective signal pre-processing method using a nonlinear operation on wavelet coefficients. This method equalizes the energy of different time-frequency components in the data so that the masking effect is greatly reduced, while the original time-frequency features of the input signal are preserved. Comparative experiments on electroencephalographic data with and without using this method have shown a clear improvement in the readability and sensitivity in bilinear time-frequency distributions.

The power spectrum densities of EEG showed 1/ f(a) fluctuation as a function of frequency f. The alpha rhythms that appeared in normal EEG have not been observed in epileptic EEC. FT could not reveal localized spikes and complexes that are typical among epileptic seizures. On the contrary, both CWT and DWT analyses could clearly reveal localized low-frequency epileptic components of EEG records.

Spectogram are computed from electroencephalogram (EEG) obtained by measuring electric potentials on the scalp. Migraine patients often have symptoms of visual and auditory dysfunction, e. g. photophobia and phonophobia. Psychophysical discomfort thresholds to light and sound stimuli are also decreased in migraine patients compared with healthy controls. We hypothesize that due to this dysfunction we are able to detect migraine by exposing them to photic stimulation. Signal response from the occipital area was captured for analysis. Time-frequency analysis of the EEG signal revealed that EEG frequency trace of migraine patients are scattered compared to the normal patients. Time-frequency analysis can therefore provide details of the frequency spread of migraine activities on migraine patients.

The main reason for their relative poor performance resides in their assumption of stationarity of the EEG. To remedy this problem, we use time-frequency distributions (TFD) to analyse and characterise the newborn EEG seizure patterns as a first step toward a time-frequency (TF) based seizure detection and classification scheme. This paper presents the results of the analysis of these time-frequency patterns for two abnormal newborn EEGs. We demonstrate that the newborn EEG seizures are well described by a class of mono- and multi-component linear FM signals. This result is novel and contradicts the simplistic assumptions routinely made in the field.

The traditional methods of signal analysis are limited by the rapidly changing nature of the EEG signal during a seizure. Time-frequency analyses, however, such as those produced by the matching pursuit (MP) method can provide continuous decompositions of recorded seizure activity. These accurate decompositions can allow for more detailed analyses of the changes in complexity of the signal that may accompany seizure evolution. Methods: The MP algorithm was applied to provide time-frequency decompositions of entire seizures recorded from depth electrode contacts in patients with intractable complex partial seizures of mesial temporal onset. The results of these analyses were compared with signals generated from the Duffing equation that represented both limit cycle and chaotic behavior. Results: Seventeen seizures from 12 different patients were analyzed. These analyses reveal that early in the seizure, the most organized, rhythmic seizure activity is more complex than limit cycle behavior, and that signal complexity increases further later in the seizure. Conclusions: Increasing complexity routinely precedes seizure termination. This may reflect progressive desynchronization. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

In essential tremor, MEG failed to detect cortical involvement. The objective of this study was to investigate whether EEG recording can reveal tremor-correlated cortical activity in patients with essential tremor or enhanced physiological tremor. (MEG) tremor. Methods Seven patients with essential tremor and three patients with enhanced physiological tremor participated in the study. Unilateral postural tremor was activated by wrist extension on the right or on the left side. Electromyography (EMG) signals arising from the wrist extensor and flexor muscles, and a high-resolution EEG were recorded simultaneously. Coherences between the time series of the rectified tremor EMG and the EEG were estimated. Findings In five of nine arms with essential tremor, we found highly significant coherences at the tremor frequency between the tremor EMG and the EEG. Isocoherence maps illustrating the topography of significant coherences over the scalp showed that the maximum coherences were located over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. In the patients with enhanced physiological tremor, we were unable to detect consistent significant corticomuscular coherences at the tremor frequency. Interpretation Using simultaneous EEG-EMG recordings, we showed that significant corticomuscular coherences at the tremor frequency can be found in essential tremor. This finding contrasts with a recent study based on MEG recordings. The results suggest that the sensorimotor cortex is involved in the generation of essential tremor. in a similar way to that previously shown in parkinsonian resting tremor.

EEG raw data are transformed into the time-frequency domain by the so-called adaptive frequency decomposition. The resulting frequency components are converted into pseudo-linguistic facts via fuzzification. Finally, an expert system applies symbolic rules formulated by the neurologist to evaluate the extracted EEG features. The system detects artefacts, describes alpha rhythm by frequency, amplitude, and stability and after artefact rejection detects pathologic slow activity. All results are displayed as linguistic terms, numerical values and maps of temporal extent, giving an overview about the clinical routine EEG. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here we present a time-frequency analysis of averaged slow auditory-evoked potentials (sAEPs) obtained at electrode locations overlying the main song control nucleus, high vocal center. Gabor spectrograms of these sAEPs show a prolonged response time course consisting of unimodal frequency peaks in the theta/alpha range (4-17 Hz). There is a stimulus-dependent modulation of the duration of the response and of the total number of its constituent frequency peaks, an effect that is bilateral in 75% of the birds and lateralized to the left side in the remaining 25%. Since the state of alertness of birds modulates these parameters along a similar continuum, these findings suggest that modulation of sAEP frequency profile may be dependent on attentional mechanisms. The presence and modulation of neurobiologically ubiquitous dominant frequency components also implicate the possible role of induced cerebral neuronal circuit oscillations in songbird auditory perception.

The spectral and phase properties of those epochs of EEG exhibiting non-linear interdependence are studied. Methods: Scalp EEG data was collected from 40 healthy subjects. A technique for the detection of non-linear interdependence was applied to 2.048 s segments of posterior bipolar electrode data. Amplitude-adjusted phase-randomized surrogate data was used to statistically determine which EEG epochs exhibited non-linear interdependence. Results: Statistically significant evidence of non-linear interactions were evident in 2.9% (eyes open) to 4.8% (eyes closed) of the epochs. In the eyes-open recordings, these epochs exhibited a peak in the spectral and cross-spectral density functions at about 10 Hz. Two types of EEG epochs are evident in the eyes-closed recordings; one type exhibits a peak in the spectral density and cross-spectrum at 8 Hz. The other type has increased spectral and cross-spectral power across faster frequencies. Epochs identified as exhibiting non-linear interdependence display a tendency towards phase interdependencies across and between a broad range of frequencies. Conclusions: Non-linear interdependence is detectable in a small number of multichannel EEG epochs, and makes a contribution to the alpha rhythm. Non-linear interdependence produces spatially distributed activity that exhibits phase synchronization between oscillations present at different frequencies. The possible physiological significance of these findings are discussed with reference to the dynamical properties of neural systems and the role of synchronous activity in the neocortex.

In particular; Wavelet Transform gives an optimal time-dependent frequency decomposition of the evoked responses, something difficult to be achieved with previous methods such as the Fourier Transform. We describe in detail the protocol for implementing the decomposition based on the Wavelet Transform and apply it to two different types of evoked potentials. In the first case we study alpha responses in pattern visual evoked potentials and in the second case, we study gamma responses to bimodal (auditory and visual) stimulation.

Mostly, widespread areas are involved and electrophysiological. signals are measured on different sites of the cortex or of the muscle. In order to investigate functional relationships between different components of multidimensional electrophysiological signals, coherence and phase analyses turned out to be useful tools. These parameters allow the investigation of synchronization phenomena with regard to oscillations of defined frequencies or frequency bands. Coherence and phase are closely connected spectral parameters. Coherence may be understood as a measure of phase stability. Whereas coherence describes the amount of common information with regard to oscillations within certain frequency bands, the corresponding phase, from which time delays of these oscillations can be computed, hints at the direction of information transfer through oscillation. Coherence and phase analysis of surface EMG during continuous activity of deep and superficial muscles show distinct differences due to volume conduction properties of myoelectrical signals. Superficial activity therefore is characterized by significant coherence and stable phase relationships, which, additionally, can be used to determine motor unit action potential (MUAP) propagation velocity along the fibre direction without application of invasive methods. Deep muscle activity lacks significant coherence. Mental processes can be very brief and cooperation between different areas may be highly dynamic. For this reason in addition to usual Fourier estimation of coherence and phase, a two-dimensional approach of adaptive filtering was developed to estimate coherence and phase continuously in time. Statistical and dynamic properties of instantaneous phase are discussed. In order to demonstrate the value of this method for studying higher cognitive processes the method was applied to EEG recorded during word processing. During visual presentation of abstract nouns an information transfer through the propagation of oscillations from visual areas to frontal association areas in the alpha (1)-frequency band could be verified within the first 400 ms. In contrast, in case of auditory presentation positive phases from the temporal electrode locations T3 and T4 towards the occipital areas appear within the time interval of 300 ms-600 ms. The alpha (1)-band predominately seems to reflect sensory processing and attention processes.

Wavelet transform (WT) is a new multi-resolution time-frequency analysis method. WT possesses localization feature both in time and frequency domains. It acts as a group of band-pass filters decompose mixed signal into signals at frequency bands. Using the dyadic wavelet transform, the EEG signals are successfully decomposed and denoised. In this paper we also use a 'quasi-detrending' method for classification of EEG spectrum where the level of detrending or differencing is made to vary. Difference in time domain acts as a high pass filter in the frequency domain. Therefore the low frequency values in the delta range can be ignored and this is a saving in computation time since delta range values do not correspond to any normal conscious human mental tasks. We also show that using discrete PSD (power spectral densities) values in the range below 30 Hz gives better classification results than using the delta, theta, alpha and beta power band values used by some authors.

(MP) Algorithm is a redundant algorithm in which raw signal f is iteratively projected to selected optimum vector (the best a toms) g(betan) to approach the original signal. By MP, we can get not only high time-frequency resolution, but also parametric descriptions of all kinds of data structures. In clinical applications, EEG sleep spindles have been identified with multifold pathology, so the successful detection of EEG sleep spindles is valuable in clinical application. In this paper, the matching pursuit algorithm (MP) based on Gabor function (the basic function) is used to detect and analyse EEG, sleep spindles, and give the time-frequency representation of the analysis results.

In particular, our software package includes (semi)automatic procedures for (i) EOG artifact detection and correction, (ii) EMG analysis, (iii) EEG artifact analysis, (iv) optimization of the ratio between artifact-free EEG channels and trials to be rejected. The performances of the software package on EOG-EEG-EMG data related to cognitive-motor tasks were evaluated with respect to the preliminary data analysis performed by two expert electroencephalographists (gold standard). Due to its extreme importance for multi-centric EEG studies, we compared the performances of two representative 'regression' methods for the EOG correction in time and frequency domains. The aim was the selection of the most suitable method in the perspective of a multi-centric EEG study. The results showed an acceptable agreement of approximately 95% between the human and software behaviors, for the detection of vertical and horizontal EOG artifacts, the measurement of hand EMG responses for a cognitive-motor paradigm, the detection of involuntary mirror movements, and the detection of EEG artifacts. Furthermore, our results indicated a particular reliability of a 'regression' EOG correction method operating in time domain (i.e. ordinary least squares). These results suggest that such a software package could be used for multi-centric EEG studies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

EEG Activity in the Process of Measuring-off of Time Intervals by Humans	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						electroencephalogram; subjective time; production of time intervals		We recorded EEG from sites C3 and C4 in an experimental situation with internal counting-off of a 20-sec-long time interval, whose beginning and end were limited by the tested subject by pushing a button; 65 adult men and women took part in the tests. In the first experimental series, the subject obtained no real information on the accuracy in production of the interval. In the second series, such information was displayed by feedback visual signals. We calculated means of the measured intervals ((t) over bar), coefficient of variation of the realizations (CV), and, in the series with the real feedback, successfulness of measuring-off (normalized number of fits within an acceptable range of the standard interval, 19 to 21 sec). Analysis of the data obtained in the first experimental series for the entire tested group demonstrated the existence of a reverse dependence between the modal frequency of EEG beta rhythm recorded from the left hemisphere in the course of measuring-off of the interval and the (t) over bar value. In the second series, we found significant negative correlation between the beta rhythm power in both hemispheres and CV, that between the alpha rhythm power in the left hemisphere and (t) over bar, and positive correlation between the alpha rhythm frequency in the left hemisphere and successfulness of the interval counting-off. Analysis of the dynamics of EEG of each tested subject demonstrated the existence of mostly reverse dependences between the powers of a few EEG rhythms and duration of the produced interval. We hypothesize that the frequencies of the alpha and beta EEG oscillations play the role of significant indices reflecting the speed of the "internal clock" of the individual. We also emphasize a complex nature and the high individual variability of the EEG pattern in the course of measuring-off of time intervals.	[Makhin, S. A.; Pavlenko, V.

In the microstructure of the sleep EEG signal, transient patterns are characterized by their frequency content and their time duration. The Time-Frequency Representations (TFR) take into account these time frequency characteristics but the lower energy transient signals are masked by higher energy ones. In order to overcome this problem, we introduced a method to decompose signals into a summation of oscillatory components with time varying frequency, amplitude and phase characteristics, based on the Tufts-Kumaresan algorithm. The resulting parameters, i.e. amplitude and frequency, are then used to train joint linear filtering operations of the TFR in the time - frequency domain. The aim of this work is to improve the classical TFR analysis for detecting frequency transients over short time duration, to reduce the amount of useful information to few parameters that help medical doctors to analyze the microstructure of sleep by correlating information estimated from different signals.

Time-based analysis on sleep EEG may provide an explanation. We focused on chronological aspects of initiation and termination of non-REM episodes, using spectral analysis of sleep EEG. The subjects were healthy male volunteers (n = 32, mean age +/- S.D.: 25.5 +/- 3.5 years). The rise latencies from non-REM sleep onset to the maximal power value and the decay latencies from the maximal power value to non-REM sleep offset were determined in the initial and final 21-min windows of individual non-REM episodes in each EEG band ranges. Low (12.1-13.7 Hz) and high (14.1-16.0 Hz) sigma ranges were analyzed separately. The rise and decay latencies were shorter in higher frequency ranges (> 14 Hz) and longer in lower frequency ranges (< 14 Hz). There were significant differences in the rise and decay latencies between low and high sigma ranges, indicating that the whole frequency ranges were clearly separated at the middle of the sigma range (14 Hz). The rise and decay latencies were significantly different in lower frequency ranges. The clock time of the night significantly affected only the rise latencies of the delta (0.78-3.9 Hz), alpha (8.2-11.7 Hz) and low sigma (12.1-13.7 Hz) ranges. In conclusion, initiation and termination of non-REM sleep was represented by higher frequency ranges, whereas further evolution and devolution of non-REM sleep was represented by lower frequency ranges, and only the evolution process was affected by the clock time of the night.

J	Freeman, WJ; Holmes, MD; Burke, BC; Vanhatalo, S				Freeman, WJ; Holmes, MD; Burke, BC; Vanhatalo, S			Spatial spectra of scalp EEG and EMG from awake humans	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						electroencephalographic scalp; electromyographic scalp; Hilbert transform electroencephalography/electromyography; power spectral density; electroencephalography/electromyography; spatial spectrum electroencephalography/electromyography	LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; SYNCHRONIZATION; PHASE; TASK; OSCILLATIONS; RESOLUTION; COHERENCE; RESPONSES; CORTEX	Objective: Evaluate spectral scaling properties of scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG), optimal spacing of electrodes, and strategies for mitigating EMG. Methods: EEG was recorded referentially from 9 subjects with a 64 channel linear array (electrodes 3 mm apart) placed parasagittally or transversely on forehead or occiput, at rest with eyes open or closed, or with deliberate EMG. Temporal (PSDt) and spatial (PSDx) power spectral densities were calculated with one-dimensional fast Fourier transform (FFT) for comparison with earlier analyses of intracranial EEG. Results: Scaling of PSDt from scalp resembled that from pia: near-linear decrease in log power with increasing log frequency (1/f(alpha)). Scalp PSDx decreased non-linearly and more rapidly than PSDx from pia. Peaks in PSDt (especially 4-12 Hz) and PSDx (especially 0.1-0.4 cycles/cm) revealed departures from 1/f(alpha). EMG power in PSDt was more "white" than 1/f(alpha). Conclusions: Smearing by dura-skull-scalp distorts PSDx more than PSDt of scalp EEG from 1/f(alpha) scaling at the pia. Spatial spectral peaks suggest that optimal scalp electrode spacing might be similar to I cm to capture non-local EEG components having the texture of gyri. Mitigation of EMG by filtering is unsatisfactory. A criterion for measuring EMG may support biofeedback for training subjects to reduce their EMG. Significance: High-density recording and log-log spectral display of EEG provide a foundation for holist studies of global human brain function, as an alternative to network approaches that decompose EEG into localized, modular signals for correlation and coherence.

The ANS blockers used were prazosin, propranolol, and atropine. Time-domain summary statistics were derived from the series of consecutive R-R intervals (RRI) of the ECG to measure beat-to-beat heart rate variability (HRV), and spectral analysis techniques were applied to the EEG activity to assess its frequency content. Both prazosin and atropine did not alter the power spectral density (PSD) of the EEG low frequency (LF: 0.5-7.5 Hz) and high frequency (HF: 7.6-30 Hz) bands, whereas propranolol decreased the PSD in these bands. These findings suggest that central beta-adrenergic receptor mechanisms could mediate the reptilian waking EEG activity without taking part any alpha(1)-adrenergic and/or cholinergic receptor systems. In 55% of the lizards in control conditions, and in similar to 43% of the lizards under prazosin and atropine, a negative correlation between the coefficient of variation of the series of RRI value (CVRRI) and the mean power frequency (MPF) of the EEG spectra was found, but not under propranolol. Consequently, the lizards' HRV-EEG-activity relationship appears to be independent of alpha(1)-adrenergic and cholinergic receptor systems and mediated by beta-adrenergic receptor mechanisms.

The effect of a 40 h sleep deprivation (SD) on spindle characteristics along the antero-posterior axis was investigated. Methods: EEGs during non-REM sleep in healthy young volunteers were analyzed with a new method for instantaneous spectral analysis, based on the fast time frequency transform. (FTFT), which yields high-resolution spindle parameters in the combined time and frequency domain. Results: FTFT revealed that after SD, mean spindle amplitude was enhanced, while spindle density was reduced. The reduction in spindle density was most prominent in the frontal derivation (Fz), while spindle amplitude was increased in all derivations except in Fz. Mean spindle frequency and its variability within a spindle were reduced after SD. When analyzed per 0.25 Hz frequency bin, amplitude was increased in the lower spindle frequency range (12-13.75 Hz), whereas density was reduced in the high spindle frequency range (13.5-14.75 Hz). Conclusions: The observed reduction in spindle density after SD confirms the inverse homeostatic relationship between sleep spindles and slow waves whereas the increase in spindle amplitude and the reduction in intra-spindle frequency variability support the hypothesis of a higher level of synchronization in thalamocortical cells when homeostatic sleep pressure is enhanced.

Methods: Our EEG analysis method consists of two simulated leaky integrate and fire units (LIFU) connected to a signal preprocessing stage that marks parts of the EEG signals with slopes, larger than a preset threshold Hilt with unit pulses. The LIFUs change their spiking frequency depending on the rate and the synchrony of the impinging pulse trains. Here, we use our method in a high-sensitivity mode by setting Hth to low values, which causes the LIFUs to continuously spike during the interietal state. We test if the LIFUs spiking rates, change before seizure onset. Results: We used 9 long-term EEGs (16 +/- 7 h) of 7 patients with drug resistant epilepsy. Fifteen seizures were analyzed and all were preceded by an increase of the time-averaged spiking rates SRav of the LIFUs. We defined a function F-Sz, which quantifies the changes of SRav. F-Sz increased and stayed above an individually set and fixed threshold 83 +/- 91 min (range: 4-330 min) before EEG seizure onset. Only two false alarms occurred. Conclusions: We conclude that EEG analysis with simulated neuronal cell models may be used to detect pre-seizure changes with high sensitivity and specificity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

EEGs of freely moving rats were recorded with implanted electrodes and then decomposed into four components of delta, theta, alpha and beta using wavelet transform. The power and power percentage of each component were calculated as functions of time. In SWS EEGs, the results showed that there existed as much as 26.2% +/- 7.7% time duration in which the delta power percentage was less than 50%. In addition, the powers of other three components in small delta EEGs were Significantly larger than those in large delta EEGs. This result revealed a reciprocal relationship between delta oscillation and spindle oscillation. Comparatively, the conventional method of FFT based power spectrum could only show a delta power-dominating (70.6% +/- 6.4%) spectrum of SWS EEGs. In the non-stationary TS EEG, spindle and non-spindle segments were distinguished based on the wavelet components of theta and alpha, and then the average duration of the spindles was estimated. In conclusion, the wavelet transform may be useful in developing novel quantitative time-frequency measures of sleep EEGs as valuable complements of conventional FFT method to analyze the transient changes in sleep EEGs induced by physiological, pathological or pharmacological conditions.

Methods: In an experimental study (9 subjects), the probability-classification analysis of single-trial spectral EEG changes was utilized. Results were compared with auditory ERD/ERS. Results: It was shown that (1) variability of EEG spectral patterns was considerable, (2) EEG activity was different at various task stages, (3) probability measures were different from the results of conventional frequency analysis, (4) probability of trials with alpha- and theta-patterns was characteristically different in various task stages, (5) the occurrence of alpha- and theta-trials were most probable, but not frequent enough to characterize all the trials. The results suggest that the ERD/ERS responses are influenced by EEG characteristics in the pre-stimulus interval, which also have a strong influence on the EEG in the post-stimulus interval. Conclusions: Alpha- and theta-ERD/ERS responses during memory task performance are not typical for all trials. They reflect EEG changes only in similar to39% for alpha-activity and similar to43% for theta-oscillations of all trials, what reflects piecewise stationary EEG structure.

The EEG spectra obtained from the tasks were assessed for time effect and ultradian periodicity. Fronto-central EEG high frequency powers (22.5-44.5 Hz) decreased at the time of the midafternoon vigilance dip (14.00-17.00 h) along with slight concomitant increases in parietal alpha (7.5-13.5 Hz) and delta (1-3 Hz) powers. A slow ultradian rhythm with a 3-4 h periodicity strongly modulated EEG power in all frequency bands between 1 and 44.5 Hz. The high frequency waking EEG may well reflect the activity of a brain arousal process underlying maintenance of the waking state probably throughout the 24 h cycle.

J	Adeli, H; Zhou, Z; Dadmehr, N				Adeli, H; Zhou, Z; Dadmehr, N			Analysis of EEG records in an epileptic patient using wavelet transform	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						computational neuroscience; encephalogram; epilepsy; EEG; neurology; neuroscience; wavelet		About 1% of the people in the world suffer from epilepsy and 30% of epileptics are not helped by medication. Careful analyses of the electroencephalograph (EEG) records can provide valuable insight and improved understanding of the mechanisms causing epileptic disorders. Wavelet transform is particularly effective for representing various aspects of non-stationary signals such as trends, discontinuities, and repeated patterns where other signal processing approaches fail or are not as effective. In this research, discrete Daubechies and harmonic wavelets are investigated for analysis of epileptic EEG records. Wavelet transform is used to analyze and characterize epileptiform discharges in the form of 3-Hz spike and wave complex in patients with absence seizure. Through wavelet decomposition of the EEG records, transient features are accurately captured and localized in both time and frequency context. The capability of this mathematical microscope to analyze different scales of neural rhythms is shown to be a powerful tool for investigating small-scale oscillations of the brain signals. Wavelet analyses of EEGs obtained from a population of patients can potentially suggest the physiological processes undergoing in the brain in epilepsy onset. A better understanding of the dynamics of the human brain through EEG analysis can be obtained through further analysis of such EEG records. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The authors recently proposed a time-frequency (TF) based technique suitable for nonstationarity of EEG signal. This method attempts to detect seizure activities through analysing the interspike intervals of the EEG in the TF domain. The performance of this method is compared to those of three non-parametric techniques for seizure detection. These methods are: Autocorrelation, Spectrum and Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA). The Autocorrelation method performs analysis in the time domain and is based on the autocorrelation function of short epochs of EEG data. The Spectrum technique is based on spectral analysis and is used to detect periodic discharges. The SSA technique employs singular spectrum analysis and information theoretic-based selection of the signal subspace. These three methods are based on the assumption that newborn EEG signal is quasi-stationary. The obtained results show the superior performance of the TF-based technique for detecting newborn EEG seizures.

J	McDonald, T; Hoffman, WE; Berkowitz, R				McDonald, T; Hoffman, WE; Berkowitz, R			Combining median electroencephalography frequency and sympathetic activity in an index to evaluate opioid detoxification in patients	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article						opiate : detoxification; naloxone; receptor; sympathetic; electroencephalogram; median frequency	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; ANESTHESIA; WITHDRAWAL; PLASMA; SIGNS	During rapid opioid detoxification, increased sympathetic activity and a greater median frequency (MF) of activity on electroencephalography (EEG) have been reported. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a new index for detoxification that combines sympathetic activity and MF data. After informed consent was obtained, eight patients were sedated with propofol. The MF of EEG activity derived from frontal electrodes was determined. Heart rate variability was evaluated in 256-second segments by power spectral analysis, and sympathetic activity was determined by the low frequency component. The Hoffman Index for narcotic detoxification was weighted 70% to sympathetic activity and 30% to MF to normalize the difference in scales and to provide adequate weight to the sympathetic component. Opioid detoxification was produced by infusion of 25 mg naloxone for 30 minutes, followed by a 24-hour infusion of 1 mg per hour. The MF showed a rapid increase during high-dose infusion of naloxone, but the peak response occurred 1 to 2 hours later. Sympathetic activation and the Hoffman Index increased more slowly after the start of naloxone infusion, but peak increases in ail components occurred at approximately the same time. The peak increases in Hoffman Index (110% of baseline), MF (260%). and sympathetic activity (304%) during administration of naloxone were significant and correlated with respect to time (r = 0.89-0.94). The Hoffman Index showed an early increase related to MF and a well-defined peak response indicative of sympathetic and MF activity. The behavior of the Hoffman Index in relation to the MF and sympathetic activity more clearly indicated the onset of opioid detoxification and the maximum response to opioid reversal than did MF or sympathetic activity alone.

Bilirubin especially affects the thalamus and cerebral cortex. Inasmuch as rhythmic oscillations on the EEG arise from the interaction between cortex and thalamus, electrophysiologic effects of bilirubin on the rhythmic oscillations with long-term postnatal age were investigated. Brain maturation was also analyzed with power spectral analysis quantitatively. For this purpose, 141 EEG records were taken (in the first week, 15th d, at the end of the first month, and at the third month) from 17 infants with hyperbilirubinemia and 22 healthy infants. In all records, the major frequency component was formed by the delta frequency in both groups. In the first records of the hyperbilirubinemia group, the delta frequency was higher than the control group; however the theta, alpha, and beta frequencies and the amplitude levels were lower (p < 0.001). These changes were found to be significantly correlated with the bilirubin levels (p < 0.001). On the 15th d the amplitude of the hyperbilirubinemia group increased to similar levels as the control group. At the frequency bands of delta and theta, there were significant changes related to postnatal age (p < 0.001). In all cerebral regions, the delta frequency decreased and the theta frequency increased with age. However, in the hyperbilirubinemia group the delta frequency was higher, the theta frequency was lower, and the changes between the groups disappeared in the third month despite the differences at all regions of the brain. In terms of the vertex, k complex, and sleep spindle, there were no differences between both groups in the third month (p > 0.05). We conclude that hyperbilirubinemia affects the cerebrocortical electrical activity but appears to be time limited.

The present study tested whether they consist of more than one distinct type of signal. Methods: Somatic evoked magnetic fields (SEFs) elicited by electrical stimulation of the median nerve were measured in 12 healthy volunteers. They were analyzed using a time-frequency analysis method based on Gabor filters and another based on autoregressive moving average, and also with bispectrum and bicoherence techniques and a new dispersion curve method. Results: Signals in two separate high-frequency bands (200 and 600 Hz) were distinguished from the main signal in the low frequency (LF) range during the time period of N20m and P25m. The novel 200 Hz-band signal was seen reliably in those channels where the LE: band signal was weak, so that the former was not masked by the latter. The 600 Hz signal consisted of two distinct components or parts (p1 and p2) in 10 out of 12 subjects, one peaking during ascending slope and the second during the descending slope of the N20m. The latency of the pi was shorter than the latencies of the 200 Hz and LF signals according to the dispersion curve analysis. The inter-peak interval of pi became shorter for later peaks in all 12 subjects. Bicoherence analysis revealed a significant phase coupling between the 200 and 608 nz bands. Conclusions: There are three distinct types of signal during the time period of the short-latency cortical components of the SEF - LF which gives rise to the commonly seen waveform of the SEF, the newly found 200 Hz signal and the 600 Hz signal which consists of two components. The possible origins of the high frequency signals are discussed in light of the new set of evidence found in the present study. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Two experimental sessions were conducted randomly between 09.00 and 18.00 h, once after nocturnal sleep and once after a night of total sleep deprivation. Spectral analysis of serial waking electroencephalography (EEG) from a short target fixation task repeated every 10 min was undertaken, along with an estimation of cortisol secretory profiles by deconvolution of plasma radioimmunoassay measures obtained from continuous blood withdrawal with regular sampling at a 10-min interval. Following nocturnal sleep, a temporal association between the HPA axis activity and the waking EEG activity was found, cortisol secretory rate following changes in frontal gamma (20-45 Hz) band power by 10 min (average R = 0.458, p < 0.001). Although it remained significant (average R = 0.276, p < 0.05), the association strength decreased significantly following total sleep deprivation (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon test). Cortisol plasma level, secretory rate and pulse amplitude were increased as well as waking EEG power in the delta (0.5-5.5 Hz), theta (5.5-8.5 Hz) and gamma frequency bands (all p values <0.05, Student t tests). The sleep deprivation-related increases in cortisol secretory rate and waking EEG gamma activity were quantitatively associated (R = 0.504, p < 0.05). These results support the existence of a common ultradian regulatory mechanism, co-ordinating HPA axis activity to the level of central arousal in man, which seems involved in the sleep deprivation-induced hyperarousal.

Two features were analyzed: (1) change of location of the brain electric source gravity centers of the EEG frequency bands, and (2) magnitude of fluctuation of these locations over time. Multichannel EEG was analyzed into source gravity center localizations for seven EEG frequency bands, using fast Fourier transform (FFT) Dipole Approximation (first principal component-single source modeling in the frequency domain). Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) showed: source localizations were more anterior in old than younger subjects for beta-1 and more superior for all three beta bands; from alertness to sleep, delta and theta EEG sources (inhibitory activity) changed to more posterior and superior areas, and alpha-1 and -2 (routine activity) and beta-1 and -2 sources (excitatory activity) towards anterior and superior areas. Fluctuations of the source locations of delta and beta-2 were larger on the superior-inferior axis, and of beta-2 smaller on the left-right axis to the old than younger subjects. The results suggest functional specifications (inhibitory, routine, excitatory) of cortical positron emission tomography (PET) changes reported in sleep. In sum, aging exhibits changes in spatial organization of EEG-generating neuronal assemblies; during the transition wakefulness-to-sleep, aging affects the spatial-temporal dynamics of this organization. The latter is suggested to contribute to the increased risk for consciousness disturbances in the elderly.

However, it requires a convolution integral in the time domain, so the amount of computation is enormous. In this study, we propose a Fast Wavelet Transform which is comprised in the Corrected Basic Fast Algorithm and the Fast Wavelet Transform for High Accuracy to realize high computation speed and at the same time to improve computation accuracy. The Corrected Basic Fast Algorithm is based on using mother wavelets whose frequencies are lower by 2 octaves than the Nyquist frequency in the Basic Fast Algorithm. The Fast Wavelet Transform for High Accuracy is realized by using upsampling which uses a L-Spline interpolation. The experiments demonstrate advantages of our approach and show its effectiveness for EEG analysis.

Methods: In an experimental study (15 subjects) we compared auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) to bimodal evoked potentials (BEPs; simultaneous auditory and visual stimulation). BEPs were assumed to be brain responses to complex stimuli as a marker for intermodal associative functioning. Results: Frequency domain analysis of these EPs showed marked theta-range components in response to bimodal stimulation. These theta components could not be explained by linear addition of the unimodal responses in the time domain. Considering topography the increased theta-response showed a remarkable frontality in proximity to multimodal association cortices. Referring to methodology we try to demonstrate that, even if various behavioral correlates of brain oscillations exist, common patterns can be extracted by means of a systems-theoretical approach. Conclusions: Serving as an example of functionally relevant brain oscillations, theta responses could be interpreted as an indicator of associative information processing.

From two series of signals (e.g. electroencephalogram, magnetoencephalogram or local field potentials) recorded from two sites in response to repeated sensory stimulations, the method computes the time-frequency energy of each signal. Then, it computes the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient across all the trials between the energy of the first signal series in one time-frequency region and the energy of the second signal series in a second time-frequency region. The method was designed to analyze interactions between frequency bands, in an effort to describe how the main brain rhythms interact with each other across time and space. It was applied to two simulations and to intracranial electro-encephalograin (EEG) recordings obtained from an epileptic patient performing two verbal discrimination tests (a phonological and a semantic task). It led to the identification of different correlations patterns in the gamma band depending on the level of semantic analysis performed by the patient. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The basic method, evaluated using chirp signals, utilizes a shifting window of fixed length. A substantial reduction in estimation bias and variability are obtained by utilizing an adaptive window whose length is dependent on past frequency estimates. The adaptive window yields estimates that are comparable in accuracy to those obtained using high-resolution time-frequency representation but with lower computation requirements and the potential for on-line application. Finally, an example of the application of the method for analyzing a neural recording is also illustrated. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here it is evaluated whether a) EEG acquisition during different functional states facilitates the detection of DAT-associated EEG changes, and b) EEG changes in mild DAT are topographically confined or global. Power spectra and coherence of EEGs from 29 patients with mild probable DAT and 28 age- and sex-matched controls were compared during three cognitive states. Group differences in power spectra and coherence were largest during resting with eyes open, yielding a 77 % correct classification result. Already in early stages of probable DAT, EEG changes were topographically wide-spread. The task-related up- and down-regulation of power and coherence was impaired already in mild probable DAT. We propose to augment clinical EEG assessment by including a quantitative analysis of the dynamic power and coherence changes from rest, eyes closed to eyes open in suspected DAT.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the frequency of the beta response is related to specific regions within the sensorimotor strip. Methods: Self-paced movement and electrical stimulation of the dominant hand and foot/leg was investigated in 10 right-handed volunteers. The electroencephalogram was recorded from closely spaced electrodes over central areas and processed time-locked to movement-offset or stimulation. In order to identify the dominant frequency of the induced beta oscillations. time-frequency maps were calculated using the continuous wavelet transformation. For the specific beta frequency bands. the band power time courses were analyzed by quantifying the event-related (de-)synchronization (ERD/ERS). Results: Both limb movement and somatosensory stimulation induced bursts of beta oscillations appearing within I s after movement/ stimulation with a clear focus close to the corresponding sensorimotor representation area. The peak frequency was significantly lower over the hand area (below similar to 20 Hz) than at mid-central sites overlying the foot representation area (above similar to 20 Hz). But no difference was found between movement and stimulation of the respective limb. Conclusions: Analyzing the frequency of induced beta activity revealed concomitant oscillations at slightly different frequencies over neighboring cortical areas. These oscillations might be indicative for a resonance-like behavior of connected sub-networks in sensorimotor areas. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All fights reserved.

In this chapter, spontaneous oscillations are viewed as the outcome of a self-organizing stochastic process. The aim is to introduce the general prerequisites for stochastic systems to evolve to the critical state and to explain their neurophysiological equivalents. I review the recent evidence that the theory of self-organized criticality (SOC) may provide a unifying explanation for the large variability in amplitude, duration, and recurrence of spontaneous network oscillations, as well as the high susceptibility to perturbations and the long-range power-law temporal correlations in their amplitude envelope.

To study the role of the cerebral hemispheres in generating sleep EEG patterns, all-night polysomnographic recordings were collected in subjects with brain damage (n=30) caused by hemispheric stroke and in hospitalized controls (n=12). Recordings were made in the acute (less than or equal to10 days post-stroke), subchronic (11-35 days post-stroke) and chronic (>60 days post-stroke) phases of stroke. Bipolar and referential EEG derivations were recorded. Standard sleep stage scoring was conducted using the referential derivation placed opposite the lesion. Sleep stage 2 power and coherence spectra were calculated based on recordings from bipolar derivations. In the mean spectra, the highest spindle frequency peak was identified and its size was calculated relative to the background spectrum. Analysis of visually scored EEG data indicated that, compared with controls, acute phase brain-damaged subjects had lower sleep efficiency and increased waking after sleep onset. The durations of rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep stages did not differ significantly between brain-damaged subjects and hospitalized controls. Spectral analyses revealed that, compared with hospitalized controls, brain-damaged subjects had significantly reduced spindle peak sizes in the power and coherence spectra from derivations ipsilateral to the lesion. Within-subject comparisons across time demonstrated that the power and coherence of sleep spindle frequency activity increased significantly from the acute to the chronic phases of stroke, suggesting that plastic mechanisms allowed the possibility of recovery. Our findings provide novel evidence that the cerebral hemispheres are important in generating coherent sleep spindles in humans, and they are consonant with prior empirical and theoretical evidence that corticothalamic projections modulate the generation of synchronous spindle oscillations. Because spindle oscillations are thought to be involved in blocking sensory input to the cortex during sleep, the decrease in synchronous spindle frequency activity following hemispheric stroke may contribute to the observed reduction in sleep continuity.

Methods: A time-frequency analysis method was applied to an auditory oddball paradigm in 7 healthy subjects. This method combines a multiresolution wavelet algorithm for signal extraction and the Gabor transform to represent the temporal evolution of the selected frequency components. Phase-locked or evoked activity and also non-phase-locked activity were computed for both standard and target stimuli. Results: The gamma band frequency components differed between target and non-target stimuli processing. The study showed an early and mainly phase-locked oscillatory response appearing around 26-28 ms after both standard and target stimuli onset, This response showed a spectral peak around 44 Hz for both stimuli. A late oscillatory activity peaking at 37 Hz with a latency around 360 ms was observed appearing only fur target stimuli. The latency of this late oscillatory activity had a high correlation (P = 0.002) to the latency of the P300 wave. Conclusions: EEC signal analysis with wavelet transform allows the identification of an early oscillatory cortical response in the gamma frequency range, as well as a late P300-related response.

In the present study, sleep spindle characteristics along the anterior-posterior axis were analysed during and outside the circadian phase of melatonin secretion. Sleep electroencephalograms were recorded during naps distributed over the entire circadian cycle and analysed with two different methodological approaches, the classical fast Fourier transform in the frequency-domain and a new method for instantaneous spectral analysis, the fast time frequency transform that yields high-resolution parameters in the combined time-frequency-domain. During the phase of melatonin secretion, spindle density was generally increased and intraspindle frequency variation reduced. Furthermore, lower spindle frequencies were promoted: peak frequencies shifted towards the lower end of the spindle frequency range, and spindle amplitude was enhanced in the low-frequency range (11-14.25 Hz) and reduced in the high-frequency range (similar to14.5-16 Hz). The circadian variation showed a clear dependence on brain topography such that it was maximal in the parietal and minimal in the frontal derivation. Our data provide evidence that the circadian pacemaker actively promotes low-frequency sleep spindles during the biological night with a parietal predominance.

Methods: All-night polysomnographic recordings were obtained in 3 neurogenic pain patients and 3 parkinsonian patients. One subject of each group was recorded in addition 3 months after surgery. Stereotactic operations were performed in the medial thalamus and on the pallido-thalamic tract to relieve neurogenic pain and parkinsonian symptoms, respectively. Results: Sleep efficiency was little affected by the surgical intervention in neurogenic pain patients and a dramatic reduction in REM sleep occurred, which had recovered in the subject recorded after 3 months. After the surgery parkinsonian patients showed an increase in total sleep time and in sleep efficiency, and a decrease in REM sleep latency. Sleep efficiency remained elevated in the 3 months follow-up. Medial thalamotomy abolished spindle frequency activity (SFA) in the power and coherence spectra in non-REM sleep stage 2 systematically. Pallido-thalamic tractotomy attenuated SFA only to varying degrees. After 3 months SFA had reemerged. The alpha peak of the waking EEG was shifted to lower frequencies after surgery in 5 of 6 patients and had reverted to the original frequency 3 months later. Conclusions: Medial thalamotomy or pallido-thalamic tractotomy had acute and reversible effects on the EEG and long-term deleterious side effects of stereotactic surgery on sleep and sleep EEG are improbable. The results provide further evidence for the involvement of the human thalamus in the generation of sleep spindles. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, it requires a convolution integral in the time domain, so the amount of computation is enormous. In this paper, we propose a fast wavelet transform (FWT) that the corrected basic fast algorithm (CBFA) and the fast wavelet transform for high accuracy (FWTH). As a result, our fast wavelet transform can achieve high computation speed and at the same time to improve the computational accuracy. The CBFA uses the mother wavelets whose frequencies are 2 octaves lower than the Nyquist frequency in the basic fast algorithm. The FWT for high accuracy is realized by using upsampling based on a L-Spline interpolation. The experimental results demonstrate advantages of our approach and show its effectiveness for EEG analysis. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Theta-band activity (4-12 Hz in rodents; 4-8 Hz in humans) plays a significant role in memory function in rodents and in humans. Recording intracranially in humans, we have reported task-related, theta-band rhythmic activity in the raw trace during virtual maze learning and during a nonspatial working memory task. Here we analyze oscillations during virtual maze learning across a much broader range of frequencies and analyze their relationship to two task variables relevant to learning. We describe a new algorithm for detecting oscillatory episodes that takes advantage of the high signal-to-noise ratio and high temporal resolution of the iEEG. Accounting for the background power spectrum of the iEEG, the algorithm allows us to directly compare levels of oscillatory activity across frequencies within the 2- to 45-Hz band. We report that while episodes of oscillatory activity are found at various frequencies, most of the rhythmic activity during virtual maze learning occurs within the theta band. Theta oscillations are more prevalent when the task is made more difficult (manipulation of maze length). However, these oscillations do not tend to covary significantly with decision time, a good index of encoding and retrieval operations. In contrast, lower- and higher-frequency oscillations do covary with this variable. These results suggest that while human cortically recorded theta might play a role in encoding, the overall levels of theta oscillations tell us little about the immediate demands on encoding or retrieval. Finally, different patterns of oscillations may reflect distinct underlying aspects of memory function.

Individual PK parameter estimates were incorporated into a PK/PD model. 4 Qualitative EEG changes in rat and human were similar for clozapine, but different for the two developmental compounds, suggesting that changes in these PD parameters may not be specifically related to the anti-psychotic activity. 5 Although no definitive data are available concerning the signal specificity of EEG frequency bands with respect to dopaminergic or serotonergic receptor activity, qualitative and quantitative differences seen in EEG parameters are likely to result from the multiple receptor occupancy for these compounds. 6 The results confirm the value of population PK/PD modelling in conjunction with sparse sampling to enable determination of concentration effect relationships in the pre-clinical development programme of CNS-active drugs.

These methods are particularly fruitful when they are strongly correlated with intuitive physical concepts that allow a better understanding of brain dynamics. Here, new method based on orthogonal discrete wavelet transform (ODWT) is applied. It takes as a basic element the ODWT of the EEG signal, and defines the relative wavelet energy, the wavelet entropy (WE) and the relative wavelet entropy (RWE). The relative wavelet energy provides information about the relative energy associated with different frequency bands present in the EEG and their corresponding degree of importance. The WE carries information about the degree of order/disorder associated with a multi-frequency signal response, and the RWE measures the degree of similarity between different segments of the signal. In addition, the time evolution of the WE is calculated to give information about the dynamics in the EEG records. Within this framework, the major objective of the present work was to characterize in a quantitative way functional dynamics of order/disorder microstates in short duration EEG signals. For that aim, spontaneous EEG signals under different physiological conditions were analyzed. Further, specific quantifiers were derived to characterize how stimulus affects electrical events in terms of frequency synchronization (tuning) in the event related potentials.

However, the characteristics of continuous fluctuations in nocturnal autonomic nerve tone have not been clarified in detail. The study aimed to determine the possible correlation between the electroencephalogram (EEG) and autonomic nervous activities, and to clarify in detail the nocturnal fluctuations in autonomic nerve activities. Overnight EEGs and electrocardiograms of seven healthy males were obtained. These EEGs were analyzed by fast Fourier transformation algorithm to extract delta, sigma and beta power. Heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) were calculated in consecutive 5-min epochs. The HRV indices of low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF) and LF/HF ratio were calculated from the spectral analysis of R-R intervals. The sleep stages were manually scored according to Rechtschaffen and Kales' criteria. Low frequency and LF/HF were significantly lower during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) than REM, and were lower in stages 3 and 4 than in stages 1 and 2. Furthermore, delta EEG showed inverse correlations with LF (r = - 0.44, P < 0.001) and LF/HF (r = - 0.41, P < 0.001). In contrast, HF differed neither between REM and NREM nor among NREM sleep stages. Detailed analysis revealed that correlation was evident from the first to third NREM, but not in the fourth and fifth NREM. Delta EEG power showed negative correlations with LF and LF/HF, suggesting that sympathetic nervous activities continuously fluctuate in accordance with sleep deepening and lightening.

Methods: The electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) were recorded in 9 normal volunteers during tonic contraction of upper and lower limb muscles on the right side. Coherence between EEG and EMG was computed to analyze their linear association. Results: EEG over the contralateral sensorimotor area was coherent with EMG, with peak coherence at 11-36 Hz (mean, 22 Hz). For the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle, peak coherence, as determined by functional brain mapping with Focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), was over or slightly posterior to the hand area on the primary motor cortex determined by focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Peak coherence over the scalp was somatotopically organized. The temporal relation between EEC and EMG was analyzed with a new model for interpreting the phase shift ('constant phase shift plus constant time lag' model). For the APE muscle, the phase relation between cortical and muscular oscillations differed in the frequency ranges of 3-13 Hz and 14-50 Hz, respectively, suggesting that different coupling mechanisms operate in different bands. Only the phase shift between cortical and motoneuronal firing at 14-50 Hz was reliably estimated by a linear model. At 14-50 Hz, motoneuronal firing was led by surface-negative cortical activity with a constant time lag that depended on the cortical-muscular distance. For the APE muscle, the time lag was slightly shorter than the cortical-muscular conduction time determined by TMS. Vibratory stimulation (100 Hz) of a muscle tendon during tonic contraction had no significant effect on cortical-muscular coherence. indicating that cortical oscillation reflected motor rather than sensory activity. Conclusions: The present findings suggest temporal coding of the oscillatory motor control system (3-13 Hz vs. 14-50 Hz), and confirm the functional importance of cortical beta and gamma rhythms in the motor efferent command. Cortical-muscular synchronization is most likely mediated by the direct corticospinal pathway within the frequency range of 14-50 Hz. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Little, however, is known about the long-term spatiotemporal structure of the complex patterns of ongoing activity. A central unresolved issue is whether fluctuations in oscillatory activity reflect a memory of the dynamics of the system for more than a few seconds. We investigated the temporal correlations of network oscillations in the normal human brain at time scales ranging from a few seconds to several minutes. Ongoing activity during eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions was recorded with simultaneous magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography. Here we show that amplitude fluctuations of 10 and 20 Hz oscillations are correlated over thousands of oscillation cycles. Our analyses also indicated that these amplitude fluctuations obey power-law scaling behavior. The scaling exponents were highly invariant across subjects. We propose that the large variability, the long-range correlations, and the power-law scaling behavior of spontaneous oscillations find a unifying explanation within the theory of self-organized criticality, which offers a general mechanism for the emergence of correlations and complex dynamics in stochastic multiunit systems. The demonstrated scaling laws pose novel quantitative constraints on computational models of network oscillations. We argue that critical-state dynamics of spontaneous oscillations may lend neural networks capable of quick reorganization during processing demands.

These signals are non-stationary which makes time-invariant filtering unsuitable. The new method assumes a signal model and performs denoising by filtering the signal of each channel using a time-variable filter which is an estimate of the Wiener filter. The approximate Wiener filters are obtained using the time-frequency coherence functions between all channel pairs, and a fix-point algorithm. We estimate the coherence functions using the multiple window method, after which the fix-point algorithm is applied. Simulations indicate that this method improves upon its restriction to assumed stationary signals for realistically non-stationary data, in terms of mean square error, and we show that it can also be used for time-frequency representation of noisy multichannel signals. The method was applied to two epileptic seizure onset signals, and it turned out that the most informative output of the method are the filters themselves studied in the time-frequency domain. They seem to reveal hidden features of the epileptic signal which are otherwise invisible. This algorithm can be used as preprocessing for seizure onset EEG signals prior to time-frequency representation and manual or algorithmic pattern classification.

We compared the ability of the bispectral index (BIS) to distinguish the awake and anaesthetized states during the induction of general anaesthesia with: (i) components of the BIS (BetaRatio, SynchFastSlow); (ii) a new EEG variable-the median frequency of the first time derivative of the EEG signal (SE50d); and (iii) the SE50d derived from an EEG signal that has had the frequencies above 30 Hz removed (SE50d(30Hz)). Two groups of subjects were studied: (i) nine volunteers undergoing a short propofol infusion until loss of response to verbal command, and (ii) 84 patients undergoing routine anaesthesia for a variety of surgical procedures. in the volunteer group, the changes in the BetaRatio and SE50d were comparable with changes in the BIS. The changes in the SE50d(30Hz) were less consistent. In the patient group, the BIS components were equivalent to the BIS in separating the awake from the surgically anaesthetized states (area under receiver operating curve: BIS 0.95, SE50d 0.95, BetaRatio 0.96). Using the submental electromyogram (EMG) signal to estimate the frontalis EMG (30-47 Hz) signal, the changes in EMG signal were, on average, about one-tenth the magnitude of the EEG. We conclude that: (i) there exist simpler derived EEG variables that are similar in accuracy to the BIS; (ii) it is important to avoid filtering out the EEG frequencies above 30 Hz; and (iii) in most patients the confounding effects of the frontalis EMG on the EEG are minimal.

Methods: EEG power values were calculated across a 1-28 Hz frequency range in a 1 Hz resolution during the wakefulness-sleep transition of 7 normal subjects. Topographical changes were assessed from C3-A2, C4-A1, Fpz-A1, Fz-Al, Cz-Al, Pz-Al, Oz-Al recordings, after averaging individual time series, aligned with respect to the onset of stage 2. Results: The single Hz analysis showed that before sleep onset (SO), the <7 Hz slow frequencies were more prominent at the more anterior scalp locations; this anterior prominence was counterbalanced by a reciprocal prevalence across the >8 Hz frequencies of EEG activity from the occipital areas; while the > 13 Hz fast frequencies were not characterized by significant antero-posterior differences. After SO, more EEG power was found in the range of slow frequencies at the centro-frontal scalp locations and a second peak of EEG activity was also revealed within the range of the sigma frequency, higher at the centro-parietal scalp locations. No consistent topographical changes were observed within the range of faster EEG frequencies. Grouped-frequency analysis confirmed these results, also pointing to different changes in the alpha frequency as a function of the SO point. Conclusions: The results suggest that: (a) the alpha rhythm spreads anteriorly as the transition progresses; b) several anterior areas first synchronize EEG activity; (c) the functional meaning of the EEG bands during the SO period should be partially revised with regard at least to alpha rhythm; (d) SO coincides with the start of stage 2.

The original technique analyses successive spikes intervals of the EEG signal in the TF domain to discriminate between seizure and nonseizure activities. In this paper improvement on the original approach is achieved by using a new spike detection technique. In this technique the TF of the signal is enhanced before the actual spike detection scheme is applied. Then, two frequency slices are extracted from the higher frequency area of the TF distribution to detect the spikes. The extracted frequency slices are subjected to the smoothed nonlinear energy operator to accentuate the spike signatures. Histogram of successive spikes intervals is then used as a feature for seizure detection. In the presented technique the EEG data are segmented into 4-second epochs. A k-nearest neighbour algorithm is employed to classify the EEG epochs into seizure and nonseizure groups. The performance of the presented technique is evaluated using the EEG data of five neonates.

Such neural integration processes can be studied by measuring synchronization of oscillations. Coherence is the best known algorithm to study synchronization between two sites of the cortex with regard to selected oscillation frequencies. Phase coherence quantifies phase synchronization, in particular. In addition, cross phase (or simply phase) gives information about the direction and speed of the spread of oscillations. We use a new method to study short-time phases between different sites of the cortex in order to explore transient neural networks during word processing. Particularly, processing of abstract and concrete nouns was investigated by dynamic phase analysis of the alphal frequency band (8-10 Hz). Abstract and concrete nouns turned out to induce different dynamic networks of information transfer. Whereas processing of concrete nouns excites a widespread network for about 800 msec, the interhemispheric interactions during abstract noun processing are restricted to 300-500 msec after word presentation. Further, the direction of cerebral information transfer differs for the two word categories. Additionally, it could be shown that the propagation speed of information is slower for concrete nouns than for abstract nouns. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The computerized storage and analysis of physiological data led to the detection of repetitive synchronized cyclical oscillations of arterial pressure, heart rate, EEG parameters, peripheral temperature and core temperature. Arterial pressure oscillations have been described in patients who are severely systemically unwell; cardiovascular and brain electrical activity may also oscillate in the presence of raised intracranial pressure. In contrast, this patient had no features of severe systemic illness or of raised intracranial pressure. Our hypothesis is that high-dose thiopental may have been a cause of our findings by producing autonomic dysfunction.

EEG was recorded from subjects while they were shown backward-masked words only some of which they were able to discriminate correctly. The results showed that activity in the gamma frequency range increased with reported awareness of a word independently of whether it was correctly discriminated or not. It is concluded that gamma power is associated with awareness-dependent visual processing but not with processing that occurs in the absence of awareness. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This study investigates task-related alpha power desynchronization during an attentional switching task requiring higher executive attentional control. Low 8-10 Hz and high 10-12 Hz alpha power responses are studied in good versus poor performers based upon normative data. Accurate, fast and stable performers showed significant task-related desynchronization in the 8-10 Hz range during attentional switching, whereas inaccurate performers hypersynchronized in the 10-12 Hz range, and slow and unstable performers did not demonstrate significant alpha reactivity. These preliminary findings indicate, in agreement with previous research, functional differences in these narrow frequency bands. The 8-10 Hz power decrease is likely to be related to phasic arousal or alertness, whereas the 10-12 Hz power increase appears to be associated with inaccurate attentional switching.

We used infomax independent component analysis (ICA) to decompose 64-channel EEG data from trials in which the subject successfully up-or down-regulated the measured EEG signals. Applying time-frequency analysis to the time courses of activity of several of the resulting 64 independent EEG components revealed that successful regulation of the measured activity was accompanied by extensive, asymmetrical changes in power and coherence, at both nearby and distant frequencies, in several parts of cortex. A more complete understanding of these phenomena could help to explain the nature and locus of learned regulation of EEG rhythms and might also suggest ways to further optimize the performance of brain-computer interfaces.

This information is at present not readily available, because the design of arrays has not been based on systematic studies of the spatial power spectral densities of these signals from the brain. Spatial spectral analysis is essential for deriving spatial patterns from simultaneous recordings of EEGs, in order to determine the optimal interval between electrodes in arrays, and to design spatial filters, particularly for extraction of information about the dynamics of human gamma activity. EEG have now been recorded from up to 64 electrodes 0.5 mm apart in a linear array 3.2 cm long, which was placed on the exposed superior temporal gyrus or motor cortex of volunteers undergoing diagnostic surgery. Visual displays of multiple traces revealed broad spectrum oscillations in episodic bursts having a common aperiodic wave form with recurring patterns of spatial amplitude modulation (AM patterns) on selected portions of the array. The one-dimensional spatial spectrum of the human ECoG was calculated at successive time samples and averaged over periods up to 20 s. Log power decreased monotonically with increasing log spatial frequency in cycles/mm (c/mm) to the noise level similar to2 log units below maximal power at minimal frequency (0.039 * 0.002 c/mm). The inflection point at 0.40 * 0.05 c/mm specified an optimal value for a low pass spatial filter to remove noise, and an optimal interelectrode spacing of 1.25 mm to avoid undersampling and aliasing. An 8x8 array with that spacing is 10x10 mm, which fits readily onto the average human gyrus having a width of about 1 cm, and it can be introduced through a standard neurosurgical trephine opening, thus avoiding the need to remove a bone flap.

Methods: Sixty-eight patients with temporal lobe epilepsy who underwent temporal lobectomy with good surgical outcome were included in this study. Ictal SPECT was performed during video-EEG monitoring. The ictal EEG was analyzed in 5-second intervals from the initiation of the ictal rhythm. Lateralized EEG dominance was determined by the amplitude, frequency, or regional patterns of ictal rhythm for each 5-second interval. The total ictal EEG was divided into three periods: preinjection (maximum, 30 seconds), the initial part of the postinjection period (30 seconds), and the latter part of the postinjection period (30 to 60 seconds). The results of ictal SPECT were compared with the lateralized EEG dominance of each period and at seizure onset. Results: Fifty-four of 68 ictal EEGs correctly lateralized seizure focus ipsilateral to the side of surgery. Ictal SPECT correctly lateralized the epileptogenic temporal lobe in 61 of 68 patients (mean injection time, 29.8 seconds from onset). Multivariate analysis indicated that only the EEG dominance of the prejection period correlated significantly with the concordant hyperperfusion of ictal SPECT. Correct lateralization of ictal SPECT occurred in 10 of 14 patients with nonlateralized ictal EEG. Conclusions: Preinjection neuronal activity seems to be important for the accurate interpretation of the hyperperfused patterns of ictal SPECT. Ictal SPECT is an independent and confirmatory presurgical evaluation technique.

Three special EEG patterns of marginal to slightly abnormal character are discussed: a) rhythmical midfrontal 6-7/sec activity of juveniles, b) rhythmical midfrontal sharp 4-6/sec activity of infancy and early childhood with arousal from sleep, and c) frontal intermittent rhythmical delta activity (FIRDA) in waking adults with frontopolar maximum, possibly related to thought processes under abnormal conditions. With extension of the frequency range, ultraslow (DC-like) as well as fast beta (gamma, 40-80/sec) and ultrafast activity (80-1000/sec) are found particularly over the frontal lobes. Ultraslow baseline shifts are arousal-related and mixed with overlying ultrafast waves. Attention control and the "working memory" involve chiefly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, investigated with P300 responses and likely to show ultrafast spectra. Perception -related 40-80/sec gamma activity has been thought to be associated with the entrance into consciousness. Initiation and design of motor activity spreads from prefrontal to the frontomotor cortex, associated with powerful event-related potentials: contingent negative variation (CNV) and "Bereitschafts potential" ("readiness potential," RP). Neuroscientific research of the highest frontal lobe functions has become a very active domain of neuroimaging. With the use of the extended frequency range, EEG and also evoked potential studies could add further information with acquisition in real time.

In addition, the diagnostic values of the electroencephalogram (EEG) for judging the depth of the balanced anaesthesia with an alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist was evaluated. The treatments comprised 20 mug/kg medetomidine (Me-20), 80 mug/kg medetomidine (Me-80), 20 mug/kg medetomidine and 0.5 mg/kg midazolam (Me-Mi) administered intramuscularly, and 20 mug/kg medetomidine with 0.5 mg/kg midazolam and 0.1 mg/kg butorphanol (Me-Mi-Bu). The EEG was recorded continuously at pre-administration, and at 7, 10, 20, 30, 45 and 60 min after administration. The recorded data were analysed by separating the power spectrum into 1-3, 4-7, 8-13 and 14-30 Hz bands. Spectral-edge analysis was used to calculate the spectral edge frequency 90 (SEF90) and the median edge frequency (MEF). Time-related changes in power spectrum analysis showed a significant increase in the Me-80 group in the 1-3 Hz band. The power for 1-3 Hz in the Me-80 group was significantly higher than in all the other groups. In the 14-30 Hz band, there was a significant reduction of power in all groups following administration of the agents. The SEF90 frequencies were significantly reduced in all groups except for the Me-20 group after administration of the agents. The SEF90 frequencies in the Me-20, Me-Mi and Me-Mi-Bu were all significantly higher than those in the Me-80 group. However, there was no significant difference between the Me-20, Me-Mi and Me-Mi-Bu groups in any analyses. Our results demonstrated that the changes in quantitative EEG made by the Me-Mi-Bu and Me-Mi groups were similar to those made by Me-20 groups. Present results suggest that the EEG should be interpreted with caution in assessing the anaesthetic level in balanced anaesthesia in dogs.

MEG has now emerged as a mature clinical technology. While both EEG and MEG can be performed with more than 100 channels, MEG recordings with 100 to 300 channels are more easily done because of the time needed to apply a large number of EEG electrodes. EEG has the advantage of the long-term video EEG recordings, which facilitates extensive temporal sampling across all periods of the sleep/wake cycle. MEG and EEG seem to complement each other for the detection of interictal epileptiform discharges, because some spikes can be recorded only on MEG but not on EEG and vice versa. Most studies indicate that MEG seems to be more sensitive for neocortical spike sources. Both EEG and MEG source localizations show excellent agreement with invasive electrical recordings, clarify the spatial relationship between the irritative zone and structural lesions, and finally, attribute epileptic activity to lobar subcompartments in temporal lobe and to a lesser extent in extratemporal epilepsies. In temporal lobe epilepsy, EEG and MEG can differentiate between patients with mesial, lateral and diffuse seizure onsets. MEG selectively detects tangential sources. EEG measures both radial and tangential activity, although the radial components dominate the EEG signals at the scalp. Thus, while EEG provides more comprehensive information, it is more complicated to model due to considerable influences of the shape and conductivity of the volume conductor. Dipole localization techniques favor MEG due to the higher accuracy of MEG source localization compared to EEG when using the standard spherical head shape model. However, if special care is taken to address the above issues and enhance the EEG, the localization accuracy of EEG and MEG actually are comparable, although these surface EEG analytic techniques are not typically approved for clinical use in the United States. MEG dipole analysis is approved for clinical use and thus gives information that otherwise usually requires invasive intracranial EEG monitoring. There are only a few dozen whole head MEG units in operation in the world. While EEG is available in every hospital, specialized EEG laboratories capable of source localization techniques are nearly as scarce as MEG facilities. The combined use of whole-head MEG systems and multichannel EEG in conjunction with advanced source modeling techniques is an area of active development and will allow a better noninvasive characterization of the irritative zone in presurgical epilepsy evaluation. Finally, additional information on epilepsy may be gathered by either MEG or EEG analysis of data beyond the usual bandwidths used in clinical practice, namely by analysis of activity at high frequencies and near-DC activity.

The. cognitive and in formation processing take place in different brain regions. In order to investigate how these distributed brain regions are linked together and the information is exchanged, the coherent analysis is frequently used as a tool for studying the relationship between two channel EEG. Traditional linear method for calculating the correlation between two time series in the frequency domain is referred as the coherence analysis. In many practice, EEG signals are often expressed, as time-varying processes. For this purpose, this paper proposes a modern time-frequency method, which employs an alternative way for quantifying synchrony with both temporal and spectral resolution. This modern analysis method combines the wavelet transform. with the coherence. Wavelet coherent spectrum is defined and computed from the EEG data set such that the cross wavelet magnitude spectra serves to indicate the degree of coherence and. the cross wavelet phase can be used to provide the direction of information flow between channels on different cortical regions. Several real EEG data are collected based on a cognitive target. It is observed from the cross wavelet magnitude spectra and the phase that there are obviously differences during identifying both Chinese and English sentences. The researches are helpful for the study of English and Chinese to the Chinese students.

Depending on the location of epileptic areas (foci) of the brain, seizures can take many forms and occur as a result of a brief disturbance in the brain's electrochemical activity. Many systems of the human body are effected by the neurological disorder, making the study of epileptic seizure occurrence and detection complex. There is a need for a detector to predict onset, as seizure occurrence and frequency of occurrence are often unpredictable at times. The aim is to distinguish characteristic frequency components existent in EEG waveforms, during muscle contractions of the abductor digiti minimi (ADM) through electroencephalographic (EEG) frequency analysis. Here, EEG waveforms were recorded across the right hemisphere motor-cortex region of the brain during localised voluntary and involuntary finger contractions. Involuntary contractions were evoked through electrical stimulation of the ADM. Results from power spectral analysis of the EEG show an increase in magnitude during voluntary contractions compared to involuntary evoked contractions.

J	Bigan, C; Woolfson, MS				Bigan, C; Woolfson, MS			Time-frequency analysis of short segments of biomedical data	IEE PROCEEDINGS-SCIENCE MEASUREMENT AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								An evaluation is made of two novel methods in the tracking of variations in frequency of the various components present in an electroencephalogram (EEG) signal, for example when the subject is undergoing an epileptic seizure. In one method, the polynomial modelling method, the EEG is broken down into its constituent components using repeated polynomial modelling and zero crossing analysis is employed to characterise the time variation of the frequency of each component. In the second method, the phase compensation method, the signal is modelled as several cosines and the individual components are estimated and subtracted off the total signal; the phase derivative of each component is used to estimate the frequency. These methods are then compared with the conventional short time Fourier transform (STFT) and the high-order Yule-Walker (HOYW) methods. Using simulated data it is shown that the polynomial modelling method has the best performance in terms of breaking down the EEG into its constituent components. However, the HOYW and phase compensation methods provide estimates of the frequencies with lower variance. The three non-Fourier based methods are sensitive to the presence of noise and give similar estimates of the frequencies when applied to experimental non-pathological EEG data. The paper concludes with suggestions for combining the two novel methods to obtain a better frequency tracking performance.

Two HOC-based EEG analysis methods are developed for brain injury detection and quantification. The first method explores EEG spectrum characteristics via an estimate of the dominant frequency of a pre-processed EEG signal. The second method is based on the norm of the AHOC, an HOC obtained from the alpha-filter prefiltered EEG signal. Both methods are shown to be effective in detecting hypoxic/asphyxic injuries as well as assessing the severity of the injury.

Methods: Eighteen patients (mean age: 24.7 +/- 5.5 years) affected by partial epilepsy underwent continuous EEC-polysomnography. The temporal series of Slow Wave Activity (SWA), Sigma Activity (SA) and Theta Band (TB), derived from spectral analysis, were obtained from a spike-free and pathologic alteration-free derivation, contralateral to the most active lead, where the IED count was performed. Relationships between SA, SWA and TB and time series of ZED were tested by means of correlation techniques after data normalization. Results: Our results revealed a significantly higher correlation between IED and SWA in 12 subjects; a significantly higher correlation between ZED and SA in three subjects and a significant correlation with TB in three cases. Conclusions: Data suggest that in most adult patients with partial epilepsy IED production during sleep is facilitated by the action of synchronizing mechanisms which are active during NREM sleep and lead to the appearance of EEG delta waves. Nevertheless evidence is given of two smaller groups of patients. In one of them ZED are more sensitive to the promoting action of the spindle generating mechanism, active during stage 2 of NREM sleep. In the other one the promoting action of TB, characterizing EEG during stage 1 and REM sleep, is evident. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

A power spectral analysis of the EEG during the retention interval revealed a clear peak at 9-12 Hz, a frequency in the alpha band (8-13 Hz). In apparent conflict with previous ideas according to which alpha band oscillations represent brain 'idling', we found that the alpha peak systematically increased with the number of items held in working memory. The enhancement was prominent over the posterior and bilateral central regions. The enhancement over posterior regions is most likely explained by the well known alpha rhythm produced close to the parietal-occipital fissure, whereas the lateral enhancement could be explained by sources in somato-motor cortex. A time-frequency analysis revealed that the enhancement was present throughout the last 2.5 s of the 2.8 s retention interval and that alpha power rapidly diminished following the probe. The load dependence and the tight temporal regulation of alpha provide strong evidence that the alpha generating system is directly or indirectly linked to the circuits responsible for working memory. Although a clear peak in the theta band (5-8 Hz) was only detectable in one subject, other lines of evidence indicate that theta occurs and also has a role in working memory. Hypotheses concerning the role of alpha band activity in working memory are discussed.

Auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were compared with bisensory evoked potentials (BEPs; simultaneous auditory and visual stimulation) in 15 subjects. Gamma responses in AEPs, VEPs and BEPs were assessed by means of wavelet decomposition. Overall maximum gamma-components post-stimulus were highest in BEPs (P<0.01). Bisensory evoked gamma-responses also showed significant central, parietal and occipital amplitude-increases (P<0.001, P<0.01, P<0.05, respectively; prestimulus interval as baseline). These were of greater magnitude when compared with the unisensory responses. As a correlate of the marked gamma responses to bimodal stimulation we suggest a process of 'intersensory association', i.e. one of the steps between sensory transmission and perception. Our data may be interpreted as a further example of function-related gamma responses in the EEG. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This study was designed to examine whether they are linked to sleep stage-related changes in arterial blood pressure (ABP). Analysis of sleep electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in the delta frequency band, intra-arterial pressure, and PRA measured every 10 min was performed in eight healthy subjects. Simultaneously, the ratio of low frequency power to low frequency power + high frequency power [LF/(LF + HF)] was calculated using spectral analysis of R-R intervals. The cascade of physiological events that led to increased renin release during NREM sleep could be characterized. First, the LF/(LF + HF) ratio significantly (P < 10(-4)) decreased, indicating a reduction in sympathetic tone, concomitantly to a significant (P < 10(-3)) decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP). Delta wave activity increased (P < 10(-4)) 10-20 min later and was associated with a lag of 0-10 min with a significant rise in PRA (P < 10-4). Rapid eye movement sleep was characterized by a significant increase (P < 10(-4)) in the LF/(LF + HF) ratio and a decrease (P < 10(-4)) in delta wave activity and PRA, whereas MAP levels were highly variable. Overnight cross-correlation analysis revealed that MAP was inversely correlated with delta wave activity and with PRA (P < 0.01 in all subjects but one). These results suggest that pressure-dependent mechanisms elicit the nocturnal PRA oscillations rather than common central processes controlling both the generation of slow waves and the release of renin from the kidney.

The sensorimotor cortex seems to be part of the tremor-generating neuronal network in ET. Here, we investigated using electroencephalography (EEG) whether the independence of central oscillators in ET is supported by the analysis of cortical activity. Methods: In 8 patients with ET, bilateral hand tremor was activated by wrist extension. EMGs from the wrist flexors and extensors were recorded simultaneously with an EEG. EEG-EMG coherence was estimated for 74 epochs of 60 s duration. Results: In 42.6% of the cases, EEG-EMG coherence at the tremor frequency existed only with the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. However, 21.6% of the tremor-EMGs were coherent with EEG activity over both the contralateral and ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex. Bilateral and exclusively contralateral EEG-EMG coherence could alternate within the same recording. Bilateral EEG-EMG coherence was associated with increased right-left EEG-EEG coherence, increased right-left EMG-EMG coherence as well as with increased tremor strength. Conclusions: In ET, central oscillators in the right and left brain are not entirely independent of each other. They may dynamically synchronise, presumably by interhemispheric coupling via the corpus callosum. (C) 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Consistent with previous results, the present data show that schizophrenics have lower EEG responses to photic stimulation in alpha frequency. The differences between normal and schizophrenic subjects were distributed across major brain areas except centro-temporal regions. It also demonstrated that I-Hz narrow-pulsed stimulation was feasible in EEG photic driving studies. The enhanced harmonic resolution produced significantly more information in the frequency domain about EEG oscillatory responses to visual stimulus. Using this new technique, the authors showed for the first time that alpha photic driving was a well defined resonant system and that the group differences in harmonic responses were primarily confirmed in the high frequency portion of alpha band, suggesting a peak frequency shift of EEG resonance in schizophrenia.

A statistical time-frequency analysis (STFA) approach is taken to detect cognitive binding. The STFA approach consists of an analysis filter bank that extracts useful components from the input EEG signals and certain statistical parameters at the output that characterize the synchronization patterns or er multiple scalp sites. With the help of wavelet-packet filters and wavelet coherence measures, cognitive binding is detected over many frequency bands by statistical resting.

EEGs of freely moving rats were recorded with implanted electrodes and were decomposed into four components of delta, theta, alpha and beta by wavelet transform. The power and power percentage of each component were calculated as functions of time. The results show that under slow wave sleep there existed as much as 26.2 +/- 7.7% of EEG period during which the delta power percentage was less than 50%. The powers of other three components during small delta EEG were significantly larger than those during large delta EEG. Comparatively, the conventional FFT method could only show a delta power (percentage of 70.6 +/- 6.4%) dominating spectrum. Therefore, the method of wavelet transform is useful in developing new quantitative time-frequency measures of EEG.

FFI is pathologically characterized by selective atrophy of the anteroventral and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei and clinically by loss of sleep, dysautonomia and motor signs. A key early polysomnographic sign of the disease onset is the loss of sleep spindling (sigma activity, SA). In FFI tho loss of SA leads to the spectral representation of a sudden slow wave activity (SWA) increase from an awake state, the reaching of a stable plateau without oscillations, followed by abrupt fall down to REM sleep. We evaluated the presence of differences in the spectral sleep EEG pattern in FFI relatives carriers (C178(pos)) or non-carriers (C178(neg)) of the C178 mutation. Methods: Seventeen healthy relatives of FFI patients, 8 carriers of the C178 FFI mutation in a preclinical condition and 9 non carriers, underwent two-night polysomnography. The absolute and relative EEG power of the 4 main bands (delta: SWA, 0.5-4.0 Hz; theta: TB, 4.5-8 Hz; alpha: AB, 8.5-12 Hz; sigma: SA, 12.5-16 Hz) has been studied for the total sleep time, the period of delta increase after sleep onset, and the period of delta plateau. Multiple regression has been applied to investigate relations between the power of the bands studied and 3 parameters: age, the gender of the subjects and the C178 genotype. Results: Our study could not show evidence of differences in the sleep EEG composition between carriers and non-carriers of the C178 FFI mutation. Conclusions: The spectral analysis techniques we used were not able to disclose sleep EEG markers linked to the FFI C178(pos) in the preclinical condition. Key sleep EEG alteration become evident only at the clinical onset of the disease. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we use a 'quasi-detrending' method for classification of EEG spectrum where the level of detrending or differencing is made to vary. Differencing in time domain acts as a high pass filter in the frequency domain. Therefore the low frequency values in the delta range can be ignored and this is a saving in computation time since delta range values do not correspond to any normal conscious human mental tasks. We also show that using discrete PSD values in the range below 30 Hz gives better classification results than using the delta, theta, alpha and beta power band values used by some authors.

These methods are particularly fruitful when they are strongly correlated with intuitive physical concepts that allow a better understanding of the brain dynamics. The processing of information by the brain is reflected in dynamical changes of the electrical activity in time, frequency, and space. Therefore, the concomitant studies require methods capable of describing the qualitative variation of the signal in both time and frequency. The entropy defined from the wavelet functions is a measure of the order/disorder degree present in a time series. In consequence, this entropy evaluates over EEG time series gives information about the underlying dynamical process in the brain, more specifically of the synchrony of the group cells involved in the different neural responses. The total wavelet entropy results independent of the signal energy and becomes a good tool for detecting dynamical changes in the system behavior. In addition the total wavelet entropy has advantages over the Lyapunov exponents, because it is parameter free and independent of the stationarity of the time series. In this work we compared the results of the time evolution of the chaoticity (Lyapunov exponent as a function of time) with the corresponding time evolution of the total wavelet entropy in two different EEG records, one provide by depth electrodes and other by scalp ones.

To test this theoretical framework we recorded neuromagnetic responses from 10 subjects performing the Sternberg task. Subjects were required to retain a list of 1, 3, 5 or 7 visually presented digits during a 3-s retention period. During the retention period we observed ongoing frontal theta activity in the 7-8.5-Hz band recorded by sensors over frontal brain areas. The activity in the theta band increased parametrically with the number of items retained in working memory. A time-frequency analysis revealed that the task-dependent theta was present during the retention period and during memory scanning. Following the memory task the theta activity was reduced. These results suggest that theta oscillations generated in frontal brain regions play an active role in memory maintenance.

We applied two quantifiers based on the Wavelet Transform to evaluate 20 seizures from eight consecutive patients admitted for video-EEG monitoring. We studied the relative wavelet energy and the wavelet entropy over time. In 16/20 events we found significant decremental activity in the relative wavelet energy associated with frequency band 0.8-3.2 Hz (delta activity) at the seizure onset, indicating that the seizure is dominated by medium frequency bands 3.2-12.8 Hz (theta and alpha bands). In 19/20 events the mean wavelet entropy presents lower values during the ictal period compared to the pre-ictal period, indicating that the associated dynamic is more ordered and simple. Thus the employed tools show good accuracy for detecting changes in the system dynamic.

The method relies on an adaptive approximation of a signal by means of waveforms chosen from a very large and redundant dictionary of functions. The MP performance is illustrated by simulations and examples of sleep spindles and slow wave activity analysis. An improvement of the original procedure, relying on the introduction of stochastic dictionaries, is proposed. A comparison of the performance of dyadic and stochastic dictionaries is presented. MP with stochastic dictionaries is characterized by an unmatched resolution in time-frequency space; moreover it allows for parametric description of all (periodic and transient) signal features in the framework of the same formalism. Matching pursuit is especially suitable for analysis of non-stationary signals and is a unique tool for the investigation of dynamic changes of brain activity.

Wavelet transform (WT) is a powerful signal processing tool for extracting the ERP components occurring at different time and frequency spots. A technical explanation of WT in ERP processing and its four distinct applications are presented here. The first two applications aim to identify and localize the functional oddball ERP components in terms of certain wavelet coefficients in delta, theta and alpha bands in a topographical recording. The third application performs a similar characterization that involves a three stimulus paradigm. The fourth application is a single sweep ERP processing to detect the P300 in single trials. The last case is an extension of ERP component identification by combining the WT with a source localization technique. The aim is to localize the time-frequency components in three dimensional brain structure instead of the scalp surface. The time-frequency analysis using WT helps isolate and describe sequential and/or overlapping functional processes during ERP generation, and provides a possibility for studying these cognitive processes and following their dynamics in single trials during an experimental session.

One disadvantage of using in vitro models for ischemia studies is the lack of a sensitive electrophysiological measure for the degree of ischemic damage to a large population of neurons. The present study examined effects of hypoglycemia, hypoxia or both on an in vitro micro-EEG model, to determine whether this model provides a sensitive measure. Methods: Theta frequency (4-8 Hz) micro-EEG oscillations were evoked in rat neocortical brain slices using the cholinergic agonist carbachol (100 mu M) and the GABA(A) antagonist bicuculline (10 mu M). Extracellular field micro-EEG signals and whole cell patch clamp recordings were used to monitor electrical activity. Results: Upon removal of oxygen and/or glucose, theta oscillation amplitudes progressively declined to isoelectric levels. Low frequency delta oscillations (0.5-3.0 Hz) and burst suppression discharges were prominent during hypoglycemic episodes and upon recovery. Time to onset of isoelectric activity was faster in slices deprived of both glucose and oxygen (7.0 +/- 1.8 min) and oxygen alone (5.0 +/- 1.5 min) compared to hypoglycemia alone (25.6 +/- 3.8 min, P < 0.01, ANOVA). Hypoxia and hypoglycemia-induced isoelectric activity occurred prior to significant population spike depression from control levels (87.7 +/- 16.9% control amplitude, P > 0.35 (t test compared with control) for hypoglycemia; 93.6 +/- 27.0%, P > 0.72 for hypoxia). Spreading depression (SD) was observed in 11/12 (91.7%) slices deprived of both sugar and oxygen, but not in hypoxic (0/4) or hypoglycemic (0/5) slices. in all cases, SD occurred later than isoelectric activity. Theta oscillations recovered within 10 min in 12/13 (92.3%) slices that did not undergo SD, but slices that underwent SD failed to recover theta activity (0/4), though all (4/4) at least partially recovered the population spike (>40%). Conclusions: These results suggest chat synchronized micro-EEG activity may be a useful and sensitive indicator of early-onset and possibly reversible ischemic damage.

Hence, time-frequency based techniques are employed for classification of these types of signals. In this paper we propose data-driven time frequency representations kernel optimization, that leads to the minimum classification error (MCE) for nonstationary signal classification. Our central issue is to determine the optimal kernel parameters and best distance measure to achieve the NICE performance measure. The minimum classification error achievable using optimized kernels is investigated for two types of nonstationary signals; namely simulated chirp signals and real-life newborn EEG signals. For the EEG signals a classification error as low as 4.6% was achieved.

Methods: Auditory responses were recorded simultaneously using EEG and MEG from 20 patients with schizophrenia and 19 control subjects. Bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG) sources and their time courses were obtained using MEG for the 30-100 ms post-stimulus interval. The MEG STG source time courses were used to predict the EEG signal at electrode Cz. Results: In control subjects, the STG sources predicted the EEG Cz recording very well (97% variance explained). In schizophrenia patients, the STG sources accounted for substantially (86%) and significantly (P < 0.0002) less variance. After MEG-derived STG activity was removed from the EEG Cz signal, the residual signal was dominated by 40 Hz activity, an indication that the remaining variance in EEG is probably contributed by other brain generators, rather than by random noise. Conclusions: Integrated MEG and EEG analysis can differentiate patients and controls, and suggests a basis for a well established abnormality in the cortical auditory response in schizophrenia, implicating a disorder of functional connectivity in the relationship between STG sources and other brain generators.

Since the non-stationary nature of different kinds of clinical EEG rhythms covers different frequency bands, wavelet packet decomposition, as a time-varying filter, can be used for forming the filters with different frequency response characteristics to detect 4 different EEG. rhythms. We also select he coefficients of wavelet transformation corresponding to the desired rhythms bands to construct the transient brain topographic mapping with multi-channel signals. Several clinical EEG signals are decomposed into 4 kinds of rhythms, and the specified rhythms are investigated and compared so that we can further understand the dynamic rhythms of the EEG signals in different functional states of brain. It is indicated from the experimental results. that the transient rhythms and the dynamic information of the brain electrical activities can be well described by using wavelet packet analysis. The method presented in this paper also proposes a new way for the analysis of other pathological EEG signals, such as the signals containing the spikes and slow waves.

Nonlinear measures of the EEG reflect the complexity of the overall EEG, but not of each component in it. The aim of this study is to examine effect of the sound and light (SL) stimulation on the complexity of each component of the EEG. We used independent component analysis to obtain independent components of the EEG. The first positive Lyapunov exponent (L1) was estimated as a nonlinear measure of complexity. Twelve subjects were administered photic and auditory stimuli with a frequency of 10 Hz, which corresponded to the alpha frequency of the EEG, by a sound and light entrainment device. We compared the L1 values of the EEGs and their independent components between baseline and after the SL stimulation. We detected that the L1 values of the EEG decreased after the SL stimulation in all channels except C3 and F4, indicating that the complexity of the EEG decreased. We showed that alpha components increased in proportion but decreased in complexity after the SL stimulation. The beta independent components were found to decrease in proportion and complexity. These results suggest that decreased complexity of he EEG after the SL stimulation may be principally caused by decreased complexity and increased proportion of the alpha independent components. We showed also that theta components increased in complexity after the SL stimulation. We propose that nonlinear dynamical analysis combined with independent component analysis may be helpful in understanding the temporal characteristics of the EEG. which cannot be detected by conventional linear or nonlinear methods.

Many methods have been proposed to remove artifacts from EEG recordings, especially those arising from eye movements and blinks. Often regression in the time or frequency domain is performed on parallel EEG and electrooculographic (EOG) recordings to derive parameters characterizing the appearance and spread of EOG artifacts in the EEG channels. Because EEG and ocular activity mix bidirectionally regressing out eye artifacts inevitably involves subtracting relevant EEG signals from each record as well. Regression methods become even more problematic when a good regressing channel is not available for each artifact source, as in the case of muscle artifacts. Use of principal component analysis (PCA) has been proposed to remove eye artifacts from multichannel EEG. However, PCA cannot completely separate eye artifacts from brain signals, especially when they have comparable amplitudes. Here, we propose a new and generally applicable method for removing a wide variety of artifacts from EEG records based on blind source separation by independent component analysis (ICA). Our results on EEG data collected from normal and autistic subjects show that ICA can effectively detect, separate, and remove contamination from a wide variety of artifactual sources in EEG records with results comparing favorably with those obtained using regression and PCA methods. ICA can also be used to analyze blink-related brain activity.

Clicks elicited larger responses with significantly shorter latencies than the tone pips at the same intensity in dB sensation level (SL). Most MLR amplitudes increased and their latencies decreased with increasing stimulus intensity for both types of stimulation. Pa and Nb amplitudes saturated at intensities of 60 dB SL in the case of click stimulation. The shorter latencies of MLR evoked by the click were explained by its short rise time and the high frequency content of its spectrum. MEG source analysis yielded MLR sources which were clearly different from those of the slow cortical wave N1. They seem to be located in primary auditory areas along Heschl's gyrus.

We record EEG using a high spatial density array (63 electrodes) during the rapid presentation (50-200 msec per image) of natural images. Each trial consists of 100 images, with a 50% chance of a single target being in a trial. Subjects are instructed to press a left mouse button at the end of the trial if they detected a target image, otherwise they are instructed to press the right button. Subject EEG was analyzed on a single-trial basis with an optimal spatial linear discriminator learned at multiple time windows after the presentation of an image. Analysis of discrimination results indicated a periodic fluctuation (time-localized oscillation) in A. performance. Analysis of the EEG using the discrimination components learned at the peaks of the A, fluctuations indicate 1) the presence of a positive evoked response, followed in time by a negative evoked response in strongly overlapping areas and 2) a component which is not correlated with the discriminator learned during the time-localized fluctuation. Results suggest that multiple signatures, varying over time, may exist for discriminating between target and distractor trials.

The second method called short time Directed Transfer Function (SDTF), based on a multichannel autoregressive model (MVAR), allowed for investigation of EEG activity propagation as a function of time and frequency. The evidence of "cross-talk" between different areas of sensorimotor cortex was found.

Based on the concepts of entropy and wavelet transform, we introduce a measure named Wavelet-Entropy and we will show the results of its application to real sleep EEG signals and artificial data. The definition of wavelet entropy is very similar to the definition of entropy in information theory or spectral entropy in signal processing but its most important difference is the usage of time-frequency representation of the signal and its wavelet coefficients. Time-frequency methods proved to be very useful for signals like EEG with fast changing dynamics and high non-stationarity. This characteristic of EEG limits the usage of other complexity evaluation methods like chaos analysis and parameters like correlation dimension or Lyapunov exponent.

Spontaneous power fluctuations of electrical rhythms were determined for multiple discrete frequency bands, and associated fMRI signal modulations were mapped on a voxel-by-voxel basis. There was little positive correlation of localized brain activity with alpha power (8-12 Hz), but strong and widespread negative correlation in lateral frontal and parietal cortices that are known to support attentional processes. Power in a 17-23 Hz range of beta activity was positively correlated with activity in retrosplenial, temporo-parietal, and clorsomedial prefrontal cortices. This set of areas has previously been characterized by high but coupled metabolism and blood flow at rest that decrease whenever subjects engage in explicit perception or action. The distributed patterns of fMRI activity that were correlated with power in different EEG bands overlapped strongly with those of functional connectivity, i.e., intrinsic covariations of regional activity at rest. This result indicates that, during resting wakefulness, and hence the absence of a task, these areas constitute separable and dynamic functional networks, and that activity in these networks is associated with distinct EEG signatures. Taken together with studies that have explicitly characterized the response properties of these distributed cortical systems, our findings may suggest that alpha oscillations signal a neural baseline with "inattention" whereas beta rhythms index spontaneous cognitive operations during conscious rest.

Methods: A method that calculates phase-corrected voltage maps in the frequency domain (FFT-approximation) was applied to ictal multichannel recordings in 10 epileptic patients. The onset of the ictally dominant frequency was determined and its temporal evolution over a time period of 46 s around the ictal EEG onset was studied. The analysis was completed by a linear inverse solution that estimated the sources of the dominant frequency. Results: This method permitted the identification of an ictally dominant frequency which started on the average prior to the onset of initial EEG signs as determined by visual inspection. The frequency incremented during the evolution of the seizure in all patients. The linear inverse solution algorithm localized the source of this frequency to the brain region which was clinically determined as the site of seizure onset and whose resection rendered all patients seizure-free. Conclusions: Our data suggest that the constant increase of the ictally dominant frequency is related to the amount of temporal lobe tissue generating the ictal discharges. Frequential analysis of ictal electric fields can be reliably used to detect focal pathological activity early during seizure onset arising in deep structures such as the mesial temporal lobe.

Wavelet transformation ( AM analyses were performed on the non-target (P3a) and target (P3b) ERPs to assay how the underlying electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was affected by both the difficulty and novelty factors. When target/standard discrimination was easy, P300 amplitude was higher for the target than the non-target across all electrode sites, and both demonstrated parietal maximums. In contrast, when target/standard discrimination was difficult, non-target amplitude (P3a) was higher and earlier over the frontal/central electrode sites for both levels of novelty, whereas target amplitude (P3b) was greater parietally and occurred later than the non-target components and was generally unaffected by non-target novelty level. The WT analyses indicated that appreciable theta activity was related to the more novel non-target stimuli; primarily target component delta coefficients were affected by the discrimination difficulty variable. The findings suggest that target/standard discrimination difficulty, rather than stimulus novelty, determines P3a generation for visual stimuli but that the underlying theta oscillations are differentially affected by stimulus novelty. WT analysis methods are discussed along with the theoretical and neurophysiological implications of the findings.

Design: Prospective study. Setting: Operating room (OR) of a university medical center. Patients: 7 ASA physical status I and II patients scheduled for elective surgery. Interventions: Patients were premedicated with ranitidine 150 mg. Anesthesia was induced with thiopental sodium 4 mg/kg intravenously (IV) and succinylchozine 1 mg/hg IV, and maintained with nitrous oxide (N2O) 67% and sevoflurane in oxygen. Patients were ventilated mechanically at a rate of 15 breaths/min. Measurements: R-R interval of electrocardiography (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG), noninvasive arterial blood pressure (BP), and end-tidal sevoflurane concentration were recorded. Measurements were performed 1) after patients arrived at the OR and were placed in the supine position, 2) a stable period after inhalation of 2% sevoflurane, and 3) following the appearance of an isoelectric EEG at a higher concentration of sevoflurane. At times 2) and 3), data were recorded during mechanical ventilation and during apnea. Main Results: There were decreases in both the low-frequency (LE; 0.04 to 0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (HF; 0.15 to 0.4 Hz) components of HR variability during anesthesia compared with the awake state. HF decreased during apnea at 2% sevoflurane, but LF did not change. Neither LF nor I-IF changed in response to the absence or presence of respiration during isoelectric EEG. Conclusions: Autonomic nerve activity was attenuated by sevoflurane. Parasympathetic input to the heart by respiration was markedly suppressed following the appearance of isoelectric EEG.

The variability of neuronal responses is assumed to take place only in the reconstructed time series of cortical sources and not in their positions. This hypothesis allows the use of the surrogate data method to detect recurrently active brain areas across trials adjusted with any cortically constrained focal MEEG inverse solution. Results obtained from synthetic data show that considering several trials enhances the accuracy of the source localisation. We apply this approach on MEG data recorded during a simple visual stimulation. The considered stimulus is frequency tagged in order to reveal the neural network correlated to its perception using phase synchronisation analysis. The results show consistent patterns of distributed synchronous networks centred on occipital areas. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

We propose that human cortical theta activity coordinates sensory information with a motor plan to guide wayfinding behavior to known goal locations. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed invasive recordings from epileptic patients while they performed a spatially immersive, virtual taxi driver task. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found theta oscillations during both exploratory search and goal-seeking behavior and, in particular, during virtual movement, when sensory information and motor planning were both in flux, compared with periods of self-initiated stillness. theta oscillations had different topographic and spectral characteristics during searching than during goal-seeking, suggesting that different cortical networks exhibit theta depending on which cognitive functions are driving behavior ( spatial learning during exploration vs orienting to a learned representation during goal-seeking). In contrast, oscillations in the beta band appeared to be related to simple motor planning, likely a variant of the Rolandic mu rhythm. These findings suggest that human cortical theta oscillations act to coordinate sensory and motor brain activity in various brain regions to facilitate exploratory learning and navigational planning.

The WPT provides a fast way of choosing the best out of a large number of time-frequency bases according to features of the signal to be analysed. From the wavelet packet coefficients, we calculated an information cost function (ICF), which evaluates the information associated with the energy distribution of the signal: the wavelet entropy. Results suggested that the entropy or degree of disorder in the energy distribution of control subjects' EEG was higher. Applying the ANOVA test, we verified that there was a significant difference (p-ANOVA<0.01) between EEG frames of both groups.

The present work complements the efforts described in Rosso et al. (Physica A 313 (2002) 587), devoted to non-extensive information measures A In Tsallis. Here we show that the notion of complexity, using (1) appropriate information-theory tools (adapted to a non-extensive scenario) and (2) scalp EEG data, provides one with valuable insights into the dynamics of neural activity. In particular, using different complexity measures we detect the presence of states characterized by both order and maximal complexity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

However, it has been argued that EEG synchrony is not the only necessary factor, but at least must be accompanied by a sufficient complexity of brain dynamics. Here, we propose that, besides complexity, EEG chaoticity may be another necessary condition for conscious brain functioning. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Gharieb, RR; Cichocki, A				Gharieb, RR; Cichocki, A			Segmentation and tracking of the electro-encephalogram signal using an adaptive recursive bandpass filter	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						electro-encephalogram analysis; non-stationarity; adaptive tracking of centre frequency of biomedical signals	NONSTATIONARY TIME-SERIES; EEG; MODELS	An adaptive filtering approach for the segmentation and tracking of electro-encephalogram (EEG) signal waves is described. In this approach, an adaptive recursive bandpass filter is employed for estimating and tracking the centre frequency associated with each EEG wave. The main advantage inherent in the approach is that the employed adaptive filter has only one unknown coefficient to be updated. This coefficient, having an absolute value less than 1, represents an efficient distinct feature for each EEG specific wave, and its time function reflects the non-stationarity behaviour of the EEG signal. Therefore the proposed approach is simple and accurate in comparison with existing multivariate adaptive approaches. The approach is examined using extensive computer simulations. It is applied to computer-generated EEG signals composed of different waves. The adaptive filter coefficient (i.e. the segmentation parameter) is -0.492 for the delta wave, -0.360 for the theta wave, -0.191 for the alpha wave, -0.027 for the sigma wave, 0.138 for the beta wave and 0.605 for the gamma wave. This implies that the segmentation parameter increases with the increase in the centre frequency of the EEG waves, which provides fast on-line information about the behaviour of the EEG signal. The approach is also applied to real-world EEG data for the detection of sleep spindles.

The 62-channel EEG, skin conductance response (SCR) and heart rate (HR) were simultaneously recorded while subjects viewed sequentially presented pictures and subjectively rated them after each presentation. In the theta band, both MA and HA vs. LA stimuli induced larger synchronization over the left anterior and bilaterally over posterior cortical leads. However, rather unexpectedly, both MA and HA vs. LA stimuli yielded larger alpha-1 synchronization, predominantly over occipital leads. In both theta and alpha-1 bands, affectively salient stimuli prompted larger ERS against the background of the overall dominance in power synchronization of posterior regions of the right hemisphere, irrespective of stimulus category. Finally, in the alpha-3 band, HA stimuli induce a lateralized time-dependent power increase over anterior leads of the left hemisphere. The hemispheric asymmetries revealed point to recruitment of not only posterior regions of the right hemisphere (theta and alpha-1 bands), but also of anterior regions of the left hemisphere (theta and alpha-3 bands) in affect analysis beyond valence dimension. In terms of affective chronometry, the significant arousal X time interactions clearly indicate that in the theta frequency band discrimination of affective stimuli has already started at 200 ms post-stimulus, whereas in the alpha-l and alpha-3 bands this process is delayed by up to 800-1200 ms.

For this reason, it is often more productive to reduce the data set by limiting the analysis to certain features or by selecting a subset of the data according to a certain criteria. One traditional method is to use frequency domain techniques to focus upon certain aspects of the data. However, when the frequency domain is used to analyze EEG data, the temporal domain features are lost. In this paper we examine an alternative method of data reduction and channel grouping using a statistical approach which retains time information.

The Hilbert transform will be used to estimate the instantaneous frequency, the instantaneous amplitude and the phase synchronization of scalp EEG recordings. As a fourth measure derived from the Hilbert transform we will define a measure of rhythmicity. The purpose of this paper is to combine the time evolution of these four measures to come to a characterization of the dynamics present in, and between, different EEG channels. By applying these measures to scalp EEG recordings of patients with Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy we will show that they are useful for off-line analysis of large amounts of EEG data. Because all these measures are derived from the fast Hilbert transform it is also possible to use them as an analysis tool for online monitoring.

In recent years, ultrafast activities between 100 and 1000/sec have been the topic of various studies with regard to physiological and paroxysmal conditions. Personal work on ultrafast frequencies in deep structures (elicited with pentylenetetrazol in rats) is mentioned in passing and will be the object of a special study. Other work focusing on the sensorimotor cortex and thalamocortical connections has proved to be seminal for ultrafast EEG research in conjunction with evoked responses (N20 response, SSEP) and experimental neurophysiological studies of afferent volleys, including those causing paroxysmal cortical responses. The well known decremental seizures with initially flat tracings require clarification with ultrafast recordings. In the physiological-neurocognitive domain, Pfurtscheller's event-related desynchronization might also benefit from the use of ultrafast recording. A plea for additional ultraslow recording (DC recording) is also being made, since paroxysmal flattening (electrodecrement) may be associated with an ultraslow negative baseline deflection. The combination of ultrafast (facilitated by digital technique) and ultraslow (technically difficult in patients, easier in experimental animals) would finally denote the frequency-wise complete EEG.

The performance of three techniques for seizure detection is investigated. The technique of Roessgen is model based and uses parameter estimation for detection. The two other methods are non-parametric. The technique of Gotman uses frequency analysis to determine the changes in the dominant peak of the frequency spectrum of short epochs of EEG data. The technique of Liu performs analysis in the time domain and is based on the auto-correlation function of short epochs of EEG data. This paper discusses the underlying methodology of the different techniques and presents a comparison of their performance on simulated EEG signal with the aim of considering the best for a possible implementation within a DSP system for automatic seizure detection. The obtained results show that Gotman's method outperforms the two other methods in terms of good detection, the missing detection, and the false alarm rates.

The presented wavelet-coherent technique provides the information regarding both the degree of coherence and the relation of phase difference. The wavelet coherence enables to provide the synchronization and the direction of information flow between two-channel signals. In addition, real EEG recordings are collected based on the cognitive targets during sentences identification and the wavelet coherence is employed for the analysis of the multi-channel EEG signals. It is observed from both the magnitude spectra and phase of the wavelet coherence that there are obvious differences between two kinds of cognitive activities. Finally, some results are illustrated with both simulation and real EEG time series to show the effectiveness of the method.

The analysis revealed an exponential characteristic in power spectral density (PSD) of the EEG, known to be peculiar to nonlinear phenomena. In addition, powers of such frequency components in EEG as alpha, beta, theta and delta were calculated quantitatively by integrating the PSD obtained from the segments of the EEG without any filtering procedures, and their temporal variations were investigated in detail. They were remarkably influenced by the stage of anesthesia. Further, the magnitude of the slope of exponentially decaying PSD increased as anesthesia became effective. The authors therefore proposed to take the magnitude as a new measure of estimating brain activities, and its usefulness was confirmed by the fact that the magnitudes for EEGs of children decrease as ages of subject increase.

We propose a novel method based on the time-frequency representation for quantifying synchronization between two channel EEG with both temporal and spectral resolution. The presented method employed the wavelet transform for cross coherent spectral analysis of the EEG signals recorded during sentences recognizing and learning. The wavelet-coherent magnitude spectra provide the information indicating the degree of coherence and the cross-wavelet phase relation serves to indicate the direction of information flow between two EEG channels on different cortical regions. Real EEG recordings are collected based on a cognitive target. It is observed from both the magnitude spectra and phase of the wavelet coherence that there are obvious differences between the identification of both Chinese and English sentences. These are helpful for the research on the English study for Chinese students.

Methodology and applications	REVISTA DE NEUROLOGIA			Spanish	Article						alpha; attention; electroencephalogram; event-related potentials; temporal spectral evolution; temporal dynamics of the frequency; spectral power	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EEG; DESYNCHRONIZATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; MOVEMENT; SLEEP	Introduction. The event-related potentials (ERPs) allow to study the evolution of the cerebral electric activity related with the diverse sensorial, motors and cognitive processes. However, the ERPs and the spectral analyses based in Fast Fourier Transform, are notable to show the variations along the time of the spectral content of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Objective. The present work will show the necessary methodology to obtain the temporal dynamics of the frequency (TSE) in the EEG, a technique described by Salmelin and Hari (1994) that allows the analysis of the modulations of any spectral band along the time. Patients and methods. The presented data correspond to the electroencephalographic registration of 20 human subjects during an experiment of visual spatial attention. Results. The modulations of the ERPs differ of the observed by the spectral techniques in latency and topography. Likewise, comparing different spectral techniques is proven that the TSE allows to define with more temporal precision the variations on the spectral content. Conclusion. The application of the TSE technique to the same EEG signal that is used for obtaining the ERPS, allows the inclusion of the variable time in the spectral analysis of the EEG, what can be crucial to understand the physiological bases of some neuropathologies.

Methods: In 1,6 children aged 9-11 years the reaction time, the number of mistakes and EEG (19 scalp electrodes) were measured in three experiments (verbal and nonverbal). The EEG data was baseline-corrected and after a fast fourier transformation, analyzed with the coherence tool of the Brainvision(C) Software. Results: The dyslexic group made more mistakes than the control group on all tasks but their reaction times were significantly longer only on the verbal tasks. There were no coherence differences on the nonverbal task. On the language-dependent tasks the dyslexics showed higher total-frontal and lower left-frontal coherences only in the theta-frequency range, while in the alpha and beta frequency ranges coherences did not differ. Conclusions: A language-dependent cognitive automatizational deficit in the dyslexic group is assumed that is depicted by the higher synchronization of total-frontal coherences (involvement of the central executive) and is based on the less established functional coupling of cortical subsystems for language processing.

Twenty-seven patients undergoing vascular surgery were studied under general anesthesia with sevoflurane, isoflurane, propofol, or desflurane. The EEG was recorded continuously during the procedure and patients' anesthesia states were assessed according to the responsiveness component of the observer's assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) score. An OAA/S score of zero or one was considered asleep and two or greater was considered awake. Complexity of the EEG was quantitatively estimated by the measure C(n), whose performance in discriminating awake and asleep states was analyzed by statistics for different anesthetic techniques and different patient populations. Compared with other measures, such as approximate entropy, spectral entropy, and median frequency, C(n) not only demonstrates better performance (93% accuracy) across all of the patients, but also is an easier algorithm to implement for real-time use. The study shows that C(n) is a very useful and promising EEG-derived parameter for characterizing the (DOA) under clinical situations.

Trace alternant was the most frequent EEG pattern during quiet sleep of these newborns and consists of burst and interburst periods. The calculation of coherence was performed by means of time-variant autoregressive models on the basis of Kalman filtering. Coherence changes simultaneously with the appearance of these burst and interburst periods. The highest level of coherence was observed during burst periods in comparison with interburst periods. The lowest level of coherence was observed just before the burst started. During burst, maximal coherence was reached at different moments - late in the low frequency band (0.5-1.5 Hz; about 3 s after the burst started) and earlier in higher frequency bands (> 2 Hz, about 2 s). Interhemispheric coherence depended on the region being investigated. A significant level of coherence could be observed over frontal, temporal and occipital regions. Our data demonstrate significant modification of interhemispheric coherence during quiet sleep of full-term newborns and, irrespective of the immaturity of the brain, these coherences differ significantly between cortical regions.

"Approximate entropy" is a new statistical parameter derived from the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy formula which quantifies the amount of regularity in data. The approximate entropy quantifies the predictability of subsequent amplitude values of the EEG based on the knowledge of the previous amplitude values. The authors investigated the dose-response relation of the EEG approximate entropy during desflurane anesthesia in comparison with spectral edge frequency 95, median frequency, and bispectral index. Methods: Twelve female patients were studied during gynecologic laparotomies. Between opening and closure of the peritoneum, end-tidal desflurane concentrations were varied between 0.5 and 1.6 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC). The EEG approximate entropy, median EEG frequency, spectral edge frequency 95, and bispectral index were determined and the performance of each to predict the desflurane effect compartment concentration, obtained by simultaneous pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling, was compared, Results: Electroencephalogram approximate entropy decreased continuously over the observed concentration range of desflurane. The performance of the approximate entropy (prediction probability P-K = 0.86 +/- 0.06) as an indicator for desflurane concentrations is similar to spectral edge frequency 95 (P-K = 0.86 +/- 0.06) and bispectral index (P-K = 0.82 +/- 0.06) and is statistically significantly better than median frequency (P-K = 0.78 +/- 0.06). Conclusions: The amount of regularity in the EEG increases with increasing desflurane concentrations. The approximate entropy could be a useful EEG measure of anesthetic drug effect.

Methods: It can be shown that a QPC exists between the frequency ranges 0-2.5 and 3-7.5 Hz and between the frequency ranges 0-2.5 and 8-12 Hz. By means of time-variant bicoherence analysis, a strong phase-locking between the modulating and the modulated component can be identified. The phase-locking is demonstrable within the first 250 ms after the burst onset and comes up to the maximum between 750 and 1250 ms. Results: The effect is maintained over the whole first part of the burst (2 s) with a decreasing tendency after 1250 ms. All these effects cannot be found in the EEG before: entering the burst suppression period (BSP). The transient coupling phenomena in the EEG bursts during BSP can be regarded as indicators for short-term interrelations between the underlying electrophysiologic processes. Conclusions: It can be suggested that the method introduced for the quantification of the sedation depth should be used. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although it is quite useful, of course, one has to acknowledge its subjective nature that hardly allows for a systematic protocol. In order to overcome this undesirable feature, a quantitative EEG analysis has been developed over the years that introduces objective measures. These reflect not only characteristics of the brain activity itself, but also clues concerning the underlying associated neural dynamics. The processing of information by the brain is reflected in dynamical changes of the electrical activity in (i) time, (ii) frequency, and (iii) space. Therefore, the concomitant studies require methods capable of describing the qualitative variation of the signal in both time and frequency. In the present work we introduce new information tools based on the wavelet transform for the assessment of EEG data. In particular, different complexity measures are utilized.

For the analysis of shorter, transient EEG events, it is possible to identify and quantify brain electric microstates as subsecond time epochs with stable field topography. These microstates may correspond to basic building blocks of human information processing. Microstate analysis yields a compact and comprehensive repertoire of short lasting classes of brain topographic maps, which may be considered to reflect global functional states. Each microstate class is described by topography, mean duration, frequency of occurrence and percentage analysis time occupied. This paper presents normative microstate data for resting EEG obtained from a database of 496 subjects between the age of 6 and 80 years. The extracted microstate variables showed a lawful, complex evolution with age. The pattern of changes with age is compatible with the existence of developmental stages as claimed by developmental psychologists. The results are discussed in the framework of state dependent information processing and suggest the existence of biologically predetermined top-down processes that bias brain electric activity to functional states appropriate for age-specific learning and behavior.

Do these responses reflect the activation of associative other than somatosensory systems? Anticipatory processes were probed by alpha oscillations (6-12 Hz) for the evaluation of thalamocortical channels and by negative event-related potentials for the evaluation of cortical excitability. Compared with the control condition, a progressive reduction of the alpha power was recognized over the primary somatosensory cortex from 2 s before the painful stimulation. In contrast, the anticipatory event-related potentials were negligible during the expectancy period. The results on the alpha power suggest that the expectancy of the painful stimulation specifically facilitated the somatosensory thalamocortical channel. Remarkably, the associative frontal-parietal areas were not involved, possibly due to the predictable and repetitive features of the painful stimulus. The present results also suggest that negative event-related potentials are modest preceding warned stimuli (even if painful) with a simple information content.

Intracranial studies showed that this show oscillation triggers and groups cortical network firing. In the present study, we examined whether the phases of the slow oscillation during sleep stage 4 are correlated with the magnitude of sigma (12-16 Hz) and gamma (>20 Hz) scalp activity. For this purpose, 10-min segments of uninterrupted stage 4 sleep EEG from 9 subjects were analyzed by applying wavelet techniques. We found that scalp recorded sigma, but not gamma, activity is modulated by the phases of the slow oscillation during deep sleep. Enhancement of sigma activity was observed to be triggered by the peak of the surface positive slow wave component, whereas reduction of sigma activity started around the peak of the negative component.

The effects of acute and chronic alcohol treatments on sleep in rats were determined. Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were acclimated to a temperature-controlled chamber, and electromyograms and electroencephalograms (EEGs) were obtained during 23-hr recording sessions. Time spent in rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) and non-REM sleep (NREMS), EEG slow-wave activity (SWA) during NREMS, a spectral analysis of the EEG by fast Fourier transform, and brain temperatures were determined. Results: Acute exposure to alcohol (2.3 and 3.0 g/kg) by gastric intubation at the beginning of dark onset produced an increase in NREMS and a suppression of SWA. Spectral analysis revealed that during the first 4 hr there was a small increase in very-low-frequency bands (0.5-2 Hz), with a suppression of higher-frequency bands. This was followed by a suppression of low-frequency bands. A dose of 3,0 g/kg at light onset caused an increase in NREMS and a suppression of SWA. Spectral analysis revealed a suppression of low-frequency bands throughout the first 12 hr of recording but no change on high-frequency bands with light-onset alcohol. Chronic treatment with alcohol (6% alcohol in a liquid diet with pair-fed isocaloric controls) for 3 weeks produced an increase in NREMS and a decrease in EEG power density in frequency bands above 2 Hz. Chronic alcohol also reduced the circadian variation of REMS, an effect that showed a rebound 1 week after the alcohol treatment was terminated. Two weeks after the alcohol treatment was stopped, NREMS and REMS values returned to baseline. Conclusions: These results demonstrate differences in the effect of acute alcohol on sleep depending on the time of administration and demonstrate that distinct alterations in sleep patterns are induced by chronic treatments in as little as 3 weeks.

Unusually, EEG responses to electrical nerve stimulation contain brief bursts of high-frequency (600 Hz) wavelets. Here we show, in awake monkeys, that a subset of primary somatosensory cortex single units consistently fires both bursts and single spikes phase-locked to EEG wavelets. Spike bursts were also evoked by tactile stimuli, proving that this is a natural response mode. EEG wavelets at 600 Hz may therefore permit non-invasive assessment of population spike timing in human cortex.

But the relationship between the indirect hemodynamic fMRI signal and the more direct EEG signal is uncertain. Event-related EEG responses can be analyzed in two different ways, reflecting two different kinds of brain activity: evoked, i.e. phase-locked to the stimulus, such as evoked potentials, or induced, i.e. non phase-locked to the stimulus such as event-related oscillations. In order to determine which kind of EEG activity was more closely related with fMRI, EEG and fMRI signals were acquired together, while subjects were presented with two kinds of rare events intermingled with frequent distractors. Target events had to be signaled by pressing a button and Novel events had to be ignored. Results: Both Targets and Novels triggered a P300, of larger amplitude in the Novel condition. On the opposite, the fMRI BOLD response was stronger in the Target condition. EEG event-related oscillations in the gamma band (32-38 Hz) reacted in a way similar to the BOLD response. Conclusions: The reasons for such opposite differential reactivity between oscillations/fMRI on the one hand, and evoked potentials on the other, are discussed in the paper. Those results provide further arguments for a closer relationship between fast oscillations and the BOLD signal, than between evoked potentials and the BOLD signal.

The main idea is based upon averaging energy distributions of single EEG trials in the time-frequency plane. As the estimator for the signal's energy density, matching pursuit is chosen, with stochastic Gabor dictionaries. Other possible estimates are presented on a simulated signal and discussed briefly. The consistency of the results with previous findings is evaluated on the data from a classical voluntary finger movement experiment.

Our main aim was to ascertain, in a reliable manner, whether evoked (stimulus-locked) and induced (triggered by, but not locked to, stimuli) responses are present in intracranial recordings. For this purpose, we introduce new methods adapted to detect the presence of gamma responses at this level of recording, intermediary between EEG-scalp and unicellular responses. The analysis relies on a trial-by-trial time-frequency analysis and on the use of surrogate data for statistical testing. We report that visual stimulation reliably elicits evoked and induced responses in human intracranial recordings. Induced intracranial gamma activity is significantly present in short oscillatory bursts (a few cycles) following visual stimulation. These responses are highly variable from trial to trial, beginning after 200 ms and lasting up to 500 ms. In contrast, intracranial-evoked gamma responses concentrate around 100 ms latencies corresponding to evoked responses observed on the scalp. We discuss our results in relation to scalp gamma response in a similar protocol [Tallon-Baudry et al. (1996) J. Neurosci., 16, 4240-4249] and draw some conclusions for bridging the gap between gamma oscillations observed on the scalp surface and their possible cortical sources.

Seven men lived in an environmental scheduling facility for 4 weeks and completed fourteen 42.85-h 'days', each consisting of an extended (28.57-h) wake episode and a 14.28-h sleep opportunity. The circadian rhythm of plasma melatonin desynchronized from the 42.85-h day. This allowed quantification of the separate contribution of circadian phase and elapsed time awake to variation in EEG power spectra (1-32 Hz). EEG activity during standardized behavioral conditions was markedly affected by both circadian phase and elapsed time awake in an EEG frequency- and derivation-specific manner. The nadir of the circadian rhythm in alpha (8-12 Hz) activity in both fronto-central and occipito-parietal derivations occurred during the biological night, close to the crest of the melatonin rhythm. The nadir of the circadian rhythm of theta (4.5-8 Hz) and beta (20-32 Hz) activity in the fronto-central derivation was located close to the onset of melatonin secretion, i.e. during the wake maintenance zone. As time awake progressed, delta frequency (1-4.5 Hz) and beta (20-32 Hz) activity rose monotonically in frontal derivations. The interaction between the circadian and wake-dependent increase in frontal delta was such that the intrusion of delta was minimal when sustained wakefulness coincided with the biological day, but pronounced during the biological night. Our data imply that the circadian pacemaker facilitates frontal EEG activation during the wake maintenance zone, by generating an arousal signal that prevents the intrusion of low-frequency EEG components, the propensity for which increases progressively during wakefulness.

These oscillations may be recorded by the EEG (electroencephalogram). The oscillatory interaction between neuronal ensembles may be at one single frequency or at different frequencies due to non-linear coupling. The investigation of momentary coherence and phase enables the examination of synchronized oscillatory network activity during fast-changing cognitive processes. On this basis information transfer from occipital areas towards frontal areas could be described during processing of visual presented words. Non-linear phase coupling between oscillations with different frequencies during memory processing was detected by means of cross-bicoherence.

The aim of this paper is to evaluate a method of artifact reduction applied in different sleep stages: awakeness, stage 2, delta and REM sleep. Artifacts, particularly certain types, may be more likely found in particular settings and stages of sleep. To overcome the limitation of regression methods in bidirectional contamination, a method based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA) using time structure is applied. Artifact identification is based on time, frequency and scalp topography aspects of the independent components. Influence of artifacts is evaluated by calculating some target spectral variables before and after their reduction, using significance probability maps. Results show that ICA is a useful technique for the evaluation of these variables with clinical interest in different sleep stages.

Methods: For this purpose, power spectra of 1 EEG channel (C4, referred to Al) were obtained by means of the fast Fourier transform and the power of the bands ranging 0.75-4.50 Hz (Delta), 4.75-7.75 (Theta), 8.00-12.25 (Alpha), 12.50-15.00 (Sigma), 15.25-24.75 (Beta), 25.00-34.75 (Gamma 1), and 35.00-44.75 (Gamma 2) was calculated for the whole period of analysis (7 h). in 10 healthy subjects. Additionally, two other time series were calculated: the ratio between Beta and Gamma2, and between Gamma1 and Gamma2 (Beta and Gamma ratios). For each subject, we extracted 3 epochs of 30 min corresponding to the 15 min preceding and the 15 min following the onset of the first 3 REM episodes. Data were then averaged in order to obtain group mean values and standard deviation. The same process was applied to the 30-min epochs around REM sleep end. Results: The course of the Delta band around REM sleep onset was found to be characterized by a first phase of slow decline lasting from the beginning of our window up to a few seconds before REM onset; this phase was followed by a sudden, short decrease centered around REM onset. lasting for approximately 1.5-2 min. At the end of this phase, the Delta band reached its lowest values and remained stable up to the end of the time window. The Sigma band showed a similar course with stable values before and after REM sleep onset. The Beta and Gamma ratios also showed a 3-phase course; the first phase, in this case, was characterized by stable low values, from the beginning of our window up to approximately 5 min before REM onset. The following second phase was characterized by an increase which reached its maximum shortly after REM sleep onset (approximately I min). In the last phase, both Beta and Gamma ratios showed stable high values, up to the end of our time window. At REM sleep end, the Delta band only showed a very small gradual increase, the Sigma band presented a more evident gradual increase. on the contrary, both Beta and Gamma ratios showed a small gradual decrease. Conclusions: The results of the present study show a different time synchronization of the changes in the Delta band and in Beta and Gamma ratios. at around REM sleep onset, and seem to suggest that the oscillations of these parameters might be modulated by mechanisms more complex than a simple reciprocity. All these considerations point to the fact that REM sleep can be considered as a complex phenomenon and the analysis of high-frequency EEG bands and of our Beta and Gamma ratios represent an additional important element to include in the study of this sleep stage.

This paper proposes a modern time-frequency method, which as an alternative for quantifying synchrony with both temporal and spectral resolution. The presented method employed the wavelet transform for cross coherent spectral analysis of the EEG signals recorded during sentences recognizing. The wavelet-coherent magnitude spectra serves to indicate the degree of coherence and the cross wavelet phase serves to indicate the direction of information flow between channels on different cortical regions. Real EEG recordings are collected based on a cognitive target. It is observed from both the magnitude spectra and phase of the waveletcoherence that there are obvious differences between the identification of Chinese and English sentences. These are helpful for the research on the English study for Chinese people.

Information on hypnotizability-related EEG characteristics is controversial and incomplete, particularly on intracerebral source localization and EEG dimensionality. 19-channel, eyes-closed resting EEGs from right-handed, healthy, 8 high- and 4 low-hynotizable subjects (age: 26.7 +/- 7.3 years) were analyzed. Hypnotizability was rated after the subjects' ability to attain a deep hypnotic stage (amnesia). FFT Dipole Approximation analysis in seven EEG frequency bands showed significant differences (p < 0.04) of source gravity center locations for theta (6.5-8 Hz, more posterior and more left for highs), beta-1 and beta-2 frequencies (12.5-18 and 18.5-21 Hz; both more posterior and more right for highs). Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) specified the cortical anteriorization of beta-1 and beta-2 in low hypnotizables. Power spectral analysis of Global Field Power time series (curves) showed no overall power differences in any band. Full-band Global Dimensional Complexity was higher in high-hypnotizable subjects (p < 0.02). Thus, before hypnosis, high and low hypnotizables were in different brain electric states, with more posterior brain activity gravity centers (excitatory right, routine or relaxation left) and higher dimensional complexity (higher arousal) in high than low hypnotizables.

In addition, their typical diurnal variations show very different time courses. Quantitative analysis of the waking electroencephalogram (EEG) has been proposed as an objective measure of alertness, but it is not clear how it compares with other measures. In this study, the waking EEG was measured in the daytime to determine the presence of diurnal variations in the activity of standard frequency bands and to compare these variations with the temporal patterns typical of sleep propensity and subjective alertness. Alertness was evaluated in four men and 12 women, aged 19-33 y. Assessments were conducted every 2 h, from 10.00 to 24.00, in the following order: a visual analogue scale of alertness, a waking EEG recording and a sleep latency test. The waking EEG was recorded with eyes open. For each recording session, 32-60 s of artefact-free signals were selected from the C3/A2 derivation, then subjected to amplitude spectral analysis. Four EEG frequency bands showed significant diurnal variations: delta, theta, sigma and beta1. None of these variations showed a significant correlation with the temporal patterns of sleep latencies or subjective alertness. At the individual level, however, theta band activity increased when subjective alertness decreased, suggesting that the theta band can be used to monitor variations in alertness in a given individual, even at the moderate levels of sleepiness experienced during the daytime.

Methods: Individual distributions were aligned with respect to the onset of stage 2 to provide an unequivocal hallmark of the beginning of sleep and to reduce the sources of variability in this transition. The relationship between EEG spectral powers and EOG changes was assessed by means of product-moment correlations and bootstrap analyses for individual time series, and by means of a multiple regression analysis for the entire sample. Results: Results on the individual distributions as well as on averaged data showed a tight relationship between SEMs and EEG changes, negative across the 1-14 Hz frequency range and positive across the 15-30 Hz one. Spectral power in the sigma EEG band, that corresponds to the frequency at the phasic sleep spindles, resulted as the best predictor of SEM variations, being negatively correlated to the EOG changes. With respect to the other EEG frequency bands, the split half of the distributions with respect to stage 2 onset indicated a positive correlation of delta power with the increase of SEM activity before sleep onset, and of beta power with the decrease of SEMs after sleep onset. Conclusions: These results seem to suggest that sleep spindles could trigger the reduction and the final disappearance of slow eye movements in the late part of the wake-sleep transition.

These oscillations are important, as they may play a causal role in the initiation of seizures. Methods. Subdural EEG recordings were obtained from children with focal cortical dysplasias and intractable seizures. Intra- and extracellular recordings were performed in rat hippocampal slices, with induction of population activity, as follows: (a) bath-applied tetramethylamine (an intracellular alkalinizing agent, that opens gap junctions); (b) bath-applied carbachol, a cholinergic agonist; and (c) focal pressure ejection of hypertonic K+ solution. Detailed network simulations were performed, the better to understand the cellular mechanisms underlying oscillations. A major feature of the simulations was inclusion of axon-axon gap junctions between principal neurons, as supported by recent experimental data. Results: Very fast oscillations were found in children before seizure onset, but also superimposed on bursts during the seizure, and on interictal bursts. In slice experiments, very fast oscillations had previously been seen on interictal-like bursts, we now show such oscillations before. between, and after epileptiform bursts. Very fast oscillations were also seen superimposed on gamma (30-70 Hz) oscillations induced by carbachol or hypertonic Ki, and in the latter case, very fast oscillations became continuous when chemical synapses were blocked. Simulations replicate these data, when axonal gap junctions are included. Conclusions: Electrical coupling between principal neurons, perhaps via axonal gap junctions, could underlie very fast population oscillations, in seizure-prone brain, but possibly also in normal brain. The anticonvulsant potential of gap-junction blockers such as carbenoxolone, now in clinical use for treatment of ulcer disease, should be considered.

The neural networks' output represents the degree of seizure-like activity for each of the 94 channels and four closest neighboring electrodes. A decrease in the standard-deviation of the neural network output at each seizure-like event was noted. Also, by spectrogram analysis, a large increase in the low-frequency components of the variation at the time of the seizure event in each sample was seen. This suggests that, at the onset of seizure-like activity: 1) the magnitude of the signal standard-deviation across the subdural space is small; 2) the time-dependent change of the standard-deviation is small; 3) the signal power is concentrated in a small range of low-frequency components. These results suggest the entrainment of epileptogenic neural components.

Sixty-five cirrhotic patients were assayed for hepatic function by the Child-Pugh score and for encephalopathy by psychometric testing and by digital EEG recording. The dominance index showed a significant correlation with the degree of hepatic failure and of vigilance. Moreover, a linear relationship was found between the dominance index and three psychometric tests. In conclusion, the dominance index proved to reflect hepatic encephalopathy and the Hurst exponent highlighted features of cerebral dysfunction that were not detectable by routine EEG examination.

J	Baker, MR; Baker, SN				Baker, MR; Baker, SN			The effect of diazepam on motor cortical oscillations and corticomuscular coherence studied in man	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							TASK-DEPENDENT MODULATION; ISOMETRIC CONTRACTION; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; REALISTIC NETWORK; FINGER MOVEMENTS; SYNCHRONIZATION; RHYTHMS; HUMANS; INHIBITION; GENERATION	EEG recordings from sensorimotor cortex show oscillations around 10 and 20 Hz. These modulate with task performance, and are strongest during periods of steady contraction. The 20 Hz oscillations are coherent with contralateral EMG. Computer modelling suggests that oscillations arising within the cortex may be especially dependent on inhibitory systems. The benzodiazepine diazepam enhances the size of GABA(A) IPSPs; its effects are reversed by the antagonist flumazenil. We tested the effect of these drugs on spectral measures of EEG and EMG, whilst eight healthy human subjects performed a precision grip task containing both holding and movement phases. Either an auxotonic or isometric load was used. EEG changes following electrical stimulation of the contralateral median nerve were also assessed. The EEG power showed similar changes in all task/stimulation protocols used. Power around 20 Hz doubled at the highest dose of diazepam used (5 mg), and returned to control levels following flumazenil. EEG power at 10 Hz was by contrast little altered. The peak frequency of EEG power in both bands was not changed by diazepam. Corticomuscular coherence at ca 20 Hz was reduced following diazepam injection, but the magnitude of this effect was small (mean coherence during steady holding in the auxotonic task was 0.062 in control recordings, 0.051 after 2.5 mg and 5 mg doses of diazepam). These results imply that 20 Hz oscillations in the sensorimotor cortex are at least partially produced by local cortical circuits reliant on GABA(A)-mediated intracortical inhibition, whereas 10 Hz rhythms arise by a different mechanism. Rhythms generated during different tasks, or following nerve stimulation, are likely to arise from similar mechanisms. By examining the formulae used to calculate coherence, we show that if cortical oscillations are simply transmitted to the periphery, corticomuscular coherence should increase in parallel with the ratio of EEG to EMG power. The relative constancy of coherence even when the amplitude of cortical oscillations is perturbed suggests that corticomuscular coherence itself may have a functional role in motor control.

They identify dependencies of the correlation integral and the correlation dimension on frequency and amplitude of the signal, which may result in a reinterpretation of the dynamic importance of these measures and may cast doubts on their predictive abilities for certain classes of seizures. The relevance, for clinical and research purposes, of the distinction between retrospective and prospective inference (prediction) is addressed briefly. The authors point to the need for further research, consisting of long time series, containing multiple seizures, and for the development of objective prediction criteria.

Local synchronizing mechanisms of any of the above-mentioned oscillations occur at the site of their genesis, thalamic or cortical. These mechanisms are assisted by the wide-range, synchronized occurrence of the cortical slow oscillation, which finally produces the coalesced picture of slow-wave sleep EEG. Multisite, simultaneous intracellular and field potential recordings in cat, as well as EEG recordings in human were performed in order to assess the slate of synchrony and the propagation of Various sleep rhythms in the corticothalamic network.

Animals Thirteen entire male horses and ponies referred to Division of Clinical Veterinary Science, Bristol (n = 9) and Department of Clinical Veterinary Medicine (n = 4) for castration. Materials and methods Following pre-anaesthetic medication with acepromazine, anaesthesia was induced with guaiphenesin and thiopental and maintained with halothane in oxygen. The EEG was recorded continuously using subcutaneous needle electrodes. Additional monitoring comprised ECG, arterial blood pressure, blood gas analysis, airway gases, and body temperature. All animals were castrated using a closed technique. The raw EEG was analysed after completion of each investigation and the EEG variables median frequency (F50), spectral edge frequency (SEF) 95% and total amplitude were derived from the spectra using standard techniques. The mean values of EEG variables recorded during a baseline time period (recorded before the start of surgery) and castration of each testicle were compared using analysis of variance for repeated measures. Results Total amplitude (Atot) decreased and F50 increased during castration of each testicle compared to the baseline time period [(89.0 +/- 7.8% testicle 1, 87.0 +/- 7.8% testicle 2) and (110.0 +/- 15.0% testicle 1, 109.0 +/- 15.0% testicle 2), respectively]. Changes in SEF 95% were not significant. Conclusions De-synchronization was identified in the EEG during the nociceptive stimulus of castration. The results suggest that an increase in F 50 may be a specific marker for nociception in the horse. Clinical relevance Studies investigating the efficacy of analgesic agents in horses are limited by difficulties in peri-operative pain assessment. This model, using EEG changes associated with nociceptive stimulation, can be used to investigate the anti-nociceptive efficacy of different anaesthetic agents in the horse.

NEUROPHYSIOLOGIE CLINIQUE-CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			French	Article						EEG; linear relation; non linear relation	EEG; SIGNALS	Two kinds of methods are available in order to assess the functional relationships between different cerebral structures from the analysis of EEG signals: linear and non-linear methods. In this paper, we describe didactically the methodological bases of signal processing. After recalling the significance of the fundamental parameters of a sine wave: frequency, amplitude and phase, we show, from a first example about an epileptic seizure propagation, how a linear variation between phase and frequency can be interpreted as a small time difference between two EEG channels. This linear method hypothesises that these two signals are respectively the input and the output of a linear system. Then, we point out the limits of this method and we introduce non-linear methods. Among the latter, a recent approach introduces a realistic model of EEG which try to relate signal measured quantities to relations between underlying structures which produce them.

J	Jeleazcov, C; Schwilden, H				Jeleazcov, C; Schwilden, H			Bispectral analysis does not differentiate between anaesthesia EEG and a linear random process	BIOMEDIZINISCHE TECHNIK			German	Article						EEG monitoring; BIS-index; bispectral analysis	STRANGE ATTRACTORS; TIME-SERIES; DYNAMICS	Bispectral analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) has been used to monitor depth of anaesthesia. In the majority of publications this has involved the use of the so called BIS-Index TM (Aspect Medical Systems, Inc.). The exact relationship of this index to such bispectral parameters as the bispectrum and bicoherence has not yet been reported. If the EEG is considered as a linear random process, bicoherence is trivial, i.e. it is independent of the EEG frequency. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of EEG epochs with non-trivial bicoherence during isoflurane/N20 anaesthesia. We reanalyzed 25.5 hours of digitalised EEG signal from 9 patients undergoing gynaecological surgery. The test developed by Hinich for Gaussian distribution and linearity was then applied. The test was validated using various synthetic surrogate data: Gaussian random data, the z-component of the Lorenz attractor, the phase randomized EEG and the phase randomized z-component of the Lorenz attractor. The percentage of epochs (8.192 s, 1024 data points) with non-trivial bicoherence was: Lorenz data 95.4%, phase randomized Lorenz data 9.4%, synthetic Gaussian data 14.8%, original EEG 9.1 %, phase randomized EEG 5.1 %. The original EEG data were not found to contain a higher percentage of epochs with non-trivial bicoherence than the phase randomized data and the synthetic Gaussian data. We conclude that bispectral analysis does not substantially add to the information obtained with other methods of quantitative EEG analysis.

However, propagation delays are obligatory. Delays vary with the lengths and conduction velocities of the axons carrying the information, causing phase dispersion. In order to determine how synchrony is achieved despite dispersion, we recorded EEG signals from multiple electrode arrays on five cortical areas in cats and rabbits, that had been trained to discriminate visual or auditory conditioned stimuli. Analysis by time-lagged correlation, multiple correlation and PCA, showed that maximal correlation was at zero lag and averaged 0.7, indicating that 50% of the power in the gamma range among the five areas was at zero lag irrespective of phase or frequency. There were no stimulus-related episodes of transiently increased phase locking among the areas, nor EEG "bursts" of transiently increased amplitude above the sustained level of synchrony. Three operations were identified to account for the sustained correlation. Cortices broadcast their outputs over divergent-convergent axonal pathways that performed spatial ensemble averaging; synaptic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons in cortex operated as band pass filters for gamma; and signal coarse-graining by pulse frequency modulation at trigger zones enhanced correlation. The conclusion is that these three operations enable continuous linkage of multiple cortical areas by activity in the gamma range, providing the basis for coordinated cortical output to other parts of the brain, despite varying axonal conduction delays, something like the back plane of a main frame computer.

Methods: Twelve normal, right-handed mates were used in a randomized, double-blind crossover design study. A 3 amplifier system incorporating noise-cancellation was used to collect one channel of EEG (O1-Cz configuration) for 30 min. Either 0.5, 100 Hz, or sham CES treatment was administered for 20 min of each session. Statistical analyses were applied to time- and frequency-domain EEG variables. Results: Relative to sham control, 0.5 and 100 Hz CES caused the alpha band mean frequency to shift downward. Additionally, 100 Hz CES also caused a decrease of the alpha band median frequency and beta band power fraction. Conclusions: Both 0.5 and 100 Hz CES provide frequency distribution shifts that suggest beneficial changes in mental state. However, compared to 0.5 Hz CES, 100 Hz CES effected a greater overall change. It is suggested that similar tests be performed on individuals with various behavioral and neurological disorders to determine if comparable EEG changes can be realized and correlated with beneficial effects of CES therapy.

We aimed at addressing to what extent cognitive function is affected by paroxysmal epileptiform activity with or without clinical seizures or by clinical features characteristic of the epilepsy syndrome. To this purpose, combined electroencephalographic (EEG) recording and cognitive testing (IQ and reaction times) were performed in 28 children. Frequent epileptiform EEG discharges significantly reduced reaction time, as did the occurrence of seizures during cognitive testing. Syndrome-related factors tended to affect cognitive functions as well: children with generalized epilepsy and high average seizure frequency obtained lower scores. Linear regression analysis showed that stable aspects of cognitive function, as reflected in intelligence level, are most closely related to the severity of the epilepsy syndrome (average seizure frequency), whereas transient aspects of cognitive function, such as reaction times, are related to the occurrence of epileptiform EEG discharges. This suggests that seizures have a direct effect on transient cognitive aspects, which can accumulate and result in effects on intelligence level.

The changes in EEG oscillations were measured in predefined frequency bands (8-10, 10-12, 12-20, and 20-30 Hz) by using the event-related desynchronization technique. Movements of the affected and unaffected hand in patients with writer's cramp showed significantly less reduction in 20- to 30-Hz power compared with controls. The differences in movement-related EEG power decline were apparent over the contralateral central and midline regions before and after electromyographic onset. Because EEG beta rhythm in the sensorimotor region likely emanates from the motor cortex and is related to ongoing muscle activity, this abnormality could be a manifestation of the abnormal motor command at the cortical level.

We compared the effects of task (target vs, nontarget) and electrode (Fz, Ct, Pz) on P300 and ERD, and correlated P300 amplitude/latency with ERD maximal amplitude/latency across individuals. The major findings were that P300 as well as slow and fast alpha ERD manifested similar task and electrode effects. P300 preceded ERD and predicted individual variance of both slow and fast alpha ERD. The relationships of P300 with alpha ERD were different for the slow and fast alpha frequencies. These findings indicate that P300 and ERD are related such that slow and fast alpha ERDs are specifically guided or modified by the internal event(s) indexed by P300.

Ten patients admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit with MRI-identified lesions and intractable partial epilepsy were studied using 31-electrode scalp EEG. The scalp electrodes were located in three-dimensional space using a magnetic digitizer and coregistered with the patient's MRI. PEFSA was used to obtain a phase-encoded scalp may for the ictal frequencies. The ictal generators were obtained from the scalp map using LORETA. In addition, the generators of interictal epileptogenic spikes were identified using time-domain LORETA. The LORETA generators were rostral to the MRI lesion in 87% (7/8) of patients with temporal lobe lesions, but all were located in the mesial temporal lobe in concordance with the patients' MRI lesions. In patients with frontal lobe epilepsy, the ictal generators at the time that the spectral power was maximal localized to the MRI lesions. Eight of 10 patients had interictal spikes, of which 4 were bilateral independent temporal lobe spikes. Only generators of the interictal spikes that were ipsilateral to seizure onset correlated with the ictal generators. LORETA combined with PEFSA of the ictal discharge can localize ictal EEG discharges accurately and improve correlation with brain anatomy by allowing coregistration of the ictal generator with the MRI. Analysis of interictal spikes was less useful than analysis of the ictal discharge.

Wavelet tools in combination with Fourier analysis can detect and characterize hitherto unknown discrete, slow potentials underlying the conspicuous oscillations. Ethanol was one of the odorants that we have extensively studied (J. Neurosci. Methods, 119 (2002) 89). To detect new features and to elucidate their functions, we tested the wavelet tools on the ethanol-evoked LFP responses of the slug (Limax) procerebrum. Recordings were made in vitro from the neuropile and the cell layer. The present study led to the following findings: (i) Mutual exclusion. Energy concentrated mainly in two ranges, (a) 0.1-0.4 Hz and (b) 1.56-12.5 Hz, and the sum of energy remained constant throughout experiments regardless of the condition. A redistribution of relative energy within this sum seemed to occur in the course of main, possible interactions between the two components excluding each other ('mutual exclusion'). (ii) Transient signal ordering and disordering. Ethanol stimulation alternatingly evoked periods of strongly time evolving oscillation dominated by the energy of 1.56-12.5 Hz (increase of entropy = disordered or complexly ordered state) and those of near-silence were predominated by the energy of 0.1-0.4 Hz (decrease of entropy = ordered state). (iii) About 0.1 Hz slow wave oscillation. It was robust. The dominant energy oscillation and the resulting large entropy fluctuation were negatively correlated to each other, and revealed strong frequency-tuning or synchronization at this frequency. Our findings suggest that discrete slow waves play functionally important roles in the invertebrate brain, as widely known in vertebrate EEG. Wavelet tools allow an easy interpretation of several minutes of frequency variations in a single display and give precise information on stimulus-evoked complex change of the neural system describing the new state 'more ordered' or 'non-ordered or more complexly ordered'.

Preliminary surface Laplacian transformation of EEG data (31 channels) reduced head volume conductor effects. EEG phase values were computed by FFT analysis and the statistical evaluation of these values was performed by Rayleigh test (P < 0.05). About 50% of the EEG single trials presented statistically the same FFT phase value of the evoked EEG oscillations (phase-locked single trials), indicating a preponderant phase-locked compared to nonphase-locked component. The remaining single trials showed random FFT phase values (nonphase-locked single trials), indicating a preponderant nonphase-locked compared to phase-locked component. Compared to nonpainful stimulation, painful stimulation increased phase-locked theta to gamma band responses in the contralateral hemisphere and decreased the phase-locked beta band response in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Furthermore, nonphase-locked alpha band response decreased in the ipsilateral Pronto-central area. In conclusion, both decreased and increased EEG oscillatory responses to galvanic painful stimulation would occur in parallel in different cortical regions and in the phase- and nonphase-locked EEG data sets. This enriches the actual debate on the mapping of event-related oscillatory activity of human brain. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The purpose of this study was to determine the main EEG frequency ranges that represent ischemic changes during short periods of circulatory arrest. The EEG was recorded with a 16-channel common reference montage (Cz). After onset of circulatory arrest, the log spectral changes of three-epoch moving averages were calculated relative to the baseline spectrum. For factor analysis, 17 EEG periods were selected that showed changes progressing to an isoelectrical period. Topographic differences and the time course of quantitative EEG (qEEG) changes were studied in all 56 patients. For each patient the EEG period with the longest duration of circulatory arrest was chosen. Factor analysis revealed four factors that represented the spectral EEG changes occurring during circulatory arrest and recovery. The frequency intervals of these factors were 0 to 0.5 Hz. 1.5 to 3 Hz, 7.5 to 9.5 Hz, and 15 to 20 Hz for all channels. Only minor topographic differences were found in the power of the spectral changes: the sequence of events was similar for all electrode positions. The first EEG change after circulatory arrest was an initial increase in alpha power and a decrease in beta power. On average. after approximately 15 seconds alpha power started to decrease, beta power decreased further, delta -1 power started to increase, and delta -2 power started to decrease. After approximately 25 seconds, the delta -1 power increase appeared to plateau or to decrease. A circulatory arrest longer than approximately 30 seconds resulted in an isoelectrical EEG. After restoration of the circulation, there was a fast transient increase in delta -1 and delta -2 power, followed by a decrease to baseline. alpha and beta power showed a more gradual increase in power toward baseline and were the last to restore after 60 to 90 seconds. In general, the spectral changes in the alpha and beta frequency ranges were most pronounced and consistent. In conclusion, to detect intraoperative cerebral ischemia, monitoring of changes in the four frequency ranges found is preferable to monitoring changes in the classically defined frequency bands. Furthermore, these results stress the importance of the alpha and beta ranges in detecting cerebral ischemia.

This methodology has been proposed as a useful clinical tool both for the diagnosis of sleep breathing disorders and for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) titration. However, previous studies suggest that the application of high-frequency pressure oscillation to the upper airway may induce changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) or upper airway muscle function. The effect of FOT measurements on upper airway muscle tone and EEG in clinical sleep studies was examined. Seven patients with moderate SAHS were included (age: 54 +/- 11 yrs; apnoea/hypopnoea index: 43 +/- 21 events(.)h(-1); body mass index: 30 +/- 2 kg(.)m(-2)). Genioglossus surface electromyogram activity (EMGgg) and EEG signal were analysed with and without FOT application (frequency: 5 Hz and 30 Hz; peak-to-peak pressure oscillation: 1 cmH(2)O) during stable sleep. Measurements were carried out in two different situations. Step 1: applying FOT during episodes of obstructive events or flow limitation; and step 2: during prolonged periods of normal breathing at optimal CPAP. The root mean square of EMGgg activity and fast Fourier analysis (alpha and delta bands) of the EEG signal were performed. The application of FOT did not increase EMGgg activity in any of the situations studied. In addition, no evidence of the effects on EEG was found: alpha/delta relationship: awake:0.70, baseline sleep:0.13, FOT(5 Hz):0.18, FOT(30 Hz):0.11. The presented results suggest that the use of forced oscillation technique over the ranges of frequency and amplitude proposed for clinical sleep studies does not induce changes in upper airway muscle activity and neurological variables in patients with sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome.

Previous investigators have hypothesized that the chronic pain and chemical intolerance reflect sensitization of different central nervous system limbic and/or mesolimbic reward pathways. We evaluated electroencephalographic (EEG) beta activity and blood glucose responses of FM patients with and without CI and normals during three repeated sucrose ingestion sessions and during a final, water-only session (testing for conditioning). The FM with CI exhibited oscillation (reversal in direction of change from session to session) at rest and then sensitization (progressive amplification) of EEG beta I over time across the 3 sucrose sessions versus controls. FM with Cl showed sensitization of blood glucose over the 3 sucrose sessions, which, like the EEG findings, reverted toward baseline in the final water-only session. The data suggest that the subset of FM patients with Cl have increased susceptibility to oscillation and physiological sensitization without conditioning, perhaps contributing to fluctuations in their chronic course.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of inpatient versus daytime outpatient telemetry. The authors evaluated prospectively 73 patients with medically intractable TLE. Ninety-one telemetry sessions were performed: 35 as inpatients and 56 as outpatients. Outpatient monitoring was performed in the EEG laboratory. They used 18-channel digital EEG. Medications were not changed in the outpatient group. For analysis of the data, time was counted in periods (12 hours = I period). Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t-test and the chi(2) test. There were no differences between the two groups (outpatient versus inpatient) with respect to age and mean seizure frequency before monitoring, mean time to record the first seizure (1.1 versus 1.4 periods), mean number of seizures per period (0.6 for both groups), lateralization by interictal spiking (46% versus 57%), and lateralization by ictal EEG (59% versus 77%). Daytime outpatient video-EEG monitoring for presurgical evaluation is efficient and comparable with inpatient monitoring Therefore, the improved cost benefit of outpatient monitoring may increase the access to surgery for individuals with intractable TLE.

Methods: Heart rate and sleep electroencephalogram signals were recorded in 8 healthy young men. Spectral analysis was applied to electrocardiogram and electroencephalogram recordings. Spectral components of RR intervals were studied across sleep stages. The cross-spectrum maximum was determined as well as coherencies, gains and phase shifts between normalized high frequency of RR intervals and all electroencephalographic frequency bands, calculated over the first 3 NREM-REM cycles. Results: RR intervals increased from awake to NREM and decreased during REM. Normalized low frequency decreased from awake to NREM and increased during REM while normalized high frequency evolved conversely. Low to high frequency ratio developed in opposition to RR intervals. Coherencies between normalized high frequency and power spectra were high for all bands. The gain was highest for delta band. Phase shift between normalized high frequency and delta differed from zero and modifications in normalized high frequency preceded changes in delta by 41 +/- 14degrees. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that: (1) all electroencephalographic power bands are linked to normalized high frequency; (2) modifications in cardiac vagal activity show predominantly parallel changes and precede changes in delta band by a phase shift corresponding to a lead of 12 +/- 5 min.

The cross-sectional surface areas of corpus callosum (CC) and of seven callosal regions were measured from the mid-sagittal slice of the anatomical MRI. Movement-related coherence between pairs of EEG electrodes overlying the central and parietal regions of both hemispheres was computed after spatially filtering EEG data by the Laplacian operator method. The spatial EEG synchronization was evaluated using Omega-complexity, a novel measure which quantifies the number of independent sources of spontaneous EEG oscillations. The amplitude of coherence between the left and right S1/M1 areas after movement onset in the lower alpha band (7.8-9.8 Hz) correlated with the size of the callosal body in both types of movement. The size of the callosal body also correlated with the C3-Cz coherence in the 15.6-19.5 Hz band in finger movement, and in the 15.6-23.5 Hz band in shoulder movements. The size of the rostral, anterior intermediate and posterior intermediate truncus of CC correlated with Omega-complexity in both types of movements indicating more foci of synchronized EEG oscillations in subjects with a large callosal truncus. The results suggest that the size of callosal truncus which is known to connect the primary sensorimotor and the supplementary motor areas of both hemispheres contributes to the coupling of EEG oscillations during voluntary finger and shoulder movements.

This approach is based on a hierarchically defined highly abstract neuron model consisting of finite-state machines. It provides computational efficiency while. incorporating components which have identifiable counterparts in the neurophysiological domain. The network model incorporates four neuron types, and glutamatergic excitatory and GABA(A) and GABA(B) inhibitory synapses. The spatio-temporal patterns, of cortical activity and the temporal and spectral characteristics of simulated electroencephalograms (EEGs) are studied. In line with previous experimental and compartmental work, 1) shock stimuli elicit EEG profiles with either isolated. peaks or damped oscillations, the response type being. determined by the intensity of the stimuli, and 2) temporally unpatterned input generates EEG oscillations supported by model-wide waves of excitation.

Estimates of correlation dimensions of control EEG, interictal EEG and ictal EEG were calculated. The values were demonstrated on topograms. The delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (30-40 Hz) components were obtained and considered as signals from the cortex. Corresponding surrogate data was produced. Firstly, the influence of sampling parameters on the calculation was tested. The dimension estimates of the signals from the frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital regions were computed and compared with the results of surrogate data. In the control subjects. the estimates between the EEG and surrogate data did not differ (P > 0.05). The interictal EEG from the frontal region and occipital region, as well as its theta component from the frontal region, and temporal region, showed obviously low dimensions (P < 0.01). The ictal EEG exhibited significantly low-dimension estimates across the scalp. All filtered rhythms from the temporal region yielded lower results than those of the surrogate data (P < 0.01). The dimension estimates of the EEG and filtered components markedly changed when the neurological state varied. For each neurological state, the dimension estimates were not uniform among the EEG and frequency components. The signal with a different frequency range and in a different neurological state showed a different dimension estimate. Furthermore, the theta and alpha components demonstrated the same estimates not only within each neurological state, but also among the different states. These results indicate that the theta and alpha components may be caused by similar dynamic processes. We conclude that the brain function underlying the ictal EEG has a simple mechanism. Several heterogeneous dynamic systems play important roles in the generation of EEG.

Material and methods: Adolescents or adults with primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (n = 11, 8 females, 3 males; mean age 23.0 +/- 9.8, range 15-49 years) and normal subjects (n = 10, 7 females, 3 males; mean age 23.2 +/- 5.4, range 14-32 years) were admitted to the sleep laboratory of the University Hospital of Aarhus, Denmark, for the investigation of sleep over four consecutive nights. A fixed day-to-night cycle was maintained. Night-time was defined as 23.00-07.00 h. The Ist and 3rd nights were completed without intervention. Sleep was modulated on the 2nd night by a waterload to induce nocturnal micturition. On the 4th night all subjects received DDAVP spray applied intranasally at bedtime. Sleep was evaluated by manual polysomnography according to the rules of Rechtschaffen and Kales and by computerized EEG power analysis on the Ist, 3rd and 4th nights. EEG power was calculated as total power and as power assigned to specific EEG frequency bands. Results: Enuretics showed a significant increase in the EEG delta power component during baseline sleep compared with controls, whereas no difference was encountered using a manual sleep score. During recovery sleep on the 3rd night EEG power in the enuretic group was increased in all EEG frequency bands apart from the alpha and sigma bands and associated with a shortened total sleep period. DDAVP was not found to influence sleep to any significant extent. Conclusions: EEG power analysis indicates an increased depth of sleep in enuretics inadequately reflected by a conventional polysomnographic technique. No sleep-modulating effect of DDAVP was detected.

J	van Putten, MJAM				van Putten, MJAM			Nearest neighbor phase synchronization as a measure to detect seizure activity from scalp EEG recordings	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; phase synchronization; seizure detection; monitoring; visualization; ROC curve	COHERENCY	The author presents results from the application of a particular measure for synchronization between brain areas (i.e., phase synchronization) in its behavior to detect epileptic seizure activity from scalp EEG recordings. The primary motivation for the current study was to contribute to the development of physiologic measures that both transform the EEG to a visual domain that allows a more intuitive interpretation of the interictal and ictal EEG and allows automated analysis, both relevant for real-time monitoring. EEGs from 16 patients experiencing temporal lobe and generalized seizures were analyzed. Nearest neighbor phase synchronization (NNPS) values for several frequency bands were determined. Additional analysis of the NNPS in the delta band, using different thresholds, allows construction of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves for each EEG analyzed. The common value for the sensitivity and the specificity, Q*, was used as a measure for the test accuracy, with values of Q* near 1.0, indicating ROC curves with sensitivity and specificity both approaching 1.0. It was found that Q*=0.48 to 0.87, depending on the EEG analyzed, indicating that the proposed method allows seizure detection in a significant portion of the EEGs studied. Nearest neighbor phase synchronization was typically increased during seizure activity and seems to be a promising method to detect seizure activity from scalp EEG recordings. The proposed visualization allows an intuitive interpretation of the EEG and may assist in real-time monitoring.

As the changes of the physiological states and the relative environment exist when cognitive and information processing take place in different brain regions at different time, the practical EEGs therefore turn out to be extremely non-stationary processes. To investigate how these distributed brain regions are linked together and the information is exchanged with time, this paper proposes a modern time-frequency coherent analysis method that employs an alternative way for quantifying synchronization with both temporal and spacial resolution. Wavelet coherent spectrum is defined such that the degree of synchronization and information flow between different brain regions can be described. Several real EEG data are analysed under the cognitive tasks of sentences identification in both English and Chinese. The time-varying synchronization between the brain regions involved in the processing of sentences exhibited that a common neural network is activated by both English and Chinese sentences. The results of the presented method are helpful for studying the English and Chinese learning for the Chinese students.				mfshen@stu.edu.cn							9	2	2	0	1	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1948-3546		0-7803-7579-3	I IEEE EMBS C NEUR E			2003							87	90						4	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Biomedical; Neurosciences	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Computer Science; Engineering; Neurosciences & Neurology	BW55S					2022-08-02	WOS:000182404500025

The coefficient of variation (CoV), i.e. the standard deviation/mean, within 10 second epochs was found to be quite constant throughout the whole of the EEG recordings and was typically about 0.46. This was found to be the case for both the patients and the volunteers. Histograms of the magnitudes indicated that the magnitudes are distributed as f(x) = betaxe(-alphax2) functions. However a CoV of 0.46 is consistent with f(x) = betaxe(-alphax3) functions. The non-stationary nature of the EEG is such that it is likely that while over short periods the EEG magnitudes are distributed as f(x) = betaxe(-alphax3) functions, variations of a over time mean that in the long term the EEG magnitudes are distributed as f(x) = betaxe(-alphax2) functions.

In this study, we evaluated 1) the extent to which high frequency EEG activity is limited to the 14-32 Hz domain, 2) whether high frequency EEG activity (HFA) is associated with discrepancies between subjective and PSG measures of sleep continuity, and 3) the extent to which high frequency EEG activity occurs in patients with primary, as opposed to secondary, insomnia. Design: Three groups (n=9 per group) were compared: Primary Insomnia, Insomnia secondary to Major Depression, and Good Sleeper Controls. Groups were matched for age, sex and body mass. Average spectral profiles were created for each NREM cycle after removing waking and movement epochs and epochs containing micro- or mini-arousals. Setting: Sleep Research Laboratory Patients or Participants: Patients with primary and secondary insomnia Interventions: N/A Measurements and Results: Subjects with Primary insomnia exhibited more average NREM activity for Beta-1 (14-20Hz), Beta-2 (20-35Hz) and Gamma activity (35-45Hz) than the other two groups (p.<.01). Group differences were also suggestive for Omega activity (45.0-125Hz) (p.<.10), with MDD subjects tending to exhibit more activity than the other groups. Correlational analyses revealed that average NREM Beta-1 and Beta-2 activity tended to be negatively correlated with subjective-objective discrepancy measures for total sleep time and sleep latency. Conclusions: Our results confirm that Beta activity is increased in Primary Insomnia. In addition, our data suggest that high frequency activity in patients with Primary Insomnia is limited to the Beta/Gamma range (14-45 Hz), and is negatively associated with the perception of sleep.

Methods: For this purpose, power spectra were calculated with a fast Fourier transform and the power of the bands ranging 0.75-4.50 Hz (Delta), 4.75-7.75 (Theta), 8.00-12.25 (Alpha), 12.50-15.00 (Sigma), 15.25-24.75 (Beta), 25.00-34.75 (Gamma1), and 35.00-44.75 (Gamma 2) was calculated for-the whole period of analysis (7 h). Also two additional time series: the ratio between Beta and Gamma2, and between Gamma1 and Gamma2 were calculated (Beta and Gamma ratios). Results: Beta and Gamma1 showed small changes with a tendency to increase during REM sleep; Gamma2, on the contrary, showed small changes with a tendency to decrease during REM sleep. Beta and Gamma ratio peaks were clearly correlated with the occurrence of REM sleep. The small changes shown by Beta, Gamma1 and Gamma2 were not statistically significant; on the contrary, Beta ratio and Gamma ratio showed the most important statistical significance values being highest during REM sleep and lowest during slow-wave sleep. Finally, the calculation of the linear correlation coefficient and of the cross-correlation between the different bands showed a clear reciprocity between Delta and Beta and Gamma ratios. Conclusions: Our study shows a new method for the analysis of high frequencies (up to 45 Nz) in the scalp-recorded sleep EEG which allowed us to better define, as compared to previous studies on the same topic, the changes in power characteristically associated with REM sleep and correlated with the REM/non-REM ultradian rhythm, and to propose it as a tool for future studies.

The MI between four lead electrodes was first computed using the EEG time series. The Lempel-Ziv complexity measures, C(n)s, were extracted from the MI time series. Prediction was made by means of artificial neural network (ANN). From 98 consenting patient experiments, 98 distinct EEG recordings were collected prior to incision during isoflurane anaesthesia of different levels. During and after skin incision, each patient was observed carefully for 2 min to detect subsequent responses (purposeful movement, changes in hemodynamic parameters and respiratory pattern) and then the EEG was labelled as 0.0 for responder or as 1.0 for non-responder. Training and testing the ANN used the 'drop-one-patient' method. The prediction was tested by monitoring the response to incision and the result given by the ANN. The system was able to correctly classify purposeful response in average accuracy of 91.84% of the cases. The results showed that the method has a better performance than other methods, such as spectral edge frequency, median frequency, and bispectral analysis. This method is computationally fast and acceptable real-time clinical performance was obtained. (C) 2003 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Our goal was to understand the benefits and limits of these methods when applied to sleep in human infants, Design: Arousals were identified by evaluating rapid changes in EEG low frequency activity, blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR). A cortical arousal was defined as a rapid decrease in EEG low frequency activity. An autonomic arousal was defined by a transient increase in heart rate or a transient change in mean arterial BP (MAP). Setting: Laboratory study in sleeping and awake piglets. Participants: Five 1-2 week old piglets. interventions: Chronically instrumented with a femoral arterial line, EEG, EGG, EMG electrodes, and a micro-dialysis probe with its tip located in the rostral ventral medulla. Artificial CSF (aCSF) was dialyzed into the RVM throughout the experiments Measurements: For the visual analysis, the average delta power (0.5-4 Hz) for each 5-second epoch was determined using spectral analysis. MAP and HR were analyzed in 1-second bins. Video images were analyzed for body movements and eye openings, Transient changes in blood pressure, HR, and delta power were then visually identified. For the wavelet analysis, a quantitative, automated technique with a defined "wakefulness threshold" was used to identify rapid decreases in EEG low frequency activity and the rate of change of MAP, Results: Using the visual method, 117 episodes associated with stereotypical hemodynamic, EEG, and behavioral changes (startle) were identified. Seventy five events occurred in isolation or were first in a series of "multiple" events, 41 "multiple" events were defined as events occurring < 20 seconds following a previous event. Eighteen events were associated with the termination of apnea. In isolated events or those occurring first in a series, the onset of changes in HR and BP clearly preceded the decrease in EEG amplitude and delta power. Using wavelet analysis, 73 EEG arousals and 115 MAP transients were identified independently; 62% of the EEG events were associated with a transient change in MAP and HR, and in these cases the onset of the hemodynamic events preceded EEG arousals. EEG arousals and MAP transients, however, also occurred alone and not associated with a stereotypical pattern of a startle, changes in MAP and HR and the EEG. Conclusions: Many of these spontaneous arousals represent integrated EEG, hemodynamic, and behavioral processes similar to arousal phenomena described in adult rats and human infants, but the pattern of spontaneous arousals appears to be more heterogeneous than has been described for arousals induced by exogenous stimuli. Both the visual and wavelet analysis identified these events, but the wavelet technique has the potential advantage of better time resolution and automation of the analysis.

To determine whether these periodic oscillations are associated with similar periodicities in cortical activity, transcortical electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded in conjunction with single- or dual-unit neuronal activity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or the globus pallidus (GP), and the data were analyzed with spectral and wavelet analyses. Multisecond oscillations in firing rates of 31% of the STN neurons and 46% of the GP neurons with periodicities significantly correlated with bursts of theta (4-7 Hz) activity in transcortical EEG. Further recordings of localized field potentials in the hippocampus and frontal or parietal cortices simultaneously with GP unit activity showed field potentials from the hippocampus, but not from the frontal or parietal cortices, exhibited bursts of theta rhythm that were correlated with GP firing rate oscillations. These results demonstrate a functional connectivity between basal ganglia neuronal activity and theta band activity in the hippocampus.

The instantaneous Heart Rate Variability (HRV) provided a measure of ANS activity, and EEG was quantified by time-frequency analysis measuring power in alpha and delta frequency bands. The results revealed a power decrease in the VLF component of the inter-beat (RR) interval to a minimal level around SO, similar changes, though to a lesser degree in the LF component, and almost no change in the HF component. These changes correlated with a drop in alpha and a surge in delta EEG power. The sympathovagal balance, as reflected by LF/HF ratio pointed towards an increase in the parasympathetic activity after SO.

The model comprises two parts and is partly derived from the Roessgen et al. seizure model. The first part consists of a nonlinear Wiener model of the pure background activity, and the second part in a nonlinear Wiener model of the pure seizure activity with a time-varying deterministic input signal. The two parts are then combined in a parallel structure. The Wiener model consists of an autoregressive moving average filter followed by a nonlinear shaping function to take into account the non-Gaussian statistical behavior of the data. Model estimation was performed on 64 infants of whom four showed signs of clinical and electrical seizures. Model validation is performed using time-frequency-based entropy distance and shows an averaged improvement of 50% in modeling performance compared with the Roessgen model.

A common feature of beta oscillations (13-28 Hz) is the critical involvement of networks of inhibitory interneurons as pacemakers, gated by gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) action. Advances in molecular and statistical genetics permit examination of quantitative traits such as the beta frequency of the human electroencephalogram in conjunction with DNA markers. We report a significant linkage and linkage disequilibrium between beta frequency and a set of GABAA receptor genes. Uncovering the genes influencing brain oscillations provides a better understanding of the neural function involved in information processing.

Our previous results have shown that enhanced alpha responses to auditory task stimuli can be well synchronized with stimulus until 800-1000 ms. The present study analyzed the effect of perceptual uncertainty and difficulty in decision making on event-related alpha oscillations in single auditory event-related brain potentials (ERPs). EEG was recorded from Fz, Ct and Pt electrodes in 10 subjects participating in two experimental sessions, in which auditory stimuli with equal physical parameters were presented under passive and task instructions. Separate measurements of single alpha response amplitude and phase-locking were performed and statistically analyzed for consecutive time windows in the post-stimulus epoch. Major results show that, during the cognitive task, the phase-locking of alpha oscillations at the frontal site is significantly increased in the time window of 500-1000 ms after stimulation. Thus, the involvement of enhanced and synchronized frontal alpha activity in higher brain processes is strongly emphasized. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Int Neural Network Soc, IEEE, Neural Networks Council			OLFACTORY EEG; SPATIAL PATTERNS; BEHAVIOR	The statistical properties of saccadic time intervals recorded in eye movements in human subjects were calculated. The probability density function of the inter-spike intervals exhibits a Poisson-type behavior with a maximum located at time lags around 600 ms. Such a value agrees well with the frequency of the theta rhythm observed in the visual cortex of mammals, in particular, rabbits. EEGs were recorded from 8x8 arrays of subdural electrodes at high density (6x6 mm) in rabbits trained to discriminate visual stimuli in a classical aversive paradigm. EEG patterns had the form of amplitude and phase modulation of this The covariance between the spatial events revealed striking peaks in the theta range (2-7 Hz), even when the autospectrum of the EEG failed to show a prominent peak. Comparable sequences of spatial EEG patterns in the olfactory system occur at frequencies in the theta range, reflecting the driving by respiration. These multiple sets of observation suggest that the visual system may be driven by surges of sensory input that are occasioned by saccades. Further studies are indicated to analyze this relationship by crosscorrelating simultaneous recordings of saccades and scalp EEGs from the occipital leads.

Usually, oscillations at different frequencies occur simultaneously during information processing. Thus, the question for synchronisation of different frequencies by phase coupling and its possible functional significance is of primary importance. An answer may be given by bispectral analysis. Estimation of the (cross-) bispectrum allows to identify synchronised frequencies and possibly, the existence of non-linear phase coupling of different oscillators. Previous studies have demonstrated the simultaneous occurrence of slow (4-7 Hz) and fast (20-30 Hz) oscillations at frontal and prefrontal electrode positions during memory processing. However, interrelations between these rhythms have not been investigated up to now. In order to test short-term memory, the Sternberg task with random figures and number words was carried out on 10 female subjects. During the task EEG was recorded. Power and bispectral analyses from frontal, prefrontal and frontopolar regions were performed off-line. Increased power was found in both the theta and the gamma bands. Strong phase-coupling between theta at Fz and gamma at F3 and at Fp1, respectively, was shown for memorising number words by means of cross-bicoherence. A possible reason for this is an amplitude modulation of gamma frequencies by slow oscillations. The correspondent coherence analysis between the envelope of gamma frequencies at Fp1 and the raw EEG at Fz supports this presumption. This finding is interpreted as an EEG aspect of the functional linking between the prefrontal areas and the G.cinguli (as part of the limbic system), which are both extremely important for memory functions.

Methods: Sleep EEG was recorded in 19 YN and 19 EN Ss on 4 non-consecutive baseline nights and simultaneously quantified as fast Fourier transform (FFT) power and 3 zero-cross period-amplitude (PA) measures: integrated amplitude, time in band and average wave amplitude. Results: The shapes of both the FFT and PA spectra differed among Ss but were highly consistent within individuals. Inter-night reliability of the separate frequency bands was correspondingly high. Despite substantial age effects, the reliability of computer-measured Sleep EEG in the elderly equaled that of the YN Ss. Within both the YN and EN groups, the shapes of the NREM and REM spectral curves differed significantly. The NREM and REM also differed significantly in them two age groups. Conclusions. Computer-measured sleep EEG is highly reliable across non-consecutive nights in both young and elderly normal Ss. The trait-like stability of these measures suggests they are genetically determined. This possibility is supported by twin study data that show strong heritability for FFT-measured waking EEG. The different shapes of NREM and REM spectra add further evidence that these are fundamentally different states of brain organization. The age differences in spectral shape, along with PA data for wave incidence, demonstrate that age effects on sleep EEG are not caused by changes in skull impedance or other non-cerebral factors.

Mice lacking DBP display a shorter circadian period in locomotor activity and are less active. Thus, although DBP is not essential for circadian rhythm generation, it does modulate important clock outputs. We studied the role of DBP in the circadian and homeostatic aspects of sleep regulation by comparing DBP deficient mice (dbp(-/-)) with their isogenic controls (dbp(+/+)) under light-dark (LD) and constant-dark (DD) baseline conditions, as well as after sleep loss. Whereas total sleep duration was similar in both genotypes, the amplitude of the circadian modulation of sleep time, as well as the consolidation of sleep episodes, was reduced in dbp(-/-) under both LD and DD conditions. Quantitative EEG analysis demonstrated a marked reduction in the amplitude of the sleep-wake-dependent changes in slow-wave sleep delta power and an increase in hippocampal theta peak frequency in dbp(-/-) mice. The sleep deprivation-induced compensatory rebound of EEG delta power was similar in both genotypes. In contrast, the rebound in paradoxical sleep was significant in dbp(+/+) mice only. It is concluded that the transcriptional regulatory protein DBP modulates circadian and homeostatic aspects of sleep regulation.

The present report is a multiple-channel electroencephalographic (EEG) study of AER suppression among 20 normal and 20 schizophrenia subjects. The typical paired-stimulus paradigm was used to evoke time-locked AERs. AER responses were scored at P50 and N100 in the time domain using both single (Cz) and multichannel data (after reduction using principal components analysis, PCA), and were scored for information in the gamma (20-50 Hz) and low-frequency (1-20 Hz) ranges using multichannel information (also after PCA). The time domain analyses demonstrated that schizophrenia patients differ from normal in amplitude of response to the first, but not to the second, stimulus for both P50 and N100. The frequency domain data demonstrated that schizophrenia patients differed from normal on amplitude of the low-frequency response (LFR) to the first, but not to the second, stimulus. The groups did not differ significantly on amplitudes of the gamma-band responses. Group separations were largest for the multichannel N100 and LFR data, with the LFR demonstrating, a modestly better risk ratio for differentiating schizophrenia from normal subjects. The present results suggest two novel differences from previous AER suppression studies: (1) S1 amplitudes largely determine differences between normal and schizophrenia groups on AER suppression, and (2) frequency domain analyses may provide important complimentary information when studying AERs in schizophrenia.

These rodents spend most of their life-time underground, and are less exposed to many of the environmental stimuli and challenges that are common to non-fossorial rodents. A prominent adaptation is their blindness, which is due to an atrophy of the eyes. Design: Continuous 24-h recordings of EEG, EMG and cortical temperature, and EEG spectral analysis were performed in six individuals caught in the wild and adapted to the laboratory for several months. Setting: N/A Patients or Participants: N/A Interventions: N/A Measurements and Results: Total sleep time (52% of recording time) and the amount of REM sleep (8% of recording time) in these subterranean rodents are in the range of values found in the laboratory rat. mouse and hamster recorded under similar conditions. In contrast to these species, the polyphasic sleep-wakefulness distribution in mole rats was more distinct. A predominance of sleep in the dark period was only minor and not present in all individuals, which resembles sleep in the guinea pig. As in all other mammals investigated, the daily time course of EEG slow-wave activity (SWA) in nonREM sleep closely followed the polyphasic sleep-wake pattern and the light-dark preference. The transitions from non REM sleep to REM sleep were characterized, as in other rodents. by a gradual increase in EEG activity in the theta and sigma frequency bands before the transition. However, the power surge in these frequencies massively exceeded that found in other rodents. This feature may be related to adaptations of the brain to the requirements of the subterranean habitat. Conclusions: It is remarkable that large ecological differences between species within the same order have relatively small effects on many sleep features. The time course of SWA confirmed its predictability on the basis of the previous sleep-wake history.

Similarly to EP analysis the statistical validation of the results is based on the multiple repetition of the same task. This approach is not possible for complex unreproducible thinking processes of long duration as e.g., solving mathematical problems. Classical coherence analysis of long periods of the EEG suffers from the loss of temporal information. The paper presents a temporal coherence analysis of the ongoing EEG preserving the temporal information of long cognitive processes. The main point of the method is the decomposition of the whole time interval in microstates of synchronous oscillations. The calculation of instantaneous coherence for multiple electrode pairs yields in a time-dependent high-dimensional coherence vector. A segmentation algorithm dissects the whole process into time intervals with stable coherence vectors- the so-called microstates of oscillations. A subsequent clustering procedure into a small number of classes results in a sequence of prototypical microstates, which may be modeled by a Markovian process. Special entropy parameters characterize the strength of concatenation of different microstates. The method was applied in order to understand the special brain functioning of mathematically highly gifted subjects.

To investigate whether DHEAS modulates sleep-wake behavior, we assessed the sleep response to three doses (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg) of intraperitoneally administered DHEAS, mixed with oil, in 8 rats. DHEAS injections produced dose-dependent and long-lasting elevations in the plasma levels of both DHEAS and DHEA. DHEAS administration did not affect sleep time and architecture but exerted persistent effects on the electroencephalogram (EEG) within non-rapid eye movement sleep: 50 mg/kg DHEAS significantly augmented EEG power in the frequency range of sleep spindles, and 100 mg/kg DHEAS depressed EEG power in the slow-wave frequency bands. The findings indicate that DHEAS changes the sleep EEG in a dose-dependent way, possibly through a modulation of GABA- and glutamate-induced currents. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

Significant coherence was seen between STNME LFPs and Cz-FCz, STNME LFPs and C3/4-FC3/4, and STNME LFPs and EMG over the range 7-45 Hz, EEG phase-led STNME LFPs by 24.3 ms (95% confidence interval 19.8 to 29.0 ms). EMG also led STNME LFPs, but time differences tended to cluster around one of two values: 6.3 ms (-0,7 to 13.3 ms) and 46.5 ms (26.2 to 66.8 ms). Recordings from the STNME contact that demonstrated the most consistent coherence with Cz-FCz in the 15-30 Hz band coincided with the contact which, when electrically stimulated at high frequencies, produced the most effective clinical response in eight out of nine (89%) subjects (P < 0.01). Oscillatory activity at 15-30 Hz may therefore prove of use in localizing the subthalamic nucleus target that provides the best clinical effect on stimulation, These results extend the hypothesis that coherent activity may be useful in binding together related activities in simultaneously active motor centres, The presence of coherence between EEG and STNME LFPs in both the beta and the gamma band las opposed to only the beta band between EEG and cerebellar thalamus) suggests that there may be some relative frequency selectivity in the communication between different motor structures.

A previous study showed EEG slowing tie, a higher ratio of delta + theta frequencies to alpha + beta frequencies on EEG) during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and wakefulness in untreated OSAS patients. Study and objectives: To determine whether EEG slowing is reversible with continuous positive air pressure (CPAP) treatment and to verify whether the persistence of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is correlated with residual slowing of the EEG. Patients: Ten healthy subjects (9 men and 1 woman) and 14 patients with moderate-to-severe OSAS (13 men and 1 woman) were studied before and after 6 months of treatment with CPAP. Results: Untreated OSAS patients showed EEG slowing in frontal and central cortical regions during both wakefulness and during REM sleep compared to healthy control subjects. This EEG slowing was found to be independent of time spent with arterial oxygen saturation < 90%, severity of OSAS, or mean sleep latency as determined by the multiple sleep latency test. CPAP treatment was found to correct the EEG slowing for both REM sleep and wakefulness. Daytime sleepiness also greatly improved with treatment, but some degree of somnolence remained. Conclusion: CPAP treatment was found to correct the EEG slowing that was observed in untreated OSAS patients. Persistent EDS may be related to persistent obesity after CPAP treatment.

In different blocks, cued spatial locations (left or right) were in either the upper or lower visual field, and attended stimuli were either oriented Ts or moving dots. Distractor stimuli were equally likely in the uncued hemifield. Sustained focal increases of alpha-band activity were seen over occipital cortex contralateral to the direction of the to-be-ignored location (ipsilateral to the cued direction of attention) before onset of the to-be-attended stimulus. The focus of alpha-band activity also moved depending on whether cued locations were in the upper or lower field. Results are consistent with active gating of uncued spatial locations.

We have evidence that there is induction of gamma EEG in normal subjects in response to controlled mental activity. Here we test whether mental tasks further augment interictal gamma oscillations in people with PGE. Methods: We recorded interictal EEG from patients with PGE and partial epilepsy and compared EEG power spectral responses (increases over resting) during mental tasks. Results: In partial epilepsy, mental tasks (except for alternating checkerboard visual stimulation) induced 1.5- to 2.5-fold increases in power of gamma EEG. In generalized epilepsy, generalized increases of 1.5-fold in gamma EEG were induced by only two mental tasks (reading and subtraction), and enhancement of 1- to 1.5-fold in the remaining six (checkerboard, expectancy, music, learning, recalling, and a video). Conclusions: Gamma EEG is less responsive to mental activation in PGE than in partial epilepsy, confirming an abnormality in gamma mechanisms in PGE. Our findings also provide a possible mechanistic link between mental activity and seizures in reading- and arithmetic-induced seizures.

Methods: The sleep EEG records of young (mean age. 22.3 years) and middle-aged (mean age, 62.0 years) healthy men were compared. The EEG was obtained from 3 bipolar derivations (frontal-central (FC), central-parietal (CP), and parietal-occipital (PO)) along the anteroposterior axis. Results: The total sleep time, sleep efficiency, stage 2 and slow wave sleep (SWS) were lower in the middle-aged group, while sleep latency, stage I acid wakefulness after sleep onset were higher. Spectral analysis documented the age-related reduction of EEG power in non-REM sleep (0.25-14 Hz), and REM sleep (0.75-10 Hz), However, the reduction was not uniform over the 3 derivations, but was most pronounced in the anterior derivation (FC) in the theta (both sleep states) and high-alpha/low-sigma bands (non-REM sleep). Conclusions: These changes can be interpreted as age-related shifts of power from the anterior (FC) towards the middle derivation (CP). Aging not only reduces power in the sleep EEG. but causes frequency-specific changes in the brain topography. The results are consistent with the notion of sleep as a local process.

The electroencephalogram was recorded while subjects performed a recognition task with pictures. According to the event-related desynchronization/synchronization method, the percentage of band power changes was calculated during encoding and retrieval for a theta and three alpha bands. Significant results were obtained (with minor exceptions) only in the theta band. The increase in theta was significantly larger during retrieval than during encoding but did not differ significantly between new and successfully retrieved old pictures. Because a memory trace is lacking for new pictures, the increase in theta during retrieval reflects primarily general processing demands of a complex episodic memory system.

The EKG data was divided into three periods: before, during and after ictal activity based on visual and behavior classification of the data. Traditional indices, such as the mean and variance, of the R-R intervals of heart beats are evaluated to compare the variation in these three periods. The spectra of the R-R intervals are investigated to determine a ratio between the highest variation (HV) and the lowest variation (LV). This ratio shows how fast the R-R intervals change during these three periods. Nonlinear time-frequency analysis is also used to evaluate heart rate changes before and after ictal activity. The time-frequency analysis shows that the heart rate increases during the an ictal event and decreases back towards a normal range after the ictus.

Methods: A total of 28 children aged 9-12 years (ADHD and matched healthy controls) pressed a button in response to each target stimulus presented at the attended side (right or left). Auditory gamma band responses (GBRs) within 0-120 ms were analyzed at 8 electrodes with wavelet transform. Effects of attended channel, stimulus type. and group were evaluated for GBR power and phase-locking. Results: For both groups. GBRs had a frontal-central distribution, were significantly larger and more strongly phase-locked to target than to non-target stimuli. and did not differentiate the attended from the unattended channel. ADHD children produced larger and more strongly phase-locked GBRs than controls only to right-side stimuli, irrespective of whether these were the attended or the ignored stimuli. Conclusions: The association between auditory GBR and motor task stimulus in children suggests that phase-locked gamma oscillations may reflect processes of sensory-motor integration. ADHD-related deviations of GBRs indicate that early mechanisms of auditory stimulus processing are altered in ADHD. presumably as a result of impaired motor inhibition.

Fourteen patients underwent hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (32 degreesC, group H), and 14 normothermic CPB (group N). The level of sedation was measured with Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Score and with Ramsay Sedation Score. BIS was the only EEG measurement that paralleled the clinical course of the patients' sedation level. Values (median, 95% confidence intervals (CI)) changed significantly over time in both groups (P <0.0001). In group H, BIS decreased from 97 (95, 99) the day before surgery to 48 (44, 52) after tracheal intubation, to 46 (41, 52) before going off CPB, to 91 (85, 97) immediately before extubation. In group N, values were 93 (91, 97) the day before surgery, 53 (47, 59) after tracheal intubation, 48 (43, 53) before going off CPB, and 90 (84, 96) before extubation. During CPB, BIS values were significantly different between the two groups. Group H had a median of 41 (95% CI, 39, 42), and group N had a median of 49 (95% CI, 48, 51, P <0.0001). Peak values of all other processed EEG parameters during anaesthesia and surgery overlapped with values from the day before, when patients had no sedating medication, and these values did not correlate to the patients' course of sedation during the study. There was no explicit recall of the surgery in either group. During the phases of anaesthesia and surgery without CPB, the progression of BIS levels was comparable with previously published data for non-cardiac surgery. During normothermic CPB, the highest BIS values were close to values representing insufficient depth of sedation. It remains to be elucidated whether the much lower BIS values in the hypothermic group were solely a result of brain cooling or if increased serum propofol concentrations, because of slowed pharmacodynamics during hypothermia, also contributed.

To illustrate this concept we may assume that at least two states of the epileptic brain are possible: the interictal state characterized by a normal, apparently random, steady-state electroencephalography (EEG) ongoing activity, and the ictal state, that is characterized by paroxysmal occurrence of synchronous oscillations and is generally called, in neurology, a seizure. The transition between these two states can either occur: 1) as a continuous sequence of phases, like in some cases of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE); or 2) as a sudden leap, like in most cases of absence seizures. In the mathematical terminology of nonlinear systems, we can say that in the first case the system's attractor gradually deforms from an interictal to an ictal attractor. The causes for such a deformation can be either endogenous or external. In this type of ictal transition, the seizure possibly may be anticipated in its early, preclinical phases. In the second case, where a sharp critical transition takes place, we can assume that the system has at least two simultaneous interictal and ictal attractors all the time. To which attractor the trajectories converge, depends on the initial conditions and the system's parameters. An essential question in this scenario is how the transition between the normal ongoing and the seizure activity takes place. Such a transition can occur either due to the influence of external or endogenous factors or due to a random perturbation and, thus, it will be unpredictable. These dynamical changes may not be detectable from the analysis of the ongoing EEG, but they may be observable only by measuring the system's response to externally administered stimuli. In the special cases of reflex epilepsy, the leap between the normal ongoing attractor and the ictal attractor is caused by a well-defined external perturbation. Examples from these different scenarios are presented and discussed.

To help clarify the situation single trials of hippocampal EEG were analysed using wavelet time-frequency analysis and we found that theta frequency within single trials shows positive or negative correlation with wheel running speed, even when mean theta frequency is not correlated with mean wheel running speed. As the mean running speed increases and the standard deviation of running speed decreases in a single trial, the correlation between theta frequency and wheel running speed within the single trial tends to be positive. Trials with abrupt decelerations have lower means and higher standard deviations of speed and tend to have negative correlations within single trials. In addition, we observed a shift of dominant theta frequency from 7.5-8 Hz to 8.5-9 Hz during spontaneous deceleration behaviour without involving any cognitive task, which has been connected to learning, attention and cognition.

These subjective states, 'recollection' and 'familiarity' both entail correct recognition but one involves a clear and conscious recollection of the event including memory for contextual detail whilst the other involves a sense of familiarity without clear recollection. Here we show that during a verbal recognition memory test, the subjective experience of 'recollection' induced higher amplitude gamma oscillations than the subjective experience of 'familiarity' in the time period 300-500 ms after stimulus presentation. Recollection, but not familiarity, was also associated with greater functional connectivity in the gamma frequency range between frontal and parietal sites. Furthermore, the magnitude of the gamma functional connectivity varied over time and was modulated at 3 Hz. Previous studies in animals have shown local theta frequency modulation (3-7 Hz) of gamma-oscillations but this is the first time that a similar effect has been reported in the human EEG.

For the physiological tremor in healthy subjects, the analysis enables to determine the resonant contribution to the oscillation and allows to test for a contribution of reflexes to this tremor. Comparing the analysis of the relation between the tremor of both hands in normal subjects and subjects with a rare abnormal organization of certain neural pathways proves the involvement of central structures in enhanced physiological tremor. The relation between the left and the right side of the body in pathological tremor shows a specific difference between orthostatic and all other forms of tremor. An investigation of EEG and tremor in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease reveals the tremor-correlated cortical activity. Finally, the general issue of interpreting the results of methods designed for the analysis of bivariate processes when applied to multivariate processes is considered. We discuss and apply partial cross-spectral analysis in the frame of graphical models as an extention of bivariate cross-spectral analysis for the multivariate case.

However, there have been several reports in which oscillatory pre-myoclonic cortical discharges occur in patients with repetitive myoclonus (Mov Disord 6 (1994) 633; Brain 119 (1996) 1307; Brain 124 (2001) 2459; Brain 126 (2003) 326). In the present paper, we describe 4 patients with non-repetitive positive or negative myoclonus whose jerks were preceded by 16-20 Hz oscillatory EEG potentials over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. Methods: Jerk-locked averaging (JLA) was performed in 3 patients with positive myoclonus two of which had benign familial myoclonus epilepsy whilst the other had tuberculous meningitis. Silent period locked averaging (SPLA) was performed in a patient with hepatic encephalopathy and asterixis. Results: In the 3 patients with positive myoclonus, JLA revealed a sequence of 20 Hz EEG potentials preceding the myoclonus. The positive peak of the last oscillation preceded the onset of myoclonus by the cortico-muscular latency. In the patient with hepatic encephalopahty, SPLA showed that 16 Hz EEG oscillations over the contralateral motor cortex were associated with small EMG oscillations, and that the largest EEG wave of the oscillation preceded the onset of a large EMG discharge just prior to the EMG silence. These oscillatory activities are similar in frequency to the motor cortical oscillations seen in monkeys and humans during voluntary contraction. Conclusions: Abnormally enhanced rhythmic (16-20 Hz) activities in the motor cortex are associated with arrhythmic positive or negative myoclonus. The rhythmic activities may also be responsible for the generation of the tremulousness (or mini-asterixis) in metabolic encephalopahty. (C) 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

We suppose that delta, theta and alpha oscillations are informational channels of three hierarchical philogenetic systems. Delta oscillations are linked with the most ancient system, which was dominant in reptilian brain. Theta oscillations dominate in lower mammals. Alpha oscillations are manifestation of activity of the newest system, which dominate in adult humans. The three hierarchical phylogenetic systems fulfill parallel processing and their contribution to resulting behavior could differ in different individuals. Relative contribution of each system is regulated by means of descending inhibition (DI), higher systems inhibiting the lower. One of this theory's implications is that the personality trait of behavioral inhibition (behavioral inhibition system, BIS) should be associated with a stronger DI but particular mechanism could be different in children and adults. In order to test this hypothesis in 95 children (11-16 years) and 45 adults (18-37 years) resting EEG recordings were obtained along with BIS scores assessed by the Gray-Wilson Personality Questionnaire. Within subject strength of DI was measured by negative correlations between delta, theta and alpha powers estimated in individually adjusted EEG bands. In adults, BIS was associated with enhanced negative feedback from the alpha to the delta system, indicating a predominantly cortical origin of the adult humans' anxiety. In children, BIS was associated with enhanced negative relation be tween theta and delta systems, which is similar to the mechanism known in animals where limbic system plays the crucial role in mediating anxiety and fear. Although the presented empirical data partly supported the theory, it remains to be speculative and needs further empirical validation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Electrical stimulation of the snout elicited somatic-evoked magnetic fields (SEFs) above the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) of the piglet. The SEFs contained high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) around 600 Hz similar in many respects to the noninvasively measured HFOs from humans with MEG and electroencephalography (EEG). These HFOs were highly correlated with those in simultaneously measured intracortical somatic-evoked potentials (SEPs) in the snout projection area in SI. Both HFOs in SEFs and SEPs consisted of an initial component insensitive to cortically injected kynurenic acid (Kyna, 20 mM), a nonspecific antagonist of glutamatergic receptors, and a subsequent Kyna-sensitive component. The former was localized in cortical layer IV, indicating that it was due to spikes produced by the specific thalamocortical axonal terminals, whereas the latter was initially localized in layer IV and subsequently in the superficial and deeper layers. These results suggest that it may be possible to study properties of the thalamocortical and cortical spike activities in humans with MEG.

Wavelet analysis of the single-sweep IC activation waveforms revealed increased high-frequency energy for two ICs underlying the visual enhancement effect. For one ICI current source density analysis localized activity mainly to the superior temporal gyrus, consistent with principles of multimodal integration. For the other IC, activity was distributed across multiple cortical areas perhaps reflecting global mappings underlying the visual enhancement effect. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Susceptibility loci for epilepsy and schizophrenia have been mapped in this region. Based on pharmacological evidence, it has been suggested that GABA(B) receptors may play a crucial role in the synchronization of EEG oscillations, which in turn can be abnormal in neuropsychiatric disorders. In the present study, the hypothesis was tested, whether three exonic variants of the gene encoding the human GABA(B) receptor (GABA(B)R1) modify cortical synchronization measured as scalp-recorded EEG-coherence. Two principal components of EEG coherence (frontal coherence, parietotemporal coherence) were investigated in 104 healthy subjects during three conditions: resting EEG, activated EEG, and event-related EEG. No significant associations were found between the frontal coherence component and any polymorphism or between the parietotemporal coherence component and the exon 1a1 polymorphism. However, parietotemporal coherence showed statistically highly significant associations across all three experimental conditions with exon 7 and trend associations with exon 11. The results provide evidence that the translated polymorphism of exon 7 maybe functionally meaningful and impact cortical EEG oscillations. Since variations of EEG coherence have been described for several neuropsychiatric disorders, the present association should be tested in clinical samples using EEG coherence as an intermediate phenotype.

These oscillations are characterized by a common wave form with a spatially distributed pattern of amplitude modulation (AM). We observe highly reproducible AM patterns across spatially separated channels within various areas, yet the temporal correlations between the channels are low. In the framework of the present research, a nonlinear, spatially distributed dynamical model of neuronal populations (KIII) is used for the interpretation of the observed spatial coherence. The theoretical findings are in good agreement with experiments performed with chronically implanted rabbits. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B,V. All rights reserved.

Personality was assessed in Ss older than I I years by questionnaires based on Eysenck's and Gray's models. Psychopathology was measured in children aged 7-17 years by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the Child Behaviour Check List (CBCL) completed by teachers, parents and children older than I I years. EEG was recorded in a resting state. Absolute and relative spectral powers were calculated for individually adjusted delta, theta, and alpha bands. In order to test Robinson's theory (Robinson, 2001), which states that the thalamocortical "alpha" system exerts an inhibitory effect over the brainstem "delta" system and that the strength of this inhibition relates to personality, Robinson's analysis of averaged evoked potentials (AEP) was replicated on spontaneous EEG measures and an "Inhibition" score extracted. Extraversion, Behavioural Activation, and Conduct Problems were positively related to delta, and negatively related to alpha power and "Inhibition". Neuroticism, Behavioural Inhibition, and Emotional Symptoms showed an opposite pattern of correlations, being positively related to alpha and "Inhibition", and negatively related to delta power. These relationships generally support Robinson's theory. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The method, based on independent component analysis, was applied to data recorded from two normal subjects performing sustained submaximal contractions or continual repetitive movements of the arm. Augmented datasets, consisting of the EEG and either the sEMG from a single muscle (subject 1) or a combination of sEMGs from several muscles (subject 2), were analyzed with independent component analysis to determine the EEG/sEMG coupling. Each derived coupling consisted of a spatial distribution on the scalp and a waveform representing an EEG channel combination coactivating with the sEMG. The combinations of sEMGs, derived by applying independent component analysis to the simultaneous sEMG recordings from several muscles to create sEMG independent components (ICs), were either tonic or phasic with differing periods of activation. The topographic distributions on the scalp of the couplings between the EEG and sEMG ICs were different for each sEMG IC. The spatial distributions of the couplings between tonic sEMG ICs or single-muscle sEMGs and the EEG followed topographic patterns in sensorimotor regions. Phasic couplings were bifrontal, lateral, and bioccipital. Calculation of coherence between the sEMG ICs and calculated EEG combinations agreed well with the frequency spectra of the independent component analysis-derived coupling waveforms. These preliminary results demonstrate that detection of both the tonic and phasic coupling between the sEMG and the EEG is possible when monitoring unpaced proximal arm movement. This may thus be a practical means of exploring the dynamic cortical/muscle relationships in subjects unable to perform fine finger movements, such as patients recovering from stroke.

J	Lo, PC; Chung, WP				Lo, PC; Chung, WP			An approach to quantifying the multi-channel EEG spatial-temporal feature	BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						multi-channel EEG (electroencephalogram); spatial-temporal feature; state-space trajectory; intrinsic dimension; complexity index; global waveform complexity	CHAOS; ATTRACTORS; NUMBER; STATE	Investigation of spatial characteristics in the multi-channel EEG (electroencephalogram) has been of great importance to the fundamental and clinical medicine. Conventional methods are mostly based on the coherence and correlation analysis in time and frequency domain. The authors present the method of quantifying the global waveform complexity in EEG by analyzing the high-dimensional state-space trajectory constructed from the multi-channel EEG. The resulting average complexity index (<(<delta>)over bar>) is well distinct between the background (4.0 similar to 4.5) and event (3.0 similar to 3.5 for the focal-sharp-wave transient) in the 5-channel case study. In addition, the running <(<delta>)over bar> measurement for different electrode arrays, for a fixed number of state-space dimension (n = 5), reveals the EEG spatial characteristic. An array composed of nearby channels with similar EEG activities tends to have a small <(<delta>)over bar>. On the other hand, the computed <(<delta>)over bar> increases as the array consists of electrode sites with spatially incorrelated EEG activities. Thus the method is capable of quantifying the spatial-temporal feature of the multi-channel EEG.

The existence of a mutually exclusive mechanism between spindles and delta waves should be reflected in a mutually exclusive facilitation of IEDs activation by slow wave activity (SWA) and sigma activity (SA) during synchronized NREM sleep. Methods: We reanalyzed data from 19 children and 15 adult patients affected by different partial epileptic syndromes. The temporal series of SWA, SA and theta band (TB), derived from spectral analysis, were obtained from a spike-free and pathologic alteration-free derivation, controlateral to the most active lead, where the IEDs count was performed. Relationships between SA, SWA and TB and time series of IEDs were tested by means of correlation techniques after data normalization. Results: A positive correlation of spike distribution with SWA time course has been found in the majority of adults. Only a few adult patients showed IEDs that were correlated with SA or TB. Conversely SA was shown to be positively correlated with spiking in many different epileptic syndromes of childhood. Moreover, in the contest of the NREM sleep cycle an inverse relationship between the SWA and SA mode of spike activation has been detected. Conclusions: Overall results give evidence that 3 main rhythmic spectral components that characterize sleep EEG can exert positive influences on IEDs production. Our studies demonstrate that within NREM sleep the facilitating influences on IEDs production exerted separately by either spindle activity or delta synchronization mechanisms can be detected. Moreover, a mutually exclusive mechanism between SA and SWA oscillations is detectable in the opposite relationship of the correlation between IEDs and the two bands in the central part of the NREM cycle.

In control recording, PTZ (27.5 mg/kg i.p.) increased EEG power at frequencies under 12 Hn up to five times. After rats were pretreated with imipramine, fluoxetine or trazodone for 7 days (10 mg/kg i.p., twice a day), PTZ could not increase EEG power to more than three times the power before injection; this effect was not observed after pretreatment for 3 days. These three antidepressants inhibit serotonin uptake, while two other antidepressants, desipramine and nortriptyline, that inhibit norepinephrine uptake failed to counter the PTZ effect. We concluded that antidepressants with serotonergic effects enhanced the function of the GABAA receptor complex. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG. Basel.

J	Allen, PJ; Josephs, O; Turner, R				Allen, PJ; Josephs, O; Turner, R			A method for removing imaging artifact from continuous EEG recorded during functional MRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							RESTORATION; FMRI	Combined EEG/fMRI recording has been used to localize the generators of EEG events and to identify subject state in cognitive studies and is of increasing interest. However, the large EEG artifacts induced during fMRI have precluded simultaneous EEG and fMRI recording, restricting study design. Removing this artifact is difficult, as it normally exceeds EEG significantly and contains components in the EEG frequency range. We have developed a recording system and an artifact reduction method that reduce this artifact effectively. The recording system has large dynamic range to capture both low amplitude EEG and large imaging artifact without distortion (resolution 2 mu V, range 33.3 mV), 5-kHz sampling, and low-pass filtering prior to the main gain stage. Imaging artifact is reduced by subtracting an averaged artifact waveform, followed by adaptive noise cancellation to reduce any residual artifact. This method was validated in recordings from five subjects using periodic and continuous fMRI sequences. Spectral analysis revealed differences of only 10 to 18% between EEG recorded in the scanner without fMRI and the corrected EEG. Ninety-nine percent of spike waves (median 74 mu V) added to the recordings were identified in the corrected EEG compared to 12% in the uncorrected EEG. The median noise after artifact reduction was 8 mu V. All these measures indicate that most of the artifact was removed, with minimal EEG distortion. Using this recording system and artifact reduction method, we have demonstrated that simultaneous EEG/fMRI studies are for the first time possible, extending the scope of EEG/fMRI studies considerably.

These findings suggest that insomnia may be characterized by central nervous system (CNS) hyperarousal. In this article, the seven studies are critically reviewed, two theoretical perspectives on beta EEG are presented, and the concept of hyperarousal as a three component process is discussed.

With no proven effective primary therapy for post-anoxic brain injury, the goal of neurologic care are supportive, to provide prognosis and prevention of further complications. With the multifaceted approach using electroencephalography (EEG), somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP), multiunit recordings, behavioral and histologic assessment, we investigated the hyperacute recovery period after resuscitation from cardiac arrest in a rat model to define the value of EEG and SEP in assessing neurologic injury. METHODS: Two cohorts of rats were subjected to sham and graded asphyxic-cardiac arrest. EEG was collected during baseline, at injury, and 90 minutes into recovery in the first rat cohort. EEG bursting during the first 90 minutes of recovery was visually analyzed and correlated with the neurologic recovery at 24 hours after injury. The neurologic recovery was assessed using a neurodeficit score (NDS) with 80 as normal and 0 as brain dead. The next rat cohort subjected to asphyxic-cardiac arrest was studied using SEP and multiunit recording in the VPL; brain histologic studies were performed at 4 hours after the asphyxia. RESULTS: The first rat cohort subjected to graded asphyxic-cardiac arrest emerged from EEG isoelectricity by burst-suppression pattern during the first 90 minutes after asphyxia. Six rats in the good outcome group (NDS >60) showed increased frequency of bursting, leading to return of EEG background activity. Six rats with a bad outcome (NDS <60) had law-intensity and persistent bursting without return of EEG background activity within 90 minutes of observation. Visual assessment showed increased EEG peak burst counts during the first 90 minutes of recovery for the rats with a good outcome compared with the rats with a bad outcome. In the second cohort, the rats were subjected to 3 minutes, 5 minutes, and 7 minutes of asphyxia. The N20 recovered to 60% of baseline in all three cases. The recovery profile of VPL is similar to that of cortical N20 for the animal with 3 minutes of asphyxia. However, VPL response is suppressed after T minutes of asphyxia leading to a divergence in the rate of recovery of the cortical N20 and VPL response. In both the animals (with mild and intermediate injury) in which the early response in VPL recovered to more than 50% of baseline, the recovery profile was similar to the N20 in cortical evoked potential (EP). The rats were killed 4 hours after asphyxia and the hematoxylin and eosin stain performed on the brains showed evidence of neuronal injury in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) which seemed to correlate with the duration of asphyxia. CONCLUSION: We present a multimodality assessment of early neurologic recovery following resuscitation from cardiac arrest. The recovery of bursting and high-frequency oscillations may be regulated by interneurons in the TRN. The early selective vulnerability of these interneurons in the TRN may be crucial to the early neurologic recovery as assessed by EP, multiunit recording, EEG, and neurologic behavioral recovery.

Sixty-two patients were randomized to ECT conditions differing in electrode placement (right unilateral versus bilateral) and stimulus dosage (just above seizure threshold versus 2.5 times seizure threshold). At the second and penultimate treatments, global total power (1.5-28.5 Hz) and global power in specific frequency bands were quantified in 19-lead EEG recordings of the generalized seizure and the immediate postictal period. Seizures induced with high dosage, and to lesser extent, with bilateral electrode placement, resulted in greater global power. Patient age, initial seizure threshold, and baseline depression severity were inversely related to global power during seizures. While superior clinical outcome following ECT was associated with greater global power during seizures, this effect was small. The factors associated with more robust seizure expression also resulted in greater postictal bioelectric suppression. Associations with treatment parameters and patient variables were stronger at the second than penultimate treatment. We conclude that manipulations of ECT technique strongly determine the magnitude of seizure expression, but relations with clinical outcome are weak. The findings raise doubt about the clinical utility of algorithms based on analysis of EEG features to guide ECT parameter selection.

It can be shown that a transient quadratic phase coupling (QPC) exists between the frequency ranges 0 to 2.5 and 3 to 7.5 Hz and between the frequency ranges 0 to 2.5 and 8 to 12 Hz. The QPC can be explained by an amplitude modulation, where the slow rhythm modulates the rhythmic activities with a higher frequency. By means of time-variant bicoherence analysis, a strong phase-locking between the modulating and the modulated component can be identified. The phase-locking is demonstrable within the first 250 ms after the burst onset and comes up to the maximum between 750 and 1250 ms. The effect is maintained over the whole first part of the burst (2 a) with a decreasing tendency after 1250 ms. All these effects cannot be found in the LEG before entering the burst suppression period (BSP). The transient coupling phenomena in the EEG bursts during BSP can be regarded as indicators for short-term interrelations between the underlying electrophysiologic processes.

The EEG features typical of healthy subjects were identified: an anterior-posterior gradient of the mean coherence and the character of cortical-subcortical relationships in the anterior cerebral structures. Right- and lefthanded subjects showed the frequency and regional differences in EEG coherence, which reflected, mainly, specific intracortical relationships. Development and regression of pathologic signs in right- and lefthanded patients with organic brain lesions are thought to be determined by these differences. As distinct from cortical pathology, lesions of regulatory structures (diencephalic, brainstem, and limbic) were shown to produce more diffuse changes in intercentral relationships with a tendency to reciprocity. Intercentral relations, including their interhemispheric differences, varied with changes in the functional state of healthy subjects (increase and decrease in the level of functioning). A certain time course of changes in intercentral relationships was also revealed in patients with organic brain lesions during recovery of their consciousness and mental activity. Changes in the dominance of activity of individual regulatory structures are considered to be one of the most important factors that determine the dynamic character of EEG coherence.

Methods: A portable multi-channel EEG telemetry system was developed to record the EEGs of 3 healthy male Balinese while they were performing a ritual dedicatory drama in the field. After reducing extraneous artifacts using a digital filter, the EEGs and their power spectra were analyzed in terms of evolution from one state to another. Results: During the drama, one of the subjects became possessed while the others did not. The EEG of the possessed subject did not show any pathological findings including epileptic discharges, but indicated enhanced power in the theta and alpha frequency bands during the trance. This finding was not observed in the other two subjects, who did not go into trances, with no pathological EEG findings. Conclusions: The measurement system and data analysis methods we developed have allowed us, for the first time, to obtain an EEG from healthy subjects who are vigorously moving while in a possession trance. The present technique enables us to use a spontaneous EEG as a marker of the underlying physiology of a state of possession trance. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

For this purpose, power spectra of three EEG channels (F4, C4, and O2, all referred to A1) were obtained by means of the fast Fourier transform, and the power of the bands ranging from 0.75-4.50 Hz (delta) and 12.50-15.00 (sigma) was calculated for the whole period of analysis (7 h) in 10 healthy subjects. Also two additional time series - the ration between beta and gamma2 and between gamma1 and gamma2 - were calculated (beta and gamma ratios). The difference between the mean group values of the delta and sigma bands power, and of the beta and gamma ratios, during the different sleep stages, over the three different scalp locations recorded was evaluated by means of the nonparametric Friedman, ANOVA. During non-REM slow-wave sleep, the delta band showed the highest values over the central regions, followed by those observed over the occipital areas and, lastly, those form the frontal lead. During REM sleep, the beta ratio showed its highest values over the central field, which were significantly higher that those obtained form both the frontal and the occipital regions. The gamma ratio showed a statistically nonsignificant tendency to show a similar topographic distribution pattern. Sleep can be considered a complex phenomenon with a differential involvement of multiple cortical and subcortical structures. The analysis of high-frequency EEG bands and of our beta and gamma ratios represent and additional important element to include in the study of sleep.

The performance of these methods is compared for the case of wavelet time-frequency analysis of simulated gamma-band activity. A reasonable comparison of CSD and MN on the single trial level requires regularization such that the corresponding transformed data sets have similar signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). For region-of-interest approaches, it should be possible to optimize the SNR for single estimates rather than for the whole distributed solution. An effective implementation of the MN method is described. Simulated data sets were created by modulating the strengths of a radial and a tangential test dipole with wavelets in the frequency range of the gamma band, superimposed with simulated spatially uncorrelated noise, The MN and CSD transformed data sets as well as the average reference (AR) representation were subjected to wavelet frequency-domain analysis, and power spectra were mapped for relevant frequency bands. For both CSD and MN, the influence of noise can be sufficiently suppressed by regularization to yield meaningful information, but only MN represents both radial and tangential dipole sources appropriately as single peaks. Therefore, when relating wavelet power spectrum topographies to their neuronal generators, MN should be preferred. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Material and methods - EEGs (200 Hz sample frequency; 21 channels; average reference) were recorded in 10 AD patients (two males; age 76.2; SD 9.36; range 59-86), 17 subjects with MCI (eight males; age 77.41; SD 6.25; range 62-88) and 20 subjects with SCI (11 males; age 68.9; SD 12.96; range: 51-89). The synchronization likelihood, a novel type of coherence measure, was computed, comparing each channel with all other channels, for the 2-6, 6-10, 10-14, 14-18, 18-22 and 22-50 Hz band. Results - The synchronization likelihood was significantly decreased in the 14-18 and 18-22 Hz band in AD patients compared with both MCI subjects and healthy controls. Lower beta band synchronization correlated with lower Mini-Mental state examination (MMSE) scores. Conclusion - Loss of beta band synchronization occurs early in mildly affected AD patients and correlates with cognitive impairment.

The subjects were first allowed to explore the environment freely. They then had to navigate from a starting point to a destination, knowing that an obstruction would appear at one of several possible locations along the main route and force them to take a detour. Spatiotemporal analysis of the theta and alpha bands were performed (1) prior to the start of navigation, (2) from the start of navigation until the obstruction was encountered, (3) during the time subjects were contemplating a detour and were not navigating, and (4) from the resumption of navigation until the destination was reached. In all subjects, theta power was strongest during the two periods of navigation. The peak frequency of the oscillations was approximately 3.7 Hz. Control studies consisted of a motor task similar to that required for navigation, passive viewing of a tour through the same virtual reality town, and a mental concentration task. No consistent increases in theta power were seen in the MEG during any of the control tasks. The results suggest an association between theta rhythm and the performance of navigational tasks in humans.

ECoG were recorded from up to 64 electrodes 0.5 mm apart in a linear array 3.2 cm long, which was placed on the exposed superior temporal gyrus or motor cortex of volunteers undergoing diagnostic surgery. Visual displays of multiple traces revealed broad spectrum oscillations in episodic bursts having a common aperiodic wave form with recurring patterns of spatial amplitude modulation (AM patterns) on selected portions of the array. The one-dimensional spatial spectrum of the human ECoG was calculated at successive time samples and averaged over periods of up to 20 s. Log power decreased monotonically with increasing log spatial frequency in cycles/mm (c/mm) to the noise level similar to 2 log units below maximal power at minimal frequency (0.039 +/- 0.002 c/mm). The inflection point at 0.40 +/- 0.05 c/mm specified an optimal value for a low pass spatial filter to remove noise, and an optimal interelectrode spacing of 1.25 mm to avoid undersampling and aliasing. An 8 x 8 array with that spacing would be 10 x 10 mm. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Intracranial recordings from human cortex have revealed evidence of high-amplitude theta oscillations throughout the brain, including the neocortex. Although its specific role is largely unknown, the observation of human theta has begun to reveal an intriguing connection between brain oscillations and cognitive processes.

Cognitive features of rapid eye movement sleep (REM) dreaming resemble frontal lobe dysfunction. Therefore, temporal coupling of EEG activity between frontal and perceptual regions was analyzed from 10 min prior to dream reports (8 adults) from stage-2 and REM sleep. EEG correlation between frontal and perceptual regions decreased and, among perceptual regions increased during REM. The temporal dissociation of EEG activity between executive and perceptual regions supplies an inadequate mechanism for the binding and interpretation of ongoing perceptual activity resulting in dream bizarreness.

It was found that prominent theta activity appears over the frontal midline (Fm). The significant change of the theta amplitude is found not only around the Fm region but also over the centro-parietal region during learning the route to a goal in a novel maze. It is concluded that both the frontal cortex. and the centro-parietal cortical areas contribute to learning during spatial navigation. These results suggest that the development of the brain network during spatial learning is managed by the cooperation between the frontal cortex and the hippocampus, possibly by synchronization.

Particular variables are derived from EEG and ECG signals and are correlated to anesthetic gas (sevoflurane) concentration, in pediatric anesthesia. The methods used for parameter extraction are based on change detection theory and time-frequency representation. Preliminary results show that the expired anesthetic gas concentration modulates both the heart rate variability and the duration of the burst suppression. Monitors of the central nervous system and autonomic nervous system activities can be expected to be based on these variables.

Recent studies indicate that HRV in humans is altered by nocturnal exposure to power-frequency (60 Hz) magnetic fields. Given the central origin of autonomic cardiac control, we determined if field exposure in the beta(1) EEG/MEG frequency range was a more effective stimulus for HRV alteration than 60 Hz fields, and explored the mechanisms involved. Methods: Healthy young men were exposed (n = 9) overnight to an intermittent magnetic field (16 Hz, 28.3 microTesla, muT), or sham exposed (n = 9), under blind test conditions in a laboratory exposure facility. Results: Field exposure was associated (P < 0.05) with reduced power in the low band of the HRV frequency spectrum, and with decreases in mean heart rate. Analysis of the timing of the R waves surrounding each on-off transition of the intermittent field revealed no evidence for a direct effect on the cardiac pacemaker. Conclusions: Magnetic field exposure in the EEG/MEG beta(1) frequency range alters HRV via a CNS effect. Phase-resetting experiments rule out a direct effect on the cardiac pacemaker. Biophysical calculations of the intensity of the electric fields induced in brain versus heart under the present exposure conditions are also consistent with and support a central rather than a peripheral site of action.

J	David, O; Friston, KJ				David, O; Friston, KJ			A neural mass model for MEG/EEG: coupling and neuronal dynamics	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							CORTICAL AREAS; BRAIN; SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; INTEGRATION; NETWORKS; RHYTHMS; SYSTEM; OSCILLATIONS; POPULATIONS	Although MEG/EEG signals are highly variable, systematic changes in distinct frequency bands are commonly encountered. These frequency-specific changes represent robust neural correlates of cognitive or perceptual processes (for example, alpha rhythms emerge on closing the eyes). However, their functional significance remains a matter of debate. Some of the mechanisms that generate these signals are known at the cellular level and rest on a balance of excitatory and inhibitory interactions within and between populations of neurons. The kinetics of the ensuing population dynamics determine the frequency of oscillations. In this work we extended the classical nonlinear lumped-parameter model of alpha rhythms, initially developed by Lopes da Silva and colleagues [Kybernetik 15 (1974) 27], to generate more complex dynamics. We show that the whole spectrum of MEG/EEG signals can be reproduced within the oscillatory regime of this model by simply changing the population kinetics. We used the model to examine the influence of coupling strength and propagation delay on the rhythms generated by coupled cortical areas. The main findings were that (1) coupling induces phase-locked activity, with a phase shift of 0 or pi when the coupling is bidirectional, and (2) both coupling and propagation delay are critical determinants of the MEG/EEG spectrum. In forthcoming articles, we will use this model to (1) estimate how neuronal interactions are expressed in MEG/EEG oscillations and establish the construct validity of various indices of nonlinear coupling, and (2) generate event-related transients to derive physiologically informed basis functions for statistical modelling of average evoked responses.

Method: Nine male subjects with regular non-rapid-eye movement-rapid-eye movement (NREM-REM) sleep cycles were included in the study. They underwent EEG and cardiac recordings during one experimental night. Heart rate variability was determined over 5-min periods by the ratio of low frequency to low frequency plus high frequency power [LF/(LF + HF)] calculated using spectral analysis of R-R intervals. EEG spectra were analyzed using a fast Fourier transform algorithm. Results: We found an ultradian 80-120 min rhythm in the LF/(LF + HF) ratio, with high levels during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and low levels during slow wave sleep (SWS). During sleep stage 2 there was a progressive decrease in the transition from REM sleep to SWS, and an abrupt increase from SWS to REM sleep. These oscillations were significantly coupled in a 'mirror-image' to the overnight oscillations in delta wave activity, which reflect sleep deepening and lightening. Cardiac changes preceded EEG changes by about 5 min. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the existence of an inverse coupling between oscillations in delta wave activity and heart rate variability. They indicate a non-uniformity in sleep stage 2 that underlies ultradian sleep regulation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Materials and methods - total of 266 adult patients with CPS were included in a hospital based observational survey with a follow-up of 2 to 25 years. Clinical characteristics. seizure frequency, electroencephalography (EEG), cerebral computed tomography (CCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were analyzed. Patients were categorized according to their degree of medical responsiveness into one of three groups: seizure free, improved control ( > 50% seizure reduction) and poor control. Results - Mean age at follow-up was 44.7 years (SD 14.7, range 19-93). Mean age at seizure onset was 18.1 pears (SD 14.7. median 15, range 1-79). Complete seizure control was achieved in 40%, improved seizure control in 36% and poor seizure control in 24%. Patients entered remission after a mean period of 15.7 years (SD 12.6, median 13, range 1-54) of active epilepsy. A third of all seizure-free patients were still in remission 6.1 years (SD 5.3, median 3.5, range 1-18) after discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs (AED). Patients with poor seizure control had a significantly younger age at onset (P < 0.01), a higher initial seizure frequency (more than 3 per month) (P < 0.01), abnormal neurological examination (P < 0.01), and were more often mentally handicapped (P < 0.01). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed a high initial seizure frequency, mental handicap and an abnormal neurological examination as independent risk factors for poor seizure control. A positive family history, a history of febrile convulsions and/or psychosis, an abnormal EEG or MRI was not predictive of poor outcome. Conclusions - Not all patients with CPS were medically intractable, Seizure remission can be achieved after a long time of active epilepsy. Poor seizure control was associated with a high initial seizure frequency, mental handicap and abnormal neurological examination.

The concept of EEG coherence analysis is explained, and its importance emphasized in the light of recent neurobiological findings on frequency-dependent synchrony as a code of information processing between nerve cell assemblies. Furthermore, EEG coherence studies on naturally spoken and written word and sentence processing are reviewed and experimental results are presented giving new insights into the occurrence of "transient functional language centers" within the brain.

One task required exact arithmetic calculations on Arabic numerals. A second task involved pseudoword processing as a control for the verbal (phonological) component that is, by definition, part of arithmetic tasks. A third task primarily required visual/graphemic processing, which is also involved in the other two tasks. Spectral power in the alpha range was lowest during the pseudoword task, followed by power during the arithmetic task, and finally by power in the visual task, indicating more prominent desynchronization during engagement in the analysis of word-like printed material. Finally, linear (power in the gamma range) and non-linear measures (correlation dimension) provided evidence of predominant right hemisphere engagement during the arithmetic task.

Fifty patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy received combined epidural and general anesthesia or general anesthesia alone with isoflurane and alfentanil. Isoflurane was administered by computer-controlled closed-loop feedback to maintain an EEG 95% spectral edge frequency of 17.5 Hz, a target chosen on the basis of a pilot study. In epidural patients, end-tidal isoflurane concentration (FE'(ISO)) was 0.19% smaller (95% confidence interval [CI], - 0.32% to - 0.06%; P < 0.01), mean arterial blood pressure was 17 mm. Hg lower (95% CI, -24 to -9 mm Hg; P < 0.0001), and body temperature was 0.4degreesC lower (95% Cl, -0.7 to 0degreesC; P < 0.05) than in controls. EEG bispectral index (BIS) was 4 points higher (95% CI, 1 to 7; P < 0.05). EEG median frequency and heart rate were similar in both groups. Epidural patients were 76% more likely (95% CI, 58% to 94%; P < 0.001) to require metaraminol for hypotension and were 28% more likely (95% CI, 3% to 53%; P < 0.05) to require glycopyrrolate for bradycardia. After surgery, the time to eye opening in epidural patients was 2.3 min shorter (95% CI, -4.2 to - 0.5 min; P < 0.05). Time to eye opening correlated better with FE'(ISO) in the last 30 s of anesthesia (FE'(ISO) = 0.07 x time to eye opening + 0.31; r(2) = 0.59; P < 0.0001) than with BIS from the same period (BIS = 64 - 1.25 x time to eye opening; r(2) = 0.22; P < 0.001) (P < 0.0001). To maintain similar intraoperative spectral edge frequency, patients receiving combined epidural and general anesthesia require 21% less isoflurane than those receiving general anesthesia alone. This smaller isoflurane dose is associated with faster emergence from anesthesia.

When delivered every minute the oscillation habituated markedly after the first stimulus. This habituation could be transiently reversed by stimulating a different pathway to the recorded area. Gamma oscillation-induced beta frequency oscillations were only seen in response to the first (novel) stimulus and the gamma oscillation itself was markedly attenuated by on-going, non-oscillogenic, synaptic activity. The NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine abolished the response to novel stimuli but left the habituated response relatively unaffected. The pattern of habituation parallelled that seen for sensory induced gamma and beta oscillations in the clinical EEG. (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Part I: Information and meaning in nonconvergent and nonlocal brain dynamics	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIFURCATION AND CHAOS			English	Review						electroencephalogram (EEG); information; meaning; neurodynamics; perception; sensation	SPATIAL-PATTERNS; OLFACTORY EEG; SYNCHRONOUS SPIKING; STATE TRANSITIONS; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; NEURAL-NETWORKS; TIME-SERIES; GAMMA EEGS; SCALP EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION	The aim of this tutorial is to document a novel approach to brain function, in which the key to understanding is the capacity of brains for self-organization. The property that distinguishes animals from plants is the capacity for directed movement through the environment, which requires an organ capable of organizing information about the environment and predicting the consequences of self-initiated actions. The operations of predicting, planning acting, detecting, and learning comprise the process of intentionality by which brains construct meaning. The currency of brains is primarily meaning and only secondarily information. The information processing metaphor has dominated neurocognitive research for half a century. Brains certainly process information for input and output. They pre-process sensory stimuli before constructing meaning, and they post-process cognitive read-out to control appropriate action and express meaning. Neurobiologists have thoroughly documented sensory information processing bottom-up, and neuropsychologists have analyzed the later stages of cognition top-down, as they are expressed in behavior. However, a grasp of the intervening process of perception, in which meaning forms, requires detailed analysis and modeling of neural activity that is observed in brains during meaningful behavior of humans and other animals. Unlike computers, brains function hierarchically. Sensory and motor information is inferred from pulses of microscopic axons. Meaning is inferred from local mean fields of dendrites in mesoscopic and macroscopic populations. This tutorial is aimed to introduce engineers to an experimental basis for a theory of meaning, in terms of the nonlinear dynamics of the mass actions of large neural populations that construct meaning. The focus is on the higher frequency ranges of cortical oscillations. Part I introduces background on information, meaning and oscillatory activity (EEG). Part II details the properties of wave packets. Part III describes the covariance structure of the oscillations. Part IV addresses the amplitude modulations, and Part V deals with the phase modulations. The significance of a theory of meaning lies in applications using population neurodynamics, to open new approaches for treatment of clinical brain disorders, and to devise new machines with capacities for autonomy and intelligence that might approach those of simpler free-living animals.

Cortical direct current (DC) potential shifts and EEG were monitored in conjunction with the circulating concentration of luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans while asleep to assess a hypothalamic-neocortical interaction. The onset of an LH pulse was accompanied (i) at frontocortical locations by a transient positive DC potential shift of approximate to 3 min duration and peak amplitude 50 muV; (ii) at frontal and central locations by an increase in power of infra-slow EEG oscillations for periodicities between 64 and 320 s. Results uniquely demonstrate a coupling of hypothalamo-pituitary activity with regulation of neocortical excitability.

When the user looks to a stimulus, ail associated pattern on the EEG signal will be evoked. The objective of this project is to develop a system for signal conditioning and acquisition, as well as for further identification of different patterns. The system uses a LED matrix as the source of visual stimuli and an appropriate data acquisition system, which were used with ten volunteers in different tasks. Acquired data was analyzed offline in both, time and frequency domains with the mean FFTs and spectrogram, using the MATLAB platform. In eight out of ten volunteers the system succeeded to identify relevant patterns. The analysis of the spectrogram showed that it is possible to identify two, four and up to eight different patterns. These results encourage further development towards a functional prosthetic keyboard.

These oscillators are active usually in a random way. However, by application of sensory stimulation these generators are coupled and act together in a coherent way. This synchronization and enhancement of EEG activity gives rise to 'evoked' or 'event-related oscillations'. The compound evoked potential manifests as superimposition of evoked rhythms in the EEG frequencies ranging from delta tio gamma ('natural frequencies of the brain'). The superimposition principle is described with efficient strategies and by utilization of an efficient algorithm. The wavelet analysis confirms the results of the combined analysis procedure obtained by using the amplitude frequency characteristics (AFCs) and digital filtering. The AFC and adapted digital filtering methods are based on the first approach to analyze average evoked potentials. In contrast, the wavelet analysis is based on signal retrieval and selection among a large number of sweeps recorded in a given physiological or psychological experiment. By combining all these results and concepts, it can be stated that the wavelet analysis underlines and extends the expression that alpha-, theta-, delta-, and gamma-responses described In this report are the most important brain responses related to psychophysiological functions. The wavelet analysis confirms once more the expression 'real signals' which we attribute to EEG frequency responses of the brain. It will be demonstrated that the delta, theta, and alpha responses (i.e. the rhythms 'predicted' by digital filtering) are real brain oscillations. The frequency components of the event-related potential vary independently of each other with respect to: (a) their relation to the event; (b) their topographic distribution; and (c) with the mode of the physiological measurements.

The MI between four lead electrodes was first computed using the EEG time series. The Lempel-Ziv complexity measures, C(n)s, were extracted from the MI time series. Prediction was made by means of artificial neural network (ANN). Training and testing the ANN used the 'drop-one-patient' method. 98 consenting patient experiments show the system was able to correctly classify purposeful response in average accuracy of 91.84% of the cases and the method has a better performance than other methods, such as spectral edge frequency, median frequency, and bispectral analysis. This method is computationally fast and acceptable real-time clinical performance was obtained.

Linear and non-linear TEOAE recordings from normally-hearing subjects (40) and non-linear recordings from patients with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) (40) were analysed using the short-time-Fourier-transform spectrogram, the Gabor spectrogram, and the adaptive spectrogram. The TF representations of the TEOAE recordings indicated a considerable dispersion of energy across frequencies and TEOAE time segments >4.0 ms. The linear and non-linear recordings from the normal subjects showed common frequency peaks. The TF representations from the patients with SNHL indicated that the significantly reduced energy in the mid-to-high TEOAE frequencies did not correlate closely with the threshold elevation. As in the recordings from the normal subjects, a high percentage of the TEOAE cumulative energy was found within a short TEOAE segment (4-14 ms).

We sought to determine the frequency of this complication in a population of patients with medically intractable epilepsy and to analyze the correlation between EEG, electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical features obtained from long-term video-EEG monitoring. Methods: Retrospective analysis of the clinical records of hospitalized patients from May 1992 to June 2001 who underwent long-term video-/EEG monitoring. Results: Of a total of 1,244 patients, five patients had cardiac asystole in the course of ictal events. In these patients, 11 asystolic events, between 4 and 60 s long in a total of 19 seizures, were registered. All seizures had a focal origin with simple partial seizures (n = 13), complex partial seizures (n = 4), and secondarily generalized seizures (n = 2). One patient showed the longest asystole ever reported (60 s) because of a seizure. Cardiac asystole occurred in two patients with left-sided temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and in three patients with frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE; two left-sided, one bifrontal). Two patients reported previous cardiac disease, but only one had a pathologic ECG by the time of admission. Two patients had a simultaneous central ictal apnea during the asystole. None of the patients had ongoing deficits due to the asystole. Conclusions: These findings confirm that seizure-induced asystole is a rare complication. The event appeared only in focal epilepsies (frontal and temporal) with a lateralization to the left side. A newly diagnosed or known cardiac disorder could be a risk factor for ictal asystole. Abnormally long postictal periods with altered consciousness might point to reduced cerebral perfusion during the event because of ictal asystole. Central ictal apnea could be a frequent associated phenomenon.

However, most of the methods extract all sources simultaneously, so it is time consuming and not reliable especially, when the number of sensors is large (more than 100 sensors) and signals are contaminated by huge noise. Main objective of this paper is to present a new method for extraction of specific source signals using bandpass filters approach. Such a method allows us to extract source signals with specific stochastic properties, e.g., extraction narrow band sources with specific frequency bandwidth.

This EEG pattern has been extensively studied since 1938, when Jung and Kornmuller (1938) demonstrated the first theta recordings in the hippocampal formation of rabbits. In 1986 in collaboration with Drs. B.H. Bland, S.H. Roth and B.M. MacIver we demonstrated for the first time that bath perfusion of hippocampal slices with the cholinergic agonist, carbachol, resulted in theta-like oscillations. Since this initial demonstration of in vitro theta-like activity, we have carried out a number of experiments in an attempt to answer the basic question: what are the similarities between cholinergic-induced in vitro theta-like activity and theta rhythm which naturally occurs in the in vivo preparation. Thus far, our studies have provided strong evidence that theta-like activity recorded in vitro shares many of the physiological and pharmacological properties of theta rhythm observed in vivo. The question whether in vitro theta-like oscillations reflect features of epileptiform activity is also adressed in this review.

The motivation for introducing these time-varying complexity measures is the analysis of electroencephalograms for which nonstationarity is an inherent property. Experimental data from babies are analyzed using the proposed complexity measures. The instantaneous statistical dimension computation is based on an adaptive autocorrelation eigenspectrum computation known as APEX together with a model selection rule. The conditional Renyi entropies are based on time-frequency representation of the signal. It is shown that: 1) the three time-varying complexity measures account for a component counting property, 2) the instantaneous statistical dimension is the most robust to Gaussian white noise.

This intermediate level of recordings should help to bridge the gap between multiunit and scalp recordings. Both averaged and single-trial responses to small flashed stimuli, for which we varied the retinotopic position, the luminance and the color, were analyzed in the time-frequency domain using a wavelet-based decomposition of the signal. Large gamma oscillations (40-55 Hz), not phase locked to stimulus onset, were observed during the whole stimulus presentation, whereas visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were present mainly at stimulus onset and offset. Cortical mapping showed that both activities were restricted in spatial extent and followed the retinotopic organization of area VI on the operculum, thus strongly suggesting they were generated in the underlying cortex. Oscillatory burst detection in single trials showed that one to two bursts lasting from 100 ms to 500 ms occurred in the first 500 ms following stimulus onset, and that bursts occurring during the subsequent phases of the response had a smaller amplitude and duration. Finally, we showed that gamma activity was stronger with higher luminances and for red than for green, yellow, or white stimuli of same luminance. In one animal we recorded gamma activity over area V4. This was of lower magnitude than the activity recorded over VI and was delayed by 40 Ins with respect to the beginning of Gamma activity in V1, in contrast with the VEPs that were delayed by 20 ms only. Both Gamma oscillations and early VEP followed the retinotopic organization of V4 over the prelunate gyrus. The results show that gamma oscillations are dependent upon the same parameters as the VEPs (retinotopic position, luminance, and color). However, the differences in the time course of VEPs and gamma activity (transient vs. sustained) suggests that these two responses may reflect different cell populations, different networks, or different firing modes.

J	Yang, CCH; Lai, CW; Lai, HY; Kuo, TBJ				Yang, CCH; Lai, CW; Lai, HY; Kuo, TBJ			Relationship between electroencephalogram slow-wave magnitude and heart rate variability during sleep in humans	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						autonomic nervous system; electroencephalogram; heart rate variability; power-spectral analysis; parasympathetic activity; sleep; slow wave; sympathetic activity	APNEA SYNDROME; TIME	To explore whether depth of sleep is related to changes in autonomic control, continuous power-spectral analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) and heart rate variability (HRV) was performed in ten normal subjects during nocturnal sleep. Quiet sleep (QS) was associated with an increase in high-frequency power (HF) of HRV (0.15-0.4 Hz) but a decrease in low-frequency power (LF) (0.04-0.15 Hz) to HF ratio (LF/HF) compared with awakening. During QS, LF/HF was significantly and negatively correlated with delta power of EEG (0.5-4.0 Hz), whereas mean R-R interval and HF were not. We conclude that during QS, cardiac sympathetic regulation is negatively related to the depth of sleep, although vagal regulation is not. Our methodology offers a quantitative analysis to study the interaction between cerebral cortical and autonomic functions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Yet, risk factors for the development of problem drinking in these high risk groups remain largely unknown. In primarily Euroamerican populations, electrophysiological variables have been associated with risk for alcoholism. The EEG has a specific developmental time course that has been described in a diverse set of ethnic groups, but it has not been described in Native American youth, in addition, the relationship between EEG development and risk for alcoholism in Indian youth has not been previously studied. Methods: Clinical ratings and spectral characteristics of the resting EEG were investigated in 140 Native American Mission Indian children and adolescents between the ages of 7 and 13 years. The specific aims of the study were to (1) investigate the relationship of age and gender with EEG spectral variables to determine if this population conforms to similar trends from previously published data in other ethnic groups and (2) to determine whether children with a parental history of alcoholism differ from those without alcoholic parents on EEG spectral parameters. Results: No excess of abnormal EEG activity was found in this sample of Native American youth. Age, but not gender, was found to have a significant effect on EEG spectral characteristics with younger children (7-11 years old), having significantly more power in slow activity (0.5-7.5 Hz) and in alpha power (8-12 Hz) as well as slower alpha frequencies than older children (12-13 years old). Consistent with other studies: of Native American youth, 66% of the children and adolescents participating in this study had at least one parent who had a lifetime diagnosis of alcohol dependence. However, an ANCOVA that covaried fur age and gender revealed no significant differences in power or frequency characteristics of the EEG on the basis of parental history of alcoholism. Conclusions: These studies suggest that this sample of Mission Indian children, despite high levels of parental alcohol dependence and low socioeconomic status, show normal EEG development. As yet, no relationship has been found between any specific EEG phenotype and parental history of alcoholism in this population, however, further EEG maturation may be necessary before any relationships can be fully delineated.

The wavelet transform provides an important tool in signal analysis and feature extraction. In this paper, the modulus maximum pair of the wavelet transform method is used to detect the singularity value of the sharps and the spikes embedded in the background activities of the epilepsy electroencephalograph (EEG) signal. The wavelet transform of singularities with fast oscillations have a particular behavior that is studied separately, that are measured from the modulus maxima of wavelet transform.

The purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate a method that divides ictal EEG activity into segments of relatively constant surface voltage distribution, and to provide a 3-dimensional localization of the activity during the different segments. Methods: For each timepoint the electrical voltage distribution on the scalp (the voltage map) was determined from the digitized EEG recording. Through a spatial cluster analysis time sequences where the maps did not change much (segments) were identified, and a 3-dimensional source reconstruction of the activity corresponding to the different mean maps was performed using a distributed linear inverse solution algorithm. Results: Segments dominating early in seizure development were identified, and source reconstruction of the EEG activity corresponding to the maps of these segments yielded results which were consistent with the results from invasive recordings. In some cases a sequence of consecutive segments was obtained, which might reflect ictal propagation. Conclusions: Segmentation of ictal EEG with subsequent 3-dimensional source reconstruction is a useful method to non-invasively determine the initiation and perhaps also the spread of epileptiform activity in patients with epileptic seizures.

Evidence from quantitative EEG data has shown that their electrophysiological features, cortical generation mechanisms, and therefore, their functional correlates vary along the sleep-wake continuum. Specifically, spectral microstructure and EEG coherence levels between anterior and posterior cortical regions permit to differentiate among alpha activity spontaneously appearing in relaxed wakefulness with eyes closed, drowsiness period, and REM sleep, by reflecting distinct properties of neural networks involved in its cortical generation as well as a different interplay between cortical generators, respectively. Besides, the dissimilar spatiotemporal features of brain electrical microstates within the alpha range reveals a different geometry of active neural structures underlying each alpha variant or, simply, changes in the stability level of neural networks during each brain state. Studies reviewed in this paper support the hypothesis that two different alpha variants occur during human REM sleep: 'background responsive alpha activity', blocked over occipital regions when rapid eye movements are present, and 'REM-alpha bursts', non modulated by the alternation of tonic and phasic periods. Altogether, evidence suggests that electrophysiological features of human cortical oscillations in the alpha frequency range vary across different behavioural states, as well as within state, reflecting different cerebral phenomena with probably dissimilar functional meaning.

The differential sleep pressure induced frequency-specific changes in the waking EEG from 1-7 Hz and 21-25Hz. Frontal low EEG activity (FLA, 1-7 Hz) during sleep deprivation exhibited a prominent increase as time awake progressed, which could be significantly attenuated by sleep satiation attained with intermittent naps. Subjective sleepiness exhibited a prominent circadian regulation during sleep satiation, with virtually no homeostatic modulation. These extremely different sleep pressure conditions were not reflected in significant changes of the CBT rhythm. The data demonstrate that changes in FLA during wakefulness are to a large extent determined by the sleep-wake dependent process with little circadian modulation, and reflect differential levels of sleep pressure in the awake subject.

The response of the STN to cortical input is shaped by inhibition from the reciprocally connected globus pallidus (GP). To examine the activity in the STN-GP network in relation to cortical activity, we recorded single and multiple unit activity in STN and/or GP together with cortical electroencephalogram in anesthetized rats during various states of cortical activation. During cortical slow-wave activity (SWA), STN and GP neurons fired bursts of action potentials at frequencies that were similar to those of coincident slow (similar to 1 Hz) and spindle (7-14 Hz) cortical oscillations. Spontaneous or sensory-driven global activation was associated with a reduction of SWA and a shift in STN-GP activity from burst- to tonic- or irregular-firing. Rhythmic activity in STN and GP neurons was lost when the cortex was inactivated by spreading depression and did not resume until SWA had recovered. Although rhythmic STN-GP activity was correlated with SWA, the phase relationships of activities of neurons within the STN and GP and between the nuclei were variable. Even when neurons displayed synchronous bursting activity, correlations on the millisecond time scale, which might indicate shared synaptic input, were not observed. These data indicate that (1) STN and GP activity is intimately related to cortical activity and hence the sleep-wake cycle; (2) rhythmic oscillatory activity in the STN-GP network in disease states may be driven by the cortex; and (3) activity of the STN-GP network is regulated in space in a complex manner.

This review summarizes the recent evidence that synchronous neural oscillations reveal much about the origin and nature of cognitive processes such as memory, attention and consciousness. Memory processes are most closely related to theta and gamma rhythms, whereas attention seems closely associated with alpha and gamma rhythms. Conscious awareness may arise from synchronous neural oscillations occurring globally throughout the brain rather than from the locally synchronous oscillations that occur when a sensory area encodes a stimulus. These associations between the dynamics of the brain and cognitive processes indicate progress towards a unified theory of brain and cognition.

J	Maltseva, I; Geissler, HG; Basar, E				Maltseva, I; Geissler, HG; Basar, E			Alpha oscillations as an indicator of dynamic memory operations - anticipation of omitted stimuli	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						alpha-rhythm; memory processes; time interval reproduction; phase-ordered alpha patterns	EEG; BRAIN; POTENTIALS; RHYTHMS; STORAGE	Elaborating on a paradigm of Basar in experiments with periodically presented auditory or visual stimuli, 10 subjects performed tasks in which omitted stimuli had to be anticipated and their (virtual) onset time had either to be marked (a) mentally ('mental marking' MM) or (b) by pressing a button ('button pressing' BP). EEG was obtained from 11 sites in frontal, central, temporal, parietal and occipital areas. The experiments were carried out in triplets of MM, BP, MM measurements. Mean temporal errors of motor responses served as the basis for a functional interpretation of EEG patterns. Correlation analysis of sweeps for each individual revealed brief intervals of phase ordering of EEG patterns in the alpha range lasting approximately three periods. For frontal and vertex derivations a close congruence of the location of the phase-ordered patterns to mean errors of motor responding was shown. These results corroborate the claim that 'emitted' alpha oscillations represent intentional processing. The close agreement between temporal locations of phase-ordered EEG segments and these of the motor responses strongly suggests that EEG phases represent memory retrieval of period duration as a common functional component of MM and BP. A lack of topographical correspondence with results from a passive 'missing stimulus' paradigm underlines the specific intentional origin of the observed phase ordering. Theoretical implications of the results are discussed. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This analysis applies to signals with unique waveform characteristics, such as seizures. Methods: The method extracts activity from an EEG data matrix as a spatiotemporal component having waveforms uncorrelated to the other concurrent activities. The method also provides the location and orientation of the dipole generating this activity. We applied this method to ten scalp seizures in three patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and single-focus seizures confirmed by intracerebral recordings. A realistic head model based on MRI was used for computation of field distributions. Results: When seizure activity was still not visually identifiable on the scalp, the method demonstrated in all scalp seizures a source in the temporal neocortex corresponding clearly to the region of seizure activity in intracerebral recordings. Frequency characteristics of the estimated activities also resembled those of the intracerebral seizures. Conclusions: This method enables estimation of focal brain activity when its effect on scalp EEG is unclear to visual examination. It works in situations where currently available source analyses methods, which require noiseless definite activity, are not applicable. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

But do these medial temporal lobe (MTL) substructures directly cooperate in encoding new memories? Phase synchronization of gamma-band electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations (around 40 Hz) is a general mechanism of transiently connecting neural assemblies. We recorded depth-EEG from within the MTL of epilepsy patients performing a memorization task. Successful as opposed to unsuccessful memory formation was accompanied by an initial elevation of rhinal-hippocampal gamma synchronization followed by a later desynchronization, suggesting that effective declarative memory formation is accompanied by a direct and temporarily limited cooperation between both MTL substructures.

EEGs were recorded from multiple high-density arrays of 14-16 electrodes surgically fixed on the visual, auditory, somatomotor, and entorhinal cortices of trained cats and rabbits, and from a linear array of 64 electrodes on the scalp of human volunteers. Analytic phase relations between gamma EEG signals from multiple cortices were examined with high temporal resolution provided by the Hilbert transform. An index of synchronization was applied to intercortical pairs of signals to detect and display epochs of engagement between pairs. The measure was adapted to derive an index of global synchronization among all 4 cortices that was calculated as a t-value. Global epochs of phase stabilization ("locking") were found to involve all cortices under observation. The phase values were not clustered at zero but were in distributions about nonzero means. Episodic destabilization (decoherence) occurred aperiodically at intervals corresponding to rates in the delta range, with equal likelihood before the onset of the conditioned stimuli (CSs) and in post-stimulus test periods including performance of conditioned responses (CRs). Preferential pairwise phase stabilization was sought but not found between the sensory cortex receiving the auditory or visual CSs and the entorhinal or somatomotor cortex at times of CSs or CRs. The cospectrum from cross-correlating the global synchronization index with the global spatial ensemble average of the unfiltered EEG peaked in the delta range (1-3 Hz) near 2.5 Hz in cat and below 2 Hz in rabbit. The cospectrum of the EEG with the derivative of the analytic phase in humans peaked in the alpha range (7-12 Hz) The results indicated that macroscopic states of synchronized neural activity related to Gestalts formed during perception, that included the primary sensory and limbic areas and perhaps the entire neocortex of each cerebral hemisphere.

In the present study, we investigated the role of PLCbeta4 in thalamic neuron. PLCbeta4-deficient mutant mice were found to exhibit three phenotypic characteristics: (1) a 2-Hz increase in the peak frequency of electroencephalogram (EEG) of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, (2) an increase in the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) recorded in thalamus, and (3) waveform distortion of EEG. We postulate here that changes in protein phosphorylation due to reduced cPKC activity by PLCbeta4 deletion in thalamic neurons may give rise to these phenotypic characteristics. Taken together, these results indicate that reduced PLCbeta4 activity in thalamic neurons may underlie high-cortical oscillation frequency. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

The music clips differed in the level of their complex structure, induced mood, musical tempo and prominent frequency. They were taken from Mozart's sonata (K. 448), and Brahms' Hungarian dance (no. 5). The third clip was a simplified version of the theme taken from Haydn's symphony (no. 94) played by a computer synthesizer. Significant differences in induced event-related desynchronization between the 3 music clips were only observed in the lower-1 alpha band which is related to attentional processes. A similar pattern was observed for the coherence measures. While respondents listened to the Mozart clip, coherence in the lower alpha bands increased more, whereas in the gamma band a less pronounced increase was observed as compared with the Brahms and Haydn clips. The clustering of the three clips based on EEG measures distinguished between the Mozart clip on the one hand, and the Haydn and Brahms clips on the other, even though the Haydn and Brahms clips were at the opposite extremes with regard to the mood they induced in listeners, musical tempo, and complexity of structure. This would suggest that Mozart's music - with no regard to the level of induced mood, musical tempo and complexity - influences the level of arousal. It seems that modulations in the frequency domain of Mozart's sonata have the greatest influence on the reported neurophysiological activity.

Twelve female paid volunteers participated in sessions involving sleep onset, ganzfeld, and eyes-closed relaxed waking, and were repeatedly prompted for recall of their momentary mentation, according to a predefined schedule. Nineteen channel EEG, two channels EOG and EMG were recorded simultaneously. The mentation reports were followed by the subjects' ratings of their experience on a number of ordinal scales. Two-hundred and forty-one mentation reports were collected. EEG epochs immediately preceding the mentation reports were FFT-analysed and the spectra compared between states. The ganzfeld EEG spectrum, showing no signs of decreased vigilance, was very similar to the EEG spectrum of waking states, even showed a minor acceleration of alpha activity. The subjective experience data were reduced to four principal components: Factor I represented the subjective vigilance dimension, as confirmed by correlations with EEG spectral indices. Only Factor IV, the 'absorption' dimension, differentiated between the ganzfeld state (more absorption) and other states. In waking states and in ganzfeld, the subjects estimated elapsed time periods significantly shorter than in states at sleep onset. The results did not support the assumption of a hypnagogic nature of the ganzfeld imagery. Dream-like imagery can occur in various global functional states of the brain; hypnagogic and ganzfeld-induced states should be conceived as special cases of a broader class of 'hypnagoid' phenomena.

A periodicity generator is considered, which has three characteristic control parameters: the periodicity, the amplitudes or scaling factors and the pattern associated with successive periodic segments. The regular component is shown to be equivalent to an oscillator or periodicity generator whose parameters are dynamically varying and, thus, producing both amplitude- and frequency-modulation. The irregular component is devoid of such modulating behavior. Electroencephalogram signals from normal, maniac and epileptic subjects are studied, Through analytic signal-based analysis, it is shown that for the regular component, healthy brain possesses universal scaling behavior, whereas heterogeneous scaling or absence of universality is observed for the diseased brain.

Active and passive hand movements were investigated as control conditions. Significant EEG changes with respect to a pre-movement period were analyzed by calculating time-frequency maps of event-related (de-)synchronization (ERD/ERS) for 32 EEG channels recorded from sensorimotor and premotor areas. Immediately after the beginning of the FES movement, a prominent ERD was found, followed by a beta ERS similar to that observed after active or passive wrist movements. Both changes were maximal over the contralateral primary hand area. The main difference between active and stimulation-induced movements was that in the latter case no ERD was detectable prior to movement-onset. These findings suggest that the sensorimotor processing during FES involves some of the processes which are also involved in voluntary hand movements. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

The study of such ultrafast frequencies provides new insights into epileptic activities and also into physiological conditions. The realtionship between ultrafast epileptic "ripples" in the 100 to 400 Hz range (and other superfast patterns) to classical spikes may demonstrate a new landscape of paroxysmal manifestations. This might be also trite for physiological activities. Our personal experiences on ultrafast activities are based upon rats with pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. An EEG view enriched with ultrafast frequencies may lead to a rapprochement of EEG and evoked potentials since there is also an ultrafast component in EPs. The recording of the ultrafast component will gradually become a part of clinical EEG work. Joining forces with basic EEG researchers will be needed in order deepen our understanding of the significance of ultrafast activities. This is just another entrance gate into the 21st century.

In contrast, visual search experiments revealed that search for a multi-featured object takes more time than for a single-featured object. We used EEG to differentiate the effect of object-load and feature-load in a short-term memory task. We independently varied the amount of objects and features that had to be memorized. Object-load modulated P3 amplitude during encoding and induced 10 Hz oscillations during the retention interval. Feature-load modulated the P3 during retrieval. Thus, only object-load seemed to influence encoding and retention while feature-load played a crucial role during retrieval.

Subjects were nine patients with intractable epilepsy who had subdural electrodes surgically attached to the orbital (seven cases), medial (three cases), or dorsolateral (two cases) PFC, and in one case to the frontal pole. To examine spindle frequencies, fast Fourier transformation (FFT) and auto-correlation analyses were performed on the PFC ECoG and Cz EEG data, primarily on epochs of stage 2 sleep. Lower sigma band ECoG oscillations of about 12 Hz were widely distributed across all prefrontal cortical areas including the frontal limbic regions, but none of the PFC sigma frequency peaks coincided with the faster (about 14 Hz) Cz EEG sleep spindles. Combining our results with anatomical and electrophysiological facts, it is suggested that the thalamofrontal circuit involving the rostral reticular and the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus is responsible for the generation of 12 Hz frontal spindles in humans.

The compounds antagonised apomorphine-induced stereotypy with ED(50)s of 0.15 mg/kg s.c. for risperidone, 0.42 mg/kg s.c. for olanzapine and 1.3 mg/kg s.c. for clozapine. At a dose close to that required for apomorphine antagonism (0.16 mg/kg s.c.), risperidone induced only minor changes in EEG power spectral activity. At a higher dosage (0.63 mg/kg s.c.) it increased the power density in the high frequency range (9.8-18.6 Hz), characteristic of a sedative-like effect. Olanzapine and clozapine caused a dose-dependent increase in power density in all frequency bands. These effects were already present at doses (0.04 and 0.16 mg/kg s.c., respectively) 10 times below those required for apomorphine antagonism. The effects increased dose-dependently and were pronounced at the doses required for apomorphine antagonism. These results in rats are in agreement with the clinical observation that risperidone has less propensity for inducing sedation at therapeutic dose levels than olanzapine and clozapine.

Objective: Because the hypnotic actions of drugs may be more readily demonstrated under conditions of poor sleep quality, we investigated the influence of gaboxadol on postnap sleep. Methods: In a randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over study using a late afternoon nap model, we assessed the effects of a single oral dose of 20 mg gaboxadol on disturbed nighttime sleep in young, healthy subjects. Results: Comparisons of visually scored sleep parameters between baseline and placebo postnap nights showed that the nap prolonged sleep latency, decreased total sleep time and SWS and attenuated delta, theta and alpha activity in the EEG within non-REM sleep. Compared with the placebo postnap night, gaboxadol tended to shorten sleep latency, significantly decreased intermittent wakefulness, increased total sleep time and SWS and enhanced delta and theta activity in the non-REM EEG. Furthermore, gaboxadol increased subjective sleep quality. Conclusions: These data show that gaboxadol counteracts the disrupting, effects of a nap on subsequent sleep and suggest that, in addition to promoting deep sleep and sleep maintenance, gaboxadol is able to facilitate sleep initiation and thus, exhibits significant hypnotic actions under conditions in which sleep quality is experimentally reduced.

Based on nonlinear analysis of both intracranial and scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, different research groups have recently reported dynamical smooth changes in epileptic brain activity several minutes before seizure onset. Such preictal states have been detected in populations of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and, more recently, with different neocortical Partial epilepsies (NPEs). In this paper, we are particularly interested in the spatio-temporal organization of epileptogenic networks prior to seizures in neocortical epilepsies. For this, we characterize the network of two patients with NPE by means of two nonlinear measures of interdependencies. Since the synchronization of neuronal activity is an essential feature of the generation and propagation of epileptic activity, we have analyzed changes in phase synchrony between EEG time series. In order to compare the phase and amplitude dynamics, we have also studied the degree of association between pairs of signals by means of a nonlinear correlation coefficient. Recent findings have suggested changes prior to seizures in a wideband frequency range. Instead, for the examples of this study, we report a significant decrease of synchrony in the focal area several minutes before seizures (much greater than30 min in both patients) in the frequency band of 10-25 Hi mainly. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal organization of this preictal activity seems to be specifically related to this frequency band. Measures of both amplitude and phase coupling yielded similar results in narrow-band analysis. These results may open new perspectives on the mechanisms of seizure emergence as well as the organization of neocortical epileptogenic networks. The possibility of forecasting the onset of seizures has important implications for a better understanding, diagnosis and a potential treatment of the epilepsy.

However, past research has not clearly characterized how the neural dynamics varies with the delay over which auditory information must be maintained. We used electroencephalogram band power as a measure of relative neuronal synchrony during a non-verbal auditory working memory task. Comparing the working memory task with a control recognition task, the relative synchrony in bilateral theta and alpha bands was unchanged using a two second delay. However, five and ten second delays produced increases and decreases in relative synchrony, respectively. The memory task also induced greater synchronization in beta and gamma bands over the right temporal cortex during the two and five second delays. The results suggest that the cortical dynamics that underlie auditory working memory are highly dependent upon a duration-dependent encoding strategy. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Brainstem structures responsible for the pathogenesis of RBD are also implicated in cortical activation. To verify the hypothesis that electroencephalogram (EEG) activation will be impaired in RBD, we performed quantitative analyses of waking and REM sleep EEG in 15 idiopathic RBD patients and 15 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects. During wakefulness, RBD patients showed a considerably higher theta power in frontal, temporal, and occipital regions with a lower beta power in the occipital region. The dominant occipital frequency was significantly lower in RBD. During REM sleep, beta power in the occipital region was lower in RBD. This study shows for the first time an impaired cortical activation during both wakefulness and REM sleep in idiopathic RBD, despite an absence of changes on sleep architecture compared with controls. EEG slowing in these patients may represent an early sign of central nervous system dysfunction, perhaps paralleled by subclinical cognitive deficits. The topographical distribution of EEG slowing and possible pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed in light of the known association between RBD and neurodegenerative disorders.

Robust relationships between measured dynamics and cognitive or behavioral conditions are reviewed, and proposed physiological bases for EEG at cellular levels are considered. Classical EEG data are interpreted in the context of a conceptual framework that distinguishes between locally and globally dominated dynamic processes, as estimated with coherence or other measures of phase synchronization. Macroscopic (scalp) potentials generated by cortical, current sources are described at three spatial scales, taking advantage of the columnar structure of neocortex. New EEG data demonstrate that both globally coherent and locally dominated behavior can occur within the alpha band, depending on narrow band frequency, spatial measurement scale, and brain state. Quasi-stable alpha phase structures consistent with global standing waves are observed. At the same time, alpha and theta phase locking between cortical regions during mental calculations is demonstrated, consistent with neural network formation. The brain-binding problem is considered in the context of EEG dynamic behavior that generally exhibits both of these local and global aspects. But specific experimental designs and data analysis methods may severely bias physiological interpretations in either local or global directions. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

J	van Putten, MJAM				van Putten, MJAM			Proposed link rates in the human brain	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						synchronization; EEG; phase synchronization; link rate; LR	PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; COMPLEXITY; COHERENCY; THETA	There is increasing experimental evidence that neuronal synchronization is necessary for the large-scale integration of distributed neuronal activity to realize various time-dependent coherent neuronal assemblies in the brain. Phase synchronization seems a promising candidate to quantify the time-dependent, frequency specific, synchrony between simultaneously recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) signals that may partially reflect this former process. We introduce a link rate (LR) as a measure of the spatial-temporal incidence of phase synchronization and phase de-synchronization. The concept is exemplified in its application to the analysis of spontaneous phase synchronization. To this end, three scalp EEG recordings are used: a normal control, a patient suffering from epileptic seizures and a patient with diffuse brain damage due to anoxia, showing a burst-suppression EEG. In addition, the method is applied to surrogate data (white noise). We find in the normal control that LRcontrol = 13.90 +/- 0.04 (mean+/- S.E.M.), which is different from the surrogate data, where we find that LRsurr = 15.36 +/- 0.05. In the two pathological conditions, the LR is significantly and strongly reduced to LRburst = 4.52 +/- 0.05 and LRseizure = 5.40 +/- 0.08. The derived LR seems a sensitive measure to relevant changes in synchronization, as these occur in the dynamic process of generating different spatial-temporal networks, both in physiological and pathological conditions.

Such analysis can be difficult, especially when using multichannel data. Therefore, an effective method for the visualization of event-related changes in oscillatory brain activity is required. Methods: A bootstrap-based method is presented which gives time-frequency maps showing only significant changes of ERD or ERS in predetermined frequency bands. Results: Examples from an electroencephalographic study and an electrocorticographic study are shown. The results demonstrate how easily reactive channels and their spatio-temporal and frequency-specific characteristics can be identified by means of this method. Conclusions: The proposed method is a simple but effective way to visualize significant ERD/ERS patterns. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Dynamic changes in brain activity have been detected several minutes before seizure emergence in populations of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), using non-linear analysis of intracranial EEG recordings. Similar detection of a pre-ictal state has been obtained with standard scalp EEG recordings using a modified non-linear method. Here we applied this strategy to the seizures of patients with neocortical partial epilepsy. Results obtained by non-linear similarity analysis of 41 seizures from 11 patients with refractory partial epilepsy originating from various sites of the neocortex showed that (i) a pre-ictal state was detected in 90% of the patients and in 83% of the seizures whatever their location, with a mean anticipation time of 7.5 min, (ii) similar pre-ictal dynamic changes were detected when non-linear analysis methods were applied to either intracranial or scalp EEG recordings; (iii) the recording sites exhibiting these pre-ictal changes were distributed both within the epileptogenic focus and at remote locations; (iv) most pre-ictal dynamic changes were not correlated with linear changes in the frequency spectrum or with changes in the visually inspected EEG and the patients' behaviour. Hypotheses on the neuronal mechanisms underlying the pre-ictal period are discussed. The present results, together with those recently obtained in an MTLE population, suggest that changes in pre-ictal dynamics are a general phenomenon associated with seizure emergence in a wide population of patients with partial epilepsy, wherever the epileptogenic focus is located. The possibility of anticipating the onset of seizures has considerable therapeutic implications.

However, it is unclear whether EEG and ERPs are influenced by common or independent genetic factors. This study examined phenotypic and genetic correlations between EEG spectral power and P300 amplitude using data from 206 Dutch twin pairs, age 16 years. Multivariate genetic models (Cholesky decomposition) were fitted to the observed twin covariances using Mx software. In males, genetic correlations between P300 and EEG power measures were high (0.54-0.74); 30% of the total P300 variance could be explained by genetic factors influencing EEG delta power and 26% by P300-specific genetic factors (total heritability 56%). In females, 45% of P300 variance could be attributed to familial influences that were shared with the EEG. However, it was not possible to distinguish between the genetic versus shared environmental factors, consistent with previous analysis of P300 in this sample (van Beijsterveldt et al., 1998). The results suggest that a substantial proportion of genetic influences on P300 amplitude can be explained by strong heritability of slow EEG rhythms contributing to P300.

The NRT is divided up into sectors. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bilateral lesions of the NRT on sleep and sleep oscillations. Only the results concerning delta oscillations will be reported here. As a first step we produced stereotaxically placed electrolytic lesions. The rats presented continuous circling behavior with electroencephalographic (EEG) theta and delta activity and subsequent sudden death. To avoid disruption of the bundles of fibers that pass through the NRT to and from the cerebral cortex, we used the excitotoxic ibotenic acid. Given its high toxicity, we concentrated on the rostral pole of the NRT, which is believed to have powerful effects on the synchronization of oscillatory activity during sleep. Immediately after surgery, the rats fell into a deep sleep during which there was an increase in EEG slow-wave activity and no spindles. On postoperative day 2, corresponding to the destruction period, the sleep/wake cycle partially recovered, but NREM sleep was quantitatively diminished and showed abnormalities (increased latency to sleep onset, sleep fragmentation, gradual elimination of the delta rhythm). It is concluded that the rostral pole of the NRT contributes to normal and pathological EEG synchronization and the organization of sleep in rats.

EEG was recorded from 28 scalp locations as participants performed three visual discrimination tasks designed to tap into increasingly more complex operations regularly involved in the recognition of living animate objects. In addition, data from a control task involving the same stimuli, but requiring no cognitive decision or response, was included. EEG records were quantified using power spectrum measures in five frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). Results showed a significant linear increase in absolute power in the gamma band with increasing task complexity over left hemisphere frontal and occipital regions, and over right temporoparietal regions.

Reports on the effects of focal hemispheric damage on sleep EEG are rare and contradictory. Patients and Methods: Twenty patients (mean age +/- SD 53 +/- 14 years) with a first acute hemispheric stroke and no sleep apnea were studied. Stroke severity [National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)], volume (diffusion-weighted brain MRI), and short-term outcome (Rankin score) were assessed. Within the first 8 days after stroke onset, 1-3 sleep EEG recordings per patient were performed. Sleep scoring and spectral analysis were based on the central derivation of the healthy hemisphere. Data were compared with those of 10 age-matched and gender-matched hospitalized controls with no brain damage and no sleep apnea. Results: Stroke patients had higher amounts of wakefulness after sleep onset (112 +/- 53 min vs. 60 +/- 38 min, p < 0.05) and a lower sleep efficiency (76 +/- 10% vs. 86 +/- 8%, p < 0.05) than controls. Time spent in slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and total sleep time were lower in stroke patients, but differences were not significant. A positive correlation was found between the amount of SWS and stroke volume (r = 0.79). The slow-wave activity (SWA) ratio NREM sleep/wakefulness was lower in patients than in controls (p < 0.05), and correlated with NIHSS (r = -0.47). Conclusion: Acute hemispheric stroke is accompanied by alterations of sleep EEG over the healthy hemisphere that correlate with stroke volume and outcome. The increased SWA during wakefulness and SWS over the healthy hemisphere contralaterally to large strokes may reflect neuronal hypometabolism induced transhemispherically (diaschisis).

Simulation results show that: (i) the dynamic behavior of every circuit is chaotic; (ii) the synchronization of the network is incomplete; (iii) the incomplete synchronization can integrate burst firings of cortical cells into waxing-and-wanning EEG spindle waves. These results enlighten us that this kind of incomplete synchronization may integrate microscopic, electrical activities of neurons in billions into macroscopic, functional states in human brain. fn addition, the effects of coupling strength, connectional mode and noise to the synchronization are discussed.

In 17 subjects, the EEG was recorded while learning pairs of words and faces. Subjective task difficulty was rated and a control condition of mental relaxation was also run. Spontaneous EEG activity during epochs which subsequently resulted in efficient encoding was associated with upper alpha desynchronization (10-12 Hz) and theta synchronization (4-8 Hz) when compared with spontaneous EEG activity during epochs of poor recall performance. The combined measure of theta synchronization plus upper alpha desynchronization was enhanced selectively over left frontotemporal cortical regions during efficient learning of words and over right parietal cortical regions during efficient learning of faces (P < 0.001). This striking topographical dissociation between learning materials for the combined measure of theta and upper alpha EEG activity suggests that the mode of intentional learning relies essentially on an interdependent regulation of two neuronal circuits: the thalamo-cortical circuit and the hippocampo-cortical circuit.

J	Massimini, M; Rosanova, M; Mariotti, M				Massimini, M; Rosanova, M; Mariotti, M			EEG slow (similar to 1 Hz) waves are associated with nonstationarity of Thalamo-Cortical sensory processing in the sleeping human	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; MEDIAN NERVE; IN-VIVO; DELTA-WAVES; WAKE CYCLE; K-COMPLEX; OSCILLATIONS; CORTEX; NEOCORTEX; NETWORKS	Intracellular studies reveal that, during slow wave sleep (SWS), the entire cortical network can swing rhythmically between extremely different microstates, ranging from wakefulness-like network activation to functional disconnection in the space of a few hundred milliseconds. This alternation of states also involves the thalamic neurons and is reflected in the EEG by a slow (<1 Hz) oscillation. These rhythmic changes, occurring in the thalamo-cortical circuits during SWS, may have relevant, phasic effects on the transmission and processing of sensory information. However, brain reactivity to sensory stimuli, during SWS, has traditionally been studied by means of sequential averaging, a procedure that necessarily masks any short-term fluctuation of responsiveness. The aim of this study was to provide a dynamic evaluation of brain reactivity to sensory stimuli in naturally sleeping humans. To this aim, single-trial somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were grouped and averaged as a function of the phase of the ongoing sleep slow (<1 Hz) oscillation. This procedure revealed a dynamic profile of responsiveness, which was conditioned by the phase of the spontaneous sleep EEG. Overall, the amplitude of the evoked potential changed sistematically, increasing and approaching wakefulness levels along the negative slope of the EEG oscillation and decaying below SWS average levels along the positive drift. These marked and fast changes of stimulus-correlated electrical activity involved both short (N20) and long latency (P60 and P100) components of SEPs. In addition, the observed short-term response variability appeared to be centrally generated and specifically related to the evolution of the spontaneous oscillatory pattern. The present findings demonstrate that thalamo-cortical processing of sensory information is not stationary in the very short period (approximately 500 ms) during natural SWS.

In the present study, two predictions from this model (the existence of nonlinear synchronization between macroscopic field potentials and itinerant nonlinear dynamics) were investigated. The dependence of nonlinearity on the method of measuring brain activity (EEG vs. MEG) was also investigated. Dataset I consisted of 10 MEG recordings in 10 healthy subjects. Dataset II consisted of simultaneously recorded MEG (126 channels) and EEG (19 channels) in 5 healthy subjects. Nonlinear coupling was assessed with the synchronization likelihood S and dynamic itinerancy with the synchronization entropy Hs. Significance was assessed with a bootstrap procedure ("surrogate data testing"), comparing S and Hs with their distribution under the null hypothesis of stationary, linear dynamics. Significant nonlinear synchronization was detected in 14 of 15 subjects. The nonlinear dynamics were associated with a high index of itinerant behaviour. Nonlinear interdependence was significantly more apparent in MEG data than EEG. Synchronous oscillations in MEG and EEG recordings contain a significant nonlinear component that exhibits characteristics of unstable and itinerant behaviour. These findings are in line with Friston's proposal that the brain can be conceived as a large ensemble of coupled nonlinear dynamical subsystems with labile and unstable dynamics.

These K-channels play a major role in the regulation of firing properties in these neurons. We investigated whether the K.v.3.2 subunit contributes to the generation of the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG). The EEG of a frontal and occipital derivation of K.v.3.2-deficient mice and littermate controls was recorded during a 24-h baseline, 6-h sleep deprivation (SD) and subsequent 18-h recovery to assess also the effects of the K.v.3.2 subunit deficiency under physiological sleep pressure. The K.v.3.2-deficient mice had lower EEG power density in the frequencies between 3.25 and 6 Hz in nonREM (NREM) sleep and 3.25-5 Hz in REM sleep. These differences were more prominent in the frontal derivation than in the occipital derivation. The waking EEG spectrum was not affected by the deletion. In both genotypes SD induced a prominent increase in slow-wave activity in NREM sleep (mean EEG power density between 0.75 and 4.0 Hz), and a concomitant decrease in sleep fragmentation. The effects of SD did not differ significantly between the genotypes. The results indicate that K.v.3.2 channels may be involved in the generation of EEG oscillations in the high delta and low theta range in sleep. They support the notion that GABA-mediated synchronization of cortical activity contributes to the electroencephalogram. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We hypothesized that resting electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha oscillations may show relationships with attentional mechanisms and give some clues about the underlying mechanisms of pseudoneglect. We recorded resting EEGs of 41 subjects and tested them with a paper pencil line bisection task. Our results showed that line bisection scores of men (n=18) were less biased and their performance was higher compared to those of women (n=20), but these differences only approached significance. The eyes open resting EEG alpha power of women was significantly and positively correlated with their line bisection performance. In general, significant relationships were related to the left hand performance when the lines were presented in the left hemispace. Greater resting alpha power was correlated with lower absolute bisection score or, in other words, higher bisection performance. Greater alpha power also correlated with diminished leftward bisection bias (or reduced pseudoneglect). The resting EEG alpha of men was weakly associated with bisection performance. Results discussed in terms of Kinsbourne's activation-orientation theory and Basar's view on brain oscillations.

The authors hypothesize that cholinesterase inhibitors are effective mostly in patients with fluctuating cognition. Twenty-three patients affected by mild dementia with similar scores on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale evaluation were classified in a group with fluctuating cognition (n = 11) and a group of nonfluctuators (n = 12). All patients were assigned randomly to the branches of a double-blind crossover study of donepezil (DPZ), a 5 to 10-mg dose, versus vitamin E, a 2000 IU dose, for 30 days. MMSE, ADAS-cog, University of California at Los Angeles Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), quantitative EEG, P3 event-related potentials, choice reaction time variability (CRTV) were assessed at baseline and at the end of treatments. At the end of the crossover study all patients received DPZ for 6 months. The dominant EEG frequency variability, low EEG frequencies amplitude, the P3 latency and jitter, CRTV, and NPI was significantly different in the fluctuating cognition group than the nonfluctuating group at baseline (P < 0.001). Short-term DPZ administration induced a significant increase in MMSE scores, reduction of ADAS-cog and of NPI scores (P < 0.003-0.001), increase of EEG alpha activity and reductions of P3 latency and jitter, dominant frequency variability and CRTV (P < 0.009-0.001) in the fluctuating cognition group, and significant increases of MMSE scores (P = 0.03) and a decrease of P3 jitter and dominant frequency variability (P < 0.034-0.041) in the nonfluctuating group. Short-term DPZ effects differed significantly between fluctuating cognition and nonfluctuating patients (0.001). Significant effects of the 6-month observation were observed only in fluctuating cognition patients. Logistic analysis showed that P3 latency predicts the effect of DPZ (P = 0.04, P < 0.01) in the crossover study, and CRTV predicts the effect at the 6-month follow-up.

A time-frequency analysis of non-phase-locked activity in the 7-47 Hz range was performed on movement-centred EEG sweeps using wavelet filters and Gabor transforms. All three movements were accompanied by a decrease in beta activity that began contralaterally about 1.5 s prior to the onset of movement but that extended to both sides near the beginning of the movement. This decrease was followed by a rebound after the end of the movement in the ballistic and negative movements. A decrease was also seen in the alpha band during the three paradigms, which began later (I s before movement) and lasted longer. An increase in gamma activity was only seen during ballistic and sustained movements, while a decrease in gamma energy was observed during negative movements. It was concluded that changes in the beta band of the EEG before movement are related to the preparation for the movement, but an important afferent component may be present in the later changes. Gamma band activity may be just involved in the execution of the movement, related to muscle contraction.

Previous work demonstrated metabolic, physical, chemical, and electrical stimulation data supporting a role for AN in the expression of PTZ seizures. We now extend these observations through examination of neuroelectric signal indicators during seizure epochs. We show that the EEG recorded from AN is highly coherent with surface cortical (CTX) EEG during the immediate preconvulsant period and during the ictal stateough. Methods: Awake rats were continuously infused with PTZ until clonic seizures were recorded by using both subcortical AN, posterior thalamus (PT), or hippocampal (HPC) bipolar electrodes and cortical EEG. Through the signal-analysis techniques of ordinary and partial coherence, it was possible to focus selectively on signal correlations between AN and CTX (AN/CTX) by removing the effects of unaffiliated regions such as PT and HPC. Results: Coherence of PT/CTX was observed to be modest, and partial coherence of PT/CTX with the effects of AN/CTX removed did not improve the signal coherence of PT/CTX (PT/ CTX-AN). In contrast, AN/CTX coherence was observed to be high, with undiminished correlation when PT/CTX influence was removed (AN/CTX-PT). The most robust band of AN/ CTX coherence was centered around the spike-wave clonic frequency of 1-3 Hz. Partial multiple coherence-analysis techniques were used to remove the possible signal contributions from hippocampus in addition to PT. The AN/CTX coherence remained fully preserved in the low-frequency bands. Conclusions: These data provide electrophysiologic evidence supporting the special role of the anterior thalamus in the propagation of seizure activity between subcortex and cortex.

Design: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Setting: Sleep laboratory of the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics at the Clinics Hospital. Participants: 12 female outpatients with chronic primary insomnia Interventions: Zolpidem was given at a daily dose of 10 mg for 15 nights. Results: The hypnotic drug reduced steep latency and waking time after sleep onset, and increased total sleep time and sleep efficiency. Values corresponding to visually scored slow wave sleep (stage 3 and 4) showed no significant changes. Ail-night spectral analysis of the EEG revealed that power density in NREM sleep was significantly increased in the low frequency band (0.25-1.0 Hz) in the zolpidem group during the first 2-h interval. Conclusions: In agreement: with previous findings obtained in patients with chronic primary insomnia, zolpidem significantly improved sleep induction and maintenance. Moreover, zolpidem increased power density in the 0.25-1.0 Hz band during short-term and intermediate-term treatment. Nevertheless, other frequency bands in the delta range showed a relative decrease which was not statistically significant.

The investigational drug NNC-687 (NNC 01-0687/CEE 03-310) was administered to 20 healthy young men in doses of 5, 10, and 15 mg in. a double blinded, placebo controlled, crossover design. In rats, dopamine D I receptor antagonism can produce large increases in the amounts of both rapid eye-movement (REM) and non-rapid eye-movement (NREM) sleep. In this study, drug effects were most prominent in the first NREM period. D1 antagonism markedly reduced the peak-amplitude of delta EEG waves but increased their instantaneous frequency as well as enhancing the total number, incidence, and burst-duration of sleep spindles. The length of the first NREM period was increased up to 47% over baseline. Despite these large increases in NREM sleep time, the amount of delta EEG power accumulated over the first NREM period was conserved at baseline levels. We note that the sleep-EEG profile of 01 antagonism is very similar to that of GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor modulators and suggest that D1 antagonism may alter the properties of the neuronal networks which generate delta and spindle, and K-complex EEG waveforms through the upstream modulation of GABAA receptor activity.

Methods: Twenty-eight patients with TLE demonstrating exclusively unilateral temporal IEDs on routine EEGs underwent 24-h continuous recording. The entire record was visually inspected for epileptiform discharges. We used continuous EEG to assess the significance of long-term recording in detecting bilateral IEDs. Results: Twenty-two patients had left temporal IEDs; 21 had right temporal IEDs. Seventeen (61%) patients had IEDs originating from both the right and left temporal lobes. The probability of detecting bilateral independent IEDs was correlated with the duration of continuous EEG recording. There was no correlation between the number of IEDs originating from one side and the probability of detecting independent IEDs on the other side. The frequencies of IEDs were not correlated with the length of time since onset of epilepsy. Conclusions: The findings suggest that when long-term recordings are performed, the incidence of bilateral discharges in TLE is higher than previously reported in the literature and supports the view that TLE is commonly a bilateral disease.

The subiculum is the primary hippocampal formation output area and is comparatively uninvestigated neurophysiologically. We compared subicular unit activity and the subicular EEG while rats occupied a small, restricted environment and also correlated neuronal activity with the ongoing behavior of the animal. Units were separated using their electrophysiological characteristics into bursting units, regular spiking units, theta-modulated units, and fast spiking units. The bursting and regular spiking unit classes are similar to hippocampal CA1 units, whereas the fast spiking units appear to be interneurons. Bursting units were variable in their behavior: some units bursted regularly, and others bursted only occasionally. Theta-modulated units have not been described before; these were similar to regular spiking units in all respects except that they increased their firing significantly when theta oscillations were present in the simultaneous EEG record. Subicular EEG was similar to hippocampal EEG, with theta oscillations dominating "alert, moving" behaviors, while large amplitude irregular activity (LIA), which included sharp waves, predominated when theta oscillations were not present, mainly during "alert, still" and "quiet" behaviors. A relatively small proportion of subicular recordings ( approximately 32%) were phase-locked to theta; this is a smaller proportion than in areas from which the subiculum takes major inputs. The relative lack of entrainment of subicular neurons by this important intrinsic rhythm is suggestive of a limit to which theta might be capable of affecting both subicular and hippocampal information processing more generally.

Design Analysis of covariance (randomised block design) to determine the effects of treatment on eight bandwidths of the EEG frequency spectrum. Procedure Ninety-eight, 3- to 4-week-old lambs were subjected to one of seven treatments: castration, tail docking, mulesing, ear tagging, sham shearing, formalin injection (to induce lameness) and handling. EEG was recorded for 15 min before treatment, during treatment, and for 15 min after treatment. Results Consistently lower mean power values across all bandwidths of the EEG were found at the time of mulesing and docking than at handling and shearing (P < 0.01). Formalin injection resulted in lower power values than handling and shearing (P < 0.01). Castration had lower power values than handling and shearing. Similarly, for 15 min after treatment, mulesing and formalin injection had significantly lower power values than handling, shearing, ear tagging and castration (P < 0.05). Conclusion The consistent effects associated with mulesing, docking and castration compared to handling, shearing and ear tagging suggest that mulesing at both the time of treatment and during 15 min after treatment results in a response that is similar to that of induced lameness. Docking and castration result in a response at the time of treatment that is similar to induced lameness and mulesing, but during 15 min after treatment is similar to the non-noxious control treatments. However, the depressing effects on the mean power values are the reverse of that anticipated from a previously developed pain model, highlighting the need for further research to develop this technology to evaluate pain associated with husbandry procedures.

WS was computed for ERPs recorded from nine healthy subjects with three different types of stimuli, among them target stimuli in a cognitive task. A significant decrease of entropy was correlated with the responses to target stimuli (P300), thus showing that these responses correspond to a more "ordered" state than the spontaneous EEG. Furthermore, we propose the WS as a quantitative measure for such transitions between EEG ("disordered state") and ERP ("ordered state").

In particular, men usually perform better on mental rotation tasks than women. Performance on mental rotation tasks has been associated with right parietal activation levels, both during task performance and prior to performance during bass line recordings. This study examined the relations among sex, age, electroencephalogram (EEG) hemispheric activation (at the 10.5 Hz to 13.5 Hz frequency band), and 2-D mental rotation task ability. Nineteen 8-year-olds (10 boys) and 20 college students (10 men) had EEG recorded at baseline and while performing a mental rotation task. Men had a faster reaction time on the mental rotation task than women, whereas there were no differences between boys and girls. After covarying for baseline EEG power values, men exhibited more activation (lower EEG power values) than women in the parietal and posterior temporal regions, whereas boys' and girls' power values did not differ in the parietal or posterior temporal regions. Furthermore, during the baseline condition, men generally exhibited more activation (lower EEG power values) throughout all regions of the scalp. Results support the hypothesis that a change that affects both brain activation and performance on mental rotation tasks occurs sometime between childhood and adulthood.

It is recommended for testing cognitive EEG in organic mental disorders. The essence of the task situation is that it needs continuous mental work during a short period of time. The level of task difficulty must be adapted to each patient's actual mental capacity. To preserve continuity of the mental work, the level of difficulty might be changed instantly by the EEG technician in case of a longer break or multiple mistakes by the subject in the task. For analysis, artifact-free EEG sections are manually selected. Differences of pre-task and post-task EEG power spectra (ERDS) and differences of the peak and mean frequencies are calculated. Based on our initial experience on 100 ERDS tests, this method demonstrates cognitive EEG changes related to the task. Each patient's pre-task EEG serves as control data that is compared to post-task changes. Hence, confounding effects on the ERDS test are minimal, i.e., the effect of individual EEG features or those EEG signs of the disease or therapy that are independent of cognitive functions. Therefore, ERDS test results can be considered as markers of cognitive state in diverse pathological conditions. They also enable us to follow changes during the spontaneous course of mental illness or due to therapeutic interventions. Appropriate instruction of patients about the task, attention of the technician in order to preserve the patient's continuous mental work, and to insure patient compliance are very important. Further investigation is necessary for validation of the method and to build a database of tests on healthy population of different age groups and of patients with different psychiatric conditions. Standardization of the test is essential for the introduction of ERDS to the every-day routine of clinical neuropsychiatry. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

This frequency range covers the EEG bands beta 1 (12-20 Hz), beta 2 (20-30 Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz). The pharmacological profile of both spontaneous and sensory-evoked EEG potentials reveals a very strong influence on these rhythms by drugs which have direct effects on GABA, receptor-mediated synaptic transmission (general anaesthetics, sedative/hypnotics) or indirect effects on inhibitory neuronal function (opiates, ketamine). In addition, a number of experimental models of, in particular, gamma-frequency oscillations, have revealed both common denominators for oscillation generation and function, and subtle differences in network dynamics between the different frequency ranges. Powerful computer and mathematical modelling techniques based around both clinical and experimental observations have recently provided invaluable insight into the behaviour of large networks of interconnected neurons. In particular, the mechanistic profile of oscillations generated as an emergent property of such networks, and the mathematical derivation of this complex phenomenon have much to contribute to our understanding of how and why neurons oscillate. This review will provide the reader with a brief outline of the basic properties of inhibition-based oscillations in the CNS by combining research from laboratory models, large-scale neuronal network simulations, and mathematical analysis.

The selective GABAA receptor agonist gaboxadol has been shown to increase non-REM sleep and the duration of the non-REM episodes in rats and sleep efficiency in young subjects and to enhance low-frequency activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG) within non-REM sleep in both rats and humans. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we investigated the influence of an oral dose of 15 mg of gaboxadol on nocturnal sleep and hormone secretion (ACTH, cortisol, prolactin, growth hormone) in 10 healthy elderly subjects (6 women). Compared with placebo, gaboxadol did not affect endocrine activity but significantly reduced perceived sleep latency, elevated self-estimated total sleep time, and increased sleep efficiency by decreasing intermittent wakefulness and powerfully augmented low-frequency activity in the EEG within non-REM sleep. These findings indicate that gaboxadol is able to increase sleep consolidation and non-REM sleep intensity, without disrupting REM sleep, in elderly individuals and that these effects are not mediated by a modulation of hormone secretion.

Here, we describe the effects of similar tetanic stimulation in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. We found field potential oscillations in the dentate granule cell layer which shared several properties with tetanically induced oscillations in CA1, including delayed onset, duration, progressive slowing of frequency within the oscillations and sensitivity to blockers of GABA(A) receptors, NMDA receptors and metabotropic glutamate receptors. However, the mean frequency of the oscillations in the dentate is similar to100 Hz, much higher than tetanic oscillations in CA1 and, in contrast to CA1, dentate high-frequency oscillations are sensitive to antagonists of AMPA-receptors. Oscillation frequency was decreased by metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists and increased by antagonists of AMPA-receptors as well as the gap junction blocker carbenoxolone. The oscillations can be observed in the whole dentate gyros-CA3-network and are tightly correlated between the dentate gyrus and area CA3. Thus, tetanic stimulation in the dentate elicits a new pattern of network oscillations with coherence in the dentate-CA3-network which may affect the processing of afferent information in the hippocampus.

The aim of this work was to determine changes in the dynamics of sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) in cirrhotic patients without overt encephalopathy. Twenty such cirrhotic subjects included in the protocol of hepatic transplantation of our hospital were studied and compared with 20 age-matched healthy volunteers. Spectral analysis of all-night EEG was estimated by computing the fast-Fourier transform in 2-second epochs, and averaging every 60 seconds. Artifacts were off-line suppressed, sleep stages (stage 2, stage 3-4 and REM) were determined, and the EEG mean dominant frequency (MDF) was calculated in each of these stages. Results show that in cirrhotic patients, nocturnal MDF evolution discloses a clear alteration of the ultradian EEG frequency oscillations present in controls. Also, the mean value of MDF in REM episodes was larger in cirrhotics than the corresponding value in controls. Conclusions: 1) sleep EEG evidences the existence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy; 2) the spectral analysis of EEG in minimal hepatic encephalopathy showed that the changes of MDF during sleep are an early marker of cerebral dysfunction in cirrhotic patients.

There is now mounting evidence that seizures develop minutes to hours before clinical onset. This change in thinking is based on quantitative studies of long digital intracranial electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings from patients being evaluated for epilepsy surgery. Evidence that seizures can be predicted is spread over diverse sources in medical, engineering, and patent publications. Techniques used to forecast seizures include frequency-based methods, statistical analysis of EEG signals, non-linear dynamics (chaos), and intelligent engineered systems. Advances in seizure prediction promise to give rise to implantable devices able to warn of impending seizures and to trigger therapy to prevent clinical epileptic attacks. Treatments such as electrical stimulation or focal drug infusion could be given on demand and might eliminate side-effects in some patients taking antiepileptic drugs long term. Whether closed-loop seizure-prediction and treatment devices will have the profound clinical effect of their cardiological predecessors will depend on our ability to perfect these techniques. Their clinical efficacy must be validated in large-scale, prospective, controlled trials.

To relax the limitation, a multiple band-pass filter was introduced to estimate the precise course of PSDs for flash visual evoked potentials (VEPs). Signals were recorded during -200 and 600 ms using balanced noncephalic electrodes, and sampled at 1,000 Hz in 12 bits. With 1 Hz and 10 ms resolutions, PSDs were estimated between 10 and 100 Hz. Background powers at the alpha- and beta-bands were high over the posterior scalp, and powers around 200 ms were evoked at the same bands over the same region, corresponding to P110 and N165 of VEPs. Normalized PSDs showed evoked powers around 200 ms and suppressed powers following the evoked powers over the posterior scalp. The evoked powers above the 20 Hz band were not statistically significant, however, the gamma band was significantly evoked intra-individually; details in the gamma bands were varied among the subjects. Details of PSDs were complicated even for a simple task such as watching flashes; both synchronization and desynchronization occurred with different distributions and different time courses.

IPS consisted of white flickers at 10 flashes/sec, lasting 10 sec and repeated six times at 10 sec intervals. The differences between the two groups were assessed for two conditions (i.e., during photic stimulation (PS) and inter-PS). During stimulus, the absolute 9-11 Hz band power of the patient group was higher at the posterior than that at the anterior sites throughout the 10 sec periods. However, this difference between sites was not seen during the first 1 sec in the control group. During the nonstimulus period, posterior dominance of 9-11 Hz band power was prominent in the patient group throughout. In the control group, however, this difference was minor, especially during the latter half of the period. These results suggest that schizophrenic patients show fewer changes in posterior alpha activity during both stimulus and nonstimulus, and this continuity of posterior dominance may reflect hyper-arousal, which counteracts any decrease in vigilance throughout the IPS.

In mothers without affective disorders the power of oscillations in the delta, theta, and alpha I frequency bands was increased as compared to controls. Intrahemispheric EEG coherence between the left frontal and adjacent derivations in the delta and theta bands and interhemispheric coherence in the central areas was increased and decreased over the remaining cortical surface. These changes led to a significant decrease in EEG asymmetry. It is suggested that during normal postpartum the influence of the limbicodiencephalic and lower brainstem structures on the cortex is augmented and a certain kind of dominanta is formed. In mothers with postpartum depressions the EEG alpha-band power was lower than in the control and normal groups, coherence changes in the delta and theta bands diminished the EEG asymmetry. The insufficiency of limbicodiencephalic influence and impairment of adaptive brainstem reactions are suggested to be responsible for problems in the formation of maternal dominanta, which results in the development of postpartum depressions.

The data segments which contain a transition from interictal to ictal activity carry the most critical diagnostic information. Computer signal extraction within this transition period represents a challenging signal processing problem. In this work a two-step method is presented to extract early ictal activity. In the first step we employ a nonlinear signal decomposition technique in the wavelet domain to separate SEEG data into ictal and background components. In the second step we use time-frequency analysis and a novel integration algorithm to extract the desired information. Our experiments on clinically recorded data indicate that this method is highly effective allowing us to reveal important hidden features in the data which could not otherwise be observable.

Starting from recently published results about i) the behavior of inhibitory interneurons in hippocampal or neocortical networks in the generation of gamma frequency oscillations, ii) the nonuniform alteration of GABAergic inhibition in experimental epilepsy (reduced dendritic inhibition and increased somatic inhibition) and iii) the possible depression of GABA(A,fast) circuit activity by GABA(A,slow) inhibitory post-synaptic currents, this paper describes a new computational macroscopic model of EEG activity that includes a physiologically relevant fast inhibitory feedback loop. Results show that strikingly realistic activities are produced by the model when compared to real depth-EEG epileptic signals recorded with intracerebral electrodes. They show that the transition between interictal to fast ictal activity is explained, in the model, by the impairment of dendritic inhibition.

J	Scholle, S; Zwacka, G				Scholle, S; Zwacka, G			Arousals and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in children	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						obstructive sleep apnea syndrome; childhood; sleep structure; EEG arousal; movement arousal	INFANTS; THERAPY	Objective: Observations of children with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) show a restless sleep. But there is no significant disturbance of sleep macrostructure as in adult OSAS patients. It will be proved, whether the analysis of arousals permits a comprehensive characterization of this respiratory related sleep disturbance. Considering the problems in EEG-arousals detection in dependence of age and maturation we will compare the results of analysis of EEG- and movement arousals to find out a more practicable way for arousal analysis in childhood. Methods: Twenty OSAS pediatric patients (aged 3.1-14.3 years, median 7.5 years) and 20 age matched children with no OSAS (aged 3.3-13.9 years, median 7.9 years) were examined polysomnographically. Clinically confirmed OSAS patients with an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) > = 5/h TST (total sleep time) were examined during 1 whole night before treatment (diagnostic night - baseline) and after/under receiving therapy. Various polygraphic parameters to describe the macrostructure of sleep (sleep efficiency, NREM 13, REM) and the microstructure of sleep (EEG- and movement arousals) were analyzed. Furthermore the AHI. heart rate and oxygen saturation were evaluated. Results: Patients with clinically and polysomnographically confirmed OSAS had significantly more EEG (median 21.0/interquartile range 9.31 /h TST) and movement arousals (20.4/13.1 Ih TST) before therapy than after/under therapy (EEG: 9.9/6.3 /h TST: movement: 9.2/3.8/h TST). The frequency of arousals was comparable in OSAS children after/under treatment and controls (EEG: 9.0/4.2/h TST: movement 9.3/3.4/h TST). In the 3 groups there was no significant correlation between AHI and number of EEC-arousals and movement arousals. AHI was significantly higher in OSAS children in comparison to controls and treated OSAS. In contrast to adults, sleep efficiency and macrostructure of sleep were not different in controls and OSAS children with or without treatment. Also, oxygen saturation and heart rate, had the same values in controls, OSAS children and OSAS children after/under treatment. Conclusions: OSAS in children is characterized by a restless sleep, i.e, by an enhanced number of movement and EEG-arousals. The microstructure of sleep but not the macrostructure is changed. There is a high coincidence between EEG arousals and movement arousals. The evaluation of arousals especially the analysis of movement arousals is helpful to estimate treatment effect in OSAS patients. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

To study how these distributed brain regions are linked together, conventional coherence analysis serves as an important tool. In this paper, we propose time-frequency, method as an alternative for quantifying synchrony with both temporal and spectral resolution. Cross wavelet spectrum is calculated from the EEG data such that the cross wavelet magnitude spectra serves to indicate the degree of synchrony and the cross wavelet phase serves to indicate the direction of information flow between channels on different cortical regions.

These potentials are described as evoked potentials. There is another type of change in the ongoing EEG, which is time-locked but not phase-locked to an event: the EEG rhythm reactivity, also called "Event-Related Desynchronization and Synchronization" (ERD/ERS) by Pfurtscheller. These changes are often visible to the naked eye but they cannot be extracted by the averaging technique. Their quantification requires another method, which was suggested by Pfurtscheller and Aranibar in 1977. This method consists in measuring the temporal evolution of the power of EEG signal within a given frequency band before, during, and after an event. ERD corresponds to the decrease in power of an EEG rhythm related to an event. Conversely, ERS corresponds to an increase in amplitude of an EEG rhythm related to the event. ERD represents the activation of the subjacent cortical areas. ERS would partly traduce the setting at rest of the cortex; it would also be related to the somesthetics afferents inputs. This method can be applied to the study of cortical activation in many situations: memory tasks, auditory processing, attention, anticipatory behavior, and voluntary movement. Thus, a voluntary self-paced movement of the dominant hand is preceded by an ERD of mu and beta rhythms occurring respectively 2 000 and 1 500 ms before the movement onset. This ERD is recorded over the contralateral central region. It becomes bilateral at the movement onset and reaches its maximum at the movement offset. It is then followed by an ERS of the beta rhythms. We show that ERD/ERS phenomena vary with the type of movement, and that their study allows exploring the modifications of cortical excitability that are observed in Parkinson's disease and in epilepsy with focal motor seizures.

Pathological brain regions generate proportionately less high frequency (beta) activity than non-pathological regions, a phenomenon accentuated by barbiturate administration. Objectives: Previously, we reported a loss of high-frequency brain electrical response to thiopental in dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT). The current study examines whether this phenomenon may be detected in early stages of the illness. Methods, Using quantitative electroencephalography, we examined power in the 20-28 Hz band in patients with early DAT (n=7, age 71.0 +/- 3.2 years, Folstein Mini Mental State Score, MMSE 26.2 +/- 0.8). normal controls (n=8, age 74.3 +/- 3.2 years, MMSE 29.0 +/- 0.3) and subjects with moderately severe DAT (n=6, age 76.6 +/- 3.0 years, MMSE=12.5 +/- 3.7) at baseline and following an intravenous bolus of thiopental (0.5 mg/kg). Results: No significant group differences in beta power were detectable at baseline. In response to thiopental, early DAT subjects compared to controls showed a significantly smaller beta power response in the frontal region at 1-3 min postinjection. Losses were smaller than those of subjects with moderately severe DAT and demonstrated a non-linear correlation with decreases in cognitive function as assessed by the MMSE score (r(2)=0.75). Conclusion: In early stages of DAT, a barbiturate challenge may unmask abnormalities in brain electrical activity not seen at base-line. Such changes may reflect underlying cortical deafferentation.

Zaleplon was 14.3 times more potent at inhibiting [H-3]flunitrazepam binding to membrane preparations of the cerebellum than to membrane preparations of the spinal cord, The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ratio of zaleplon was 2.07. Zaleplon produced significant increases in muscimol binding similar to those of diazepam, and it was antagonized by flumazenil. Furthermore, zaleplon showed little affinity for other receptors. Spectral analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) of rabbits showed that zaleplon and 3-methyl-6-[3(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]-1,2,4,-triazolo [4,3-beta] pyridazine (CL218,872), an omega(1) receptor-selective compound (1 mg/kg, i.v., respectively), produced large increases in energy of the delta frequency band without affecting the energy of the alpha and beta frequency bands. In contrast, intravenous administration of triazolam and zopiclone increased the energy of the beta frequency band at doses of 0.1 and 2 mg/kg, respectively. In addition, the zaleplon-induced increase in the energy of the delta frequency band was antagonized by pretreatment with flumazenil (I mg/kg, i.v,), which did not affect the spontaneous EEG alone, The present results clearly demonstrate that zaleplon is a selective full agonist of the omega(1) receptor subtype, and thus, zaleplon may induce responses closely resembling the physiological pattern of slow wave steep.

An increase of local cerebral blood flow or metabolic demands has been detected in those regions. Functional integration of the neuronal circuits that subserve the task performance, based upon the identification of the oscillations and their distributed cerebral sources, has not been accomplished previously. The event-related tonic oscillations within a period of 2,000 msec after the stimulus onset and the probable neural substrate were evaluated in healthy volunteers by variable-resolution brain electrical tomography (VARETA). The WCST induced a significant increase of delta, theta, beta-2, and gamma oscillations, but decrease of alpha. Areas such as the frontal subregions, temporal, cingulate, parahippocampal, parietal, occipitotemporal cortex, and occipital poles showed modified activity during the task, with EEG spectral band selectivity as well as some overlapping among them. Frontal and temporal regions generated the delta/theta oscillations. Additionally, the occipitotemporal and parietal regions were the source of the delta activity, lacking theta activation. The parietal region also showed tonic alpha, beta-2 and gamma changes. These data imply that different processes have been simultaneously mediated during task performance. Relationships among the individual bands, the neural substrata and the specific cognitive process that support the task were established. The selectively distributed delta, theta, alpha, beta-2 and gamma oscillations reflect communication networks through variable populations of neurons, with functional relations to the working memory functions and the information processing that subserve the WCST performance.

However, these techniques cannot truthfully identify fault features when the actual behavior of the physical system is far from linear due to the change of its operating conditions, and involves nonlinearity. This paper presents a nonlinear dynamics method called complexity, which has been investigated to extract feature parameters from raw vibration signals measured from a bearing system. The results demonstrated that complexity presents a good measure for detecting machine defects.

Fifteen rats randomly received either 150 (n = 3), 200 (n = 6) or 300 mg kg(-1) (n = 6) GHB over 5 min, followed by a supramaximal dose of 450 mg kg(-1) over 5 min at the end of the experiment. Plasma concentrations were determined with HPLC. The EEG was continuously recorded and the amplitude in the 15.5-30 Hz frequency band was quantified using aperiodic analysis. The plasma concentration-time profiles were fitted to a two-compartment model with Michaelis-Menten elimination. The pharmacokinetic parameters V-max, K-m and the apparent volume of distribution (Vd) proved to be independent of the dose and the mean pooled values were V-max 2068 +/- 140 mug min(-1) kg(-1), K-m 58 +/- 16 mug mL(-1) and Vd 476 +/- 12 mL kg(-1). The EEG amplitude in the 15.5-30 Hz frequency band displayed a monophasic inhibition and the effect-plasma concentration curve showed hysteresis. This hysteresis between EEG effect and plasma concentrations was minimized by simultaneous calculation of hypothetical effect-site concentrations and fitting the effect vs effect-site concentration curve to a sigmoid inhibitory E-max model. The descriptors of this E-max model (E-max EC50, k(e,0), gamma and E-0) were independent of the dose with an equilibration half-life t1/2k(e,0) of 5.6+/-0.3 min (mean value of the pooled results of the 5-min treatment groups). To investigate the origin of this hysteresis, a dose of 600 mg kg(-1) GHB was infused over either 45 or 60 min each in three animals. The hysteresis was much less pronounced with 45 min than with 5 min and was absent with 60-min infusions. This indicated that the hysteresis was due to a distribution delay between the central compartment and the effect site. This study showed that the concentration-effect relationship of GHB could be characterized in individual rats using aperiodic analysis in the 15.5-30 Hz frequency band.

As a novelty, this "multi-modal" EEG analysis was combined with the evaluation of involuntary mirror movements, taken as an index of "bimanual competition." A main issue was whether the decision regarding the hand to be moved ("free" movements) could modulate ERD/ERS or MRPs overlying sensorimotor cortical areas typically involved in bimanual tasks. Compared to "fixed" movements, "free" movements induced the following effects: (1) more involuntary mirror movements discarded from EEG analysis; (2) stronger vertex MRPs (right motor acts); (3) a positive correlation between these potentials and the number of involuntary mirror movements; (4) gamma ERS over central areas; and (5) preponderance of postmovement beta ERS over left central area (dominant hemisphere). These results suggest that ERD/ERS and MRPs provide complementary information on the cortical processes belonging to a lateralized motor act. In this context, the results on vertex MRPs would indicate a key role of supplementary/cingulate motor areas not only for bimanual coordination but also for the control of "bimanual competition" and involuntary mirror movements.

J	Staba, RJ; Wilson, CL; Bragin, A; Fried, I; Engel, J				Staba, RJ; Wilson, CL; Bragin, A; Fried, I; Engel, J			Quantitative analysis of high-frequency oscillations (80-500 Hz) recorded in human epileptic hippocampus and entorhinal cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							DENTATE GYRUS; ELECTRICAL OSCILLATIONS; SINGLE-NEURON; SLEEP; NETWORK; EEG; GENERATION; NEOCORTEX; RIPPLES; RATS	High-frequency oscillations (100-200 Hz), termed ripples, have been identified in hippocampal (Hip) and entorhinal cortical (EC) areas of rodents and humans. In contrast, higher-frequency oscillations (250-500 Hz), termed fast ripples (FR), have been described in seizure-generating limbic areas of rodents made epileptic by intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid and observed in humans ipsilateral to areas of seizure initiation. However, quantitative studies supporting the existence of two spectrally distinct oscillatory events have not been carried out in humans nor has the preferential appearance of FR within seizure generating areas received statistical evaluation based on analysis of a large sample of oscillatory events. Interictal oscillations within the bandwidth of 80-500 Hz were detected in Hip and EC areas of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy using wideband EEG recorded during non-rapid eye-movement sleep from chronically implanted depth electrodes. Power spectral analysis showed that oscillations detected from Hip and EC areas were composed of two spectrally distinct groups. The lower-frequency ripple group was defined by a frequency of 96+/-14 Hz (median +/- width), while the higher-frequency FR group had a frequency of 262+/-59 Hz. FR oscillations were significantly shorter in duration compared with ripple oscillations (P<0.0001). In regard to the occurrence of FR and ripples in epileptic Hip and EC, the mean ratio of the number of FR to ripples generated in areas ipsilateral to seizure onset was significantly higher compared with the mean ratio of FR to ripple generation from contralateral areas (P=0.008). Furthermore, sites ipsilateral to seizure onset with hippocampal atrophy had significantly higher ratios compared with sites contralateral to both seizure onset and hippocampal atrophy (P=0.001). These data provide compelling quantitative and statistical evidence for the existence of two spectrally distinct groups of limbic oscillations that have frequency and duration characteristics similar to those previously described in epileptic rat and human Hip and EC. The strong association between FR and regions of seizure initiation supports the view that FR reflects pathological hypersynchronous events crucially associated with seizure genesis.

EEG was reorded from four points in symmetrical frontal and occipital scalp areas. The results of the non-linear analysis of the high-frequency EEG indicate the existence of the deterministic chaotic component with a high attractor correation dimension. It was significantly different from the respective values of the Gaussian noise filtered in the same frequency band. In the state of quiet wakefulness (eyes closed), the dimensions of chaotic components of the EEG in all derivations did not differ from each other. Analysis of correlation pairs between the ensembles of correation dimensions of the high-frequency EEG revealed reliable patterns of significant connections between the neocortical areas with individual features in different subjects. When the functional state of the brain was changed by hyperventilation, both the values of the correlation dimensions and the stucture of interarea connection patterns changed. We belive that the nonlinear component of high-frequency EEG is a sensitive and local characteristic of the functional state of the human brain.

One aspect of this control is thought to be a facilitation of sensory pathways in anticipation of such processing. To investigate the possible involvement of prefrontal cortex in anticipatory top-down control, we studied the statistical relations between prefrontal activity, recorded while a macaque monkey waited for presentation of a visual stimulus, and subsequent sensory and motor events. Local field potentials were simultaneously recorded from prefrontal, motor, occipital and temporal cortical sites in the left cerebral hemisphere. Spectral power and coherence analysis revealed that during stimulus anticipation three of five prefrontal sites participated in a coherent oscillatory network synchronized in the P-frequency range. Pre-stimulus network power and coherence were highly correlated with the amplitude and latency of early visual evoked potential components in visual cortical areas, and with response time. The results suggest that synchronized oscillatory networks in prefrontal cortex are involved in top-down anticipatory mechanisms that facilitate subsequent sensory processing in visual cortex. They further imply that stronger top-down control leads to larger and faster sensory responses, and a subsequently faster motor response.

It has been suggested that merging of separate features into a single percept ("binding") is associated with coherent gamma band activity across the cortical areas involved. Therefore, it would be of utmost interest to image cortico-cortical coherence in the working human brain. The frequency specificity and transient nature of these interactions requires time-sensitive tools such as magneto- or electroencephalography (MEG/EEG). Coherence between signals of sensors covering different scalp areas is commonly taken as a measure of functional coupling, However, this approach provides vague information on the actual cortical areas involved, owing to the complex relation between the active brain areas and the sensor recordings. We propose a solution to the crucial issue of proceeding beyond the MEG sensor level to estimate coherences between cortical areas. Dynamic imaging of coherent sources (DICS) uses a spatial filter to localize coherent brain regions and provides the time courses of their activity. Reference points for the computation of neural coupling may be based on brain areas of maximum power or other physiologically meaningful information, or they may be estimated starting from sensor coherences. The performance of DIGS is evaluated with simulated data and illustrated with recordings of spontaneous activity in a healthy subject and a parkinsonian patient. Methods for estimating functional connectivities between brain areas will facilitate characterization of cortical networks involved in sensory, motor, or cognitive tasks and will allow investigation of pathological connectivities in neurological disorders.

Dispersion relations and derivations of power spectral response for the models, show that a low frequency resonant mode and associated travelling wave solutions of the models' equations of state can account for the predominant 1/f spectral content of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Large scale activity in the alpha, beta, and gamma bands, is accounted for by thalamocortical interaction, under regulation by diffuse cortical excitation. System impulse responses can be used to model Event-Related Potentials. Further classes of local resonance may be generated by rapid negative feedbacks at active synapses. Activity in the gamma band around 40 Hz, associated with large amplitude oscillations of pulse density, appears at higher levels of cortical activation, and is unstable unless compensated by synaptic feedbacks. Control of cortical stability by synaptic feedbacks offers a partial account of the regulation of autonomous activity within the cortex. Synchronous oscillation occurs between concurrently excited cortical sites, and can be explained by analysis of wave motion radiating from each of the co-active sites. These models are suitable for the introduction of learning rules-most notably the coherent infomax rule. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The investigation was performed in a group of 94 term and preterm infants (28-112 weeks postconceptional age). For each neonate, one continuous two-channel EEG of 1-6 hours was recorded. The cluster analysis of different age groups was pel formed with a self-referential neural network. The network performed a nonlinear discriminant analysis; the synaptic strength of input nodes indicates the relevance of an individual EEG feature. The most relevant EEG features are given by the average amplitude in the delta and theta bands and by the relative amplitudes of beta-1/theta and beta-1/delta, respectively. The correlation between the frequency shifts and the postconceptional age agreed with measures of brain dysmaturity in healthy preterm neonates, Thus the presented trend in early EEG development demonstrates that it is possible to establish clinically relevant age dysmaturity scores.

We reported previously that Ramadan provokes a shortening in nocturnal total sleep time by 40 min, an increase in sleep latency, and a decrease in slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep duration during Ramadan. During the same study, the effects of Ramadan intermittent fasting on daytime sleepiness were also investigated in eight healthy young male subjects using a quantitative waking electroencephalograph (EEG) analysis following the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) procedure. This procedure was combined with subjective alertness and mood ratings and was conducted during four successive experimental sessions: (1) baseline (BL) 15 days before Ramadan, (2) beginning of Ramadan (R11) on the 11th day of Ramadan, (3) end of Ramadan (R25) on the 25th day of Ramadan, (4) recovery 2 weeks after Ramadan (AR). During each session, four 20-min nap opportunities (MSLTs) were given at 10:00, 12:00, 14:00 and 16:00 h and were preceded by rectal temperature readings. Nocturnal sleep was recorded before each daytime session. Subjective daytime alertness did not change in R25 but decreased in R11 at 12:00 h, and subjective mood decreased at 16:00 h, both in R11 and R25. During the MSLT, mean sleep latency decreased by an average of 2 min in R11 (especially at 10:00 and 16:00 h) and 6 min in R25 (especially at 10:00 and 12:00 h) compared with BL. There was an increase in the daily mean of waking EEG absolute power in the theta (5.5-8.5 Hz) frequency band. Significant correlations were found between sleep latency during the MSLT and the waking EEG absolute power of the fast alpha (10.5-12.5 Hz), sigma (11.5-15.5 Hz) and beta (12.5-30 Hz) frequency bands. Sleep latency was also related to rectal temperature. In conclusion, Ramadan diurnal fasting induced an increase in subjective and objective daytime sleepiness associated with changes in diurnal rectal temperature.

Power spectra from wakefulness (W), slow-wave sleep (SWS), and paradoxical sleep (PS) of Wistar rats were submitted to Principal Component Analyses (PCA) to investigate which frequencies are covariant. Three independent eigenvectors were identified for SWS: a band between 1-6, an intermediate band between 7-15, and a fast band between 16-32 Hz (90.74% of the variance); two independent eigenvectors were extracted for PS: slow frequencies between 1-6 covarying together with frequencies between 11-16 Hz, and activity between 6-10 covarying together with fast frequencies between 17-32 Hz (80.38% of the variance); four eigenvectors were obtained for W: 3-7, 8-9, 10-21 and 21-32 Hz (81.47% of the variance). Vigilance states showed significant differences in AP from 1 to 22 Hz. PCA extracted broad bands different for each vigilance state, which included the most representative EEG activities characteristic of them. These results indicate that during SWS, slow oscillations include frequencies up to 6 Hz, and spindle oscillations frequencies down to 7 Hz. No alpha frequencies were identified as an independent band. Frequencies within theta and beta were gathered in the same eigenvector during PS and in different eigenvectors during W suggesting coordinated activation of hippocampal and cortical systems during PS. These bands are consistent with the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms of sleep and wakefulness and with firing frequencies of generators of rhythmic activity obtained in cellular studies in animals.

Experimental studies indicate that normal sleep oscillations that during nREM sleep lead to the appearance of spindles and delta waves on scalp EEG might develop into paroxysmal synchronization. Spectral analysis enables the quantitative description of the dynamics of delta (Delta Activity, DA, 0.5-4.5 Hz) and sigma activity (SA, 12-16 Hz) and can be used to assess the relationship between SA, DA and epileptiform discharges (EDs) during sleep. Methods: We analyzed the EDs distribution during sleep in five children affected by CSWSS. We used a model of the evolution of power of DA and SA to which the time series of EDs could be fitted. Results: We found a high and positive correlation between EDs and SA. DA resulted negatively correlated with EDs. Conclusion: Our data suggest that neural mechanisms involved in the generation of sleep spindles facilitate EDs production in the CSWSS syndrome. Such a mechanism seems to be an age related phenomenon shared by other epileptic syndromes of childhood. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: ERD/ERS responses of the 4-6, 6-8, 8-10 and 10-12 Hz EEG frequency bands were studied in 12 children (mean age 12 years) while they performed an auditory memory task. Twelve adult subjects served as a control group. Results: The children's ERD/ERS responses differed from those of the adult's in the 4-6, 6-8 and 8-10 Hz EEG frequency bands, especially during retrieval from memory. The children's 4-6 Hz initial ERS responses were of lesser amplitude and of delayed latency as compared to those of the adults. In the 6-8 and 8-10 Hz frequency bands, especially during retrieval from memory, the children's ERD responses were of lesser magnitude than those of the adults. In the 10-12 Hz frequency band, no differences were observed between the ERD/ERS responses between the children and adults. Conclusions: Our results suggest that theta and alpha response systems might participate in auditory information processing already at this age, although not being fully developed. Memory systems involving retrieval may be the last to mature. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recently, we reported frontal gamma-band enhancement during multistable visual perception. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether changes in the gamma-band correspond to the variability of the reversal rate. Therefore, a total of 25 observers were divided into two subgroups according to their reversal rate during a 400-s observation period of a reversible pattern based on apparent motion. Subjects with more than 40 reversals within the 400-s were defined as high-rate switchers (HRS). Subjects with a reversal rate below 40 switches were defined as low-rate switchers (LRS). EEG was recorded from frontal, central, parietal, and occipital locations of both hemispheres. The results showed significantly higher gamma activity for the HRS in both phase-locked and non-phase-locked oscillations. Both subgroups showed the highest gamma amplitudes at frontal locations. The results support the involvement of attentional top-down processing in figure reversal. It is concluded that the higher gamma activity for the HRS reflects states of higher arousal, alertness and/or attention according to their fast reversal rate. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Objectives: We investigated electrical brain activity (QEEG and cognitive event related potentials, ERPs) in healthy subjects who received olanzapine. Methods: Vigilance-controlled, 19-channel EEG and ERP in an auditory odd-ball paradigm were recorded before and 3 h, 6 h and 9 h after administration of either a single dose of placebo or olanzapine (2.5 mg and 5 mg) in ten healthy subjects. QEEG was analysed by spectral analysis and evaluated in nine frequency bands. For the P300 component in the odd-ball ERP, the amplitude and latency was analysed. Statistical effects were tested using a repeated-measurement analysis of variance. Results: For the interaction between time and treatment, significant effects were observed for theta, alpha-2, beta-2 and beta-4 frequency bands. The amplitude of the activity in the theta band increased most significantly 6 li after the 5-mg administration of olanzapine. A pronounced decrease of the alpha-2 activity especially 9 h after 5 mg olanzapine administration could be observed. In most beta frequency bands, and most significantly in the beta-4 band, a dose-dependent decrease of the activity beginning 6 h after drug administration was demonstrated. Topographic effects could be observed for the beta-2 band (occipital decrease) and a tendency for the alpha-2 band (frontal increase and occipital decrease), both indicating a frontal shift of brain electrical activity. There were no significant changes in P300 amplitude or latency after drug administration. Conclusion: QEEG alterations after olanzapine administration were similar to EEG effects gained by other atypical antipsychotic drugs, such as clozapine. The increase of theta activity is comparable to the frequency distribution observed for thymoleptics or antipsychotics for which treatment-emergent somnolence is commonly observed, whereas the decrease of beta activity observed after olanzapine administration is not characteristic for these drugs. There were no clear signs for an increased cerebral excitability after a single-dose administration of 2.5 mg and 5 mg olanzapine in healthy controls.

Synchronous 20-80 Hz oscillations, so called gamma rhythms, have been proposed as a possible fundamental physiological mechanism of binding neuronal activity underlying visual object recognition. The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not gamma band oscillatory activity in the human brain is modulated by attributes of elementary visual stimulation. The experiment was performed on 7 normal subjects. Sinusoidal gratings were presented over a range of spatial frequencies. Evoked potentials were recorded over 5 surface electrodes placed in a horizontal occipital chain across the back of the head. Discrete wavelet transform was performed on the first 200 msec following stimulus onset on the average data of 256 sweeps, Power was analyzed with ANOVA across conditions. In our previous studies we have separated a "low" (14-28 Hz) and "high" (28-55 Hz) gamma band.* The current results indicate that both gamma bands to full-field stimulation have the highest power at the midline (inion) electrode to a spatial frequency of 5.5 cpd, which is the peak spatial frequency from foveal psychophysical data. However, the spatial frequency bandwidth is considerably narrower in the HG than in the LG band, Occipital spatial frequency tuning of the massed high gamma response is narrower than the tuning of individual cortical neurons. The bandwidth difference between low and high gamma band suggests that different frequency gamma range oscillations may represent not only different functional properties of visual processing, but may also reflect underlying differences in excitatory and postsynaptic inhibitory circuits shaping the contrast sensitivity of the human observer. Our study emphasizes the importance of elementary visual filter properties for gamma responses and the need to subdivide gamma frequency ranges according to functional properties.

Here we show that a deficiency in short-chain acylcoenzyme A dehydrogenase (encoded by Acads) in mice causes a marked slowing in theta frequency during paradoxical sleep only. We found Acads expression in brain regions involved in theta generation, notably the hippocampus. Microarray analysis of gene expression in mice with mutations in Acads indicates overexpression of Glo1 (encoding glyoxylase 1), a gene involved in the detoxification of metabolic by-products. Administration of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) to mutant mice significantly recovers slow theta and Glo1 overexpression. Thus, an underappreciated metabolic pathway involving fatty acid beta-oxidation also regulates theta oscillations during sleep.

It is currently being evaluated as a conceivable alternative to electroconvulsive therapy for the treatment of mood disorders. Eight healthy young (age range 21-25 years) right-handed men without sleep complaints participated in the study. Two sessions at a 1-week interval. each consisting of an adaptation night (sham stimulation) and an experimental night (rTMS in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or sham stimulation; crossover design), were scheduled. In each subject, 40 trains of 2-s duration of rTMS (inter-train interval 28 s) were applied at a frequency of 20 Hz (i.e. 1600 pulses per session) and at an intensity of 90% of the motor threshold. Stimulations were scheduled 80 min before lights off. The waking EEG was recorded for 10-min intervals similar to 30 min prior to and after the 20-min stimulations, and polysomnographic recordings were obtained during the subsequent sleep episode (23.00-07.00 h). The power spectra of two referential derivations, as well as of bipolar derivations along the antero-posterior axis over the left and right hemispheres, were analyzed. rTMS induced a small reduction of sleep stage 1 (in min and percentage of total sleep time) over the whole night and a small enhancement of sleep stage 4 during the first non-REM sleep episode. Other sleep variables were not affected. rTMS of the left dorsolateral cortex did not alter the topography of EEG power spectra in waking following stimulation, in the all-night sleep EEG, or during the first non-REM sleep episode. Our results indicate that a single session of rTMS using parameters like those used in depression treatment protocols has no detectable side effects with respect to sleep in young healthy males.

We recorded intracranial electroencephalogram from human cortical and hippocampal areas while subjects performed a short-term recognition memory task. On each trial, a series of four list items was presented followed by a memory probe. We found agreement across trials of the phase of oscillations in the 7- to 16-Hz range after randomly timed stimulus events, evidence that these events either caused a phase shift in the underlying oscillation or initiated a new oscillation. Phase locking in this frequency range was not generally associated with increased poststimulus power, suggesting that stimulus events reset the phase of ongoing oscillations. Different stimulus classes selectively modulated this phase reset effect, with topographically distinct sets of recording sites exhibiting preferential reset to either probe items or to list items. These findings implicate the reset of brain oscillations in human working memory.

Furthermore, there are only a few investigations for a pharmacodynamic model of the electroencephalographic effects of propofol in rats. We investigated pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol in rats with special regard to linearity in pharmacokinetics and development of tolerance. Methods: Twelve adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received propofol in three successive infusion periods of 30 min each with infusion rates of 0.5, 1 and 0.5 mg kg(-1) min(-1). Propofol plasma concentrations were determined from arterial blood samples. Pharmacokinetics were tested for linearity using the ratio of the concentrations at the end of the first and second infusion interval as a model independent criterion. Several linear and nonlinear models were investigated with population pharmacokinetic analysis. Pharmacodynamics were analysed using the median frequency of the electroencephalographic power spectrum as a quantitative measure of the hypnotic effect. Results: Pharmacokinetics were found to be nonlinear and were best described by a two-compartment model with Michaelis-Menten elimination (V-m = 2.17 mug mL(-1) min(-1), K-m = 2.65 mug mL(-1), k(12) = 0.30 min(-1), k(21) = 0.063 min(-1), V-c = 0.13 L). Acute tolerance to the electroencephalographic effect of propofol was observed. The hypnotic effect was best described by a sigmoid E-max model (E-o = 17.8 Hz, E-max = 17.7 Hz, EC50 = 4.1 mug mL(-1), gamma = 2.3, k(e0) = 0.36 min(-1)) with competitive antagonism of propofol and a hypothetical drug in an additional tolerance compartment. Conclusions: For the applied infusion scheme, propofol pharmacokinetics in rats were nonlinear and a development of tolerance to the electroencephalographic effect of propofol was observed during an infusion time of 90 min.

Taking this concept further, we review experiments showing that oscillatory phenomena such as alpha, theta, and delta responses to events are, just as the gamma band, strongly interwoven with sensory and cognitive functions. This review argues that selectively distributed delta, theta, alpha and gamma oscillatory systems act as resonant communication networks through large populations of neurons. Thus, oscillatory processes might play a major role in functional communication in the I,rain in relation to memory and integrative functions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We analyzed polysomnographic data in 51 infants and investigated correlations between the manifestation of apneas and changes in EEG pattern. Methods: Measurements were performed by means of the commercial polysomnographic device 'ALTCE III'. Spectral analysis of certain parts of the registered EEG was performed. Results: During apnea a reduction of the EEG amplitude was seen. The extent of the decrease differed slightly between the frequency bands. Conclusions: According to the widespread agreement that a lower voltage of electrical brain activity is a fundamental sign of waking up, we hypothesize that the observed change might be an immature type of arousal reaction.

Classically, it is said that depression is taking the mask of dementia, but very often deterioration and depression are present at the same time. Sleep EEG can help the clinician to differentiate dementia and depression in pseudo depressive dementia. Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) is a good indicator of deterioration process. We tried to improve the sleep recording and analysis and our ability to differentiate SWS in this indication. We use a portable digital recording material (Hypnotrace(R)). The signal is analysed by the association of a visual standard method to Digital Periodic Analysis (DPA) which is very sensitive to SWS. The visual analysis gives informations about the macroarchitecture of the night. The Digital Periodic Analysis gives at any moment the value of the wave frequency and thus informations about the microarchitecture. Our hypothesis is that this association helps to better recognise SWS and thus improves sleep EEG as a diagnostic tool in this indication. Methods 23 inpatients meeting both the criteria for major depression and dementia (DSM IV) have been recorded during two nights after 15 days of wash out and before antidepressant treatment. The recordings are analysed with the visual standard method and with the help of DPA. The patients are evaluated every 15 days during two months in order to define three groups based on the clinical evolution. Results - The scoring with DPA is more sensitive to Slow Wave Sleep, particularly for the patients with good clinical evolution (with the strongest depressive component). Thus, this method could be a good diagnostic tool to differentiate dementia and depression in pseudo depressive dementia.

In this study, we demonstrate that a comparable gamma-to-beta transition is seen in the human electroencephalogram (EEC) in response to novel auditory stimuli. Correlations between gamma and beta 1 activity revealed a high degree of interdependence of synchronized oscillations in these bands in the human EEC, Evoked (stimulus-locked) gamma oscillations preceded beta 1 oscillations in response to novel stimuli, suggesting that this may be analogous to the gamma-to-beta shift observed in vitro. Beta 1 oscillations were the earliest discriminatory responses to show enhancement to novel stimuli, preceding changes in the broad-band event-related potential (mismatch negativity). Later peaks of induced beta activity over the parietal cortex were always accompanied by an underlying gamma frequency oscillation as seen in vitro. A further analogy between in vitro and human recordings was that both gamma and beta oscillations habituated markedly after the initial novel stimulus presentation.

At this time, the a rhythm was thought to act as a temporal device (i.e., a timer) in information processing. Although this conception was subsequently contested, the empirical data obtained at this time and the theoretical conception derived from them may be re-evaluated in light of recent findings. Indeed, over the last 10 years electrophysiological and behavioral researches have suggested the involvement of faster rhythms in information processing. Behavioral and neurophysiological evidence for oscillations in information processing, both sensory and motor, will be reviewed. We will try to synthesize the data based on behavioral techniques, global electrophysiology (electroencephalography, local field potential, multi-unit recording), and analysis of unit activity (membrane potentials oscillations, synaptic determinants of oscillations). A tentative architecture model will be proposed. The main idea is that an internal oscillator, the role of which would be to chunk information flow in packets, paces the information processing system. This idea led us to propose the dual pacing hypothesis, according to which both the information flow and the receptivity state of neurons receiving this information are paced by the oscillator. According to this conception, oscillations would increase signal/noise ratio in processing.

In this work, data-dependent filters are designed that can help reveal obscure activity at the onset of seizures in problematic EEGs. Methods: Data-dependent filters were designed using temporal patterns common to selected segments from pre-ictal and ictal portions of the scalp EEG. Temporal patterns that accounted for more variance in the ictal segment than in the pre-ictal segment of the scalp EEG were used to form the filters. Results: Application of the filters to the scalp EEG revealed temporal components in the seizure onset in the scalp recording that were not obvious in the unfiltered EEG. Examination of the filtered EEG enabled the onset of the seizure to be recognized earlier in the recording. The utility of the filters was confirmed qualitatively by comparing the scalp recording to the intracranial. recording and quantitatively by calculating correlation coefficients between the scalp and intracranial recordings before and after filtering. Conclusion: The data-dependent approach to EEG filter design allows automatic detection of the basic frequencies present in the seizure onset. This approach is more effective than narrow band-pass filtering for eliminating artifactual and other interference that can obscure the onset of a seizure. Therefore, temporal-pattern filtering facilitates the identification of seizure onsets in challenging scalp EEGs.

The beta-1 was present during wake and REM sleep while gamma was present in all states. Recently we studied a patient (35 years M) with electrodes attached to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). This structure showed regular theta (5-6 Hz) oscillations. In the first recording, electrodes were attached to the MTL, that demonstrated the beta-1 and gamma oscillations. Two months later, electrodes were placed on orbitofrontal and ACC and an all night sleep recording was carried out. The ACC exhibited a highly regular and continuous theta oscillation during wakefulness and REM sleep, but not during NREM sleep. Since this same subject showed beta-1 oscillations in the MTL, it is probable that the theta in the ACC is independent of beta-1 in the MTL. This single case suggests the existence of two different frequency oscillators in the human limbic system. Elucidating their functional roles will be an interesting challenge for future studies.

Taking this concept further, we review experiments showing that oscillatory phenomena such as alpha, theta, or delta responses to events are strongly interwoven with sensory and cognitive functions. This review argues that selectively distributed delta, theta, alpha, and gamma oscillatory systems act as resonant communication networks through large populations of neurons. Thus, oscillatory processes might play a major role in relation with memory and integrative functions. A new 'neurons-brain' doctrine is also proposed to extend the neuron doctrine of Sherrington.

These increases in [H-3]MUS binding sites are probably due to compensatory up-regulation of GABA, receptors on pyramidal cells as a consequence of a selective loss of GABAergic interneurons in layer II of cingulate cortex. The number of [H-3]flunitrazepam binding sites was reported to be reduced in schizophrenic cingulate cortex, and this may directly reflect the loss of GABAergic interneurons. Chronic administration of clozapine to rats was reported to significantly reduce the numbers of [H-3]MUS binding sites in temporal cortex and hippocampus which may be due to selective blockade of GABA, receptors on GABAergic interneurons that make synaptic contact with pyramidal cells. Basket cells are GABAergic interneurons that make synaptic contact with pyramidal cells as well as other interneurons. Basket cells can also generate both theta and gamma oscillations. Clozapine increases the power of theta and gamma EEG. Schizophrenic patients show reduced EEG power at 40 Hz (gamma frequency) but not at lower frequencies during auditory stimulation. The GABA, receptor blocker bicuculline at 10 nM, but not 10 muM, was reported to increase the amplitude of slow oscillations (II Hz) in rat hippocampal slices. It therefore seems possible that clozapine, by selectively blocking another GABA(A) receptor, could increase the amplitude of gamma oscillations.

Previous studies in a kainic acid animal model of epilepsy revealed increased intensity of gamma rhythms in background EEG preceding epileptiform discharges, leading the authors to test for intensified gamma EEG in humans with epilepsy. Methods: 64 channel cortical EEG were recorded from 10 people with primary generalised epilepsy, 11 with partial epilepsy, and 20 controls during a quiescent mental state. Using standard methods of EEG analysis the strength of EEG rhythms (fast Fourier transformation) was quantified and the strengths of rhythms in the patient groups compared with with controls by unpaired t test at 1 Hz intervals from 1 Hz to 100 Hz. Results: In patients with generalised epilepsy, there was a threefold to sevenfold increase in power of gamma EEG between 30 Hz and 100 Hz (p<0.01). Analysis of three unmedicated patients with primary generalised epilepsies revealed an additional 10-fold narrow band increase of power around 35 Hz-40 Hz (p<0.0001). There were no corresponding changes in patients with partial epilepsy. Conclusions: Increased gamma EEG is probably a marker of the underlying ion channel or neurotransmitter receptor dysfunction in primary generalised epilepsies and may also be a pathophysiological prerequisite for the development of seizures. The finding provides a new diagnostic approach and also links the pathophysiology of generalised epilepsies to emerging concepts of neuronal correlates of consciousness.

This study investigated the influence of event-related slow-wave (SW) (0.01-2 Hz) activity in the group differences seen between children with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) of different subtypes. Methods: Time-frequency analysis techniques were applied to auditory ERP data derived from children with AD/HD predominantly inattentive type (n = 30), AD/HD combined type (n = 30) and age-matched control subjects (n = 30). Results: Event-related early frontal negative and late posterior positive SW components were reduced in the AD/HD combined type group, but not AD/HD inattentive type group, relative to controls. The RESIDUAL ERPs, which represented event-related 2-12 Hz activity, showed clinical vs. control group differences in components that were similar in both AD/HD subtype groups. Conclusions: The time-frequency results showed that event-related SW (0.1-2 Hz) activity contributes importantly to group differences between AD/HD and control children, and the pattern of group differences from controls for each of the AD/HD subtype groups, which are evident in raw ERPs. These results emphasise both the clinical and developmental importance of this form of analysis. Significance: This novel approach revealed additional specific information about stimulus processing and regional inhibition/activation in two AD/HD subtypes, relative to control subjects.

Later recalled nouns were related with increased neuronal synchronization (= cooperation) between anterior and posterior brain regions regardless of presented word category (either concrete or abstract nouns). However, theta coherence exhibited topographical differences during encoding of concrete acid abstract nouns whereby former were related with higher short-range (mainly intrahemispheric), later with higher long-range (mainly interhemispheric) coherence. Thus, theta synchronization possibly is a general phenomenon always occurring if task demand increases and more efficient information processing is required. Measurement of EEG coherence yields new information about the neuronal interaction of involved brain regions during memory encoding of different word classes.

J	Wendling, F; Bartolomei, F; Bellanger, JJ; Chauvel, P				Wendling, F; Bartolomei, F; Bellanger, JJ; Chauvel, P			Epileptic fast activity can be explained by a model of impaired GABAergic dendritic inhibition	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						dis-inhibition; gamma band activity; interneuronal circuits; intracerebral EEG	LOBE EPILEPSY; NETWORKS; HIPPOCAMPUS; DYNAMICS; RHYTHMS; NONLINEARITY; INTERNEURONS; RAT	This paper focuses on high-frequency (gamma band) EEG activity, the most characteristic electrophysiological pattern in focal seizures of human epilepsy. It starts with recent hypotheses about: (i) the behaviour of inhibitory interneurons in hippocampal or neocortical networks in the generation of gamma frequency oscillations; (ii) the nonuniform alteration of GABAergic inhibition in experimental epilepsy (reduced dendritic inhibition and increased somatic inhibition); and (iii) the possible depression of GABA(A,fast) circuit activity by GABA(A,slow) inhibitory postsynaptic currents. In particular, these hypotheses are introduced in a new computational macroscopic model of EEG activity that includes a physiologically relevant fast inhibitory feedback loop. Results show that strikingly realistic activity is produced by the model when compared to real EEG signals recorded with intracerebral electrodes. They show that, in the model, the transition from interictal to fast ictal activity is explained by the impairment of dendritic inhibition.

EEG was registered in 49 pairs of monozygotic and 45 pairs of dizygotic twins aged 7-12 months during (1) visual attention and (2) darkness. The variability of occipital alpha frequency depended mainly on genetic, probably nonadditive factors. The mean heritability for the spectral amplitudes in the delta, theta, and alpha bands were 0.37, 0.13, and 0.22 during visual attention, and 0.22, 0.40, and 0.10 during darkness. The influence of shared environment was probable for many of the EEG parameters. It was greatest for the amplitude of the theta rhythm during visual attention. The theta amplitude depended on such a parameter of early social environmental enrichment as the number of caregivers in the family. The possible relationship between infant theta rhythm and developmental outcome is discussed. For many of the EEG parameters, heritability increased during the second half of the first year of life, thus supporting the hypothesis about amplification of genetic effects and decrease of common environmental influences with age.

It is not affected by anatomical parameters such as skull thickness, which can considerably bias the commonly used slow-wave power (SWP). In our study, both of the estimators SW% and SWP were monitored throughout two nights in 22 subjects, Each subject took temazepam (a benzodiazepine) on one of the two nights, Both estimators detected the effects of age, temazepam, and time of night on sleep. Females were found to have twice the SWP of males, but no gender effect on SW% was found. This confirms earlier reports that gender affects SWP but not sleep depth. Subjectively assessed differences in sleep quality between the nights were correlated to differences in SW%, not in SWP. These results demonstrate that slow-wave microcontinuity, being based on a physiological model of sleep, reflects sleep depth more closely than SWP does.

Short-acting benzodiazepines are established to rapidly lose their hypnotic effect upon repeated administration. To investigate the tolerance potential of allopregnanolone, we assessed sleep-wake behavior in rats during subchronic treatment (once daily for five days) with placebo or 15 mg/kg allopregnanolone (n = 8 each). The sleep patterns of the placebo and allopregnanolone group did not differ significantly before and after treatment. Throughout the entire treatment period the allopregnanolone group exhibited shorter non-rapid eye movement sleep (non-REMS) latencies, prolonged REMS latencies, longer non-REMS episodes, more pre-REMS and less low-frequency, but higher spindle activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG) within non-REMS than the placebo group. The lack of tolerance effects suggests that allopregnanolone may be an efficacious modulator of sleep-wake behavior over longer time periods than most drugs targeting the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABAA receptor.

We tested whether three exonic variants of the gene encoding the human GABA(B) receptor (GABA(B)R1) modify scalp-recorded alpha-EEG voltage. One hundred twenty-eight patients suffering from alcoholism and 114 normal subjects were investigated. Alcohol-dependent patients were included because evidence exists that the frequently observed alpha low voltage in these subjects is at least partly a trait variable. Logistic regression analyses revealed no associations between alpha-EEG voltage and polymorphic variations in exon 1a1 or exon 11. A significant interaction was observed for an exon 7 substitution polymorphism and diagnosis (P = 0.009). Post hoc analyses showed an association between EEG phenotype and exon 7 genotype in normal subjects only. It is concluded that this particular association may only be observable under physiologic conditions and that alpha low voltage in alcohol-dependent subjects is under the control of either different genes or that it is related to the disease process.

J	Neville, KR; Haberly, LB				Neville, KR; Haberly, LB			Beta and gamma oscillations in the olfactory system of the urethane-anesthetized rat	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							BACKPROPAGATING ACTION-POTENTIALS; PREPYRIFORM ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY; CELL LATERAL DENDRITES; FAST-WAVE ACTIVITY; PIRIFORM CORTEX; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; PYRIFORM CORTEX; DENTATE GYRUS; EEG ACTIVITY; BULB	Fast oscillations in the beta (15-40 Hz in awake rats) and gamma (50-100 Hz) frequency ranges are prominent in field potentials induced by odorants in the mammalian olfactory bulb (OB) and piriform cortex (PC). Whereas the gamma oscillation has been studied for >50 yr, the beta oscillation has attracted attention only recently, and its origin, mechanism, and relationship to gamma are unknown. To address these questions, we have examined responses induced by odorants in the urethane-anesthetized rat-a preparation well-suited for the analysis of mechanisms. We found that both oscillations could be induced by odorants in a concentration-dependent manner. Analysis with a concentration series and spectral methods revealed that the beta and gamma oscillations were distinct and not harmonically related, indicating generation by independent mechanisms. The beta oscillation was synchronous at sites less than or equal to4 mm apart in the OB, the greatest distance tested. In contrast, the gamma oscillation was synchronous in some experiments and asynchronous in others (frequency differed slightly at different sites, resulting in progressive phase shifts). Current source-density analysis indicated that, for both oscillations, the field potentials in the OB were generated by synaptic currents in granule cells. The two oscillations were differently affected by surgical interruption of the lateral olfactory tract. This lesion abolished the beta oscillation, whereas the gamma oscillation was still induced in the OB. Our results confirm previous reports that the gamma oscillation is generated within the OB but indicate that the beta oscillation requires the participation of PC.

One of the fundamental problems encountered in memory research is how specific and complementary cortical structures interact with each other during episodic encoding and retrieval. A key aspect of the research described below was estimating the coupling of rapid transition processes (in terms of EEG description) which occur in separate cortical areas rather than estimating the routine phase-frequency synchrony in terms of correlation and coherency. It is assumed that these rapid transition processes in the EEG amplitude correspond to the "switching on/off" of brain elemental operations. By making a quantitative estimate of the EEG structural synchrony of alpha-band power between different EEG channels, it was shown that short-term memory has the emergent property of a multiregional neuronal network, and is not the product of strictly hierarchical processing based on convergence through association regions. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the dynamic temporal structure of alpha activity is strongly correlated to the dynamic structure of working memory. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Recently, RSA in humans during spatial navigation was reported, but systematic data regarding human REM sleep are lacking. Using mesio-temporal corticography with foramen ovale electrodes in epileptic patients, we report the presence of a 1.5-3-Hz synchronous rhythmic hippocampal oscillation seemingly specific to REM sleep. This oscillation is continuous during whole REM periods, is clearly observable by visual inspection, and appears in tonic and phasic REM sleep episodes equally. Quantitative analysis proved that this 1.5-3-Hz frequency band significantly differentiates REM sleep from waking and slow-wake sleep (SWS). No other frequency band proved to be significant or showed this high rhythmicity. Even in temporo-lateral surface recordings, although visually much less striking, the relative power of the 1.5-3-Hz frequency band differentiates REM sleep from other states with statistical significance. This could mean that the 1.5-3-Hz hippocampal RSA spreads over other cortical areas in humans as in other mammals. We suggest that this oscillation is the counterpart of the hippocampal theta of mammalian REM sleep, and that the 1.5-3-Hz delta EEG activity is a basic neurophysiological feature of human REM sleep.

We propose that the spatial and temporal properties of these signals during rhythmic activity are associated with the probabilistic attributes of the ionic channels. Specifically: (1) The EEG-signals present a phase relationship with the open probability of the channels that drives the rhythm, (2) The oscillatory preferences of the signals - the 'EEG spectral profile' - are determined by the location probability (concentration) of the channels. In order to test and apply the hypothesis, it is suggested to correlate open and location probabilities with changes in the structure and dynamic of water molecules, water protons and pH using novel MRI-techniques.

However, when avoiding concomitant activation of Apartial derivative-fibres, C-fibre related ultra-late LEPs are recorded. This poorly understood phenomenon was re-investigated using a method which, unlike time-domain averaging, reveals electroencephalogram (EEG) changes whether or not phase-locked to stimulus onset. Methods: CO2 laser stimuli were applied to the dorsum of the hand. Reaction-time was used to discriminate between Apartial derivative- and C-fibre mediated detections. Analyses were performed using a method based on the time-frequency wavelet transform of EEG epochs. Results: This study revealed: (1) a novel non-phase-locked component related to the activation of Apartial derivative-fibres occurring at similar latencies as the late LEP; and (2) a widespread post-stimulus event-related desynchronization (ERD) induced by both Apartial derivative- and C-fibres. Conclusions: Apartial derivative- and C-fibre related LEPs could be electrophysiological correlates of similar brain processes, which, when already engaged by Apartial derivative-fibres, cannot or do not need to be reactivated by the later arriving C-fibre afferent volley. Apartial derivative-fibre related ERD could reflect a 41 transient change of state of brain structures generating these responses. (C) 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

It is argued that the initial defect in absences lies with corticothalamic (CT) neuronal mechanisms responsible for selective attention and/or planning for action, rather than with those establishing either the states or the contents of consciousness. Normally, rich thalamocortical (TC)-CT feedback loops regulate the flow of information to the cortex and help its neurons to organize themselves in discrete assemblies, which through high-frequency (> 30 Hz) oscillations bind those distributed processes of the brain that are considered important, so that we are able to focus on what is needed from moment to moment and be aware of this fact. This ability is transiently lost in absence seizures, because large numbers of CT loops are recruited for seconds in much stronger, low-frequency (similar to3 Hz) oscillations of EPSP/IPSP sequences, which underlie electroencephalographic (EEG) spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs). These oscillations probably result from a transformation of the normal EEG rhythm of sleep spindles on an abnormal increase of cortical excitability that results in strong activation of inhibitory neurons in the cortex and in nucleus reticularis thalami. The strong general enhancement of CT feedback during SWDs may disallow the discrete feedback, which normally selects specific TC circuits for conscious perception and/or motor reaction. Such a mechanism of SWD generation allows variability in the extent to which different TC sectors are engaged in the SWD activity and thus explains the variable ability of some patients to respond during an absence, depending on the sensory modality examined.

In our study, we apply these estimators to a set of human intracranial auditory evoked potentials (AEP) in response to amplitude modulated signals, recorded on epileptic patients. After showing that these AEPs present a frequency peak at the modulation frequency (MF), we present the results obtained for a set of three time series recorded in the primary auditory cortex of one patient. From these results, we establish graphs representing causal relations at the modulation frequency for each method and show that these graphs are similar.

GBRs of 114 healthy children from 9 to 16 years were elicited in an auditory focused attention task requiring motor responding to targets, and analyzed by means of the wavelet transform (WT). The effects of age and task variables (attended side and stimulus type relevance) were examined for GBR power and phase-locking within 120 ms after stimulation. Similar to the spontaneous gamma band power, the power and phase-synchronization of GBRs did not depend on the age. However, the functional reactivity of GBRs at specific locations changed in the course of development. In 9-12-year-old children, GBRs at frontal locations were larger and better synchronized to target than to nontarget stimulus type, and were larger over the left hemisphere (contralateral to the responding hand), thus manifesting sensitivity to external stimulus features and motor task. In 13-16-year-old adolescents, GBRs at parietal sites were enhanced by active attending to the side of stimulation, thus being associated with a maintenance of attentional focus to stimulus location. The results indicate that (i) specific aspects of task-stimulus processing engage distinct spatially localized gamma networks at functionally relevant areas, and (ii) the neuronal substrates of gamma band networks and the ability to synchronize them in relation to task-specific processes are available in all age groups from 9 to 16 years. However, the mode and efficiency with which gamma networks can be entrained depends on the age. This age-dependent reactivity of GBRs to different task variables may reflect a transition in processing strategies emerging at approximately 12-13 years in relation to the maturation of cognitive and executive brain functions.

Method: We analyzed the coherence between subdurally recorded cortical electroencephalograms (EEG) and EMGs of the contralateral wrist extensor muscle during continuous isometric contraction in 8 patients with medically intractable epilepsy. Results: In all subjects, a significant coherence between the primary motor area (M1) and EMG was observed at the peal; frequency of 15 +/- 3 Hz (means +/- SD). In the primary somatosensory area (S1) of 7 subjects and the supplementary motor area proper (SMA proper) of 4 subjects, significant coherence with EMG was observed at 12 +/- 5 and 15 +/- 4 Hz, respectively. The time lags revealed by cross-correlogram were 10 +/- 3, 7 +/- 1 and 22 +/- 8 ms in the M1, S1 and SMA proper, respectively, with the EMG lagging in all areas. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the rhythmic activity in the SMA proper, as well as in the S1 and M1, is related to the generation of the rhythmicity of EMG activity.

Neurophysiological and Psychophysiological Effects of Sulpiride in the Norm and in Patients with Opiate Addiction	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						opiate addiction; sulpiride; EEG; psychophysiological testing	RECEPTORS	We studied characteristics of the EEG activity and psychophysiological indices in healthy persons and patients with opiate addiction (in the states of abstinence and remission) before and after peroral introduction of 200 mg sulpiride. In the initial state, spectral characteristics of EEG in patients with opiate addiction differed from those in the control (in healthy tested subjects) by higher relative powers of low- and high-frequency components (delta and beta waves) and a considerable depression of the alpha rhythm. Treatment with sulpiride evoked changes in the spectral characteristics of EEG, which showed a significant intergroup specificity; intensification of alpha oscillations was a general effect in all groups. We conclude that the effects of sulpiride on the EEG activity comprised components typical of both neuroleptics and antidepressants; in the group of patients in the abstinence state, the pattern of effects of sulpiride was close in its profile to the effect of anxiolytics. Dynamics of the indices of psychophysiological testing after sulpiride treatment demonstrated that the drug exerts mostly positive regulating effects on the state of higher nervous functions in patients with opiate addiction.

Relative power values (power percent) of the theta frequency band (4-7 Hz) increased and power percent of the alpha frequency band (7-13 Hz) decreased after intracranial injection of TGF-beta. The directions of these changes of EEG after intracranial injection of TGF-beta were consistent with those after exercise. The EEG pattern produced by leucine-enkephalin (Leu-enk), a typical brain peptide related to exercise, was completely different from that after exercise. The results suggested that the increase in TGF-beta concentration in the brain is, at least partly, relevant to the change of neuronal activity after exercise. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Based on adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) modeling, a derived fuzzy knowledge model is proposed for quantitatively estimating the DOA and validate it by 30 experiments using 15 dogs undergoing anesthesia with three different anesthetic regimens (propofol, isoflurane, and halothane), By eliciting fuzzy if-then rules, the model provides a way to address the DOA estimation problem by using electroencephalogram-derived parameters. The parameters include two new measures (complexity and regularity) extracted by nonlinear quantitative analyses, as well as spectral entropy. The model demonstrates good performance in discriminating awake and asleep states for three common anesthetic regimens (accuracy 90.3% for propofol, 92.7% for isoflurane, and 89.1% for halothane), real-time feasibility, and generalization ability (accuracy 85.9% across the three regimens). The proposed fuzzy knowledge model is a promising candidate as an effective tool for continuous assessment of the DOA.

This study was conducted to explore the structure of harmonic responses of EEG coherence during photic stimulation (PS) in AD. Methods: EEG interhemispheric coherence was analyzed for each harmonic responses during PS (white flickers at 5, 10 and 15 flashes/sec) in younger subjects (20-25 years), non-demented elderly subjects (50-67 years) and AD patients (43-66 years). Results: The elderly subjects had higher interhemispheric coherence during PS than the younger subjects, with significant differences found in the 6th (30 Hz) and 8th (40 Hz) harmonic responses to 5 Hz PS. The AD patients had significantly smaller coherence than the elderly subjects in the 2nd (10 Hz) and 4th (20 Hz) harmonic responses to 5 Hz PS, and in the fundamental (10 Hz) and 2nd (20 Hz) harmonic responses to 10 Hz PS. These coherence values did not correlate with duration of the disease or with cognitive functioning as evaluated by MMSE score. Conclusions: A failure of stimulation-related brain activation in AD patients was observed in alpha-related frequencies, suggesting that AD is not the end result of normal aging of the brain, at least in terms of the mechanisms which are involved in PS-related functional organization.

Old experimental results indicate that repetitive stimulation of the visual pathway evokes synchronous responses at the cortical level with a gain that depends on frequency; oscillations within relevant bands are less damped at subsequent processing levels than others. Our current results show in the cat that cortico-geniculate feedback has a build-in potentiation mechanism that operates at around the beta frequency and activates thalamic cells thus lowering the threshold for visual information transmission. We have also shown that enhanced beta activity is propagated along this feedback pathway solely during attentive visual behavior. This activity consists of 300-1,000 ms bursts that correlate in time with gamma oscillatory events. Beta-bursting activity spreads to all investigated visual centers, including the lateral posterior and pulvinar complex and higher cortical areas. Other supporting data are discussed that are concerned with the enhanced beta activity during attentive-like behavior of various species, including humans. Finally, we put forward a general hypothesis which attributes the appearance of oscillations within the alpha, beta and gamma bands to different activation states of the visual system. According to this hypothesis, alpha activity characterizes idle arousal of the system, while beta bursts shift the system to an attention state that consequently allows for gamma synchronization and perception.

J	Merica, H; Fortune, RD				Merica, H; Fortune, RD			A unique pattern of sleep structure is found to be identical at all cortical sites: a neurobiological interpretation	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article							DELTA-WAVES; SLOW-WAVE; REGIONAL DIFFERENCES; BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY; FREQUENCY BANDS; EEG; POWER; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; OSCILLATION; NEURONS	There is substantial evidence both at the cellular and at the electroencephalogram (EEG) level to support the view that the brainstem activating systems control the sleep-state (stage) progression over time that constitutes the overall sleep structure as seen at the EEG. We argue here that the brainstem therefore modulates the time-courses of spectral power in the different EEG frequency bands. These show during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep a very particular interrelationship the origin of which has received little attention and for which the neuronal transition probability model for sleep structure has proposed a physiological explanation. We advance the hypothesis that if the brainstem is modulating these time-courses then they should show a marked similarity in shape and timing at all sites. Using data from 10 healthy subjects, we measure the degree of similarity of the time-courses over each of the first four NREM episodes at the frontal, central and parietal sites, for each of the frequency bands beta, sigma and delta, and also the cortically generated slow oscillation. All the cross- correlation coefficients are high and statistically significant, indicating that the shape and timing of these time-courses are practically identical at different sites despite regional differences in their average power levels. These results tend to suggest that two processes may operate concurrently: the brainstem controls the shape and timing of the power time-courses while cortical-thalamic interaction controls their site-dependent average power.

Lower SWA amplitude was evident in the depressed group, especially among depressed men. For the most part,, significant differences between patients and control subjects were restricted to the first NREM period and only in those 20-30 years of age. Significant age-related declines in SWA amplitude were evident in control subjects but not in depressed patients. In addition, sex differences in the depressed group were twice as large as those seen in control subjects. The time course of SWA amplitude, presumed to reflect homeostatic sleep regulation of SWA, was only abnormal in depressed men with lower accumulation and slower dissipation over NREM sleep. Depressed women showed no evidence of an abnormal SWA time course. Furthermore, no sex differences in the time course of SWA were evident in control subjects, and age-related changes in this aspect of regulation were not striking in any group. Thus, the amplitude of SWA showed strong age effects in healthy individuals but not in those with MDD whereas the time course showed very subtle age effects. It was suggested that men, but not women, with MDD show impaired SWA regulation that is evident from 20 to 40 years of age. These findings provide further support that the pathophysiology of depression differs for men and women and suggest that maturational effects on SWA in depression differ from those observed in healthy individuals.

Previous work showed that large-amplitude theta frequency oscillations occurred intermittently during a maze navigation task, but it was unclear whether theta related to the spatial or working memory components of the task. To determine whether theta occurs during a nonspatial task, we made recordings while subjects performed the Sternberg working memory task. Our results show event-related theta and reveal a new phenomenon, the cognitive "gating" of a brain oscillation: at many cortical sites, the amplitude of theta oscillations increased dramatically at the start of the trial, continued through all phases of the trial, including the delay period, and decreased sharply at the end. Gating could be seen in individual trials and varying the duration of the trial systematically varied the period of gating. These results suggest that theta oscillations could have an important role in organizing multi-item working memory.

Alterations of autonomic control of cardiac activity can play an important role in sudden unexplained death in patients with epilepsy (SUDEP). However, the presence of specific changes in heart rate variability (HRV) during sleep, not correlated with seizures, has not been assessed in children with epilepsy; for this reason, we evaluated features of cardiac autonomic function during sleep without ictal epileptiform electroencephalogram (EEG) activity in a group of children with partial epilepsy. Eleven patients (five males and six females; mean age 11.5 years, SD: 3.65 years) affected by partial epilepsy were admitted to this study; 11 normal subjects (five males and six females; mean age 12.9 years, SD: 2.72 years) served as a control group. All subjects slept in the laboratory for two consecutive nights. The data were analyzed during the second night. Sleep was polygraphically recorded [including one electrocardiography (ECG) channel] and signals were digitally stored. A series of 5-min ECG epochs were chosen from each sleep stage, during periods without evident ictal epileptiform activity in the EEG. Electrocardiography signals were analyzed for automatic detection of R-waves and, subsequently, a series of time- and frequency-domain measures were calculated. Epileptic subjects tended to show an overall lower HRV in both time- and frequency-domain parameters, principally during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and, to a lesser extent, during sleep stage 2. Among the different bands, this decrease was most evident for the high-frequency band (HF) absolute power. For this reason, the ratio between the low-frequency band (LF) and HF was always higher in epileptic patients than in normal controls and the difference was statistically significant during sleep stages 3 and/or 4 and REM sleep. Our results indicate that during sleep, a particular condition of basal modification in autonomic characteristics occurs (mostly during REM sleep) in partial epilepsy patients. This finding might represent an important factor contributing to the complex mechanism of SUDEP which takes place most often during sleep and supports the need of studying HRV specifically during this state in subjects with seizures.

EEG power and coherence were calculated for the delta, theta-1, theta-2, alpha, beta-1 and beta-2 frequency bands. Compared with control subjects, SAD subjects had lower than normal EEG power in most frequency bands; asymmetrical distribution of delta, theta-1, theta-2 and alpha activity in parietal and temporal regions due to increased EEG power over the left electrode sites; and beta activity in the lateral frontal region due to increased beta power over the right electrode site. The foci of decreased EEG coherence were mainly in the right and left frontal and the right posterior regions. Remitted SAD subjects showed normalization of inter-hemispheric asymmetry in lateral frontal areas; increases of delta, theta-2, and alpha activity compared with control values; theta-1 activity in excess of control values; and disappearance of the foci of decreased coherence in anterior areas of the left hemisphere.

These beta bursts are dominant over the contralateral hand representation area, but also appear over the midcentral area overlaying the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the foot representation area. We show that the induced midcentral beta oscillations following movement-offset display not only slightly higher frequency components, but have also a significantly earlier onset. These beta oscillations arise likely from the SMA. Assuming that the short-lasting beta synchronizations at frequencies below 35 Hz after termination of a movement reflect a state of localized cortical inhibition, we propose that the induced midcentral oscillations reflect the inhibition of networks within the SMA. This assumed resetting or inhibitory process within the SMA precedes that of the networks within the primary motor hand area. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

In particular, it is now clear that electrical signaling is important, if not essential, for the generation of a wide variety of different network interactions which may underlie rhythmic activity, of cognitive relevance, seen in EEG recordings. Two types of such rhythmic activity observed in the hippocampus both in vivo and in vitro are gamma frequency (30-80 Hz) oscillations and ultrafast ( > 80 Hz) "ripple" oscillations. Several lines of work, discussed here, show that gap junction-mediated signaling plays a central role in the generation of both these types of network activity. Recent work also now suggests that a number of different, anatomically discrete, gap junction-mediated networks may exist which could both function and be modulated independently.

However, there is evidence from a genetic rat model of absence epilepsy, GAERS, that the underlying cellular and molecular abnormalities may also manifest themselves in other brain regions. As enhanced learning has previously been associated with this rat, model, we have studied extracellular amino acid levels and EEG spectra in the hippocampus of these rats, this being a brain region associated with memory and learning. We report significantly higher levels of basal extracellular glutamate within the hippocampus of GAERS, together with transient increases in citrulline and glycine following aggravation of the absence seizures with the GABA(B) agonist, (-) baclofen. Furthermore, there is a reduction in the relative power of the EEG theta frequencies in GAERS, and a slowing of the EEG following administration of (-)baclofen which is not evident in control animals. Administration of a GABA(B) antagonist, CGP 56999, at a dose which blocks absence seizures in GAERS, caused a shift to faster frequencies of the EEG in both GAERS and control rats. It is speculated that the mechanisms underlying absence seizures in GAERS may manifest themselves in other functions modulated by thalamocortical oscillations such as cognitive processing.

We propose a new synthetic measure based on time-frequency decomposition to provide detailed characterization of these dynamic changes. Methods: The matching pursuit (MP) method allows for continuous time-frequency decomposition. We have developed a derivative of the NIP method, the Gabor atom density method (GAD) that facilitates interpretation during the dynamic ictal period. The GAD analysis was applied to intracranial recordings of complex partial seizures (n = 43) of mesial temporal origin in 7 patients. Results: Complex partial seizure occurrence is systematically associated with a GAD increase of 400 +/- 150%. The GAD increase coincides with the electrographical evidence of seizure onset. The similarity between seizures in a given patient is very high with uniform onset slope, maximum level and termination pattern. Global GAD responses over all channels can reveal detailed seizure propagation patterns including secondary independent foci and secondary generalization. Conclusions: The GAD measure based on the NIP decomposition is a reliable tool to detect seizure occurrence in long-term recordings, to differentiate seizures from artifacts on a multi-channel basis and to examine patterns of seizure propagation. The reproducible GAD pattern suggests consistent changes in signal inner structure and may provide new clues about seizure dynamics and evolution. Significance: The GAD method can provide information about seizure dynamics that can contribute to methods of seizure detection. These analyses may lead to better understanding of seizure termination and help facilitate application of responsive seizure control devices in humans. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

The recent generation of the connexin-36 knock-out (Cx36 KO) mouse has offered a unique opportunity to examine this problem. Recent in vitro recordings in Cx36 KO mice suggested that Cx36 gap junction contributes to various oscillatory patterns in the theta (similar to5-10 Hz) and gamma (similar to30-80 Hz) frequency ranges and affects certain aspects of high-frequency (>100 Hz) patterns. However, the relevance of these pharmacologically induced patterns to the intact brain is not known. We recorded field potentials and unit activity in the CA1 stratum pyramidale of the hippocampus in the behaving wild-type (WT) and Cx36 KO mice. Fast-field "ripple" oscillations (140-200 Hz) were present in both WT and KO mice and did not differ significantly in power, intraepisode frequency, or probability of occurrence. Thus, fast-field oscillations either may not require electrical synapses or may be mediated by a hitherto unknown class of gap junctions. Theta oscillations, recorded during either wheel running or rapid eye movement sleep, were not different either. However, the power in the gamma frequency band and the magnitude of theta-phase modulation of gamma power were significantly decreased in KO mice compared with WT controls during wheel running. This suggests that Cx36 interneuronal gap junctions selectively contribute to gamma oscillations.

SWS was suppressed on two consecutive nights by means of acoustic stimulation. The electroencephalogram (EEG) power of baseline, deprivation and recovery nights was analysed in 1 Hz bins. During the SWS deprivation nights, large decreases of EEG power were found at frontopolar, central and parietal derivations encompassing the delta, theta and alpha range, while only slow delta (0.5-2 Hz) was affected at the frontal derivation. Recovery sleep was characterized by a generalized increase of power during non-REM sleep encompassing the delta, theta and alpha bands, with a clear antero-posterior gradient. The coherent behaviour of different EEG bands with traditionally different electrophysiological meanings during non-REM sleep suggests that, in light of the recent advances in sleep neurophysiology, a re-examination of the functional role of EEG rhythms during sleep is needed. The 'resistance' to selective SWS deprivation of the frontal area, together with its larger increase of EEG power during recovery, may be interpreted as a sign of a greater sleep need of the frontal cortical areas, confirming that some aspects of the regulatory processes of human sleep are local in nature and may show use-dependent characteristics.

The present study aims to examine the reliability of high-frequency oscillatory activity in the human electroencephalogram (EEG) across 4 sessions. Convolution of the EEG time series with Morlet wavelets yielded time-frequency representations of the signal for each session. Stability of both topography and time course of gamma-band activity (GBA) was determined for two participants performing a feature-based selective attention task in four separate sessions, spaced at weekly intervals. We found high temporal stability of non-phase-locked GBA typically occurring in time ranges between 200 and 500 ms following presentation of a stimulus, both in terms of topography and time course. Early phase-locked GBA (80-120 ms) showed higher variability with respect to topography, but was consistent in terms of time course. We conclude that measures of high-frequency oscillatory activity as used in the cognitive neurosciences meet stability requirements necessary for meaningful interpretation of this parameter of brain function.

For that purpose the EEG of 115 student-teachers (Intelligence: (M) under bar=115.17; <(SD)under bar>=12.78; IQ(min)=82; IQ(max)=136; Creativity - standardized scores: (M) under bar= 5.97; <(SD)under bar>= 0.67; C-max=38; C-max=84) was recorded while they were resting with eyes open and closed. The study showed only weak correlations between measures based on the level of activity in different areas (mean power, mean frequency and approximated entropy) and creativity. The correlations with IQ scores were even less pronounced. On the other hand, coherence measures showed a much more intense relationship both with creativity as well as with intelligence. In the eyes-open state these differences were mainly distributed over the right hemisphere. The results are discussed in the light of different theories relating brain functioning and ability.

During nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, neuronal membrane potential oscillations lead to the appearance of spindles and delta waves in the surface EEG and might develop into paroxysmal synchronization. Spectral analysis allows the quantitative description of the dynamics of delta (slow-wave activity, SWA, 0.5-4.5 Hz) and sigma activity (SA, 12.0-16.0 Hz) and can be used to assess the relation between SA, SWA, and IEDs during sleep. Methods: We performed six overnight continuous EEG-polysomnographic studies in three patients with LKS. The temporal series of SWA and SA were obtained from a spike-free derivation lead. The IEDs count was performed on the most active lead. Relations between sigma and SWA and time series of IEDs were tested by means of correlation techniques after data normalization. Results: Our results revealed a significantly higher correlation between IEDs and SA with respect to SWA in all the subjects, in total sleep time. The same analysis limited to NREM sleep highlights the better correlation between SA and IEDs. Conclusions: Our data suggest that neural mechanisms involved in the generation of sleep spindles facilitate IEDs production in LKS.

Exploring the role of alpha oscillations during externally vs. internally directed attention and the implications for idling and inhibition hypotheses	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						electroencephalogram; attention; internal attention; alpha; mental imagery; oscillations; top-down processing; inhibition	EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; IMAGERY; DEMANDS; RHYTHMS	Although slow waves of the electroencephalogram (EEG) have been associated with attentional processes, the functional significance of the alpha component in the EEG (8.1-12 Hz) remains uncertain. Conventionally, synchronisation in the alpha frequency range is taken to be a marker of cognitive inactivity, i.e. 'cortical idling'. However, it has been suggested that alpha may index the active inhibition of sensory information during internally directed attentional tasks such as mental imagery. More recently, this idea has been amended to encompass the notion of alpha synchronisation as a means of inhibition of non-task relevant cortical areas irrespective of the direction of attention. Here we test the adequacy of the one idling and two inhibition hypotheses about alpha. In two experiments we investigated the relation between alpha and internally vs. externally directed attention using mental imagery vs. sensory-intake paradigms. Results from both experiments showed a clear relationship between alpha and both attentional factors and increased task demands. At various scalp sites alpha amplitudes were greater during internally directed attention and during increased load, results incompatible with alpha reflecting cortical idling and more in keeping with suggestions of active inhibition necessary for internally driven mental operations.

Is it possible to detect oscillatory synchrony in humans, and is it relevant to behavior? There is now converging evidence for the existence of a transient oscillatory activity in the gamma range (30-60 Hz), obtained in response to static visual objects, and having only a loose temporal relationship to stimulus onset. This so-called "induced" gamma response is much larger in response to coherent static or moving objects. However, functional variations of gamma and/or beta (15-20 Hz) oscillations are not restricted to perceptive, bottom-up mechanisms, but are also observed during visual imagery or short-term memory maintenance. Oscillations at the scalp level thus seem to reflect large-scale neural cooperativity in a variety of task-dependent networks. Human intra-cranial recordings in a short-term memory paradigm further reveal the existence and the task-dependency of oscillatory synchrony in the beta range, between focal sites separated by several centimeters and with a few milliseconds time-lag. These findings thus confirm experimentally the hypothesis of a functional role of synchronized oscillatory activity in the coordination of distributed neural activity in humans, and support Hebb's concept of short-term memory maintenance by reentrant activity within the activated network. In addition, the intra-cranial data obtained in humans and monkeys also help to better understand the neural mechanisms generating scalp-recorded oscillations.

This study adds to our understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in pain by considering the relation between cortical oscillations in response to pain, with and without hypnosis and hypnotic analgesia, and the subjective experience of pain. Thirty-three subjects' neural responses (EEG) were measured during the 40-540 ms period following phasic electrical stimulations to the right hand, under control and hypnosis conditions. Resultant FFT amplitudes for frequencies ranging from 8 to 100 Hz were computed. These were grouped into 7 scalp topographies, and for each frequency, relations between these topographies and pain ratings, performance and stimulus intensity measures were assessed. Gamma activity (32-100 Hz) over prefrontal scalp sites predicted subject pain ratings in the control condition (r = 0.50, P = 0.004), and no other frequency/topography combination did. This relation was present in both high and low hypnotisable subjects and was independent of performance and stimulus intensity measures. This relation was unchanged by hypnosis in the low hypnotisable subjects but was not present in the highs during hypnosis, suggesting that hypnosis interferes with this pain/gamma relation. This study provides evidence for the role of gamma oscillations in the subjective experience of pain. Further, it is in keeping with the view that hypnosis involves the dissociation of prefrontal cortex from other neural functions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The nature of these electrical fields and how they are related to cortical areas involved in response execution remains to be clarified. Methods: As subjects performed a speeded response task the EEG was recorded with a 128-channel sensor array. By filtering out the large slow waves of the event-related potential, we found that the error-related negativity (Ne/ERN) arises from a midline frontal oscillation that alternates with oscillations over lateral sensorimotor cortex. Electrical source analyses were used to determine the brain sources involved in the generation of these oscillations. Results: The results show that the midline and lateral oscillations have a period of about 200 ms (theta), and they are present for both correct and error responses. When an error is made, the midline error oscillation is recruited strongly, and it becomes correlated with the motor oscillation. Source analyses localized the midline error oscillation to centromedial frontal cortex and the lateral oscillation to sensorimotor cortices. Conclusions: Because of the similarity between the midline oscillation observed in the present study and frontal midline theta, the nature of the Ne/ERN may be clarified by the frontal midline theta literature. The correlation between the midline and sensorimotor oscillations suggests a possible mechanism for how midline frontal evaluative and monitoring networks contribute to action regulation.

We review attention-related brain responses from auditory and visual tasks employing oddball and novelty paradigms. Dipole localization and intracranial recordings as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging reveal multiple areas involved in generating and modulating attentional brain responses. In addition, the influence of brain lesions of circumscribed areas of the human cortex onto attentional mechanisms are reviewed. While it is obvious that damaged brain tissue no longer functions properly, it has also been shown that functions of non-lesioned brain areas are impaired due to loss of modulatory influence of the lesioned area. Both early (P1 and N1) and late (P3) event-related potentials are modulated by excitatatory and inhibitory mechanisms.. Oscillatory EEG-correlates of attention in the alpha and gamma frequency range also show attentional modulation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

This helps in understanding that 'frontal theta' is a major oscillation of the human frontal cortex and has a response-controlling function; (2) it will be shown that complex stimulations such as bimodal stimulation enhances the theta response; and by bringing together the results outlined in a number of previous reviews the so-called 'selectively distributed theta system of the brain' is described.

Whether or not determinism exists in brain activities is a question that may be resolved by analysis of the dynamical properties of the electroencephalogram (EEG) or magnetoencephalogram (MEG). We will show that even though there are strong nonstationarities in most brain behaviors, small epochs of deterministic dynamics can still be observed. We will also show that the local Lyapunov exponents are measures that can demonstrate smooth transitions into these deterministic states.

During sleep, brain temperatures are in part determined by the level of brain cooling activity, which may be reflected by facial skin temperatures. In many animals, the level of brain cooling activity oscillates across the NREM-REM sleep cycle. Facial skin temperatures during sleep in patients with winter depression are abnormally low and uncorrelated with octal temperatures, although their relationship to EEG-defined sleep stages remains unknown. We therefore measured the sleep EEG, fore body and facial skin temperatures in 23 patients with winter depression and 23 healthy controls, and tested the hypothesis that ultradian oscillations in facial skin temperatures exist in humans and are abnormal in patients with winter depression. We found that facial skin temperatures oscillated significantly across the NREM-REM sleep cycle, and were again significantly lower and uncorrelated with rectal temperatures in patients with winter depression Mean slow-wave activity and NREM episode duration were significantly greater in patients with winter depression, whereas the intraepisodic dynamics of stow-wave activity were normal in patients with winter depression. These results suggest that brain cooling activity oscillates in an ultradian manner during sleep in humans and is reduced during winter depression, and provide additional support for the hypothesis that brain temperatures are elevated during winter depression.

However, the mechanisms of action underlying the effects of benzodiazepines on sleep and the sleep EEG are still unknown. Slow waves during sleep are generated by the corticothalamic system and synchronized by the inhibitory GABAergic neurons of the reticular thalamic nucleus. This region contains exclusively alpha3-containing GABA(A) receptors. We investigated the role of these receptors in the mediation of diazepam effects on the sleep EEG by studying point-mutated mice in which the alpha3-GABA(A) receptor is diazepam-insensitive [alpha3(H126R)]. Sleep was recorded for 12 h after i.p. injection of 3 mg/kg diazepam or vehicle at light onset in alpha3(H126R) and wild-type controls (n=13-17 per genotype). The main effect was a marked reduction of slow-wave activity (EEG power density in 0.75-4.00 Hz) in non-REM sleep and a concomitant increase in frequencies above 15.00 Hz in non-REM sleep and waking in both genotypes. Neither effect of diazepam differed significantly between the genotypes. Despite the exclusive expression of alpha3-containing GABA(A) receptors in the reticular thalamic nucleus, these receptors do not seem to be critical for the mediation of the effects of diazepam on the sleep EEG.

J	Blumenfeld, LD; Clementz, BA				Blumenfeld, LD; Clementz, BA			Response to the first stimulus determines reduced auditory evoked response suppression in schizophrenia: single trials analysis using MEG	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						schizophrenia; auditory evoked response; suppression; gating; magnetoencephalography; gamma band; theta	POOR P50 SUPPRESSION; TEMPORAL VARIABILITY; OSCILLATIONS; STIMULATION; DYSFUNCTION; RELATIVES; CORTEX; EEG	Objective: Reduced auditory evoked response (AER) suppression in a paired-stimulus paradigm ma phrenia. In most published studies of AER suppression, scores are based on data averaged over numerous stimulus presentations and recorded from few channels. It is unclear whether averaged data are equally representative of single trial responses in normal and schizophrenia subjects. In the present report, we used 148 channel magnetoencephalography to investigate grand-average and single trial responses on AER suppression. Methods: The typical paired-stimulus paradigm was used to evoke time-locked AERs from 20 normal and 20 schizophrenia patients. Gamma band response (GBR) and low frequency response (LFR) characteristics were measured on grand-averaged and single trial data. Generalized eigenvalue, decomposition was used to reduce the multiple channel information to a vector that accounted for the most AER variance for the GBR and LFR. Results: Group performances on grand-average and single trials were similar. A remarkable difference, which replicates previous studies, was that schizophrenia subjects had smaller LFR amplitudes in response to the first stimulus than normal. Conclusions: These findings are inconsistent with the 'poor suppression' theory often used to explain schizophrenia-normal group differences when using the paired-stimulus paradigm.

Methods: Eight male subjects underwent two randomized night studies after receiving either a placebo or 5 mg ritanserin administered in the morning. The overnight variations in the delta (0.5-4.0 Hz) and sigma (12.25-15.0 Hz) frequency bands were characterized using a peak analysis which provided a quantitative evaluation of the time-courses in EEG activity. Results: In subjects under ritanserin, slow wave sleep duration and the number of non-rapid eye movement (NREM)-REM sleep cycles were significantly enhanced (P < 0.01). The number of peaks in delta activity occurring in the normal 80-120 min range was significantly (P < 0.05) increased. Using a delta peals analysis, 4 periods containing or not a significant peak were identified in each subject. A significant increase in delta activity was observed in the areas under the averaged curves during the second and the third periods (P < 0.05), while sigma activity decreased under ritanserin during the first, second and third periods (P < 0.05). Conclusions: These results demonstrate that ritanserin increases delta activity, possibly by opposing the inhibitory control of 5-HT2 receptor family. It restores sleep ultradian rhythmicity and improves sleep quality in young poor sleepers. (c) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

A curvilinear array of 64 electrodes 3 mm apart extending 18.9 cm across the scalp was used to record EEG at 200/sec. Analytic amplitude (AA) and phase (AP) were calculated at each time step for the 64 traces in the analog pass band of 0.5-120 Hz. AP differences approximated the AP derivative (instantaneous frequency). The AP from unfiltered EEG revealed no reproducible patterns. Filtering was necessary in the beta and gamma ranges according to a technique that optimized the correlation of the AP differences with the activity band pass filtered in the alpha range. The sizes of temporal AP differences were usually within +/-0.5 radian from the average step corresponding to the center frequency of the pass band. Large AP differences were often synchronized over distances of 6 to 19 cm. An optimal pass band to detect and measure these recurring jumps in AP in the beta and gamma ranges was found by maximizing the a peak in the cospectrum of the correlation between unfiltered EEG and the band pass AP differences. Synchronized AP jumps recurred in clusters (CAP) at alpha and theta rates in resting subjects and with EMG. Cortex functions by serial changes in state. The Hilbert transform of EEG from high-density arrays can visualize these state transitions with high temporal and spatial resolution and should be useful in relating EEG to cognition.

Methods: Log transformed absolute power in the Beta 1 (12.5-16 Hz), Beta 2 (16.5-20 Hz), and Beta 3 (20.5-28 Hz) bands in the eyes-closed EEG of 307 alcohol-dependent subjects and 307 unaffected age- and gender-matched control subjects were compared using a multivariate repeated measures design. Effect of gender, age, and drinking variables was examined separately. Results: Increased Beta 1 (12.5-16 Hz) and Beta 2 (16.5-20 Hz) absolute power was observed in alcohol-dependent subjects at all loci over the scalp. The increase was most prominent in the central region. Increased Beta 3 (20.5-28 Hz) power was frontal in the alcoholics. Age and clinical variables did not influence the increase. Male alcoholics had significantly higher beta power in all three bands. In female alcoholics the increase did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: Beta power in all three bands of resting EEG is elevated in alcoholics. This feature is more prominent in male alcoholics. The increased beta power in the resting EEG may be an electrophysiological index of the imbalance in the excitation-inhibition homeostasis in the cortex. (C) 2002 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

Both types of responses were recorded with electroencephalography and studied during rest and motor behavior in eight normal subjects. During manipulation of a cube with the fingers of the right hand, the beta ERS around 20 Hz, induced by right hand median nerve stimulation, is significantly suppressed, whereas the long-latency SEP components are significantly enhanced. The results suggest that both phenomena can be interpreted as responses of different neuronal structures in sensorimotor areas. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Specifically, we wanted to find out, whether it is reduced activation and/or synchronization (phase-locking) in specific frequency bands of the ongoing EEG which is related to the decreased signal amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio in schizophrenics. Methods: We investigated 41 unmedicated schizophrenics (10 of them drug-naive) and compared them with healthy control subjects (n = 233) as well as unmedicated subjects with schizotypal personality (n = 21), who were considered to be high-risk subjects for schizophrenia, and unmedicated depressive patients (n = 71). We measured event-related activity during an acoustical choice reaction paradigm and calculated the signal-to-noise ratio, signal power and noise for a time interval of 50-200 ms after stimulus presentation. Signal-to-noise ratio was calculated from the power of the averaged trials (signal power) divided by the mean power of the single trials minus the power of the average (noise power). Also, we performed a frequency analysis of the pre- and poststimulus EEG based on a factor analytical approach. Group comparisons were performed with ANCOVA. Results: As expected, a decreased signal-to-noise ratio of evoked activity was found in the schizophrenic and a non-significant trend in the schizotypal subjects and the depressive patients. We were able to show that the observed decrease is due to a reduced signal power and an increase of absolute noise power. Frequency analysis of the evoked activity revealed that normals, schizophrenics schizotypal subjects and depressive patients increased theta/delta activity between pre- and poststimulus interval to a similar extend. However, this theta/delta-augmentation does not correlate with signal power in schizophrenics. Also, normals and depressive subjects augment coherence between both temporal lobes during information processing, which is not found in schizophrenics and schizotypal subjects. In contrast, these two groups augment frontal lobe coherence, which goes along with an increase of noise. Conclusions: Reduced stimulus-induced phase-locking and bitemporal coherence of cortically evoked activity but not a failure to activate the cortex may be responsible for the observed low signal-to-noise ratio during information processing in schizophrenics. Accordingly, schizophrenics increase noise after stimulus presentation instead of building up a signal. This is discussed in the framework of the theory of stochastic resonance.

The ET is an array of momentary values of potentials simultaneously recorded in all the derivations. An ET is characterized by a relief and mean level. Time changes in these characteristics determine a certain type of cortical STOP. Two main types of STOP were revealed. The interaction between these two types of STOP depended on the kind of performance of a subject and was reflected in the coefficient of dynamic variation (CDV) of ETs. The CDVs were significantly different in subjects with stable and unstable forms of the cognitive set; in the latter this value was higher. The spectral characteristics of the EEG and STOP dynamics were compered. Analysis of power stectra revealed the significant inter-group differences in the alphal frequency range both in the EEG and STOP; the power of this frequency range was higher in subjects with the stable set.

We have shown in the past that progressive entrainment between an epileptogenic focus and normal brain areas results to transitions of the brain from chaotic to less chaotic spatiotemporal states, the well-known epileptic seizures. The entrainment between two brain sites can be quantified by the T-index between measures of chaos (e.g., Lyapunov exponents) estimated from the brain electrical activity (EEG) at these sites. Recently, by applying optimization theory, and in particular quadratic zero-one programming, selecting the most entrained brain sites 10 minutes before seizures and subsequently tracing their entrainment backward in time over at most 2 hours, we have shown that over 90% of the seizures in five patients with multiple seizures were predictable [23]. In this communication we show that the above procedure, applied to measures of angular frequency in the state space (average rate of phase change of state) estimated from EEG data per recording brain site over time in one of our patients with 24 recorded seizures, produces very similar results about tile predictability of the epileptic seizures (87.5%). This finding implies an interrelation of the phase and chaos entrainment in the epileptic brain and may be used to refine procedures for long-term prediction of epileptic seizures as well as to generate a model of the disorder within the framework of dynamical nonlinear systems.

Saparin et al., Chaos, Solitons and Fractals 4, 1907 (1994)] and applied to several physiological time sequences, including electroencephalograms (EEGs) of patients with epilepsy. We show here that this measure is just a modified Kullback-Leibler (KL) relative entropy, and it gives similar numerical results to the standard KL entropy. The latter better distinguishes frequency contents of, e.g., seizure and background EEGs than renormalized entropy. We thus propose that renormalized entropy might not be as useful as claimed by its proponents. In passing, we also make some critical remarks about the implementation of these methods.

We examined discharges using multi-channel EEG recording and spectral analysis in rats implanted with neocortical and hippocampal electrodes after intravenous infusion of KA (10 mg/kg), until and including the first convulsive seizure. Gamma activity (30-80 Hz) increased in hippocampus from 3-9 min after KA administration. Two types of preconvulsive bilateral rhythmic discharges were observed, both consisting of generalised high voltage sharp waves at low frequencies (<10 Hz) mixed with fast oscillations (<20 Hz): (1) generalised non-convulsive discharges (GNCD) occurred in all animals and (2) spike-wave discharges (SW), predominantly localised in neocortex, occurred in 45% of animals. Convulsive seizure evolved out of a GNCD. Spectral profiles of epileptiform discharges were characterised by an increase in power of low (<10 Hz) and high (beta and gamma range, 20-80 Hz) frequencies which were differently expressed in neocortex and hippocampus. Thus, in this model of convulsive epilepsy caused by increased excitation, there is an early increase in gamma activity, a process that might contribute to synchronisation, and two distinct types of bilateral discharges, hippocampal-neocortical (GNCD) and preferentially neocortical (SW). Neocortical, not hippocampal, changes in EEG power correlated with development of convulsive behaviours. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

J	Jensen, O; Vanni, S				Jensen, O; Vanni, S			A new method to identify multiple sources of oscillatory activity from magnetoencephalographic data	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							ALPHA-RHYTHM; THETA-RHYTHM; MU RHYTHM; PERFORMANCE; ACTIVATION; MODULATION; FREQUENCY; HUMANS; MEMORY; BRAIN	Identifying the sources of oscillatory activity in the human brain is a challenging problem in current magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) research. The fluctuations in phase and amplitude of cortical oscillations preclude signal averaging over successive sections of the data without a priori assumptions. In addition, several sources at different locations often produce oscillatory activity at similar frequencies. For example, spontaneous oscillatory activity in the 8- to 13-Hz band is produced simultaneously at least in the posterior parts of the brain and bilaterally in the sensorimotor cortices. The previous approaches of identifying sources of oscillatory activity by dipole modeling of bandpass filtered data are quite laborious and require that multiple criteria are defined by an experienced user. In this work we introduce a convenient method for source localization using minimum current estimates in the frequency domain. Individual current estimates are calculated for the Fourier transforms of successive sections of continuous data. These current estimates are then averaged. The algorithm was tested on simulated and measured MEG data and compared with conventional dipole modeling. The main advantage of the proposed method is that it provides an efficient approach for simultaneous estimation of multiple sources of oscillatory activity in the same frequency band.

We developed a fully computerized classifier based on 5 minutes of EEG recording during an acoustical choice reaction time task (AMDP-module IV). We included factorized variables from the frequency domain and evoked potentials (N100/P200-complex) from central and frontal electrodes, which were preprocessed in a sample of 150 normal subjects prior to classification. We applied discriminant analyses to the electrophysiological data from depressive, schizophrenic and schizotypal subjects, most of them being unmedicated or drug-naive. The classifier was developed on a training set (33 schizophrenics, 49 normals) and tested on an independent sample (32 schizophrenics, 49 normals). A simple three-variable classifier was found to classify schizophrenics and normals in 77 % of those tested correctly. Diagnostic specificity of the das sifier proved to be low as the inclusion of depressive patients (n = 60) significantly decreased classification power. It was demonstrated that atypical but not typical neuroleptic drugs may influence the classification results. Correctly classified schizophrenics showed significantly more negative symptoms and slower reaction times than those schizophrenics who were misclassified as normals. In contrast, these misclassified schizophrenics showed a non-significant trend for more positive symptoms and shorter reaction times. As the correctly classified schizophrenics showed increased frontally pronounced delta-activity and decreased signal power of the N100/P200 amplitude, it was concluded that these schizophrenics show dysfunction of the frontal lobe. It is proposed that this new classifier can be useful for clinical and research applications when subtyping of schizophrenics with detection of frontal dysfunction as the aim.

Far 171 combinations of data from 19 electrodes, obtained from 17 subjects and 10 replicate stimuli, we calculated the difference in correlation between the response to first seeing an ambiguous figure and when the alternative percept for that figure became consciously realized (cognitively bound). Numerous statistically significant correlation differences occurred in all frequency bands tested with ambiguous-figure stimulation, but not in two kinds of control data (a reaction-time test to sound stimuli and a no-task, mind-wandering test). Statistically significant correlation changes were widespread, involving frontal, parietal, central, and occipital regions of both hemispheres. Correlation changes were evident at each of five frequency bands, ranging up to 62.5 Hz. Most of the statistically significant correlation changes were not between adjacent sites but between sires relatively distant, both ipsilateral and contralateral. Typically, these correlation changes occurred in more than one frequency band. These results suggest that cognitive binding is a distinct mental state that is reliably induced by ambiguous-figure perception tasks. Coherent oscillations at multiple frequencies may re fleet the mechanism by which such binding occurs. Moreover, different coherent frequencies may mediate different components of the total cognitive-binding process. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

The aim was to verify if some ongoing changes in the excitability of the cortical nerve cells across the daytime could facilitate the sensorimotor processing. EEG recordings and performance results for the Four Choice Reaction Time Test (FCRTT) were obtained every two hours, from morning to late evening period, in 8 young normal subjects (21.3 +/- 0.5 years). ANOVAs were used to verify the presence of diurnal variations in the two measures. Nonparametric correlations were obtained to test the similarity between the changes across the day in the two measures. Three EEG frequency bands (delta, sigma, and betal) and the reaction time measures varied across the daytime. The changes in the sigma (12.00-13.75 Hz) and the betal (14.00-19.75 Hz) bands were similar to the diurnal variations in the reaction time measures. It is suggested that the changes in the sigma and the beta I bands may facilitate the processing of the sensorimotor treatment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

There were no significant differences in the conventional sleep parameters between de novo patients with PD and a healthy control group, but the length of stage I sleep and the number of awakenings increased significantly upon administration of dopaminergic drugs. Analyzing the quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG), we observed a significant reduction in the low-delta frequency range and a nonsignificant increase in the sigma frequency range in de novo patients with PD. The dopaminergic medication also nonsignificantly reduced the low-delta and sigma frequencies, the latter to the level of the controls. Possible mechanisms that may account for the observed differences are discussed. It is suggested that Parkinson's disease as well as the application of dopaminergic drugs exerts a desynchronizing effect on the sleep EEG that is reflected in a disruption of sleep continuity.

Methods: Seventeen healthy individuals belonging to a single fatal familial insomnia pedigree, 8 carriers and 9 non-carriers of the PRNP codon 178 mutation, underwent polysomnography and spectral electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis. All were also characterized with regard to the codon 129 polymorphism on both PRNP alleles. Results: PRNP codon 129 polymorphism exhibited influences on sleep-EEG activities. In particular, spindle frequency band power and balance between delta and spindle activity were found to correlate with the genotype of PRNP codon 129, irrespective of the mutation at codon 178. Conclusions: Our data suggest that PRNP codon 129 polymorphism may also affect sleep in the healthy population and warrant further studies in the general population and other sleep disorders.

Six subjects constituted the younger (mean age = 36.6 years) and another six the older age group (mean age = 47.6 years). Subjects performed a visual discrimination task which required a response to Kanizsa squares (targets) among Kanizsa-triangles and non-Kanizsa figures. The ERPs of the younger group revealed a significantly larger N170 amplitude. The amplitudes of evoked alpha- and gamma-band activity were also found to be significantly higher in the younger group.

The LTP induction increased the evoked PFC gamma-band EEG power (40-100 Hz) to 120-135% at 500-700 ms after test stimulation. A simple increment of stimulus intensity, instead of LTP induction, did not reveal this evoked increase. Neither LTP induction nor the intensity increment changed significantly the magnitude of an evoked decrease at around 100 ms or the spontaneous prestimulation gamma-band power. These results indicate that LTP in PFC specifically increases the evoked gamma-band EEG power, which may reflect a phasic mode of plastic neurotransmission through the hippocampo-PFC pathway in vivo.

We studied clinically and electrophysiologically these movements in 11 consecutive patients with pMSA. No abnormal movements were observed when the patients were at complete rest, except for a characteristic parkinsonian "pill-rolling" tremor in one patient. Abnormal small-amplitude, nonrhythmic movements involving just one or a few fingers, or more rarely the whole hand, were observed in nine patients when holding a posture or at the beginning of an action. Accelerometric recordings showed small-amplitude irregular oscillations which, contrary to those of patients with tremor, had no predominant peak in the Fast Fourier frequency spectrum analysis. Electromyographic recordings in the forearm and hand muscles showed brief jerks of less than 100 ms duration which were synchronous in antagonist muscles of the forearm and alternated with brief periods of silence. Electrical stimulation of the digital nerves evoked consistent reflex responses in the wrist flexor and extensor muscles at a latency of 55.3 +/- 4.1 ms (range, 50-63 ms). Routine electroencephalographic (EEG) and somatosensory evoked potentials to median nerve stimulation were normal. Back-averaging of the EEG activity time-locked to the jerks was performed in two patients with no evidence of abnormal cortical activity. Two patients had episodes of transient respiratory failure related to pneumonia. This caused a long-lasting enhancement of the abnormal hand and finger movements, which became larger and more widespread, with features of posthypoxic myoclonus. We conclude that the abnormal hand and finger movements of patients with pMSA are st form of postural and action myoclonus, and can be described as minipolymyoclonus.

The psychotropic effects of these substances embrace a diversity of functions in humans, such as the capacity to attend to, and respond with readiness, to the environmental stimulus; besides it affects the capacity to estimate time. The nature of these dysfunctions in not known with precision, but by means of visual and computerized analysis of the cerebral electrical activity in humans, either spontaneous or provoked, it allows to obtain a better characterization of this modifications. It offers also an alternative approach that explains the mechanisms underlying the psychotropic nature of the volatile organic compounds. This combination of substances (which can be found in a large percentage of several industrial products), is consumed by inhalers. Recent evidence that could add some technological and scientific advances regarding quite well controlled studies, to assess the psychotropic effects of volatile solvents is lacking. Toluene induced electrographic and behavioral changes that were similar to the absence seizures, and benzene induced changes there were similar to partial seizure in humans, followed by generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Often, in humans the effects of inhalation last for several hours. As a result of this problem, we have proposed to investigate the effects that the inhalation of industrial volatile organic compounds have upon the electroencephalogram (EEG) of the human being (evaluated polisomnographicaly and during the execution of a series of tasks in psychophysiolgical attention test) and associate them with the psychotropicity of these substances. This study reports the results of sleep register studies during the night in a group of 24 young addicts, five women and 19 men, with an average age of 21.5 years. Nine of them were younger than 18 years. All of them were detected by the foundation "Ama la Vida" which is a center against addictions. The group included 24 young controls (four women and twenty men), with an average age of 23.5 years. All subjects were submitted to two sleep individual register nights after an "habituation" night, in the same room and bed. The polysomnogram was normal in five subjects (20.8%). Insomnia alone was evident in six (25%). Myoclonus with motor activity insomnia was observed in eleven subjects (45.8%), and seizures in two subjects (8.3%). A 31 years old subject with an addiction record of 19 years, and another subject, 2 19 years old woman, had been both inhaling solvents and consuming drugs for over year, including cocaine. Both presented repeated spike with a frequency of three per second, and wave shape discharges. An increase in total time of wake and delta sleep was observed in addict subjects, as well as a significant decrease of slow wave sleep II and rapid eye movement sleep. All these polisomnographic sleep changes were also analyzed in the evolution time by the spectral 3D graphic which has the capacity to evaluate non stationary rhythms, like sleep spindles at 14-16 Hz. The average reaction time (RT) in the addicts group was of 419.9 +/- 114.7 milliseconds, while in the control group was of 277.6 +/- 94.2 milliseconds. The different features characteristic of the EEG and the behavior caused by the neurotoxic action of the organic solvent inhalation, are shown in this study. A slowness of the EEG and the presence of spikes in the temporal lobe were observed, insomnia, hipermotility and an increase in the latency of reaction time were noticed in the behavior. The alterations on the EEG are due to arise in the inhibitory processes as a response to the excitation. The epileptiform activity is induced by the sensitization of the central nervous system by the frequent use of solvents. Insomnia is due to the deficiency in serotoninergic transmission of the preoptic area. And hipermotility and the increase in the response time are due to a deficiency in the neurotransmission (dopamine and serotonin) of the areas that control motor activity and attention.

J	Medvedev, AV				Medvedev, AV			Epileptiform spikes desynchronize and diminish fast (gamma) activity of the brain - An "anti-binding" mechanism?	BRAIN RESEARCH BULLETIN			English	Article						EEG; gamma oscillations; temporal binding; epileptogenesis; kainic acid	CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY-OSCILLATION; RAT; SEIZURES; EEG; HIPPOCAMPUS; EPILEPSY; NETWORKS	Fast (20-100Hz) rhythms of electrical activity of the brain have been suggested to be important for perception and cognition providing a mechanism for temporal binding of neural activities underlying mental representations. Also, fast rhythms often precede epileptiform discharges in patients and some experimental models. Generalized slow (2-3Hz) spike activity after systemic kainic acid (KA) in the rat has been shown to be preceded by intense gamma activity. A relationship between the intensified gamma rhythms and the subsequent spike activity was studied during kainate-induced acute epileptogenesis. Power, multiple coherence and phase were analyzed at frequencies 1-100Hz in the EEG recorded from the hippocampal-neocortical structures of the rat. Gamma rhythms, extremely intense and highly coherent at the onset of discharges! were followed by a slow rhythm of epileptiform spikes/sharp waves. During this spike activity and immediately afterwards, the gamma power and coherence were significantly decreased. These data show an antagonism between gamma rhythms and spike activity and ability of the latter to desynchronize and suppress the former. They are supportive to the hypothesis that epileptiform spike activity may result from the extreme activation of the "anti-binding" mechanism controlling temporal binding at high frequencies. It is suggested that when fast activity is abnormally intensified, "over-binding" with global synchrony of gamma rhythms can occur in the neural networks. It may lead to inadequate synaptic modifications. To prevent this process, epileptiform discharge develops as a protective mechanism suppressing fast activity. This proposal has implications for our understanding of temporal binding in the brain and how its excessive activation may precipitate the development of pathological states.

The results showed a high degree of biopotential synchronisation between definite cortical areas during cognitive processes in normal subjects and have evidenced significant functional connectivity disturbances in schizophrenia in this EEG frequency domain.

Phenomenologically similar gamma-->beta oscillations can be evoked in hippocampal slices by strong two-site tetanic stimulation. Weaker stimulation leads only to two-site synchronized gamma. In vitro oscillations have memory-like features: (1) EPSPs increase during gamma-->beta; (2) after a strong one-site stimulus, two-site stimulation produces desynchronized gamma; and (3) a single synchronized gamma-->beta epoch allows a subsequent weak stimulus to induce synchronized gamma-->beta. Features 2 and 3 last >50 min and so are unlikely to be caused by presynaptic effects. A previous model replicated the gamma-->beta transition when it was assumed that K+ conductance(s) increases and there is an ad hoc increase in pyramidal EPSCs. Here, we have refined the model, so that both pyramidal-->pyramidal and pyramidal-->interneuron synapses are modifiable. This model, in a self-organized way, replicates the gamma-->beta transition, along with features 1 and 2 above. Feature 3 is replicated if learning rates, or the time course of K+ current block, are graded with stimulus intensity. Synaptic plasticity allows simulated oscillations to synchronize between sites separated by axon conduction delays over 10 msec. Our data suggest that one function of gamma oscillations is to permit synaptic plasticity, which is then expressed in the form of beta oscillations. We propose that the period of gamma oscillations, similar to 25 msec, is "designed" to match the time course of [Ca2+](i) fluctuations in dendrites, thus facilitating learning.

J	Cotillon, N; Nafati, M; Edeline, JM				Cotillon, N; Nafati, M; Edeline, JM			Characteristics of reliable tone-evoked oscillations in the rat thalamo-cortical auditory system	HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article						low-frequency oscillations; stimulus-locked oscillations; auditory cortex; auditory thalamus; thalmic reticular nucleus	CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; DEPENDENT NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; IN-VITRO; SYNCHRONIZED OSCILLATIONS; THALAMOCORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD; SYNAPTIC ORIGIN; STRIATE CORTEX; TEMPORAL POLE	Tone-evoked oscillations were studied from simultaneous recordings collected in the auditory cortex, auditory thalamus and auditory sector of the reticular nucleus in urethane anesthetized rats. These oscillations were precisely time-locked to tone onset and were easily observed on peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs). Visual inspection of PSTHs and rasters led us to distinguish between 'reliable' oscillations (which exhibited oscillatory patterns in more than 50% of the trials) and 'labile' oscillations (which exhibited oscillations in less than 50% of the trials). Systematic quantification of oscillations based on several indices derived from power spectra confirmed this distinction. 'Reliable' stimulus-locked oscillations were observed in 51/184 (28%) of the recordings from auditory cortex, 9/55 (17%) of the recordings from auditory thalamus and 11/26 (42%) of the recordings from the auditory sector of the reticular nucleus. The frequency range of these oscillations was the same in the three structures (5-14 Hz). Within the same animal, when one electrode exhibited oscillations, there was a high probability of detecting similar oscillations from electrodes located in the same structure, but not from electrodes located in the other structures. These oscillations were observed for pure tone frequency (or for clicks) whatever the tone duration (1 s, 100 ms, 10 ms). The inter-tone interval (ITI) was found to be the critical factor controlling the occurrence of these oscillations: they were present for ITIs of 2 s or longer, but were absent for ITIs of 1 s or less. In contrast, the occurrence of the oscillations was a funct:ion neither of the strength of the 'on' evoked response nor of the animal's temperature. However, lowering the animal's temperature from 37-38 degrees C to 35-36 degrees C systematically led to a decrease in the frequency and an increase in the duration of the tone-evoked oscillations. These results suggest that, even in well defined conditions (temperature, EEG, ITI, level of anesthesia), the oscillations triggered by presentation of the same stimulus can be stable or unstable. This temporal instability of stimulus-evoked oscillations has to be taken into account before stating percentages of oscillations in a given brain structure. They also suggest that some general factors such as the animals temperature or the inter-stimulus interval can considerably affect their characteristics and/or their occurrence.

This activity was mainly found at frontal and temporal/parietal brain regions. However. it was not clear if these regions interact with each other or work independently. In order to get a functional measure of the degree of neuronal large-scale cooperation, we calculated EEG coherence, which provides a statistical measure of synchronization between two EEG signals per frequency band. Therefore, coherence enables us to assess the functional interaction between cell assemblies of distant brain regions. The purpose of our study was to investigate if successfully recalled words show enhanced cortical synchronization compared with not recalled ones. Additionally, the influence of stimulus modality and the way different EEG frequencies participate in this process was examined. The EEG of 25 participants was recorded during memory encoding of concrete German nouns, either presented auditorily or visually and stimuli were separated according to the participant's memory performance. Recalled nouns exhibited overall enhanced synchronization but showed typical patterns, especially between anterior and posterior brain regions in all frequency bands except the alpha-1 band (8-10 Hz). Recalling nouns was accompanied by increased synchronization between more distant electrodes in relation to an increase of synchronization between adjacent electrodes. Moreover, the degree of intrahemispheric synchronization was higher for recalled nouns. The pattern of EEG coherence and amplitude changes during verbal memory encoding allowed us to assess the probability that nouns would be recalled or not. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Design: Prospective, controlled trial. Setting: Intensive care unit of a university hospital. Patients: Twenty patients without neurologic or metabolic disorders. Measurements and Main Results: During sedation with propofol (1-4 mg.kg(-1).hr(-1)), a bifrontally recorded processed electroencephalogram was obtained. For 48 hrs, sedation was kept constant at a level according to Ramsay Scale 3 while we adjusted the dosage of propofol given per hour. At hours 6, 18, 30, and 42, blood samples were taken to assess the plasma concentration of propofol. The electroencephalogram values of 60 mins obtained during 1 hr before blood sampling were taken for further calculation. From the data, relative band power of the beta-, alpha-, theta, and delta-bands, spectral median frequency, and spectral edge frequency 90 and 95 were computed. For statistical analysis, a polynomial three-factorial repeated-measures analysis of variance with covariates was performed. Relative power of beta- and alpha-wavebands showed a constant and significant decrease over time (beta, 15.5%, 10.3%, 10.3%, 7.6%; alpha, 14.8%, 13.4%, 10.0%, 8.3%), whereas relative delta power increased (delta, 56.4%, 63.4%, 70.7%, 72.3%). The theta-waveband remained unchanged. Accordingly, spectral edge frequency 90 and 95 and spectral median frequency decreased significantly. From hours 6 to 18, a significant increase of the plasma propofol concentration was found. Subsequently, the level remained constant. Conclusion: Despite constant sedation, a longer period of propofol application induces a time-dependent electroencephalogram frequency deceleration. The use of electroencephalogram derivatives to monitor depth of sedation in the intensive care unit thus should be regarded cautiously.

Our aim was to determine whether somatosensory evoked responses are influenced by ongoing rhythmic activity in the 8-13 Hz frequency range originating in the sensorimotor cortex (mu rhythm). Methods: We used a whole-head 122 channel magnetoencephalography (MEG) system to record somatosensory evoked fields (SEFs) in response to median nerve stimulation in 11 subjects. Spontaneous oscillations in the 8-13 Hz band over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex were evaluated in 3 different pre-stimulus time intervals using wavelet analysis. Results: The N20m SEF deflection did not depend on pre-stimulus activity, while the amplitude of the P35m deflection, and to a lesser extent that of the P60m deflection, showed a small positive correlation with the amplitude of the pre-stimulus mu rhythm. Although the amplitude of the mu rhythm varied by a factor of 2.3-5, the maximum variations in P35m and P60m amplitude were only 21 and 12%, respectively. The latencies of the peaks were not affected by the strength of the pre-stimulus mu rhythm. Conclusions: It appears that the first excitatory cortical response (N20m) is independent of the oscillatory state (8-13 Hz frequency range) of the sensorimotor cortex. Later parts of the response (P35m and P60m) are also relatively stable compared with the large variations in mu rhythm. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

In CA1, ripples have maximum amplitude in stratum pyramidale. Many pyramidal cells fail to fire during a ripple, or fire infrequently, superimposed on the sharp wave-associated depolarization, whereas interneurons can fire at high frequencies, possibly as fast as the ripple itself. Recently, we have predicted that networks of pyramidal cells, interconnected by axon-axon gap junctions and without interconnecting chemical synapses, can generate coherent population oscillations at >100 Hz. Here, we show that such networks, to which interneurons have been added along with chemical synaptic interactions between respective cell types, can generate population ripples superimposed on afferent input-induced intracellular depolarizations. During simulated ripples, interneurons fire at high rates, whereas pyramidal cells fire at lower rates. The model oscillation is generated by the electrically coupled pyramidal cell axons, which then phasically excite interneurons at ripple frequency. The oscillation occurs transiently because rippling can express itself only when axons and cells are sufficiently depolarized. Our model predicts the occurrence of spikelets (fast prepotentials) in some pyramidal cells during sharp waves.

To analyse the EEG topography, power spectra were computed from 27 derivations. Mean power maps of the nonREM sleep EEG were calculated for 1-Hz bins between 1.0 and 24.75 Hz. Cluster analysis revealed a topographic segregation into distinct frequency bands which were similar for baseline and recovery sleep, and corresponded closely to the traditional frequency bands. Hallmarks of the power maps were the frontal predominance in the delta and alpha band, the occipital predominance in the theta band, and the sharply delineated vertex maximum in the sigma band. The effect of sleep deprivation on EEG topography was determined by calculating the recovery/baseline ratio of the power spectra. Prolonged waking induced an increase in power in the low-frequency range (1-10.75 Hz) which was largest over the frontal region, and a decrease in power in the sigma band (13-15.75 Hz) which was most pronounced over the vertex. The topographic pattern of the recovery/baseline power ratio was similar to the power ratio between the first and second half of the baseline night. These results indicate that changes in sleep propensity are reflected by specific regional differences in EEG power. The predominant increase of low-frequency power in frontal areas may be due to a high 'recovery need' of the frontal heteromodal association areas of the cortex.

Whereas on one cortical area a focal 10-Hz ERD can be found, other areas can display a 10-Hz ERS. This phenomenon is called focal ERD/surround ERS and is interpreted as a correlate of an activated cortical area (ERD) and simultaneously deactivated or inhibited other areas. The induced oscillations (ERS) are dominant in the 10- to 13-Hz band and very likely mediated by thalamic gating.

The complementary condition, i.e. non-CAP (NCAP), consists of a rhythmic electroencephalogram background with few, randomly distributed arousal-related phasic events. Recently, some relation between CAP and autonomic function has been preliminarily reported during sleep in young adults by means of spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). The present study was aimed at analysing the effects of CAP on HRV in a group of normal children and adolescents. Six normal children and adolescents (age range 10.0-17.5 y) were included in this study. All-night polygraphic recordings were performed after adaptation to the sleep laboratory. Six 5-min epochs were selected from sleep Stage 2 and six from Stages 3 and 4 (slow-wave sleep), both in CAP and NCAP conditions. From such epochs, a series of parameters describing HRV was then calculated, in both time and frequency domains, on the electrocardiographic R-R intervals. Statistical comparison between CAP and NCAP epochs revealed a significant difference for most of the frequency domain parameters (increase of the low-frequency band, increase of the low-frequency/high-frequency ratio and decrease in the high-frequency band during CAP) both in Stage 2 and in slow-wave sleep. Our results demonstrate that the physiological fluctuations of arousal during sleep described as CAP are accompanied by subtle, but significant, changes in balance between the sympathetic and vagal components of the autonomic system.

Methods: Experimental manipulations of discrete physiological components were conducted in feline epilepsy models (n = 64), mostly in the systemic penicillin epilepsy model of primary generalized epilepsy and the amygdala kindling model of the localization-related seizure disorder, temporal lobe epilepsy. Procedures included seizure induction as well as quantifying norepinephrine concentrations (microdialysis) and the sleep-waking state distribution of seizures before and after lesions, systemic and localized drug administration and/or photic stimulation. Results: (1) Neural generators of synchronous EEG oscillations, including tonic background slow waves and phasic 'arousal' events (sleep EEG transients such as sleep spindles, k-complexes), can combine to promote electrographic seizure propagation during NREM and drowsiness; anti-gravity muscle tone permits seizure-related movement. (2) Neural generators of asynchronous neuronal discharge patterns can reduce electrographic seizures during alert waking and REM sleep; skeletal motor paralysis blocks seizure-related movement during REM. (3) Etiology of the seizure disorder can interact with sleep and arousal mechanisms to determine sleep-waking state distribution of interictal and ictal events. Conclusions: Differential effects of NREM versus REM sleep components on seizure discharge propagation are to some extent non-specific and in other ways specific to seizure etiology.

Using subdural and depth recordings from epileptic patients, we now report the first evidence of state-dependent hippocampal theta waves (4-7 Hz) in humans. Unlike the continuous theta in rodents, however, these oscillations were consistently observed during REM sleep in short (similar to1 sec) bursts and during transitions to wake in longer epochs. theta waves were also observed in the basal temporal lobe and frontal cortex during transitions from sleep to wake and in quiet wakefulness but not in REM, and they were not coherent with hippocampal theta oscillations. The absence of functional coupling between neocortex and hippocampus during theta periods indicates that multiple theta generators exist in the human brain, and that they are dynamically regulated by brain state. gamma oscillations were also present during REM theta bursts, but the fluctuations in gamma power were not associated with theta phase, pointing out another significant difference between rodent and human theta properties. Together, these findings suggest that the generation mechanisms of theta oscillations in humans might have evolved from tonic to phasic in hippocampus during REM sleep and extended from hippocampus to cortex, where they appear in certain wakefulness-related states.

Imaging methods are now available; they allow to study brain functions with high spatial and temporal resolution. Single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and high resolution electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG and MEG) are currently intensively applied techniques to functional studies, each one having specific properties concerning spatial and temporal resolution. The success of these methods in basic neuroscience research has led to the demand for applying them to clinical questions. Diseases of the central nervous system that lead to brain dysfunction can be ideally explored using these techniques. Of particular importance are those diseases in which a focal neuronal dysfunction is the primary cause and where surgical resection of this focus might be the cure. This is often the case for epilepsy, where a discrete primary focus might exist from which pathological rhythms evolve and propagate throughout the brain, leading to seizures that severely handicap the patient. Surgical resection of the primary focus is only possible if the focus can be exactly localized and adequately separated from functionally important areas. This is where these new functional imaging tools become important. The use of SPECT and PET for focus localization has been most extensively studied and their specificity and sensitivity are intensively discussed. in the last few years functional MRI has evolved as a new interesting tool in epileptic focus localization. The most important limitation of these techniques, however, is the temporal resolution. Since epileptic activity can propagate very fast, several hyper- or hypoactive regions are seen in the images and primary areas cannot be distinguished from regions of propagation. The only methods that have sufficient temporal resolution to follow neuronal activity in real time are the electrophysiological measures, i.e. the EEG and the MEG. Localization of the sources in the brain that produced a given surface electromagnetic field has become possible through algorithms that solve the so-called "inverse problem". Several different algorithms exist and many groups begun to apply them to epileptic data with the aim to localize the focus of the pathological electrical discharges. This review article discusses the use of distributed EEG source localization procedures in the presurgical evaluation of patients with intractable focal epilepsy. In contrast to equivalent dipole models, distributed localization methods do not localize one active point in the brain but rather assume extended active areas, which is generally the case in epileptic activity. The methods shown here are based on linear numerical methods and are therefore less prone to errors when working with scattered solution spaces such as the one defined by anatomical constraints. Solutions constraint to the gray matter determined in the individual MRI are shown here. We illustrate three methods to increase the spatial resolution of the source localization procedures: One is to increase the number of recording channels to more than 100, the second to use linear methods of high precision to detect focal sources (EPIFOCUS), and the third to combine EEG source localization with EEG-triggered functional magnetic resonance imaging. The importance of EEG source localization for the interpretation of fMRI data will be particularly discussed in view of the important difference of the temporal resolution by the two methods. The localization methods can be applied to interictal as well as to ictal activity. In case of analysis of ictal EEG we propose to use full scalp frequency analysis to determine the time period of seizure onset and to localize the sources of the initial dominant frequency.

These activities are not independent: sharp waves often occur together with high-frequency ripples, and gamma-frequency activity is usually superimposed on theta oscillations. There is both experimental and theoretical evidence supporting the notion that gamma oscillation is generated intrahippocampally, but there is no generally accepted view about the origin of theta waves. Precise timing of population bursts of pyramidal cells may be due to a synchronized external drive. Membrane potential oscillations recorded in the septum are unlikely to fulfill this purpose because they are not coherent enough. We investigated the prospects of an intrahippocampal mechanism supplying pyramidal cells with theta frequency periodic inhibition, by studying a model of a network of hippocampal inhibitory interneurons. As shown previously, interneurons are capable of generating synchronized gamma-frequency action potential oscillations. Exciting the neurons by periodic current injection, the system could either be entrained in an oscillation with the frequency of the inducing current or exhibit in-phase periodic changes at the frequency of single cell (and network) activity. Simulations that used spatially inhomogeneous stimulus currents showed antiphase frequency changes across cells, which resulted in a periodic decrease in the synchrony of the network. As this periodic change in synchrony occurred in the theta frequency range, our network should be able to exhibit the theta-frequency weakening of inhibition of pyramidal cells, thus offering a possible mechanism for intrahippocampal theta generation.

Whereas evoked activity reflects the summation of transient post-synaptic potentials triggered by an event, induced activity, which is mainly oscillatory in nature, is thought to reflect changes in parameters controlling dynamic interactions within and between brain structures. We hypothesize that induced activity may yield information about the dynamics of cell assembly formation, activation and subsequent uncoupling, which may play a prominent role in different types of memory operations. We then describe a number of analysis tools that can be used to study the reactivity of induced rhythmic activity, both in terms of amplitude changes and of phase variability. We briefly discuss how alpha, gamma and theta rhythms are thought to be generated, paying special attention to the hypothesis that the theta rhythm reflects dynamic interactions between the hippocampal system and the neocortex. This hypothesis would imply that studying the reactivity of scalp-recorded theta may provide a window on the contribution of the hippocampus to memory functions. We review studies investigating the reactivity of scalp-recorded theta in paradigms engaging episodic memory, spatial memory and working memory. In addition, we review studies that relate theta reactivity to processes at the interface of memory and language. Despite many unknowns, the experimental evidence largely supports the hypothesis that theta activity plays a functional role in cell assembly formation, a process which may constitute the neural basis of memory formation and retrieval. The available data provide only highly indirect support for the hypothesis that scalp-recorded theta yields information about hippocampal functioning. It is concluded that studying induced rhythmic activity holds promise as an additional important way to study brain function.

One way to index speed of CNS processing is through the assessment of brain oscillations via electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. The dominant frequency (peak frequency) with which neuronal feedback loops in an adult human brain oscillate in a relaxed state is around 10 cycles/sec, but large individual differences exist in peak frequencies. Earlier studies have found high peak frequencies to be associated with higher intelligence. In the present study, data from 271 extended twin families (688 participants) were collected as part of a large, ongoing project on the genetics of adult brain function and cognition. IQ was assessed with the Dutch version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IIIR), from which four dimensions were calculated (verbal comprehension, working memory, perceptual organization, and processing speed). Individual peak frequencies were picked according to the method described by Klimesch (1999) and averaged 9.9 Hz (SD 1.01). Structural equation modeling indicated that both peak frequency and the dimensions of IQ were highly heritable (range, 66% to 83%). A large part of the genetic variance in alpha peak frequency as well as in working memory and processing speed was due to nonadditive factors. There was no evidence of a genetic correlation between alpha peak frequency and any of the four WAIS dimensions: Smarter brains do not seem to run faster.

NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						alpha; event-related potential; event related decrease; induced oscillations; evoked oscillations; induced band power; event related band power	OSCILLATIONS; BAND; EEG	This study aims to resolve a paradox. Experiments measuring alpha band power report an event related decrease (desynchronization) in alpha activity, whereas those measuring evoked alpha report synchronization. During a recognition memory task with human subjects, we measured the evoked (phase locked) and induced (not phase locked) alpha response. The findings reveal that evoked alpha is due to a transient phase locking (at about 100-200 ms poststimulus) of three alpha sub-bands which can be observed only at parieto-occipital sites. In contrast, induced alpha shows a widespread pattern of desynchronization at most recording sites. Thus, opposite alpha responses occur within similar time windows. Evoked alpha synchronization may reflect cortical inhibition which serves to increase the signal to noise ratio for activation processes following immediately later.

The RF neurons are part of the common brainstem system (CBS) which participates in regulation and coordination of cardiovascular, respiratory, somatomotor systems, and vigilance, Multiple time series of these physiological subsystems yield useful information about internal dynamic coordination of the organism. Essential problems are nonlinearity and instationarity of the signals, due to the dynamic complexity of the systems. Several time-resolving methods are presented to describe nonlinear dynamic couplings in the rime course, particularly during phase transitions. The methods are applied to the recorded signals representing the complex couplings of the physiological subsystems. Phase transitions in these systems are detected by recurrence plots of the instationary signals. The pointwise transinformation and the pointwise conditional coupling divergence are measures of the mutual interaction of the subsystems in the state space. If the signals show marked rhythms, instantaneous frequencies and their shiftings are demonstrated by time frequency distributions, and instantaneous phase differences show couplings of oscillating subsystems. Transient signal components are reconstructed by wavelet packet rime selective transient reconstruction. These methods are useful means for analyzing coupling characteristics of the complex physiological system, and detailed analyses of internal dynamic coordination of subsystems become possible. During phase transitions of the functional organization (a) the rhythms of the central neuronal activities and the peripheral systems are altered, (b) changes in the coupling between CBS neurons and cardiovascular signals, respiration and the EEG, and (c) between NTS neurons (influenced by baroreceptor afferents) and CBS neurons occur, and (d) the processing of baroreceptor input at the NTS neurons changes. The results of this complex analysis, which could not be done formerly in this manner, confirm and complete former investigations on the dynamic organization of the CBS with its changing relations to peripheral and other central nervous subsystems.

For stimulation short tactile stimuli of 10 ms duration were presented at intervals of 4 s. The electroencephalogram was recorded with 60 closely spaced electrodes and sampled at 256 Hz. For each subject the reactive beta band was determined by comparing 1-s power spectra. The largest beta power increase was found in the range of 12-28 Hz on electrodes overlying the left-hand area. The Matching Pursuit algorithm was applied to single trials data and the frequency of single 'atoms' determined. In one subject the little finger showed a significant higher frequency as compared to the thumb. The difference in frequency was in the order of 1 Hz. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

The source power changes evoked by electrical stimulation of the median nerve were estimated with synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM). Source power in the low gamma band (40 Hz) decreased in the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (SI) for a few hundred milliseconds (i.e. middle and long latency) and then increased inversely. Source power in the high gamma band (70-90 Hz) increased simultaneously both in the contralateral SI and contra/ipsilateral secondary somatosensory cortex (SII) in 80-180 ms. These results suggest that low and high gamma oscillations work under independent mechanisms during somatosensory processing. In particular, high gamma oscillations may play an essential role in making a functional connection between SI and SII.

J	Hajos, M; Hoffmann, WE; Weaver, RJ				Hajos, M; Hoffmann, WE; Weaver, RJ			Regulation of septo-hippocampal activity by 5-hydroxytryptamine(2C) receptors	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							HIPPOCAMPAL THETA-RHYTHM; MEDIAN RAPHE NUCLEUS; SEPTUM-DIAGONAL BAND; MUTANT MICE; RAT; ANTAGONIST; AGONISTS; NEURONS; CATS; OSCILLATIONS	It is established that the serotonin system modulates hippocampal functions by regulating neuronal activity of both the medial septum and hippocampus. Inhibition of serotonin neurons leads to theta oscillation of septal neurons and theta wave activity in the hippocampus, indicating a tonic regulation of the septo-hippocampal system by serotonin neurons. Because the postsynaptic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor subtypes mediating this tonic inhibition have not been identified, a putative role of 5-HT2C receptors has been evaluated in the present study. Extracellular single units were recorded from the medial septum/vertical limb of diagonal band (MS/DBv) and hippocampal CA1 or dentate gyrus with simultaneous hippocampal EEG recordings from anesthetized rats. Intravenous administration of 5-HT2C receptor agonists 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine dihydrochloride (m-CPP) and [S]-2-(chloro-5-fluoro-indol-1-yl)-1-methyl-ethylamine fumarate (Ro 60-0175) dose dependently inhibited firing activity most of the recorded MS/DBv neurons and abolished theta oscillation in all tested MS/DBv and hippocampal neurons. Parallel to inhibition of theta oscillation of MS/DBv neurons, hippocampal EEG activity was desynchronized and its power spectrum was shifted to lower frequencies. The selective 5-HT2C receptor antagonist 6-chloro-5-methyl-1-[2-(2-methylpyridyl-3-oxy)-pyrid-5-yl carbomyl] indoline (SB-242084) [but not the 5-HT2B antagonist 2-amino-4-(4-fluoronaphth-1-yl)-6-isopropyl-pyrimidine (RS-127445) or 5-HT2A antagonist R-(+)-alpha-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethyl]-4-piperidinemethanol (MDL-100907)] reversed the action of 5-HT2C receptor agonists. Furthermore, in control rats 5-HT2C receptor antagonists [SB-242084 and 5-methyl-1-(3-pyridilcarbamoyl)-1,2,3,5-tetrahydropyr-rolo[2,3-f]indole hydrochloride (SB-206553)] induced or enhanced theta oscillation in MS/DBv and hippocampal neurons and theta wave activity of the hippocampus. These findings provide evidence for a tonic regulation of the activity and theta oscillation of the septo-hippocampal system via 5-HT2C receptors in the anesthetized rat, indicating that pharmacological interactions with these receptors could modulate various physiological and pathological processes associated with limbic theta activity.

Twenty subjects performed an auditory memory task during which the EEG was recorded. Half the subjects performed the task without the administration of alcohol and half under the influence of alcohol (similar to0.7 g/l). The administration of alcohol itself did not alter the ERD/ERS responses. However, when the effects of alcohol were studied as a function of time and task (encoding vs. retrieval), we observed significant effects in the 4-6, 6-8, and 8-10 Hz frequency bands such that the administration of alcohol decreased the early-appearing ERS responses during auditory encoding and increased the later-appearing ERD responses during retrieval. Our results indicate that alcohol has disorganizing effects on brain electric oscillatory systems in the theta and lower alpha frequency range during cognitive processing.

Carbachol concentrations in the 4-13 mu M range produced regular synchronized CA3 discharges at 0.5-2 Hz (carbachol-delta). Higher concentrations (13-60 mu M) produced short episodes of 5-10 Hz (carbachol-theta) oscillations separated by nonsynchronous activity. Concentrations of carbachol ranging from 8-25 mu M also produced irregular episodes of high-frequency discharges (carbachol-gamma, 35-70 Hz), in isolation or mixed with carbachol-theta and carbachol-delta. At carbachol concentrations sufficient to induce carbachol-theta, low concentrations of APV reversibly transformed carbachol-theta into carbachol-delta. Higher concentrations of D,L-2-amino-5-phosphsnopentanoic acid (APV) reversibly and completely blocked carbachol-theta. A systematic study of the effects of carbachol shows that the frequency of spontaneous oscillations depended nonlinearly on the level of muscarinic activation. Field and intracellular recordings from CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells and interneurons during carbachol-induced rhythms revealed that the hippocampal circuitry preserved in the slice was capable of spontaneous activity over the range of frequencies observed in vivo and suggests that the presence of these rhythms could be under neuromodulatory control.

The purpose of the present study was to identify signs of brain dysfunction with quantitative EEG in adults with insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes. Patients (n = 49) with type I diabetes and controls (n 51) were recruited. All patients had good glycemic control, no diabetic polyneuropathy and a minor history of severe hypoglycaemia. EEG was recorded for 15 min following a standardized protocol, power spectra were obtained from 236-584 s of artefact-free EEG from each subject and EEG was repeated in diabetic patients after 3 and 9 months. The most pronounced finding was a loss of fast oscillations (alpha, beta and gamma activity) in both posterior temporal regions, with p < 0.001 for beta and p < 0.05 or 0.01 for alpha and gamma activity in the diabetes patients. A decrease in beta activity was also present bilaterally in the anterior temporal and occipital regions (p < 0.05 or 0.01). The alpha peak frequency was lower in patients than in controls, with reductions bilaterally in the temporo-central regions (p < 0.01). These changes were not found to correlate to a previous history of hypoglycaemia. The alpha and beta power showed a high test-retest reliability at both 3 and 9 months (0.88-0.92). The focal decrease in temporal lobe fast activity suggests that these brain regions are preferentially affected by type I diabetes. This abnormality may be related to the mechanism underlying the cognitive dysfunction described in diabetes.

In the cat retina, oscillatory firing patterns occur with frequencies in the range of 60 to 120 Hz (Omega-oscillations). These millisecond-precise temporal patterns are transmitted reliably to the cortex and may provide a feed-forward mechanism of response synchronization. In the cortex, visual responses often show oscillatory patterning with frequencies between 20 and 60 Hz (gamma-oscillations), which are not phase locked to the stimulus onset and therefore do not show up in regularly averaged evoked potentials. gamma-Oscillatory responses synchronize with millisecond precision over long distances and are mediated by the reciprocal corticocortical connectivity. Modulatory systems like the ascending reticular activating system facilitate synchronization and increase the strength of gamma-oscillations. During states of such functional cortical activation, the dominant frequency of the EEG is shifted from lower frequencies in the delta-/Theta-range to higher frequencies in the gamma-range. Therefore, functional states indicate different degrees of temporal precision with which large neuronal populations interact. Response synchronization also depends on relations of global stimulus features. This suggests that millisecond-precise neuronal interactions serve as a fundamental mechanism for visual information processing.

Previously, we have reported that during drowsy periods of intermittent performance, 7 of 10 participants performing an auditory detection task exhibited episodes of nonresponding lasting about 18 s (Makeig & Jung, 1996). Further, the time patterns of these episodes were repeated precisely in subsequent sessions. The 18-s cycles were accompanied by counterbalanced power changes within two frequency bands in the vertex EEG (near 4 Hz and circa 40 Hz). In the present experiment, performance patterns and concurrent EEG spectra were examined in four participants performing a continuous visuomotor compensatory tracking task in 15-20 minute bouts during a 42-hour sleep deprivation study. During periods of good performance, participants made compensatory trackball movements about twice per second, attempting to keep a target disk near a central ring, Autocorrelations of time series representing the distance of the target disk from the ring centre showed that during periods of poor performance marked near-18-s cycles in performance again appeared. There were phases of poor or absent performance accompanied by an increase in EEG power that was largest at 3-4 Hz. These studies show that in drowsy humans, opening and closing of the gates of behavioural awareness is marked not by the appearance of (12-14 Hz) sleep spindles, but by prominent EEG amplitude changes in the low theta band. Further, both EE(; and behavioural changes during drowsiness often exhibit stereotyped 18-s cycles.

Methods: In order to avoid a confounding on the measurement level, induced band power (IBP) was used as a measure that is devoid of the influence of evoked components. The EEG was recorded during a recognition memory task. Results: The results show that compared to correctly rejected words, targets (remembered words) elicit a significantly larger P300. An oscillatory old/new effect was found for the delta and theta but not for the alpha band. It is manifested by an increase in delta and theta IBP which is significantly larger for targets than for correctly rejected words. It can be observed during the same time interval and shows the same topographic distribution as the ERP old/new effect. Most importantly, however, the ERP old/new effect (as well as the P300 itself) is generated by very slow frequencies which Lie below the delta band. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that the two types of old/new effects are functionally related. Possible physiological mechanisms underlying this relationship are discussed in terms of a threshold change in the cortex (generating the P300) that occurs during an increase in hippocampal theta activity (generating an increase in induced theta power).

The 62-channel EEG was simultaneously recorded while subjects viewed sequentially presented pictures and subjectively rated them after each presentation. The results show that emotionally loaded stimuli induced higher ERS in the delta, theta1, theta2, beta1, beta3, and gamma bands along with combined ERD and ERS effects in alpha2 band. As to hemispheric asymmetries, the effects of emotional arousal were restricted not only to right parietal (theta1 and theta2 ERS, alpha2 ERD) but also to left frontal (theta2 ERS) regions. In terms of affective chronometry, lower theta was the first to catch the affective salience of incoming stimuli (time window 0-600 ins after the stimulus input). For theta2, alpha2, and gamma bands this process was delayed to 600-1000 ins.

Application of discrete inverse solutions for the EEG/MEG inverse problem in the frequency domain usually involves the use of many current sources (sometimes 10(4) or more) restricted to gray matter points, as the solution space for the possible generators. This number can progressively increase with the level of detail of the MRI when it is used in co-registration with EEG/MEG. However, the computation of the Fourier transform to all these sources is computationally intensive. We illustrate with a simple example how this procedure can be simplified by applying the Fourier transform to the signals in the sensors using a popular inverse method (LORETA). We also suggest how the search space of current sources at specific frequencies of oscillation can be limited to some regions constrained by other technologies such as fMRI, PET and SPECT.

In animal studies, MDMA effects are primarily mediated by serotonin (5-HT), but also by dopamine (DA) and possibly noradrenaline (NA). In humans, however, the neurochemical and neurophysiological basis of acute MDMA effects remains unknown. The distribution of active neuronal populations after administration of a single dose of MDMA (1.7 mg/kg) or placebo was studied in 16 healthy, MDMA-naive volunteers. Thirty-one-channel scalp EEGs during resting with open and closed eyes was analyzed in the different EEG frequency bands. Scalp maps of power showed significant, global differences between MDMA and placebo in both eye conditions and all frequency bands. Low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was used to compute 3D, functional images of electric neuronal activity from the scalp EEG data. MDMA produced a widespread decrease of slow and medium frequency activity and an increase of fast frequency activity in the anterior temporal and posterior orbital cortex, concomitant with a marked enhancement of mood, emotional arousal and increased extraversion. This activation of frontotemporal areas indicates that the observed enhancement of mood and possibly the increased extroversion rely on modulation of limbic orbitofrontal and anterotemporal structures known to be involved in emotional processes. Comparison of the MDMA-specific EEG pattern with that of various 5-HT, DA, and NA agonists indicates that serotonin, noradrenaline, and, to a lesser degree, dopamine, contribute to the effects of MDMA on EEG, and possibly also on mood and behavior.

Methods: We simultaneously recorded cortical electrical activity (EEG) in a bipolar manner from the contralateral sensorimotor areas and surface electromyographic (EMG) activity from the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle in 10 healthy subjects during a maintained motor contraction task at 8% of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force level. The coherence between oscillatory processes in the EEG and EMG was calculated. Three different conditions were investigated: (i) performing the task with high precision (HP); (ii) performing the task with high precision and simultaneously performing a mental arithmetic task (HPAT), i.e. attention was divided between the motor task and the mental arithmetic task; and (iii) performing the task with low precision (LP). Results: We have found that the amount of beta range EEG-EMG synchronization decreases below the 95% confidence level when attention is divided between the motor task and the mental arithmetic task. The results also show that the frequency of beta range synchronization is higher with a higher level of precision but still lies within the beta frequency range (15-30 Hz). Conclusions: The data indicate that beta range synchronization represents a state of the cortico-muscular network when attention is directed towards the motor task. The frequency of synchronization of this network is associated with. and possibly encodes, precision in force production. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

By using a special algorithm for correcting response latency, we can show that the vast majority of dLGN visual responses which were elicited by a sudden change in contrast show HFOs in the range of 300 to more than 800 Hz. After response time correction these HFOs are clearly visible in summed responses, indicating th;it these patterns are highly reproducible by identical stimuli. On this basis we analysed the HFOs in more detail. We found the oscillation frequency to increase with stimulus contrast and the area of the receptive field centre covered by an excitatory stimulus. Inhibition reduces the oscillation frequency as demonstrated with additional stimulation of the antagonistic surround of the receptive field and by blocking inhibition with micro-iontophoretical application of bicuculline methiodide. The HFO was almost independent of the state of the system as estimated from the EEG pattern. Based on these findings we discuss whether bursts of action potentials triggered by the low-threshold calcium spike (LTS) can contribute to this pattern of visual thalamic activity.

For 74 subjects, the EEG was recorded during a resting session, Two different intelligence tests (LGT-3 and IST-70) were performed. We found a strong positive correlation between intelligence and alpha power. Large differences between the two intelligence tests and alpha power subbands were obtained. Whereas the upper alpha band shows the strongest correlation with the IST-70, power in the two lower alpha bands tend to show a more consistent relationship with the LGT-3. Considering the fact that the IST-70 has a strong emphasis on semantic memory demands, whereas the LGT-3 focuses more on the ability to learn new material, we conclude that upper alpha is related to the ability to process semantic information, whereas the two lower alpha bands are associated with attentional demands that dominate during the encoding of new information.

Starting from the limits and drawbacks of conventional sleep parameters (macrostructure), investigation of the underground world (microstructure) is extensively carried out with particular attention to K-complexes and other arousal-related phasic events of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. The continuity between conventional and nonconventional arousals is stressed in the light of autonomic function and motor activity evidence. The similarities and differences between CAP and arousals ave thoroughly illustrated as well as the putative biological bases of these phenomena. The oscillatory nature of CAP, the involvement of CAP in the modulation of EEG synchrony, the sleep-maintenance properties of CAP in response to arousing stimuli, the clinical applications of CAP parameters and the promising availability of automatic scoring systems are highlighted.

In contrast with previous studies of population activity using local field potential recordings, we distinguished four signals in the response. The one called DC covered almost the entire area of the olfactory bulb; in addition, three oscillations, named rostral, middle, and caudal according to their locations, occurred over broad regions of the bulb. In a typical odor-induced response, the DC signal appeared almost immediately after the start of the stimulus, followed by the middle oscillation, the rostral oscillation, and last, the caudal oscillation. The initial frequencies of the three oscillations were 14.1, 13.0, and 6.6 Hz, respectively. When the rostral and caudal oscillations occurred together, their frequencies differed by a factor of 1.99 +/- 0.01. The following evidence suggests that the four signals are functionally independent: (1) in different animals some signals could be easily detected whereas others were undetectable; (2) the four signals had different latencies and frequencies; (3) the signals occurred in different locations and propagated in different directions; (4) the signals responded differently to changes in odor concentration; (5) the signals had different shapes; and (6) the rostral and caudal signals added in a simple, linear manner in regions where the location of the two signals overlapped. However, the finding that the frequency of the rostral oscillation is precisely two times that of the caudal oscillation suggests a significant relationship between the two. The location of the caudal oscillation in the bulb changed from cycle to cycle, implying that different groups of neurons are active in different cycles. This result is consistent with the earlier findings in the olfactory system of the locust (Wehr and Laurent, 1996). Our results suggest an additional complexity of parallel processing of olfactory input by multiple functional population domains.

We recorded from 345 intracranial electrodes in five patients with medically intractable epilepsy while they learned to navigate virtual mazes. Previously, we showed significant dependence of theta on two different task parameters, maze difficulty and study versus test modes. First, we show that these results hold for an additional 174 electrodes and two subjects, removing a previous confound between the two comparisons. Here we ask whether or not these two task parameters reflect some common, or correlated, task-correlates of theta. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

On the basis of theoretical models and animal experiments, synchronized oscillatory neuronal activity is discussed as the key mechanism by which the brain binds information processesed in different cortical areas to form a percept. Using an identical stimulation design - the same as used in animal studies - it was shown that induced gamma band responses in the EEG resemble the same features as those found in the intracortical recordings of animals. In addition, the present work demonstrates that these cortical activities are not higher harmonics of the alpha band and that they are sensitive to the features of the stimulus. These results support the notion that gamma band activity is not just a by-product of neuronal activity and that alpha- and gamma band activies most certainly represent different cortical funtional states.

A new method of examining phase synchronicity across multiple electrode sites in specific EEG frequency bands as a function of time was employed, in a conventional cognitive ERP paradigm in 40 normal subjects. A significant late post-stimulus gamma synchronicity response occurred for task-relevant stimuli, whereas for task-irrelevant stimuli no such response was evident. However, an early response was seen for both task-relevant and irrelevant stimuli. This is the first empirical demonstration that widespread synchronous high frequency oscillations occur in humans in relation to cognition.

Methods: Extracellular recordings were done in permanently implanted animals during the natural waking-sleep cycle. Single and dual simultaneous recordings from cortical neurons, cortical and thalamic neurons, or cortical neurons and glial cells were performed in cats under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia. Results: (a) The minimal substrate of SW seizures is the neocortex because such seizures may occur in thalamectomized animals, in which spindles are absent. In intact-brain animals, SW seizures are initiated in neocortex and spread to the thalamus after a few seconds. The majority of thalamocortical (TC) neurons are steadily hyperpolarized throughout the cortical SW seizures. (b) In the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, the paroxysmal depolarizing shifts (PDSs) associated with the EEG "spike" of SW/PSW complexes contain an important inhibitory component, whereas the hyperpolarization during the EEG "wave" component is not due to gamma-aminobutryic acid (GABA)ergic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) but is ascribed to a mixture of disfacilitation and K+ currents. As is also the case with seizures consisting of pure SW complexes, the majority of TC neurons are hyperpolarized during the cortical paroxysms and disinhibited after the cessation of cortical seizures. Conclusions: Seizures with SW complexes and of the Lennox-Gastaut type preferentially evolve from sleep oscillations. They are initiated in neocortex and spread to the thalamus after a few seconds. The majority of TC neurons are inhibited during these seizures.

Breathing imposes the most important rhythm. Other rhythms have been described in the beta- and gamma-frequency ranges. We recorded unitary activities in different bulbar layers simultaneously with local field potentials in order to examine the different relationships existing between (i) breathing and field potential oscillations, and (ii) breathing and spiking activity of different cell types. We show that, whatever the layer, odour-induced gamma oscillations always occur around the transition point between inhalation and exhalation while beta oscillations appear during early exhalation and may extend up to the end of inhalation. By contrast, unitary activities exhibit different characteristics according to the layer. They vary in (i) their temporal relationship with respect to the respiratory cycle; (ii) their spike rates; (iii) their temporal patterns defined according to the respiratory cycle. The time window of a respiratory cycle might thus be split into three main epochs based on the deceleration of field potential rhythms (from gamma to beta oscillations) and a simultaneous gradient of spike discharge frequencies ranging from 180 to 30 Hz. We discuss the possibility that each rhythm could serve different functions as priming, gating or tuning for the bulbar network.

Moving-bar visual stimuli of different extension, stimuli moving in different directions, the impact of non-specific cortical activation upon synchronous oscillation, and the frequency content of EEG associated with synchrony were considered. The magnitude of zero lag synchrony was primarily accounted for by the properties of the eigenmodes of the travelling local field potential superposition waves generated by inputs to the cortex, largely independent of the oscillation properties and associated spectral content. Approximation of the differences in cross-correlation observed with differently moving bar stimuli, and of the impact of cortical activation, required added assumptions on (a) spatial coherence of efferent volleys al-ising from parts of a single stimulus object and (b) the presence of low-amplitude diffuse held noise, with enhancement of cortical signal/noise ratio with respect to the spatially coherent inputs, at higher levels of cortical activation. Synchrony appears to be a ubiquitous property of cortex-like delay networks. Precision in the modelling of synchronous oscillation findings will require detailed description of input pathways, cortical connectivity, cortical stability, and aspects of cortical/subcortical interactions.

MEG has selective sensitivity to tangential currents (from fissural cortex), and less distorted signals compared with EEG A major goal of MEG is to determine the location and timing of cortical generators for event-related responses, spontaneous brain oscillations or epileptiform activity. MEG provides a spatial accuracy of a few mm under optimal conditions, combined with an excellent submillisecond temporal resolution, which together enable spatiotemporal tracking of distributed neural activities, e g. during cognitive tasks or epileptic discharges. While the present focus of pediatric MEG is on tailored epilepsy surgery, the complete noninvasiveness of MEG also provides unlimited possibilities to study the brain functions of healthy and developmentally deviant children.

J	Gabriel, A; Eckhorn, R				Gabriel, A; Eckhorn, R			A multi-channel correlation method detects traveling gamma-waves in monkey visual cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						spatio-temporal correlation; traveling waves; synchronization; coherence; correlation; multi-channel recordings	COOPERATIVE FIRING ACTIVITY; PRIMATE MOTOR CORTEX; CROSS-CORRELATION; FAST OSCILLATIONS; FEATURE LINKING; STRIATE CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; COHERENCE; PHASE; EEG	Correlations among simultaneously recorded signals are mostly analyzed pairwise and include temporal averaging. However, pairwise methods are not suitable for characterizing relationships among multiple channels for signals which vary temporally in an unpredictable way. Here we develop a time-resolved spatio-temporal correlation (STC) measure among simultaneously recorded signals. We demonstrate the capabilities of the method with artificial data sets and with multiple-channel recordings from striate cortex of awake monkeys. We concentrate on correlations in the gamma-frequency range (gamma: 30-90 Hz) because they were prominent in the analyzed recordings and gained high interest in the recent years due to their assumed role in associative processing, including perceptual binding. Former analyses of gamma-activities in visual cortex, using pairwise correlation methods, mostly revealed zero-delay correlation, indicating synchrony. In cat and monkey visual cortex this gamma-synchrony is restricted to 1.5-3.0 mm (half-height decline). However, our spatio-temporal correlation (STC)-method demonstrates for striate cortex from awake monkeys that gamma-synchrony is a local phenomenon of more global traveling plane waves that appear stimulus-induced at randomly varying orientations. These gamma-waves are coupled over much larger cortical distances (approximate to7 mm half-height decline) than the gamma-synchrony ranges obtained by pairwise correlation analyses from the same data. Our STC-method therefore suggests that the previously reported results of short-range and zero-delay correlations were often due to temporal averaging of traveling gamma-waves. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Prior studies from our group using electrical stimulation and self-paced movement showed a beta rebound within one second after stimulation respectively movement offset. As the tactile-stimulation-data showed a similar ERS behaviour, we extracted the cortical sources for this beta rebound by the linear estimation method in order to see whether the representation areas of different fingers were distinguishable (as is possible with MEG data). Although realistic head models of two subjects were used for the calculations the fingers could not be spatially distinguished. However, regarding the whole spatio-temporal pattern of the ERS for different fingers clear differences can be observed.

The underlying mechanisms of fixation-off sensitivity and its relationship with alpha rhythm remain unclear. To obtain a better understanding of this issue, we used a whole-head magnetoencephalograph to study an epileptic child with fixation-off sensitivity resulting in a 3-Hz, large-amplitude oscillation (300 mu V) over the occipital regions on the EEG. Magnetic source localization revealed alpha activity around the calcarine fissure and surrounding parieto-occipital areas. Magnetic sources of abnormalities relating to fixation-off sensitivity, however, usually were located deeper in the brain, suggesting more extensively distributed sources, with involvement of the cingulate gyrus and the basomesial occipitotemporal region. Distributions of the sources of both types of activities show independent clusters but also an appreciable domain of overlap. Our findings indicate that abnormalities related to fixation-off sensitivity can emerge in thalamocortical networks, with larger and more anterior cortical distribution than those that generate alpha rhythm. Transition in the type of oscillation appears not only to depend on a change in cellular dynamics but also to be reflected in a different spatial distribution of the underlying neuronal networks.

However, it has been proved difficult because there logically exist an infinite number of other models and interpretations that could account for the same data and phenomena (i.e. the problem of underdetermination). Therefore, I suggest that applying biologically realistic multiple constraints from ion-channel level to system level (e.g. cognitive neuroscience and human brain disorders) can only solve the problem of underdetermination. Here I have explored whether the noise shaping/predictive neural coding hypothesis can provide a unified view on following realistic multiple constraints: (1) cortical gain control mechanisms in vivo; (2) the relationships between acetylcholine, nicotine, dopamine, calcium-activated potassium ion-channel, and cognitive functions; (3) oscillations and synchrony; (4) why should spontaneous activity be irregular; (5) whether the cortical neurons in vivo are coincidence detectors or integrators; and (6) the causal relationship between theta oscillation, gamma band fluctuation, and P3 (or P300) ERP responses. Finally, recent experimental results supporting the unified view shall be discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using a previously introduced classification procedure, transient patterns of cortical activity suitable to discriminate between the rising and the falling modulation were identified. Early (locked to stimulus onset) and late (emerging at variable times poststimulus) patterns could be differentiated. Deletion of increasing numbers of randomly selected electrodes was used to determine a critical density of recording channels required to capture the discriminative power of the early and late patterns. Statistical analysis of the classification revealed a sigmoid dependence of the discriminative power from the number of remaining electrodes with an inflection point at 12 electrodes. The analysis of the minima of the classification statistic revealed that in the early patterns discriminative information was focal on regions corresponding to the tonotopic representation of the stimuli, whereas in late patterns this information seemed to be distributed nonfocally across larger cortical regions. This analysis supports the previous notion of the coexistence of topographically organized activity states related to the physical stimulus features and nontopographically organized states determined largely by intrinsic factors (Ohl et al. 2001).

Assessment of periodicity in wide-band time series	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						power spectrum; theta wave; alpha wave; intracranial EEG; epilepsy; cognitive task	OMITTED STIMULUS POTENTIALS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SLOW POTENTIALS; GAMMA-ACTIVITY; HUMAN EEG; BRAIN; RESPONSES; COHERENCE; ATTENTION; OSCILLATIONS	To test the hypotheses that (i) electroencephalograms (EEGs) are largely made up of oscillations at many frequencies and (ii) that the peaks in the power spectra represent oscillations, we applied a new method, called the period specific average (PSA) to a wide sample of EEGs. Both hypotheses can be rejected. Although the principal peaks in the two spectra agree most of the time, quite often a peak in the power spectrum accompanies no periodicity peak and some periodicity peaks have no power spectral peak. The Fourier spectrum is not a reliable indication of rhythms. EEG samples from patients during waking, sleeping and seizure states, and volunteer healthy subjects doing cognitive tasks quite often show no significant rhythms, on an arbitrary, common sense definition. When clear rhythms are seen, they involve one or two, rarely up to four or five simultaneous non-harmonically related frequencies. Rhythms are special cases; most of the power spectrum most of the time is nonrhythmic. "Good" rhythms usually have quite narrow peaks, with frequency modulation of <5%, strengths of >2.5 up to >10 times the expectation from chance, and they often show fine structure by being quite local and brief. Most rhythms are quasisinusoidal but others are sharp-cornered recurrent events with <50% duty cycle. In the face of wide variability, we do not report any systematic differences in periodicity among EEGs from different parts of the brain or different brain states or species; it will take many more exemplars of each state, species or brain part to establish characteristic features. The PSA method may be the best so far proposed to demonstrate and quantify periodicity in wide-band time series with noise, but it has serious limitations. Discussion leads to the conclusion that it is time for a new paradigm or metaphor for brain waves. (C) 2003 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Muller, MM; Gruber, T; Keil, A				Muller, MM; Gruber, T; Keil, A			Modulation of induced gamma band activity in the human EEG by attention and visual information processing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						induced gamma band response; human EEG; visual information processing; attention; Gestalt	OSCILLATORY BRAIN ACTIVITY; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; AVERAGE REFERENCE; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; COGNITIVE-PROCESSES; CEREBRAL ASYMMETRY; NEURAL MECHANISMS; CURRENT-DENSITY; CORTICAL AREAS	Here we present a series of four studies aimed to investigate the link between induced gamma band activity in the human EEG and visual information processing. We demonstrated and validated the modulation of spectral gamma band power by spatial selective visual attention. When subjects attended to a certain stimulus, spectral power was increased as compared to when the same stimulus was ignored. In addition, we showed a shift in spectral gamma band power increase to the contralateral hemisphere when subjects shifted their attention to one visual hemifield. The following study investigated induced gamma band activity and the perception of a Gestalt. Ambiguous rotating figures were used to operationalize the law of good figure (gute Gestalt). We found increased gamma band power at posterior electrode sites when subjects perceived an object. In the last experiment we demonstrated a differential hemispheric gamma band activation when subjects were confronted with emotional pictures. Results of the present experiments in combination with other studies presented in this volume are supportive for the notion that induced gamma band activity in the human EEG is closely related to visual information processing and attentional perceptual mechanisms.

Methods: ERD/ERS responses of the 4-6, 6-8, 8-10 and 10-12 Hz EEG frequency bands were studied in 24 normal subjects performing a visual sequential letter task (so-called n-back task) in which memory load was varied from 0 to 2. Results: In the 3-6 Hz theta frequency band, a long-lasting synchronization was observed in the anterior electrodes, especially after the presentation of targets. In the 6-8 and 8-10 Hz frequency bands, anterior ERS was elicited especially in the 2-back condition (highest memory load). In contrast to the responses of the 8-10 Hz frequency band, in the 10-12 Hz frequency band the 2-back experimental condition elicited the greatest ERD. Conclusions: In the highest memory load (2-back) experimental condition the attentional capacities were most probably exceeded, resulting in 6-8 and 8-10 Hz ERS. This might reflect an inhibition of such brain areas (frontal cortices) no longer involved in task completion when alternative strategies are needed and utilized. These more 'cognitive' strategies were then reflected as an increase in 10-12 Hz ERD. Additionally, our results support the assumption that the simultaneously recorded ERD/ERS responses of different narrow EEG frequency bands differ and reflect distinct aspects of information processing.

It is essential for stimulating cortical activation in association with waking (and paradoxical sleep), yet also important for attenuating cortical activation and promoting slow wave sleep. Using juxtacellular recording and labeling of neurons with Neurobiotin followed by immunohistochemical staining for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), we studied the discharge properties of identified GABAergic basal forebrain neurons in relation to electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in urethane-anesthetized rats to determine the part or parts that they may play in this dual role. The GABAergic neurons displayed distinct discharge profiles in relation to somatosensory stimulation-evoked cortical activation. Whereas a significant minority increased its average discharge rate, the majority decreased its average discharge rate in association with cortical activation. Moreover, subgroups displayed distinct discharge patterns related to different cortical activities, including very regular high-frequency tonic spiking within a gamma EEG frequency range and rhythmic cluster spiking within a theta-like frequency range during cortical activation. During irregular slow EEG activity in absence of stimulation, one subgroup displayed spike bursts correlated with cortical slow oscillations. As relatively large in size and also antidromically activated from the cortex, many GABAergic neurons recorded were considered to be cortically projecting and thus capable of directly modulating cortical activity. Subgroups of GABAergic basal forebrain neurons would thus have the capacity to promote cortical activation by modulating gamma or theta activity and others to attenuate cortical activation by modulating irregular slow oscillations that normally occur during slow wave sleep.

The 62-channel EEG, facial EMG and ECG were simultaneously recorded while subjects viewed sequentially presented pictures and subjectively rated them after each presentation. The obtained findings indicate that differences induced by pictures varying in emotional valence are associated mainly with increased theta and alpha-3 synchronization activity and anterior hemispheric asymmetries. In the anterior temporal leads theta ERS revealed a significant valence by hemisphere interaction showing relatively greater right hemisphere theta ERS for Neg and left hemisphere ERS for Pos stimuli in the time window of 100-700 ms poststimulus, whereas in the alpha-3 band Neg stimuli induced lateralized time-dependent left hemisphere ERS increased in the time window of 800-1200 ms. were not observed for Neut and Pos stimuli. The obtained results along with earlier observations on EEG correlates of affective processing challenge the notion that affective anterior hemispheric asymmetries are mainly sensitive to wide alpha frequency band. Frequency and time dependence of anterior hemispheric asymmetries in emotional valence discrimination is emphasized.

Because contrast agent (CA) formulations are injected intravenously to patients who may have a disrupted blood-brain barrier, their neurotolerability should be tested by using appropriate animal models. In the present study, a model of rat brain ischemia evaluated in terms of the electroencephalogram (EEG) was validated and then used to compare the neurotolerability of gadobenate dimeglumine to that of gadodiamide, a well-documented CA for brain MRI. METHODS. Rats were prepared for EEG recording about 15 days before ischemia induction. Ischemia was induced in the right hemisphere by 2-hour middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion and 3-day reperfusion. Model validation in terms of EEG, on day 3 after MCA occlusion, was performed by using iopromide, a poorly neurotolerated iodinated CA in rats, intravenously injected at 7 g iodine/kg. The EEG recording was analyzed for pathological tracings and for changes in spectral content in terms of the frequency index (FI) at 1, 2, and 3 hours after test compound injection. The comparative study between gadobenate dimeglumine and gadodiamide was performed at 2.0 mmol/kg. D-Mannitol was used as a control compound. The presence of CA in the rat brain was verified by measuring the total gadolinium content by using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry analysis. Given the absence of metabolism for both CAs, the values of gadolinium content can be interpreted as representing unmetabolized CA. RESULTS. On days 1, 2, and 3 after transient MCA occlusion, the lesioned hemisphere of rats presented a decreased FI value with respect to the basal value. The unlesioned hemisphere, after a slight, nonsignificant decrease in the FI value on the first 2 days, presented a normal FI value on day 3. Thus, ischemic rats on day 3 after transient MCA occlusion were chosen for these neurotolerability studies. Iopromide injected intravenously into ischemic rats at a dose 10 times higher than the maximum clinical dose caused bilateral spikes on the EEG and increases in FI values for the unlesioned hemisphere without affecting the lesioned hemisphere. Gadobenate dimeglumine, like gadodiamide when injected into ischemic rats, did not cause spikes or further changes in the FI value of the lesioned hemisphere and did not modify the normal FI value of the unlesioned hemisphere. Furthermore, no significant differences between gadobenate dimeglumine, gadodiamide, and D-mannitol were found when postinjection FI values were compared, Finally, higher levels of gadolinium were found in the lesioned hemisphere with respect to the unlesioned hemisphere after both gadobenate dimeglumine and gadodiamide administration. CONCLUSIONS. We can therefore conclude that (1) on the EEG, ischemia induced by transient MCA occlusion is an appropriate model for evaluating CA neurotolerability because ischemic and CA effects can be clearly differentiated; (2) the higher level of CA in the lesioned hemisphere compared with the unlesioned one (two to three times), even 3 hours after injection, demonstrates that the CA effectively penetrated the brain; if it were neurotoxic, any negative effects would have been detected; and (3) gadobenate dimeglumine, like gadodiamide, injected intravenously at a dose 20 times higher than the intended clinical dose for brain MRI is well tolerated and, also like gadodiamide, is suitable for use in neurological diseases for which contrast-enhanced MRI is indicated.

Numerous converging observations showed that full REM-sleep and alert wakefulness exert strong inhibition. A critical zone of vigilance which is a transitional state between waking and non-REM (NREM) sleep, and NREM sleep and REM sleep, has a promoting effect on the absence type spike wave discharge. Spike wave discharges are associated with phasic arousals without awakening and are attached to oscillations on the microstructural level of sleep, perpetuated by cyclic arousal events known as 'cyclic alternating pattern' (CAP), especially within the critical zone, but also along the whole sleep process. More specifically SWD seems to be attached to the 'A-phase' of CAP which is a reactive one and reflects synchronised NREM sleep EEG elements, like K-complexes, spindles and delta groups. The more slow wave elements are found in phase A - like in subtype A1 - the more the coincidence with SWD occurs, and the more it is characterised by fast rhythms - as in subtype A2 and A3 - the less the association with SWD could be observed. Since subtype A1 is associated with the first sleep cycle and with the descending branches of cycles, it is concluded that SWD appear in those dynamic moments of vigilance level oscillations which were characterised by strong sleep-like answers to arousal influences in high sleep pressure periods of sleep cyclicity. These data harmonize with another line of evidence suggesting that SWD represent the epileptic variant of the complex thalamocortical system function which is the substrate of NREM sleep EEG phenomena. In idiopathic generalised epilepsy there is a growing body of evidence that as it was assumed by Gloor - spindles transform to SWD pattern, These data explain why those dynamic changes which evoke sleep responses are promoting for the occurrence of SWD. Adapting these data we offer a new interpretation to explain the strong activation effect of sleep deprivation in this kind of epilepsy. We assume that it is mainly due to the forced vigilance level oscillations, especially in morning, when elevated sleep pressure and circadian wake promoting forces, representing opposite tendencies, increase the amount of oscillations.

Methods: Twenty-three patients participated in the study. Phase synchronization indices based on the Hilbert transform were investigated on frequency bands 0.05-1 Hz, 1-4 Hz, 4-8 Hz. 8-12 Hz and 12-16 Hz for all pairs of the 9 EEG channels covering midline and frontal areas. A straight line was used to approximate the index values as a function of time and the Sign Test statistics were applied to the slope parameters. Results: Systematic phase synchronization changes were detected. Generally, phase synchronization in the sub-delta band decreased during the induction and increased during the recovery, while the directions were reversed in the alpha band. The changes were dependent on the channel pair. In the delta, theta and beta bands, the changes were aligned more irregularly than in the sub-delta or in the alpha bands. Highly asymmetric behavior between the induction and the recovery periods was also observed in these bands. Conclusions: Induction and recovery from propofol anesthesia changes the phase synchronization between the EEG channels. The passband and location-specific behavior of these changes reveals the effects of the anesthetic to the different neural mechanisms. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

They are characterized by a decrease of signal voltage with a marked increase of signal frequency (typically beyond 25 Hz). They have long been observed in stereoelectroencephalographic (SEEG) signals recorded with intra-cerebral electrodes, generally occurring at seizure onset and simultaneously involving distinct brain regions. Spectral properties of rapid ictal discharges as well as spatial correlations measured between SEEG signals generated from distant sites before, during and after these discharges were studied. Cross-correlation estimates within typical EEG sub-bands and statistical tests performed in 10 patients suffering from partial epilepsy (frontal, temporal or fronto-temporal) reveal that SEEG signals are significantly de-correlated during the discharge period compared with periods that precede and follow this discharge. These results can be interpreted as a functional decoupling of distant brain sites at seizure onset followed by an abnormally high re-coupling when the seizure develops. They lead to the concept of 'disruption' that is complementary of that of 'activation' (revealed by significantly high correlations between signals recorded during seizures), both giving insights into our understanding of pathophysiological processes involved in human partial epilepsies as well as in the interpretation of clinical semiology.

Results: We observed significant differences in the ERD/ERS responses between the first and second registration In all studied frequency bands when examined as a function of time and experimental task. The test-retest reliability of the ERD/ERS values was highest in the theta frequency range (4-6 and 6-8 Hz), poorer in the 8-10 Hz and poorest in the 10-12 Hz alpha frequency range. Conclusions: The test-retest effect was seen in the ERD/ERS responses of all studied frequency bands during an auditory memory task. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; hippocampus; medial temporal lobe; memory encoding; rhinal cortex	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ALPHA-DESYNCHRONIZATION; EPISODIC MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; TASK; EEG; PERFORMANCE	The hippocampus and the rhinal cortex, two substructures of the medial temporal lobe, together play a crucial role in human declarative memory formation. To investigate in detail the mechanism connecting these two structures transiently during memory formation we recorded depth EEG in epilepsy patients from within the hippocampus and the rhinal cortex. During this recording, patients performed a single-trial word list-learning paradigm with a free recall memory test following a distraction task. Rhinal-hippocampal EEG coherence and spectral power at both locations in the time interval up to 2 s after onset of word presentation were analysed in the frequency range 1-19 Hz. Successful as opposed to unsuccessful memory formation was associated with a general rhinal-hippocampal coherence enhancement, but without alterations in spectral power. Coherence increases in the theta range were correlated with the previously reported memory-related changes in rhinal-hippocampal gamma phase synchronization. This correlation may suggest an interaction of the two mechanisms during declarative memory formation. While theta coherence might be associated with slowly modulated coupling related to an encoding state, rhinal-hippocampal gamma synchronization may be more closely related to actual memory processes by enabling fast coupling and decoupling of the two structures.

The theories differed in predictions about the global and topographic effects of effective and ineffective forms of ECT on electroencephalogram (EEG) seizure expression. At the second treatment, 19-lead EEG recordings were obtained in 57 depressed patients randomized to conditions that differed in ECT electrode placement and stimulus dosage. Power in the delta frequency band was quantified during the seizure and analyzed with traditional multivariate methods and the Scaled Subprofile Model. Electrical dosage of the ECT stimulus had a powerful effect on ictal global delta power and, more so, than electrode placement. Greater ictal global delta power was associated with superior therapeutic outcome, but the magnitude of this effect was small. Effective forms of ECT resulted in a topography where delta power was accentuated in prefrontal EEG sites. High dosage right unilateral ECT also resulted in stronger asymmetry in prefrontal regions than the ineffective, low dosage right unilateral ECT. Greater bilateral generalization of seizure expression does not appear to be a prerequisite for therapeutic effects. Instead, more intense seizure expression in prefrontal regions may be critical for efficacy.

We recorded the EEG from 16 electrodes in 10 schizophrenics (6 males and 4 females) and 10 age-matched normal controls (10 males), and calculated their asymmetry indices. The asymmetry index shows which hemispheric activity is dominant through examination of interhemispheric pairs in the frequency domain with EEGs between two regions. We also estimated correlation dimension. Remarkably, lower dimensional complexities appeared on the brain regions, which had significantly lower brain activity, as determined by a lateral asymmetry analysis, in schizophrenics before sound and light (SL) stimulation. We may suggest the possibility of co-varying of both linear and non-linear properties. This co-varying phenomenon maintained after the SL stimulation. Furthermore, schizophrenic patients revealed opposite asymmetric patterns compared to normal controls, as well as reversal phenomena and abnormalities in the left frontal region when SL stimuli were applied.

In each trial a warning signal (S1) was followed 3 s later by an imperative signal (S2) to which the monkey had to respond to get a reward. The theta power in the prefrontal area 9 and the prelimbic area 32 was higher in the S1-S2 interval than in the pre-S1 period. This theta activity may be related to attentional processes and is probably a homologue of the human frontal midline theta (Fm theta) rhythms. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

We examined whether a comparable grouping of spindle and fast activity coinciding with slow oscillations can be found in human SWS. For negative and positive half-waves of slow oscillations (dominant frequency, 0.7-0.8 Hz) identified during SWS in humans (n = 13), wave-triggered averages of root mean square (rms) activity in the theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), spindle (12-15 Hz), and beta (15-25 Hz) range were formed. Slow positive half-waves were linked to a pronounced and widespread increase in rms spindle activity, averaging 0.63 +/- 0.065 muV (23.4%; p < 0.001, with reference to baseline) at the midline central electrode (Cz). In contrast, spindle activity was suppressed during slow negative half-waves, on average by -0.65 +/- 0.06 mu V at Cz (-22%; p < 0.001). An increase in spindle activity 400-500 msec after negative half-waves was more than twofold the increase during slow positive half-waves (p < 0.001). A similar although less pronounced dynamic was observed for beta activity, but not for alpha and theta frequencies. Discrete spindles identified during stages 2 and 3 of non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep coincided with a discrete slow positive half-wave-like potential preceded by a pronounced negative half-wave (p < 0.01). These results provide the first evidence in humans of grouping of spindle and beta activity during slow oscillations. They support the concept that phases of cortical depolarization during slow oscillations, reflected by surface-positive (depth-negative) field potentials, drive the thalamocortical spindle activity. The drive is particularly strong during cortical depolarization, expressed as surface-positive field potentials.

Here we suggest that selective attention facilitates synchronization of neural activity. Selective attention can be guided by bottom-up, stimulus driven, or top-down task-driven processes. Both processes will cause that stimuli are processed preferentially. While bottom-up processes might facilitate synchronization of neurons due to the salience of the stimulus, top-down processes may bias information selection by facilitating synchronization of neurons coding a certain location in space and/or of neurons related to the processing of certain features. Animal as well as human EEG studies support the notion of a link between induced gamma-band responses and attentive, sensory stimulus processing.

NEUROREPORT			English	Article						binding; EEG; gamma oscillations; music; phase synchronization	PERCEPTION; SYNCHRONIZATION; INTEGRATION	While listening to music, a significant high degree of phase synchrony in the gamma frequency range globally distributed over the brain was found in subjects with musical training (musicians) compared with subjects with no such training (nonmusicians). No significant differences were found in other EEG frequency bands. Listening to neutral text did not produce any significant differences in the degree of synchronization between these two groups. For musicians, left-hemispheric dominance was found during listening to music. The right hemisphere was found to be dominant for non-musicians in text listening. The high degree of synchronization in musicians could be due to their high ability to retrieve musical patterns from their acoustic memory, which is a cogent condition for both listening to and anticipating musical sounds.

These functions were compared in order to test their quality to represent spikes in the ECoG. The energy based on the wavelet coefficients to different scales was also calculated. The best results were found with the biorthogonal-6.8 wavelet on 5-7 scales, which gave 0.92 sensitivity, but with a high percentage of false positives; this representation was highly correlated with spike events on time and duration. To improve these results we have studied the wavelet packet coefficients energy. We found that reconstruction wavelet packet coefficients at 4 and 9 nodes contain significant information to characterize the spike event. These nodes' reconstruction coefficients were multiplied and this product was highly correlated with spikes events on time and duration. With this procedure we improved the sensitivity up to 0.96 with the same biorthogonal-6.8 wavelet at four levels. With this technique we do not sacrifice computation time: 896 samples are processed at only 0.16 s, so that it is possible to show the spike scattering path on line, because 896 samples (7 s)/16 channels are processed at 3.13 s.

Eleven participants completed four 2-hr blocks of a mock anti-air-warfare task, in which they were required to examine and remember target classifications (friend/enemy) for subsequent prosecution (fire upon/allow to pass), while targets moved steadily toward two centrally located ship icons. Target density served as the task workload variable; between one and nine targets were simultaneously present on the display. For each participant, moving estimates of blink frequency and duration, fixation frequency and dwell time, saccadic extent, and mean pupil diameter integrated over periods of 10 to 20 s, demonstrated systematic changes as a function of target density. Nonlinear regression analyses found blink frequency, fixation frequency, and pupil diameter to be the most predictive variables relating eye activity to target density. Participant-specific artificial neural network models, developed through training on two or three sessions and subsequently tested on a different session from the same participant, correlated well with actual target density levels (mean R = 0.66). Results indicate that moving mean estimation and artificial neural network techniques enable information from multiple eye measures to be combined to produce reliable near-real-time indicators of workload in some visuospatial tasks. Potential applications include the monitoring of visual activity of system operators for indications of visual workload and scanning efficiency.

The data showed that the amplitude and phase of laminar profiles of TLA recorded in vitro were the same as the type III theta profiles recorded in in vivo rat preparations. These results supported the conclusion that the neural mechanisms involved in the generation of theta field activity in in vivo preparations and the generation of TLA in in vitro preparations were similar. The study provided further validation for the use of carbachol in vitro slice preparation as a model for studying the neural circuitry underlying theta generation in the hippocampal formation.

The concept of spatial synchronization of nervous processes developed by M.N. Livanov is applied to neurophysiological analysis of higher brain functions. However, the spatial synchronization of brain potentials is only a condition for information processing and does not represent it as such. This imposes restrictions on conclusions about the neural mechanisms of consciousness. It is more adequate to use the concept of spatial synchronization in views of consciousness as a psychophysiological level along with sub- and superconsciousness in three-level structure of mind according to P.V. Simonov. Forms of consciousness interaction with other levels concern the problem of altered consciousness and may be reflected in various patterns of spatial organization of brain potentials.

Brain activity was monitored by EEG. The effects of lindane and picrotoxin on EEG pattern of rats as well as on hippocampal amino acid and nucleotide status were studied in 0-50 min, 50-100 min and 100-150 min periods post-dosing. Significant decreases in Glu and Asp were found after picrotoxin treatment. After 50-100 min post-dosing, hippocampal hypoxanthine and inosine levels increased to both lindane (10 mg/kg) and picrotoxin whereas xanthine and uridine levels increased to picrotoxin, only. Lindane elicited a dose-dependent occurrence of negative spikes accompanied with rhythmic activity at 4-5 Hz. The picrotoxin-induced 4-5 Hz activity did not display negative sharp waves and was accompanied by 10 Hz oscillations.

The integrated graphical user interface (GUI) and the signal processing algorithms were developed and implemented in MATLAB. This environment provides the facility to import or read sleep data (ECG, EEG, blood pressure, respiratory, oxygen saturation, etc.) under user control and displays them individually or collectively in a data window for visual inspection. It then enables the user to clip the length of data to be used in carrying out the analysis. Raw ECG data is preprocessed for reliable QRS detection and the HRV signal is derived following the guidelines of the Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society fir Pacing and Electrophysiology, which is then displayed along with respiration signal in the analysis window. After this step time-domain, frequency-domain, and nonlinear dynamics analyses of the HRV signal are performed to extract sensitive measures used in detecting and diagnosing sleep disordered breathing. The computer analysis can then generate a complete report for the specialist and further statistical and/or automatic analyses. The system was developed and validated using data from the MIT-BIH Polysomnographic Database. After validation and reliability testing it was used to analyze sleep data for detection of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in children. Data from normal and children diagnosed with SDB showed that the system could potentially distinguish between normal children and children suffering from sleep disordered breathing.

Part IV: Multicortical patterns of amplitude modulation in gamma EEG	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIFURCATION AND CHAOS			English	Review						binding; gamma band; neurodynamics; phase transition; spatial EEG patterns; synchronization	OLFACTORY EEG; STATE TRANSITIONS; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; PHASE; SYNCHRONIZATION; BEHAVIOR; OSCILLATIONS; CORTEX	The aim of this study is to find spatial patterns of EEG amplitude in the gamma range of the EEGs from multiple sensory and limbic areas that demonstrate multisensory convergence and integration. 64 electrodes spread in small arrays were fixed on or in the olfactory, visual, auditory, somatomotor and entorhinal areas of cats and rabbits. The subjects were trained to discriminate 2 visual and then 2 auditory conditioned stimuli, one reinforced (CS+), the other not (CS-). A moving window was applied to the 6-s records from 20 trials of each CS including a 3-s prestimulus control (CS0). The root mean square amplitude was calculated for each signal in the gamma range, so each window gave a point in 64-space. EEG patterns from the CS+, CS- and CS0 conditions gave 3 clusters of points in 64-space. The Euclidean distance of each point to the nearest center of gravity of a cluster served for classification and estimation of the probability of correct classification. The results showed that the gamma activity (35-60 Hz in cats, 20-80 Hz in rabbits) in all five areas formed global patterns of amplitude modulation (AM) in time windows lasting similar to100-200 ms and recurring at 2-4 Hz, which were correctly classified above chance levels (p < 0.01). All areas contributed information to the AM patterns that served to classify the EEG epochs in the windows with respect to the conditioned stimuli. In conclusion, multisensory integration took place over the greater part of the hemisphere, despite lack of phase coherence among the gamma waves. The integration occurred rapidly enough that, within 300 ms of CS onset, activity in every sensory area was modified by what took place in every other sensory area.

We performed dual neuron-glia intracellular recordings together with multisite field potential recordings from cortical suprasylvian association areas 5 and 7 of cats under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia. Electrical stimuli applied to the cortex elicited responses consisting of a biphasic depolarization in glial cells, which was associated with an EPSP-IPSP sequence in neurons. During the slow (<1 Hz) oscillation, extracellular measurements of the potassium concentration revealed periodic increases with an amplitude of 1-2 mM, similar in shape to glial activities. We suggest that, through their uptake mechanisms, glia cells modulate the neuronal excitability and contribute to the pacing of the slow oscillation. The slow oscillation often evolved into SW paroxysms, mimicking sleep-triggered seizures. This transition was associated with increased coupling between the depolarizing events in neurons and glial cells. During seizures, the glial membrane potential displayed phasic negative events related to the onset of the paroxysmal depolarizing shifts in neurons. These events were not voltage dependent and increased their incidence and amplitude with the development of the seizure. It is suggested that the intraglial transient negativities represent field reflections of synchronized neuronal potentials. We propose that the mechanisms underlying the neuron-glia communication include, besides the traditional neurotransmitter- and ion-mediated pathways, field effects crossing their membranes as a function of the state of the cortical network.

J	Kirk, IJ; Mackay, JC				Kirk, IJ; Mackay, JC			The role of theta-range oscillations in synchronising and integrating activity in distributed mnemonic networks	CORTEX			English	Review						memory; theta; human EEG; hippocampus; thalamus; hypothalamus	HEAD-DIRECTION CELLS; MAMMILLARY COMPLEX INVITRO; ANTERIOR THALAMIC NUCLEI; RHYTHMICAL SLOW ACTIVITY; HIGHER BRAIN-FUNCTION; FREELY MOVING RATS; HIPPOCAMPAL-THETA; SUPRAMAMMILLARY NUCLEUS; RABBITS SEPTUM; MEDIAL SEPTUM	It is well established that the occurrence of theta rhythm in the hippocampus is important in a variety of mnemonic tasks. However, in this review it will be argued that theta-rhythmic activity occurs across distributed networks within the diencephalon and neocortex as well as the hippocampus, and functions to temporally coordinate activity in distributed systems within these regions during mnemonic processes. Recent evidence strongly suggests that theta-range cellular activity occurs in the supramammillary nucleus (SuM) of the hypothalamus, and that this activity is independent of that occurring in the hippocampus. We have previously proposed in fact, that the frequency of theta activity in the hippocampus is determined in the SuM, rather than in the medial septum as previously assumed. The frequency-coded information from the SuM is then fed into at least two recurrent networks proposed by Aggleton and Brown (1999). Theta activity in these networks (the hippocampo-anterior thalamic system and the perirhinal-mediodorsal thalamic system) could potentially occur independently, but when simultaneously occurring in both may function to coordinate the integration of information in the two systems. Finally, we suggest that as the two systems include temporal and frontal neocortical areas that contribute to surface EEG, scalp recording of theta EEG activity from these regions may provide a "window" through which to assess the relative involvement of different cortico-limbic circuits in different mnemonic processes. The potential utility of this technique will be increased greatly by the use of high-density EEG and algorithms to more precisely map the topography of cortical Sources of EEG activity.

The present association study was designed to test whether EEG and ERPs are modulated by genetic variations of the human GABA(A) beta2 (GABRB2) and gamma2 (GABRG2) genes on chromosome 5q33. The genotypes of two nucleotide substitution polymorphisms of the GABRB2 and GABRG2 genes were assessed in 95 psychiatrically healthy subjects of German descent. Neurophysiological phenotyping was performed with four factorized EEG/ERP parameters: EEG activation, anterior and posterior EEG synchronization, and event-related activity (N100/P200-complex). No genotypic association was found for the GABRB2 nucleotide exchange polymorphism with any electrophysiological parameter. A significant association was found between the genotype of the intronic GABRG2 G-->A nucleotide exchange and the event-related N100/P200 (ANOVA: F=3.81; df=2; P=0.026). A comparison of homozygous subjects carrying either the G/G or A/A genotype of the GABRG2 polymorphism consistently revealed an even stronger difference in the effect-size (ANOVA: F=11.13; df=1; P=0.002). Post hoc analysis of this association with current density analysis in three-dimensional neuroanatomic Talairach space-time showed a reduction in the event-related signal power after 120 ms in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Taking into account the risk of false-positive association findings attributable to multiple testing, our results encourage further replication studies to examine the phenotype-genotype relationship of GABRG2 gene variants and event-related prefrontal activity.

These changes in cortical EEC patterns depend mainly on two factors: on the input from the thalamus and on the state of various membrane channels in the cortical pyramidal cells, which are both regulated by ascending modulatory systems. Several lines of evidence indicate that of the activating systems the cholinergic is the most effective in activating the cortex, its blockade with atropine induces large slow waves in the EEG, while inhibition of other systems has no such profound effect. The effect of atropine can be mimicked by lesioning the basal forebrain. Neurons in this area show very close tonic and phasic correlation with the cortical EEG, further supporting the suggestion that projections of these neurons have a special role in the regulation of cortical activity. However, there is a discrepancy between the effects of excitotoxic and selective cholinotoxic lesions of the basal forebrain. The immunohistochemical diversity of the corticopetal basal forebrain projection and the electrophysiological heterogeneity of the neurons also indicate that, in addition to cholinergic cells, other types of neurons do also participate in the regulation of cortical activity from this area. To understand the intimate details the activity of identified basal forebrain neurons must be recorded and correlated with cortical events. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Activation during Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST) is a common approach used in functional neuroimaging to address this failure. Equally, current knowledge states that oscillations are basic forms of cells-assembly communications during mental activity. Promising results were revealed in a previous study assessing healthy subjects, WCST and oscillations. However, those previous studies failed to meet the functional integration of the network during the WCST in schizophrenics, based on the induced oscillations and their distributed cortical sources. In this research, we utilized the brain electrical tomography (variable-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography) technique to accomplish this goal. Task specific delta, theta, alpha and beta-2 oscillations were induced and simultaneously synchronized over large extensions of cortex, encompassing prefrontal, temporal and posterior regions as in healthy subjects. Every frequency had a well-defined network involving a variable number of areas and sharing some of them. Oscillations at 11.5, 5.0 and 30 Hz seem to reflect an abnormal increase or decrease, being located at supplementary motor area (SMA), left occipitotemporal region (OT), and right frontotemporal subregions (RIFT), respectively. Three cortical areas appeared to be critical, that may lead to difficulties either in coordinating/sequencing the input/output of the prefrontal networks-SMA, and retention of information in memory-RIFT, both preceded or paralleled by a deficient visual information processing-OT.

J	Dorokhov, VB				Dorokhov, VB			Alpha bursts and K-complex: Phasic activation pattern during spontaneous recovery of correct psychomotor performance at different stages of drowsiness	ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA			Russian	Article						drowsiness stages; performance errors; EEG phasic activation; pattern; alpha bursts; K-complex	SLEEP ONSET; AROUSAL; MOVEMENTS; CONSCIOUSNESS; OSCILLATION; HIERARCHY; AWARENESS; FEATURES; HUMANS; BRAIN	It is known that phasic activation processes reveal themselves by different electrophysiological patterns depending on the sleep depth. Alpha bursts are an electrophysiological manifestation of arousal at the initial stage of sleep, whereas at the II stage K-complex becomes the main arousal pattern. We have shown earlier that during light drowsiness spontaneous recovery of correct psychomotor test performance (after an error) by a sitting subject is accompanied by EEG alpha bursts. The aim of this work was to study the EEG phasic activation pattern at deeper drowsiness during test performance by a subject in a lying position. Subjects had to press a sensitive button in a lying position with closed eyes with self-paced oral counting of pressings. The experiment lasted for 40 min; EEG, EOG, and button pressings were recorded. It was shown that recovery of correct performance after errors at deeper drowsiness was accompanied by two types of EEG phasic activation patterns (PAP-1 and PAP-2). The alpha frequency component was always present in both PAP-1 and PAP-2. PAP-1 were observed at early stages of drowsiness and consisted of high-amplitude alpha bursts and EEG activity of higher frequency. PAP-2 were recorded at deeper stages and consisted of K-complexes with superposition of PAP-1. At first (medium level of drowsiness) the alpha bursts were superposed on the late slow K-complex components. With further deepening of drowsiness the early fast components of K-complex were also observed. The early appearance of K-complex during test performance at drowsiness seems to be associated with the urgent run of brain arousal systems, which at spontaneous falling asleep are in operation at the II sleep stage.

Any disruption affecting temporality would result in distortion of cognitive activity. Dreaming during paradoxical sleep (PS) shows cognitive alterations that mimic frontal lobe dysfunction, Decreased temporal coupling of EEG between frontal and perceptual regions was hypothesized. The main objective was to explore temporal relationships of fast activity among these regions. Design: N/A Setting: N/A Participants: 8 young adults, Interventions: N/A Measurements and Results: Interhemispheric (INTERr) and intrahemispheric (INTRAr) EEG correlation spectra (1-50 Hz) were obtained for wakefulness, stage 2, stage 4, and PS during the second night spent at the laboratory. INTERr showed a significant overall increase during sleep in comparison to wakefulness, whereas INTRAr of fast activity (27-48 Hz) between frontal-perceptual regions (F-P, F-O, F-T, FpP, Fp-T) decreased exclusively during PS while INTRAr among perceptual regions (P-O, P-T, O-T) maintained wakefulness values. Conclusions: Present results demonstrate state- and frequency-dependent shifts on temporal coupling. The hypothesized decrease in correlation of fast activity between frontal and perceptual regions during PS was confirmed, This decrease of temporal coupling might underlie the lass of voluntary direction of thinking and congruence with social and temporal context and the lack of judgment and passive acceptance of bizarreness during PS dreaming. The wakefulness levels in correlation of fast activity among perceptual regions might explain perceptual acuity during PS dreaming.

The correlations between the resting EEG spectral parameter and personality scores reveal the distinctly different profiles of cortex area connectivity which accompany personality traits in the theta1,2 and beta2 bands mostly. More significant changes in power and coherence were associated with the sensation-intuition scores. High IQ groups are characterised by an increase of power in the right hemisphere, and low IQ groups have an opposite effect of the left hemisphere dominance; a power of the thetal,2 and alphal-rhythms is less while beta2-greater in groups with high IQ rather than low IQ; the groups with high IQ as compared with low IQ groups have higher interhemispheric coherence. General effects of an interaction between personality and intelligence factors are: (i) the most part of the personality associated differences of cortex activity is observed in high IQ groups; (ii) mostly three considered psychological characteristics (extraversion, neuroticism, sensation) by various means modulate an oscillations of neuronal networks relating to intelligence score. The results suggest that EEG spectral parameters in rest might reflect the relationships between neuronal integration and personality/intelligence factors. The significance of these results is discussed with reference to the hemispheric interactions in arousal and attentional processes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Method: The haptic exploration tasks consisted of palpating the structure of six sunken reliefs in sequence with both hands, eyes closed. After each exploration, the structure was reproduced on a piece of paper. A 19-channel digital electroencephalogram (EEG; linked ears) was continuously re corded during rest and haptic tasks for 10 AN patients (females, mean age: 15.90) and 10 healthy controls (CO; females, mean age: 16.14). Mean spectral power density was calculated as the mean amplitude of the spectral lines of the theta band (4-8 Hz). The AN patients were examined again after weight gain (T-0 and T-1). Results: The reproductions submitted by the AN patients were of notably poorer quality than those of the CO. Reproduction quality was unchanged after weight gain and independent of body mass index and intelligence. Mean exploration time was similiar in AN patients and CO. The analysis of spectral EEG power of both groups showed significant decrease in power data in the theta frequency band during haptic exploration compared with the rest intervals. The comparison of the theta power between CO and AN patients during haptic exploration showed major differences between the groups in both T-0 and T-1. Theta power was lower in AN patients than in the CO over the right hemisphere and right parietal regions. Discussion: The quality of reproduction of the haptic stimuli and the theta-power changes indicate a cortical dysfunction and deficits in somatosensory integration processing of the right parietal cortex in AN patients even after weight gain.

We present a multichannel classification method that uses a "committee" of artificial neural networks to do this. The classification method automatically finds spatial regions on the skull relevant for the classification task. Depending on subject, correct recognition of intended movement was achieved in 75%-98% of trials not seen previously by the committee, on the basis of single EEGs of one-second duration. Frequency filtering did not improve recognition. Classification was optimal during the actual movement, but a first peak in the classification success rate was observed in all subjects already when they had been cued which movement later to perform.

J	Marshall, L; Molle, M; Born, J				Marshall, L; Molle, M; Born, J			Spindle and slow wave rhythms at slow wave sleep transitions are linked to strong shifts in the cortical direct current potential	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; human; delta activity; beta activity; thalamocortical system; neuromodulatory systems	CEREBRAL-CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVATION; COHERENCE; THALAMUS; HORMONE; STATES; NREM	Electroencephalographic activity at the transition from wakefulness to sleep is characterized by the appearance of spindles (12-15 Hz) and slow wave rhythms including delta activity (1-4 Hz) and slow oscillations (0.2-1 Hz). While these rhythms originate within neocortico-thalamic circuitry, their emergence during the passage into slow wave sleep (SWS) critically depends on the activity of neuromodulatory systems. Here, we examined the temporal relationships between these electroencephalogram rhythms and the direct current (DC) potential recorded from the scalp in healthy men (n=10) using cross-correlation analyses. Analyses focused on transitions from wakefulness to SWS in the beginning of the sleep period, and from SWS to lighter sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep at the end of the first sleep cycle. For spindle, delta and slow oscillatory activity strong negative correlations with the DC potential were found at the transition into SWS with peak correlation coefficients (at zero time lag) averaging r=-0.81, -0.88 and -0.88, respectively (P<0.001). Though slightly lower, distinct negative correlations between these measures were also found at the transition from SWS to REM sleep (-0.78, -0.77 and -0.77, respectively, P<0.001). Fast oscillatory activity in the beta frequency band (15-25 Hz) was correlated positively with the DC potential (r=+0.75, P<0.05, at the passage to SWS). Data indicate close links between increasing spindle, delta and slow oscillatory activity and the occurrence of a steep surface negative cortical DC potential shift during the transition from wake to SWS. Likewise, a DC potential shift toward surface positivity accompanies the disappearance of these oscillatory phenomena at the end of the non-REM sleep period. The DC potential shifts may reflect gradual changes in extracellular ionic (Ca2+) concentration resulting from the generation of spindle and slow wave rhythms, or influences of neuromodulating systems on cortical excitability thereby controlling the emergence of cortical spindle and slow wave rhythms at SWS transitions.

The design of the model has a general organization corresponding to that hypothesized by neurobiologists. The cerebellar circuitry is modeled as a dynamical system using cell prototypes similar to the ones used in artificial neural networks, whereas the olivary cells were represented with simple 'on/off' units. The model works as a unit that converts the irregular and low frequency spikes originating from the olivary cells into regular spikes at 40 Hz at the level of the dentate cells. The success of the model indicates that the olivocerebellar circuitry has the physiological properties to be able to generate such rhythmic activity.

In the investigation of underlying mechanisms, mainly rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and slow-wave sleep have been considered. More recently, sleep stage 2 with sleep spindles as a most prominent feature has received increasing attention. Specifically, in rats hippocampal ripples were found to occur in temporal proximity to cortical sleep spindles, indicating an information transfer between the hippocampus and neocortex, which is supposed to underlie the consolidation of declarative memories during sleep. This study in humans looks at the changes in EEG activity during nocturnal sleep after extensive training on a declarative learning task, as compared with a nonlearning control task of equal visual stimulation and subjectively rated cognitive strain. Time spent in each sleep stage, spindle density, and EEG power spectra for 28 electrode locations were determined. During sleep after training, the density of sleep spindles was significantly higher after the learning task as compared with the nonlearning control task. This effect was largest during the first 90 min of sleep (p < 0.01). Additionally, spindle density was correlated to recall performance both before and after sleep (r = 0.56; p < 0.05). Power spectra and time spent in sleep stages did not differ between learning and nonlearning conditions. Results indicate that spindle activity during non-REM sleep is sensitive to previous learning experience.

Spatial learning can be improved in medial septal (MS)-lesioned mice by metrifonate, a cholinesterase inhibitor. We designed this study to investigate the effects of metrifonate on the hippocampal theta oscillation of intact and MS-lesioned mice. Intact and MS-lesioned C57BL mice were treated with acute injections of metrifonate (doses: 15, 50 and 100 mg/kg ip). These included a dose that considerably improved spatial memory of MS-lesioned mice in our earlier study. In addition, subtype selective muscarinic agents, BIBN-99, AF267B and AF 150(S) were used. Recordings of hippocampal theta during movement and awake immobility revealed a dramatic reduction of theta in the lesioned animals. Metrifonate induced prominent changes in the EEG of intact mice, but not of MS-lesioned mice. The effect of metrifonate was not mimicked by two selective M-1-agonists and was augmented by a combined injection of a selective M-2-antagonist. These data suggest that improved spatial learning by the cholinesterase inhibitor metrifonate is unrelated to its effects on the hippocampal EEG. These two effects may be mediated through different muscarinic receptor subtypes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

We have studied sleep in these mice under baseline conditions and following treatment with the benzodiazepine midazolam. Under baseline conditions, NREM sleep time did not differ between beta(3) subunit knockout mice and wild type mice, while REM sleep time was significantly lower in knockout mice than in wild type mice during the light portion of a 24-h light-dark cycle. In constant dark conditions, circadian rhythmicity remained intact in mutant mice for a period of at least 9 days. EEG delta power (1-4 Hz) was significantly greater in the knockout than in wild type mice during NREM sleep but not during other states. A transient increase in EEG power in the 12-16 Hz range that occurred in wild type mice just prior to the transition from NREM to REM sleep was present but significantly blunted in the knockout. Midazolam decreased NREM delta power and REM time in wild type mice. The former but not the latter response to midazolam was intact in the knockout. These results further support a role for GABAergic transmission in regulating REM sleep and EEG spectral phenomena associated with NREM sleep. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

These simulations include consideration of dendritic and synaptic dynamics, AMPA, NMDA, and GABA receptors, and intracortical and cortical/subcortical interactions. We speculate on the way in which Hebbian learning and intrinsic reinforcement processes might complement the brain dynamics thus explained, to produce elementary cognitive operations.

Based on the association between theta activity (4-7 Hz) and working memory performance, and sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) activity (12-15 Hz) and attentional processing, we investigated the possibility that training healthy individuals to enhance either of these frequencies would specifically influence a particular aspect of cognitive performance, relative to a non-neurofeedback control-group. The results revealed that after eight sessions of neurofeedback the SMR-group were able to selectively enhance their SMR activity, as indexed by increased SMR/theta and SMR/beta ratios. In contrast, those trained to selectively enhance theta activity failed to exhibit any changes in their EEG. Furthermore, the SMR-group exhibited a significant and clear improvement in cued recall performance, using a semantic working memory task, and to a lesser extent showed improved accuracy of focused attentional processing using a 2-sequence continuous performance task. This suggests that normal healthy individuals can learn to increase a specific component of their EEG activity, and that such enhanced activity may facilitate semantic processing in a working memory task and to a lesser extent focused attention. We discuss possible mechanisms that could mediate such effects and indicate a number of directions for future research. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Maintained reciprocal thalamocortical connectivity was demonstrated by VB stimulation, which elicited orthodromic and antidromic responses in the cortex, along with re-entry of thalamocortical firing originating in VB neurons excited by cortical output activity. In addition, orthodromic responses were recorded in VB and RTN following stimuli delivered in the cortex. Spontaneous and stimulus-induced coherent rhythmic oscillations (duration = 0.4-3.5 s; frequency = 9-16 Hz) occurred in cortex, VB, and RTN during application of medium containing low concentrations of the K+ channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (0.5-1 mu M). This activity, which resembled electroencephalograph (EEG) spindles recorded in vivo, disappeared in both cortex and thalamus during application of the excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist kynurenic acid in VB (n = 6). By contrast, cortical application of kynurenic acid (n = 4) abolished spindle-like oscillations at this site, but not those recorded in VB, where their frequency was higher than under control conditions. Our findings demonstrate the preservation of reciprocally interconnected cortical and thalamic neuron networks that generate thalamocortical spindle-like oscillations in an in vitro rat brain slice. As shown in intact animals, these oscillations originate in the thalamus where they are presumably caused by interactions between RTN and VB neurons. We propose that this preparation may help to analyze thalamocortical synchronization and to understand the physiopathogenesis of absence attacks.

Because of the paucity of information on the network patterns of the mouse hippocampus, we investigated the electrical patterns in the behaving animal using multisite silicon probes and wire tetrodes. Theta (6-9 Hz) and gamma (40-100 Hz) oscillations were present during exploration and rapid eye movement sleep. Gamma power and theta power were comodulated and gamma power varied as a function of the theta cycle. Pyramidal cells and putative interneurons were phase-locked to theta oscillations. During immobility, consummatory behaviors and slow-wave sleep, sharp waves were present in cornu ammonis region CA1 of the hippocampus stratum radiatum associated with 140-200-Hz "ripples" in the pyramidal cell layer and population burst of CA1 neurons. In the hilus, large-amplitude "dentate spikes" occurred in association with increased discharge of hilar neurons. The amplitude of field patterns was larger in the mouse than in the rat, likely reflecting the higher neuron density in a smaller brain. We suggest that the main hippocampal network patterns are mediated by similar pathways and mechanisms in mouse and rat. (C) 2003 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recent findings suggest the presence of two principal modes of synchronised activity within the human subthalamo-pallidal-thalamo-cortical circuit, at <30 Hz and >60 Hz. These oscillations are dynamically and systematically modulated by task, thereby suggesting a functional role in movement. More importantly, the two frequency modes are inversely affected by movement, consistent with opposing actions, and differentially expressed according to the prevailing level of dopaminergic activity. It is argued that the balance between these modes determines the effects of basal ganglia-thalamocortical projections on the motor areas of the cortex. The lower frequency oscillations facilitate slow idling rhythms in the motor areas of the cortex, whereas synchronisation at high frequency restores dynamic task-related cortical ensemble activity in the gamma band.

We investigated the functional relevance of gamma band activity for the perception of auditory objects. An auditory experiment was performed as an analog to the Kanizsa experiment in the visual modality, comprising four different coherent and non-coherent stimuli. For the first time functional differences of evoked gamma band activity due to the perception of these stimuli were demonstrated by various methods (localization of sources, wavelet analysis and independent component analysis, ICA). Responses to coherent stimuli were found to have more features in common compared to non-coherent stimuli (e.g. closer located sources and smaller number of ICA components). The results point to the existence of a pitch processor in the auditory pathway. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Measurements of total EEG oscillation power characterizing epileptiform episodes showed that within an initial period (first 16 sec) of the epileptiform activity this parameter somewhat decreased in all the examined brain structures (by 10 %, as compared with that at sham TCMS). Within a final 16-sec-long segment of the epileptiform activity. when the latter decayed, such differences were preserved in the hippocampus and occipital and frontal cortices. Analysis of modifications of EEG spectral components in various brain structures showed that the powers of theta-, beta-. and gamma -rhythms dropped most noticeably, while the delta -rhythm power increased. Thus, the mechanisms of TCMS-induced anti-epileptic effects can be related to activation of the mechanisms responsible for delta -rhythmogenesis.

We assume that this is what happens in the brain with regard to epilepsy. We consider that neuronal networks involved in epilepsy possess multistable dynamics (i.e., they may display several dynamic states). To illustrate this concept, we may assume, for simplicity, that at least two states are possible: an interictal one characterized by a normal, apparently random, steady-state of ongoing activity, and another one that is characterized by the paroxysmal occurrence of a synchronous oscillations (seizure). Methods: By using the terminology of the mathematics of nonlinear systems, we can say that such a bistable system has two attractors, to which the trajectories describing the system's output converge, depending on initial conditions and on the system's parameters. In phase-space, the basins of attraction corresponding to the two states are separated by what is called a "separatrix." We propose, schematically, that the transition between the normal ongoing and the seizure activity can take place according to three basic models: Model I: In certain epileptic brains (e.g., in absence seizures of idiopathic primary generalized epilepsies), the distance between "normal steady-state" and "paroxysmal" attractors is very small in contrast to that of a normal brain (possibly due to genetic and/or developmental factors). In the former, discrete random fluctuations of some variables can be sufficient for the occurrence of a transition to the paroxysmal state. In this case, such seizures are not predictable. Model II and model III: In other kinds of epileptic brains (e.g., limbic cortex epilepsies), the distance between "normal steady-state" and "paroxysmal" attractors is, in general, rather large, such that random fluctuations, of themselves, are commonly not capable of triggering a seizure. However, in these brains, neuronal networks have abnormal features characterized by unstable parameters that are very vulnerable to the influence of endogenous (model II) and/or exogenous (model III) factors. In these cases, these critical parameters may gradually change with time, in such a way that the attractor can deform either gradually or suddenly, with the consequence that the distance between the basin of attraction of the normal state and the separatrix tends to zero. This can lead, eventually, to a transition to a seizure. Results: The changes of the system's dynamics preceding a seizure in these models either may be detectable in the EEG and thus the route to the seizure may be predictable, or may be unobservable by using only measurements of the dynamical state. It is thinkable, however, that in some cases, changes in the excitability state of the underlying networks may be uncovered by using appropriate stimuli configurations before changes in the dynamics of the ongoing EEG activity are evident. A typical example of model III that we discuss here is photosensitive epilepsy. Conclusions: We present an overview of these basic models, based on neurophysiologic recordings combined with signal analysis and on simulations performed by using computational models of neuronal networks.

Generally, an LMS algorithm makes possible the tracking of parameters for nonstationary time series. Our estimation incorporates multiple process observations that improve the accuracy of the parameter estimation. As a consequence, the estimation sequences come close to the true model parameters with a fast adaptation speed. This advantage also holds true of spectral quantities (e.g., the momentary coherence), which are derived from the model parameters. Thus the extension of the ARMA fitting from one to multiple trajectories allows the investigation of nonstationary biological signals with an increased time resolution. The applicability of the algorithm is demonstrated for event-related EEG coherence analysis of the Sternberg task. The changing interaction between posterior association cortex and anterior brain area was shown for verbal and nonverbal stimuli by means of the time-variant theta coherence.

Methods: One hundred and seventy-four subjects performed a delayed response task. They had to remember the spatial location of a target stimulus on a computer screen for a 1 or a 4 s retention interval. The target either remained visible throughout the entire interval (sensory trials) or disappeared after 150 ms (memory trials). Changes in induced band power (IBP) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) were analyzed in 4 narrow, individually adjusted frequency bands between 4 and 12 Hz. Results: After presentation of the target stimulus, a phasic power increase was found, irrespective of condition and delay interval, in the lower (roughly, 4-8 Hz) frequency bands, with a posterior maximum. During the retention interval, sustained occipital-parietal alpha power increase and frontal theta power decrease were found. Most importantly, the memory trials showed larger IBP? decreases in the theta band over frontal electrodes than the sensory trials. Conclusions: The phasic power increase following target onset is interpreted to reflect encoding of the target location. The sustained theta decrease, which is larger for memory trials, is tentatively interpreted to reflect visuo-spatial working memory processes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Spike-and-wave (SW) seizures in these rats are characterized by generalized 7-10 Hz spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) on the EEG. All neurons recorded in intralaminar thalamic nuclei during spontaneous SWDs showed high-frequency (average 368 Hz, range 200-500 Hz), burst-like activity, which occurred in a highly synchronized fashion with every SWD or with alternating SWD-complexes. Burst discharges in intralaminar neurons were delayed by 13.1 ms (CL) and 12.7 ms (PC), with respect to the spike component of a given SWD on the EEG, whereas burst discharges in the ventrobasal thalamus (VB) and in the rostral nucleus reticularis thalami (rRT) preceded the spike component by 17.8 ms and 8.3 ms, respectively. The onset of SWDs on the EEG was preceded by a tonic firing pattern (20-50 Hz) in about one third of CL and PC neurons. Microiontophoretic application of the gamma -aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline aggravated, whereas, the glutamate receptor antagonists DNQX and APV dampened, SWD-related discharges in PC and CL; the GABA(B) receptor antagonist CGP 35347 had no measurable effect. These data indicate that intrathalamic nuclei are recruited rhythmically during SWDs, through mechanisms that seem to rely on a delayed glutamatergic excitation modulated by GABAergic influences, rather than a GABA-mediated rebound burst activity typical of relay cells. The finding of a temporal delay of SWD-related activity in intrathalamic, compared with 'specific' thalamic relay nuclei, does not support the notion of a leading or pacemaker role in SWD generation. It is, however, rather suggestive of a function of intrathalamic neurons during synchronization and maintenance of neuronal oscillations, and these intrathalamic neurons may be recruited through glutamatergic corticofugal inputs.

We assessed the relationship between different patterns of activity in cortico-striatal (C-S) cells and the electrical behavior of SONs in vivo. Intracellular activities of rat G-S neurons in the orofacial motor cortex and of SONs, located in the projection field of this cortical region, were recorded under different anesthetics, which generate various temporal patterns of cortical activity. A surface electroencephalogram (EEG) of the orofacial motor cortex was simultaneously performed with intracellular recordings and EEG waves were used as correlates of a coherent synaptic activity in cortical neurons. Under barbiturate anesthesia C-S neurons showed rhythmic (5-7 Hz) supra-threshold depolarizations in phase with large amplitude EEG waves. The correlative activity of SONs was characterized by large amplitude oscillation-like synaptic depolarizations that could trigger action potentials. Under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia C-S neurons exhibited a step-like behavior consisting of depolarizing plateaus (up states), leading to multiple spike discharges, interrupted by hyperpolarizing periods (down states). The related activity of SONs was step-like membrane potential fluctuations with firing confined to the early part of the striatal up state. In C-S neurons and SONs up states coincided with slow recurrent EEG waves (similar to1 Hz). Finally, under neurolept-analgesia an apparently disorganized EEG activity was associated with a lack of rhythmic discharge in C-S neurons. This uncorrelated activity in C-S neurons resulted in an absence of spontaneous firing as well as of large amplitude synaptic depolarizations in SONs. In the present study we demonstrate that SONs shape their input-output relationship by filtering oct uncorrelated synaptic activity and that a minimal synchronization in the cortico-striatal afferents is required to produce significant synaptic depolarization in SONs.

Such analyses capture EEG phenomena that are not part of traditional event-related potential measures. The present study investigated whether IBP changes in the delta, theta, and alpha frequency ranges are sensitive to syntactic violations in sentences. Subjects read sentences that either were correct or contained a syntactic violation. The violations were either grammatical gender agreement violations, where a prenominal adjective was not appropriately inflected for the head noun's gender, or number agreement violations, in which a plural quantifier was combined with a singular head noun. IBP changes of the concurrently measured EEG were computed in five frequency bands of 2-Hz width, individually adjusted on the basis of subjects' a peak, ranging approximately from 2 to 12 Hz. Words constituting a syntactic violation elicited larger increases in theta power than the same words in a correct sentence context, in an interval of 300-500 ms after word onset. Of all the frequency bands studied, this was true for the theta frequency band only. The scalp topography of this effect was different for different violations: following number violations a left-hemispheric dominance was found, whereas gender violations elicited a right-hemisphere dominance of the theta power increase. Possible interpretations of this effect are considered in closing. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Methods: In order to better understand the time resolution of ERD/ERS, which is a function of factors such as the exact computation method, the frequency under study, the number of trials, and the sampling frequency, we simulated sudden changes in oscillation amplitude as well as very short and closely spaced events. Results: Hilbert-based ERD yields very similar results to ERD integrated over predefined time intervals (block ERD), if the block length is half the period length of the studied frequency. ERD predicts the onset of a change in oscillation amplitude with an error margin of only 1030 ins. On the other hand, the time the ERD response needs to climb to its full height after a sudden change in oscillation amplitude is quite long, i.e. between 200 and 500 ms. With respect to sensitivity to short oscillatory events, the ratio between sampling frequency and electroencephalographic frequency band plays a major role. Conclusions: (1) The optimal time interval for the computation of block ERD is half a period of the frequency under investigation. (2) Due to the slow impulse response, amplitude effects in the ERD may in reality be caused by duration differences. (3) Although ERD based on the Hilbert transform does not yield any significant advantages over classical ERD in terms of time resolution, it has some important practical advantages.

The data stem from intracellular recordings (most of them dual impalements of pairs of neurons and glia), extracellular ionic concentrations (mainly K+ and Ca2+) and simultaneous intracortical field potentials from the cortex of cats. These data were corroborated with recordings from naturally sleeping animals and humans. It is shown that sleep is dominated by a cortically generated slow (<1 Hz) oscillation resulting from the complex interplay within networks of neurons and glia, which are modulated by the more diffuse action of extracellular currents of ions. Wakefulness is produced through the activation of brainstem and basal forebrain structures, which disrupt sleep oscillations and elicit a global change of the extraneuronal milieu, with profound modifications of glial and cerebral blood flow parameters. Paroxysmal events arising during quiet sleep evolve within the cortex from normal slow sleep oscillations. The synchronization of large cortical and eventually subcortical territories relies on the propagation of increased currents of K+ through the glial syncytium, which compensate for the reduced synaptic efficacy due to the depletion of extracellular Ca2+.

Int Neural Network Soc, IEEE, Neural Networks Council				Our aim is to simulate the dynamic behavior of the olfactory bulb as part of the olfactory system. Olfactory EEG have revealed that oscillation and chaos play important roles in the processing of information in the bulb[1]. We have based our model on coupled nonlinear oscillators, which resemble groups of mitral and granule cells as main building units. The model involves excitatory mitral and inhibitory granule cells, forming a non-linear oscillator. Several of these oscillators are coupled in two layer architecture. The system exhibits complex oscillatory behavior, simulating mammalian olfactory bulb. Results for two different types of input are considered Simulations show that the dynamic behavior of the model is stable under the influence of noise. The model bulb responds to different odor input with spatio-temporal activation patterns, which are unique for each simulated odor. After inhalation has started, a burst of oscillatory activity emerges. The specific pattern of oscillation, which is exhibited by the bulb model, is coherent over the whole bulb.

By contrast, more recent approaches emphasize the constructive nature of perception, viewing it as an active and highly selective process. Indeed, there is ample evidence that the processing of stimuli is controlled by top-down influences that strongly shape the intrinsic dynamics of thalamocortical networks and constantly create predictions about forthcoming sensory events. We discuss recent experiments indicating that such predictions might be embodied in the temporal structure of both stimulus-evoked and ongoing activity, and that synchronous oscillations are particularly important in this process. Coherence among subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations could be exploited to express selective functional relationships during states of expectancy or attention, and these dynamic patterns could allow the grouping and selection of distributed neuronal responses for further processing.

Slow waves are regulated as a function of previous wakefulness, being maximal at the beginning of sleep and then progressively returning to a baseline level. This paper discusses a hypothesis about the significance of slow-wave activity and its homeostatic regulation. The hypothesis is as follows: 1. Wakefulness is associated with synaptic potentiation in several cortical circuits; 2. Synaptic potentiation is tied to the homeostatic regulation of slow-wave activity; 3. Slow-wave activity is associated with synaptic downscaling; 4. Synaptic downscaling is tied to the beneficial effects of sleep on performance. The hypothesized link between sleep and synaptic homeostasis is supported by several lines of evidence and leads to testable predictions. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Elliott, MA; Muller, HJ				Elliott, MA; Muller, HJ			Effects of stimulus synchrony on mechanisms of perceptual organization	VISUAL COGNITION			English	Article							CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; RESPONSES; HUMANS; SEGMENTATION; INFORMATION; ATTENTION; BINDING; MEMORY; BRAIN; TASK	When neurons adopt a synchronized, oscillatory response to stimulus Gestalten, the phase of those oscillations almost always varies relative to stimulus activity. This has been taken to indicate that form-coding mechanisms are synchronized by internal timing mechanisms, and/or may be sensitive to stimulus activity only via motion detectors. This proposal is problematic for interpreting recent demonstrations of the effects of stimulus synchrony particularly when stimuli are stationary. Here we offer an account of stimulus-driven synchronization supported by evidence that segmentation by stimulus synchrony can be relatively insensitive to explicit motion signals. The argument is made that qualitative similarities between the effects of phase-independent and phase-locked oscillations in the EEG, the effects of phase synchronization at the cellular level and evidence for phase-enhanced stimulus grouping should be considered as functionally equivalent. This argument emphasizes the flexibility of temporal synchrony as a code for perceptual organization.

However, this kind of analysis does not allow observation of differences in the spectral content taking place during a sensory, cognitive or motor task. The coal of the present work was to compute the temporal dynamics of EEG oscillations using a technique called temporal spectral evolution (TSE). The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded during the presentation of flashed stimuli that were randomly presented to the left or right visual field. Subjects were asked to pay attention, alternately in different blocks of trials, to the left or to the right to detect an infrequent target. The results showed a decrease in the a. band in a time window of 375-500 ms and an increase in the P band at 500-875 ms after stimulus onset, for both attended and unattended stimuli. Statistical analysis showed that the decrease in alpha and the increase in beta were more marked during the attentional. condition. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that the decrease in alpha band and the increase in beta band are electrophysiological markers of visual spatial attention.

We studied the effects of laser puncture, needle acupuncture, and light stimulation on cerebral blood how in 15 healthy volunteers (mean age 25.0 +/- 1.9 years, 5 female, 10 male) with non-invasive transcranial Doppler sonography. In addition 40-Hz stimulus-induced brain oscillations, heart rate, blood pressure, peripheral and cerebral oxygen saturation, and the bispectral index of the EEG were recorded. Stimulation with light significantly increased blood flow velocity in the posterior cerebral artery (p<0.01, ANOVA). Similar but less pronounced effects were seen after needle acupuncture (p<0.05, ANOVA) and laserpuncture (n.s.) of vision-related acupuncture points. Furthermore both, laserpuncture and needle acupuncture, led to a significant increase in the amplitudes of 40-Hz cerebral oscillations. Stimulation of vision-related acupuncture points with laser light or needle acupuncture elicits specific effects in specific areas of the brain. The results indicate that the brain plays a key intermediate role in acupuncture. However, brain activity of itself does not explain anything about the healing power of acupuncture.

Methods: In two experiments (I and II) the EEG was recorded from frontal, central, and parietal positions before, during, and after drinking or oral stimulation. In Experiment I, subjects (n = 11) who had either been thirsty for 16 h or had quenched thirst before recordings, drank 400 ml of water. In Experiment II, thirsty subjects (n = 11) either drank 400 ml of water or sucked on a soother. The recording epochs included a 3 min baseline, an interval of about 5 min during which subjects drank or sucked on the soother, and a 7 min post-drinking interval. Results: During the drinking epoch, beta band-power (12-30 Hz) was enhanced in both conditions of Experiment I and 11, respectively. In Experiment I,,after drinking, lower alpha power (8-10 Hz) was higher when subjects were thirsty than when they were not. Lower alpha was also enhanced in the post-drinking interval of both conditions of Experiment 11, and after sucking, lower alpha synchronization was in addition accompanied by increased theta activity (4-8 Hz). Conclusions: Increased beta activity during drinking and sucking in thirsty subjects presumably reflects non-specific activation related to the motivational strength of sensorimotor regulation during consumatory behavior. The thirst dependent lower alpha synchronization after drinking, generated not only by water consumption but also by surrogate oral stimuli, can be considered a reflection of the drive reducing and rewarding qualities of oral stimulation and consumatory behavior.

The cortex has been the first part of the brain to evolve a radial and laminar arrangement of cells. The resultant modular arrangement is based on the cell minicolumn: a self-contained ecosystem of connectivity linking afferent, efferent, and inerneuronal connections. Recently, the cell minicolumn has been found to be abnormal in patients with autism. This article relates different aspects of the cell minicolumn and larger-scale neuronal assemblies to potential research techniques and their application to clinical practice.

(1999). Adaptive neural coding dependent on the time-varying statistics of the somatic input current. Neural Computation, 11, 1983-2003] proposed an adaptive neural coding model that makes spiking neurons adapt its input/output relation to the stimulus statistics. In a surprisingly precise manner, the adaptive neural coding model has been supported by recent experiments. However, the previous report has two problems: (a) although the adaptive neural coding model was developed based on the noise shaping neural coding hypothesis, their connection was not explained clearly in the previous report; and (b) the previous model did not suggest a biologically plausible method to estimate the stimulus mean and variance from spike-evoked intracellular calcium concentration. In this paper, I present how the noise shaping neural coding hypothesis produced such a precise model without any available experimental data at that time. Moreover, I propose a computational model for a biologically plausible signal statistics extraction from spike-evoked intracellular calcium concentration. An asymmetry in contrast adaptation time between increasing and decreasing variance, observed in biological experiments, is explained using the signal statistics extraction method. In addition, a new perspective on the relationship between the spike train of spiking neurons and EEG (or local field potential (LFP)) is suggested based on the noise shaping neural coding hypothesis.

Even when they are analyzed from healthy individuals, they manifest chaos in the nervous system. EEGs are likely to be produced by a nonlinear system, since a nonlinear system with at least 3 degrees of freedom (or state variables) may exhibit chaotic behavior. Furthermore, such systems can have multiple stable states governed by "chaotic" ("strange") attractors. A key feature of chaotic systems is the presence of an infinite number of unstable periodic fixed points, which are found in spontaneously active neuronal networks (e.g., epilepsy). The brain has chemicals called neurotransmitters that convey the information through the 10(16) synapses residing there. However, each of these neurotransmitters acts through various receptors and their numerous subtypes, thereby exhibiting complex interactions. Albeit in epilepsy the role of chaos and EEG findings are well proven, in another condition, i.e., depression, the role of chaos is slowly gaining ground, The multifarious roles of exercise, neurotransmitters and (cerebral) hemispheric lateralization, in the case of depression, are also being established. The common point of reference could be nonlinear dynamics. The purpose of this review is to study those nonlinear/chaotic interactions and point towards new theoretical models incorporating the oscillation caused by the same neurotransmitter acting on its different receptor subtypes. This may lead to a better understanding of brain neurodynamics in health and disease. (C) 2001 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

BZs such as diazepam (Dz) potentiate GABA(A) receptor activation. To determine the GABA(A) receptor subtypes that mediate the hypnotic action of Dz wild-type mice and mice that harbor Dz-insensitive alpha1 GABA(A) receptors [alpha1 (H101R) mice] were compared.: Sleep latency and the amount of sleep after Dz treatment were not affected by the point mutation. An initial reduction of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep also occurred equally in both genotypes, Furthermore, the Dz-induced changes in the sleep and waking electroencephalogram (EEG) spectra, the increase in power density above 21 Hz in non-REM sleep and waking, and the suppression of slow-wave activity (SWA; EEG power in the 0.75- to 4.0-Hz band) in non-REM sleep were present in both genotypes. Surprisingly, these effects were even more pronounced in alpha1(H101R) mice and sleep continuity was enhanced by Dz only in the mutants. Interestingly, Dz did not affect the initial surge of SWA at the transitions to sleep, indicating that the SWA-generating mechanisms are not impaired by the BZ. We conclude that the REM:sleep inhibiting action of Dz and its effect on the EEG spectra in sleep and waking are mediated by GABA(A) receptors other than alpha1, i,e., alpha2, alpha3, or alpha5 GABA(A) receptors, Because alpha1 GABA(A) receptors mediate the sedative action of Dz, our results provide evidence that the hypnotic effect of Dz and its EEC "fingerprint" can be dissociated from its sedative action.

The purpose of this study was to test the following hypotheses: (1) corticomuscular coherence is abnormally increased in those Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with small amplitude cortical myoclonus, and (2) corticomuscular coherence peaks around the time of the myoclonus electromyographic (EMG) discharge. We studied Parkinson's disease patients with and without myoclonus and controls. The data were digitally collected and processed off-line with EMG rectification, creation of 511-msec epochs, Fast-Fourier transform, and coherence analysis. In the 12 to 30 Hz frequency band, but not at 30 to 60 Hz or above, coherence peaks were observed in the PD subjects with myoclonus that were significantly greater than in the control subjects (P < 0.001) and in PD subjects without myoclonus (P < 0.001). The abnormal coherence values are evidence for abnormal rhythmic activity in cortical motor areas in those Parkinson's disease patients with myoclorms. In combination with previous findings on back-averaging, our results show that this myoclonus occurs when neuronal populations are driven to an extreme amount of synchronous activity with higher corticomuscular coherence values. These results have mechanistic implications for cortical dysfunction in Parkinson's disease and for cortical myoclonus in general. (C) 2003 Movement Disorder Society.

In the present report, we show similar to200 Hz oscillations in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BL) and the adjacent dorsal endopiriform nucleus (EPN) of the behaving rat. Microwire techniques were applied for recording single units and field activity from these structures and EEG from the dorsal or temporal CA1 subfields of the hippocampus. Units from both EPN and BL exhibited similar irregular firing patterns with bursts. The mean firing rates in EPN were <1 Hz, whereas units in the BL fired in a range of <1-17 Hz. Neuronal activity in both BL and EPN was phase-locked with high-frequency field oscillations (HFO, similar to200 Hz). Amygdaloid/EPN HFO displayed on average lower numbers of cycles and smaller amplitudes than hippocampal ripples. Neuronal firing and HFO in the BL and EPN were state dependent with a maximal occurrence during slow-wave sleep (SWS), being lower during waking and paradoxical sleep. Cross-correlation between hippocampal ripples and EPN or BL units and field HFO did not reveal any synchrony. These data suggest common principles of temporal coding in BL and EPN in certain behavioural states via short scale population synchrony though they convey signals of different modalities.

A slight and short-term decrease in the theta-rhythm. modulation in the MS neuronal activity and/or EEG was revealed in 30.4% of tests after the bilateral intraventricular injection of a small dose of clonidine (0.5 mug/5 mul of water). On the contrary, a high dose of clonidine (5 mug/5 mul) substantially enhanced the theta modulation in 100% of tests. The frequency of the theta bursts in the MS increased, on average, by 1.6+/-0.18 Hz (from 5.25+/-0.19 to 6.8+/-0.17 Hz). The regularity-of the theta modulation became almost twice higher: the time constant of damping increased from 0.34+/-0.04 to 0.60+/-0.08 s. Increase in the neuronal activity in the MS produced by the high dose of clonidine was always accompanied by appearance of continuous stable theta waves in the EEG; the spectral power in the theta range increased, on average, by 480+/-98%. This strong effect arose suddenly but was relatively short-lasting (12+/-3.5 min) and usually abruptly terminated. It is concluded that the noradrenergic system has a double control over the theta oscillations through the alpha2-adrenoreceptors agonist. In low concentrations the agonist clonidine acts on the high affinity inhibitory presynaptic autoreceptors reducing the noradrenaline release and suppressing the theta activity. In a high dose clonidine predominantly acts on postsynaptic (low affinity) adrenoreceptors substantially increasing the frequency and regularity of the theta bursts in the activity of septal neurons. Presumably, different types of alpha2-adrenoreceptors participate in regulation of the theta oscillations in different functional states. It is suggested that the noradrenergic locus coeruleus is a functional synergist of the activating reticular formation participating in the urgent phasic activation of the septohippocampal. system during the action of sudden strong stimuli.

Design and methods We performed polysomnography (PSG) with pulse oximetry in 26 middle-aged patients with OSAS aged 42-58 years (mean age 51.8 years). The intensity of arousal on PSG was graded into two levels: grade 1 (EEG arousal, EA), an abrupt shift in EEG frequency, and grade 2 (movement arousal, MA), EEG arousal with an increase in electromyogram activity lasting at least 3 s. The number of apnea/hypopneas per hour (apnea/hypopnea index, AHI), and length of time during which nocturnal oxygen saturation decreased below 90% (oxygen desaturation time, ODT) were also evaluated. Percentage EA and %MA were assessed by the ratio of the number of apneas and hypopneas with EA or MA to the number of apneas and hypopneas in total. The 24 h systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured noninvasively. Multiple regression analysis was performed among AHI, ODT, %EA and %MA or among age, body mass index and %MA. Results The %MA was the most significant factor contributing to the elevated 24 h SEP (r = 0.46, P< 0.05); oxygen desaturation (r = 0.44, P< 0.05) was the next most important contributing factor. The level and pattern of 24 h BP differed significantly between the patients with %MA 85% and %MA < 85% (mean 24 h SEP: 147 +/- 16.8 versus 125 +/- 19.6 mmHg, P< 0.01; mean 24 h DBP: 97.5 +/- 14.3 versus 85.6 +/- 14.6 mmHg, P< 0.01), and also differed between those with severe OSAS, i.e. ODT greater than or equal to 130 min, and mild to moderate OSAS, i.e. ODT <130 min, (mean 24 h SEP: 149 +/- 15.8 versus 132 +/- 20.6 mmHg, P< 0.01; mean 24 h DBP: 100 +/- 14.1 versus 87.4 +/- 14.0 mmHg, P< 0.01). Conclusion Our findings suggest that MA and oxygen desaturation in OSAS make an important contribution to abnormal circadian rhythm of BP. We conclude that repeated end-apneic arousal and/or hypoxic asphyxia and the subsequent sleep fragmentation may contibute to nocturnal and diurnal elevation of BP.

The term "functional" stresses that influences among neuronal systems are not necessarily made by direct physical synapses, but can be indirect via other far distributed neurons. Functional connectivity is the basis for organization of neuronal cell ensembles in the brain, an organization thought to be the basis of cognitive computations and mental functions in general. Neural network models simulate neural systems and can achieve computations that model cognitive functions. Units of these models are neurons and weighted values represent connections. The connectivity patterns in such models are essential for their effective computation. Similarly it is assumed that functional connectivity in the brain is essential for normal mental functions. Thus it is obvious why the study of brain connectivity is essential. fMRI has good spatial resolution and thus seems most suitable for the study of spatially-distributed interconnections. This is typically calculated by hemodynamic-based correlation in the dynamic activity between two brain regions. EEG offers the advantage of the millisecond-range temporal resolution. Correlations between the electrical activity expressed as waveform patterns (amplitude and frequencies) among different electrode scalp locations is one way to estimate presumed connectivity among the relevant cortical brain locations. Correlations could be simple (simple coherence measures) or take into consideration the dynamic propagation of signals by shifting the signals with respect to one another (sliding window). Correlations could be applied to raw data and to averaged signals (evoked responses) when a stimulus onset is relevant. Another method to estimate connectivity refers to estimations of independent sources. This assumes that interconnected systems acting in conjunction with each other would be expressed by a common EEG source generator, thus if EEG analysis reveals multiple independent sources then it is postulated that many disconnected systems characterize the cortical activity being measured. Imbalances in excitability of neural networks resulting in dissociated and disconnected neuronal brain activity is a leading hypothesis for the emergence of serious mental disorders such as schizophrenia. EEG assessment of connectivity in these patients exemplifies the attempts to study brain connectivity using EEG.

Methods: The coherence, phase and cumulant density estimates were calculated between right electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals and distal left leg muscles in a patient with subdural electrodes inserted over the right sensorimotor cortex. Results: Significant coherence between sensorimotor cortex and muscle was found up to 60 Hz during voluntary induced myoclonic jerks. Additional higher frequency coherence (similar to 140 and 190 Hz) was found during sensory-induced myoclonic jerks. The cortical signals phase led muscle signals at frequencies >15 Hz by delays consistent with transmission along corticospinal pathways, Below 15 Hz the cortex phase lagged the muscle signals. Polarity reversal of the cumulant density estimate and the ECoG site demonstrating the highest coherence helped to localize the site of the abnormal oscillatory activity to the leg area of the motor cortex. Conclusions: Oscillations of different frequencies can co-exist at a given location and can both phase lead and lag contralateral muscle. This has implications for cortex-muscle latency measures calculated by back-averaging techniques. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The effect of this technique on language and cognitive ability, behaviour, seizures, and EEG abnormalities is analysed here. Five children (4 males, 1 female; aged 5.5 to 10 years) underwent MST with sufficiently detailed pre- and postoperative data for analysis. Behaviour and seizure frequency improved dramatically after surgery in all children. Improvement in language also occurred in all children, although none improved to an age-appropriate level. All dye had electrical status epilepticus in sleep (ESES) before surgery, which was eliminated by the procedure. One child has had an extension of his MST due to the recurrence of ESES and accompanying clinical deterioration with good effect. An attempt is made to set the effect of MST against the natural history of the condition. MST is an important treatment modality in LKS, although the timing of this intervention and its effect on final language outcome remains to be defined.

The coordination of individual neurons into rhythmic and coherently active populations is thought to result from interactions between excitatory and inhibitory cells mediated by local feedback connections. By using extracellular recording wires and silicon microprobes to measure electrically evoked damped oscillatory responses at the level of neural populations in the entorhinal cortex, and by using current-source density analysis to determine the spatial pattern of evoked responses, we show that the propagation of activity through the cortical circuit and consequent oscillations in the local field potential are dependent upon background neural activity. Pharmacological manipulations as well as surgical disconnection of the olfactory bulb serve to quell the background excitatory input incident to entorhinal cortex, resulting in evoked responses without characteristic oscillations and showing no signs of polysynaptic feedback. Electrical stimulation at 200 Hz applied to the lateral olfactory tract provides a substitute for the normal background activity emanating from the bulb and enables the generation of oscillatory responses once again. We conclude that a non-zero background level of activity is necessary and sufficient to sustain normal oscillatory responses and polysynaptic transmission through the entorhinal cortex.

The present investigation aimed at assessing the involvement of the different components of CAP in the process of build-up, maintenance and demolition of deep non-REM (NREM) sleep. Methods: CAP parameters were quantified in the first 3 sleep cycles (SC1, SC2, SC3), selected from polysomnographic recordings of 25 healthy sound sleepers belonging to an extensive age range (10-49 years). Only ideal SCs were selected, i.e. the ones uninterrupted by intervening wakefulness and in which all stages were represented and linked in a regular succession of a descending branch, a trough and an ascending branch. Results: Among the first 3 SCs, a total amount of 45 (SCI, 16; SC2, 13; SC3, 16) met the inclusion requirements. SC1 contained the highest amount of slow wave sleep (43.7 min) and the lowest values of CAP rate (31.6%). The number of phase A1 subtypes remained unmodified across the 3 SCs (SC1, 48; SC2, 48; SC3, 48), whereas both subtypes A2 (SC1, 9; SC2, 14; SC3, 14) and A3 (SCI, 2; SC2, 8; SC3, 10) increased significantly (P <0.028 and P <0.0001, respectively). The A1 subtypes composed more than 90% of all the A phases collected in the descending branches and in the troughs, while the A2 and A3 subtypes were the major representatives (64.3%) of the A phases occurring in the ascending branches. Conclusions: Within the dynamic organization of sleep, the non-random distribution of CAP sequences, with their succession of slow (subtypes A1) and rapid (subtypes A2 and A3) EEG shifts, seem to be responsible for sculpturing EEG synchrony under the driving and alternating forces of NREM and REM sleep.

It is argued that a technique called Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) of rhythmic 10-Hz activity is well suited to study the thalamocortical processes that are thought to mediate anticipatory attention, In a series of experiments, ERD was computed on EEG and MEG data, recorded while subjects performed a time estimation task and were informed about the quality of their time estimation by stimuli providing Knowledge of Results (KR). The modality of the KR stimuli (auditory, visual, or somatosensory) was manipulated both within and between experiments. The results indicate to varying degrees that preceding the presentation of the KR stimuli, ERD is present over the sensory cortex, which corresponds to the modality of the KR stimulus. The general pattern of results supports the notion that a thalamocortical gating mechanism forms the neurophysiological basis of anticipatory attention. Furthermore, the results support the notion that Event-Related Potential (ERP) and ERD measures reflect fundamentally different neurophysiological processes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The behavioral results were consistent with previous time pressure research in that TP reduced time to perform a task and increases behavioral errors. In addition, electroencephalogram (EEG) measures showed distinctive patterns associated with TP in the theta, mu, and gamma bands along the midline, Site specific changes in the success vs. failure trials were also seen in midline theta at Fz, gamma at Fz, and mu at Cz. Right parietal alpha also differentiated TP and success vs. failure trials. In specific TP (1) increased frontal midline theta activity and (2) increased gamma at. midline (frontal, central, and partietal) and in right frontal areas. The results of these findings are discussed in terms of the formation of specific neurocognitive strategies as evidenced by the topographic distribution of task-related modulation of the EEG within certain frequency bands. It is suggested that the effect of TP on visuomotor performance is mediated by adopting either task-relevant or task-irrelevant neurocognitive strategies as evidenced by successful or failed trials, respectively. Whether these strategies are formulated prior to performance or appear spontaneously during task performance remains unclear and is awaiting further experimentation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

We previously demonstrated that measures of chaos and angular frequency obtained from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals generated by critical sites in the cerebral cortex converge progressively (dynamical entrainment) from the asymptomatic interictal state to the ictal state (seizure) [L.D. Iasemidis, P. Pardalos, J.C. Sackellares and D.-S. Shiau (2001). Quadratic binary programming and dynamical system approach to determine the predictability of epileptic seizures. J. Combinatorial Optimization , 5 , 9-26; L.D. Iasemidis, D.-S. Shiau, P.M. Pardalos and J.C. Sackellares (2002). Phase entrainment and predictability of epileptic seizures. In: P.M. Pardalos and J. Principe (Eds.), Biocomputing , pp. 59-84. Kluwer Academic Publishers]. This observation suggests the possibility of developing algorithms to predict seizures. One of the central points of those investigations was the application of optimization theory, specifically quadratic zero-one programming, for the selection of the cortical sites that exhibit preictal dynamical entrainment. In this study we present results from the application of this methodology to the prediction of epileptic seizures. Analysis of continuous, long-term (18-140 h), multielectrode EEG recordings from 5 patients resulted in the prediction of 88% of the impending 50 seizures, on average about 83 min prior to seizure onset, with an average false warning rate of one every 5.26 h. These results suggest that this seizure prediction algorithm performs well enough to be used in diagnostic and therapeutic applications in epileptic patients. Similar algorithms may be useful for certain spatiotemporal state transitions in other physical and biological systems.

SALUD MENTAL			Spanish	Article						frequency analysis; attention deficit disorder; electroencephalogram	CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE TESTS; DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; CHILDREN; EEG; DIAGNOSIS; ADULTS; ADHD	The Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) is a developmental and chronical disorder, characterized mainly by a decrease in attention. Difficulties in the inhibitory control (expressed through behavioral and cognitive impulsiveness) and also verbal and motor restlessness are characteristic in this disorder. They should appear at an early age (before 7) and be considered inadequate in regard to the patient's age and expected level of development. Current research suggests that their attention spans are shorter than those of their peers because their greater deficit is found in the area of sustained attention. Other symptoms of ADD are impulsiveness-hyperactivity, and it may be difficult to differentiate one from the other. The first one, impulsiveness, has been defined as acting without thinking, while the second one, hyperactivity, describes the excessive or inappropriate level of either verbal or motor activity. In school population, according to the DSM-IV, the prevalence of this disorder is 3-5%. It is the most frequent mental disease in childhood. The male/female rate may differ according to the sample that is being studied. In a clinical sample it is common to find a 6:1 ratio, while in the general population it may only be 3:1. In order to evaluate the attention process and the executive functions, many psychological tests have been created, and due to the clinical characteristics of ADD patients, these instruments have been incorporated to the different test batteries used in the evaluating process. One of these tests is the Continuous Performance Test (CPT), a psychological task that evaluates two corner symptoms of ADD: inattention and impulsiveness. It's clinical usefulness has been proved through different studies. On the other hand, the quantitative analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) has become a useful tool in the evaluation of this disorder. Using this technique, both, an increase in the theta band absolute and relative power, and abnormal excess in the alpha band in the anterior regions, have been reported. CPT and EEG are both techniques commonly used in the ADD patient evaluation; nevertheless, no study has ever analyzed the possible correlation between them. Therefore the goal of the present study was to analyze the correlation between CPT's variables and the brain electrical activity. The absolute power of the EEG's delta, theta, alpha and beta bands, and the number of omissions, commissions, reaction time, response style and confidence index of the CPT, were correlated in a sample of 35 ADD patients with an average age of 10.49 years (S.D. = 3.31). The 8 females and 27 males were clinically evaluated by a specialist to meet DSM-IV criteria for ADD. All the EEG values (absolute power) were normalized by logarithmic transformation, and due to the fact that both variables tend to decrease while age increases, partial correlations controlled for age, were calculated. The statistic software SPSS 10 was used. The EEG of the patients was characterized by a predominant activity in the delta, theta and alpha bands, especially in the slow bands. Delta activity was more important in frontopolar and lower frontal regions; theta activity was dominant in the upper frontal, and central regions, and the alpha band activity was more evident in posterior regions. In the temporal zone, the power of these three bands was almost equivalent. These results are similar to the characteristic EEG pattern of ADD. All the psychological measures, except the confidence index, showed statistically significant correlations. The number of commissions, the reaction time, and the response style indicator had more correlations with the theta activity of the central, upper frontal and parietal regions. The remaining variable, the number of omissions, showed a significant correlation with the alpha band in the frontopolar, lower frontal and right temporal posterior areas. Thus, statistically significant correlations were grouped in two patterns: 1) omissions showed a positive correlation with the alpha band activity in temporal and frontal inferior areas, 2) all the remaining psychological variables correlated positively (except commissions which correlated negatively) with generalized theta activity. These results suggest that, in this sample of ADD patients, such brain activity patterns may be the electroencephalographic marker that identifies a poor CPT performance. Just as well, it could be said that the presence of theta activity in the resting EEG in the noted areas tempers with the ability of the anterior and posterior attentional networks to appropriately, solve the task. This is better observed in the reaction time measure. While almost all the correlations are positive (when the electrical activity increases the number of errors also increase), the number of commissions correlated negatively with the brain electrical activity (when the electrical activity decreases, the number of errors increases and vice versa). This is explained by the conscious effort of the patient to solve the task correctly. In order to avoid making mistakes, the patient increases the reaction time trying to have more time to correctly process the stimuli information, but because of his own attention deficit he can't take advantage of this strategy and ends up losing information. If we consider the response style indicator that allows US to evaluate the speed/accuracy relationship, then the significant correlation values (almost exclusive) of this variable with the theta band support the previous affirmation. Finally all the patient did was to increase the number of omissions, but at the same time the number of commissions decreased. Thus, an inattentive profile became evident. Even though the brain electrical activity recording and the application of the CPT were done at different times, the results support the fact that the absolute power of the remaining EEG, in the delta, theta and alpha bands, specially in the theta band, is related with a poor performance in most of the CPT's variables analyzed. It is suggestive also of a relationship between the EEG and the different cognitive processes measured by the CPT.

The chaotic concept based on deterministic dynamics may become an important feature in biological signal analysis. In this report, we shall discuss the chaotic and fractal properties involved in the fluctuations of vocal sounds which may be evaluated from the fractal dimensions, the Lyapunov spectra, and multi-fractal dimensions. Furthermore, to verify nonlinear properties in a time series, we analyze colored random data by using the surrogation method.

Methods: Ketamine-sedated Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted to monitor behavioral states with frontoparietal electrodes in a first series of experiments and with multiple electrodes along the antero-posterior axis (F1, F2, F7, F8, T3, T4, P3, P4) in a second series. Monopolar and bipolar recordings were obtained in animals stereotaxically injected with ibotenic acid into both rostral poles of the thalamic reticular nucleus. Long-term video-EEG recordings and brain mapping based on quantitative spectral analysis were made. Results: Two forms of dysrhythmia gradually emerged in the neocortical EEG at 12-24 h post-injection: potentiation of theta waves and spontaneous high-voltage spindles (HVS) at 4.5-8 Hz frequency. Brain mapping during these dysrhythmia shows highest power posteriorly (parietotemporal) for theta and mesiofrontally for HVS. Conclusions: Given the lack of inhibitory intrinsic interneurons in the rat thalamus, bilateral destruction of a small part of the solely GABAergic population may promote cortical dysrhythmia (probably by dis-inhibition). The topographic differences in power might indicate different involved structures. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

We studied 38 HPPD subjects with a mean of 9.7 years of persistent visual hallucinations and 33 control subjects. Measures of local and medium distance EEG spectral coherence were calculated from all subjects. Coherence, a measure of spectral similarity over time, may estimate cortical coupling. In the eyes-open state in HPPD subjects, widespread reduction of coherence was noted. However, upon eye closure, the occipital region demonstrated augmented regional coherence over many frequencies but with reduced coherence of the occipital region to more distant regions. This occipital coherence increase correlated with previously reported shortened occipital visual evoked potential latency for HPPD subjects. We speculate from coherence and known clinical and psychophysical data that, in HPPD, there is widespread cortical inhibition in the eyes-opened state, but localized and isolated occipital disinhibition upon eye closure, a state known to facilitate hallucinatory experiences. An analogy is drawn to findings in the interictal and ictal epileptic focus. In HPPD, we speculate that occipital EEG hypersynchrony resulting from increased regional coherence, when coupled with relative isolation of visual cortex, especially upon eye closure, facilitates hallucinations and illusions.

The projected spectrum is found to consist of a plateau followed by regions of power-law decrease with various exponents, which are dependent on both model parameters and temporal frequency. The theoretical spectrum is compared with experimental results obtained in other studies, showing good agreement. The model provides a framework for understanding the nature of the spatial power spectrum by linking the underlying physiology with the large-scale dynamics of the brain.

Furthermore, synchronization in the gamma band has been shown to play an important role in higher cognitive functions, especially by binding the necessary spatial and temporal information in different cortical areas to build a coherent perception. Specific task-induced (evoked) gamma oscillations have often been taken as an indication of synchrony, but the presence of long-range synchrony cannot be inferred from spectral power in the gamma range. We studied the usefulness of a relatively new measure, called similarity index to detect asymmetric interdependency between two brain regions. Spontaneous EEG from two groups-musicians and non-musicians-were recorded during several states: listening to music, listening to text, and at rest (eyes closed and eyes open). While listening to music, degrees of the gamma band synchrony over distributed cortical areas were found to be significantly higher in musicians than non-musicians. Yet no differences between these two groups were found at resting conditions and while listening to a neutral text. In contrast to the degree of long-range synchrony, spectral power in the gamma band was higher in non-musicians. The degree of spatial synchrony, a measure of signal complexity based on eigen-decomposition method, was also significantly increased in musicians while listening to music. As compared with non-musicians, the finding of increased long-range synchrony in musicians independent of spectral power is interpreted as a manifestation of a more advanced musical memory of musicians in binding together several features of the intrinsic complexity of music in a dynamical way.

J	Herrmann, CS				Herrmann, CS			Human EEG responses to 1-100 Hz flicker: resonance phenomena in visual cortex and their potential correlation to cognitive phenomena	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						alpha; EEG; gamma; flicker; resonance; SSVEP; steady-state potentials	GAMMA-BAND RESPONSES; OSCILLATORY RESPONSES; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EVOKED POTENTIALS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ALPHA; STIMULI; MEMORY; HALLUCINATIONS; PERCEPTION	The individual properties of visual objects, like form or color; are represented in different areas in our visual cortex. In order to perceive one coherent object, its features have to be bound together. This was found to be achieved in cat and monkey brains by temporal correlation of the firing rates of neurons which code the same object. This firing rate is predominantly observed in the gamma frequency range (approx. 30-80 Hz, mainly around 40 Hz). In addition, it has been shown in humans that stimuli which flicker at gamma frequencies are processed faster by our brains than when they flicker at different frequencies. These effects could be due to neural oscillators, which preferably oscillate at certain frequencies, so-called resonance frequencies. It is also known that neurons in visual cortex respond to flickering stimuli at the frequency of the flickering light. if neural oscillators exist with resonance frequencies, they should respond more strongly to stimulation with their resonance frequency. We performed an experiment, where ten human subjects were presented flickering light at frequencies from 1 to 100 Hz in 1-Hz steps. The event-related potentials exhibited steady-state oscillations at all frequencies up to at least 90 Hz. Interestingly, the steady-state potentials exhibited clear resonance phenomena around 10, 20, 40 and 80 Hz. This could be a potential neural basis for gamma oscillations in binding experiments. The pattern of results resembles that of multiunit activity and local field potentials in cat visual cortex.

Previous research with healthy subjects suggests that electroencephalograph (EEG) theta activity reflects the encoding of new information into working memory. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the processing deficits of dyslexics ore related to a reduced phasic theta response during reading. Method: The EEG was recorded while subjects were reading numbers, words and pseudowords and analyzed in a lower and upper theta band (4-8 Hz). A phasic response is measured in terms of an increase in event related band power during reading with respect to a reference interval. Tonic power is measured in terms of (log) band power during a reference interval. Results: Large group differences in tonic and phasic lower theta were found for occipital sites where dyslexics show a complete lack of pseudoword processing. For words, only controls show a highly selective left hemispheric processing advantage. Conclusions: Dyslexics have a lack to encode pseudowords in visual working memory with a concomitant lack of frontal processing selectivity. The upper theta band shows a different pattern of results which can be best interpreted to reflect the effort during the encoding process. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						electroencephalography; complex movements; motor control; motor learning; reorganization; functional imaging; motor memory	POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; MOTOR CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; HAND MOVEMENTS; HUMAN BRAIN; RECOVERY; AREAS; STROKE; THETA	Objective: To investigate, if increasing ipsilateral cortical activation during sequential finger movements of increasing complexity relates to the difficulty of transitions ('sequence complexity') or to increasing motor memory load ('sequence length'). Methods: Pre-learned, memorized sequences (MEM) of different complexities (SIMPLE = e.g., 2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2; SCALE = e.g., 2-5-4-3-2-5-4-3-2-5-4-3-2-5-4-3; and COMPLEX = e.g., 5-3-2-4-3-4-2-5-4-4-2-3-5-2-4-3; 2 = index, 5 = pinky) were randomly alternated with visually instructed, novel sequences (Nov) of matched complexity. In this design, memory load co-varied with complexity during MEM because of increasing length of the memorized sequences. In Nov, memory load was eliminated because each sequence element was prompted by an instructive visual cue. Cortical activation was measured by spectral power analysis of 28-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) in 15 healthy, right-handed subjects. Results: The increases of ipsilateral sensorimotor activation from SIMPLE over SCALE to COMPLEX in Nov were linearly correlated with the corresponding pattern in MEM (P < 0.01). No significant differences were found between M-EM and Nov (analysis of variance, n.s.). Conclusions: The similar dynamics of cortical activation patterns across movement sequences during MEM and Nov indicate that increasing ipsilateral activation primarily reflects processing of increasingly difficult transitions between movements, and not motor memory load. Significance: Function of ipsilateral sensorimotor areas during complex motor behavior. (C) 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

These processes can be monitored in real-time by recordings from depth electrodes implanted in the MTL of patients with epilepsy who undergo presurgical evaluation. In our studies, patients performed a word memorization task during depth EEG recording. Afterwards, the difference between event-related potentials (ERPs) corresponding to subsequently remembered versus forgotten words was analyzed. These kind of studies revealed that successful memory encoding is characterized by an early process generated by the rhinal cortex within 300 ms following stimulus onset. This rhinal process precedes a hippocampal process, which starts about 200 ms later. Further investigation revealed that the rhinal process seems to be a correlate of semantic preprocessing which supports memory formation, whereas the hippocampal process appears to be a correlate of an exclusively mnemonic operation. These studies yielded only indirect evidence for an interaction of rhinal cortex and hippocampus. Direct evidence for a memory related cooperation between both structures, however, has been found in a study analyzing so called gamma activity, EEG oscillations of around 40 Hz. This investigation showed that successful as opposed to unsuccessful memory formation is accompanied by an initial enhancement of rhinal-hippocampal phase synchronization, which is followed by a later desynchronization. Present knowledge about the function of phase synchronized gamma activity suggests that this phase coupling and decoupling initiates and later terminates communication between the two MTL structures. Phase synchronized rhinal-hippocampal gamma activity may, moreover, accomplish Hebbian synaptic modifications and thus provide an initial step of declarative memory formation on the synaptic level.

These properties allow studying the CC functionality with EEG coherence analysis. Iso-oriented and orthogonally-oriented gratings were presented to the two hemifields, either close to the vertical meridian or far from it. In animals with intact CC, and in man, interhemispheric coherence (ICoh) increased only with iso-oriented gratings presented near or crossing the vertical meridian. The increase was localized to occipital electrodes and was specific for the beta-gamma frequency band. Visual-stimulus induced changes in ICoh were studied in patients with early pathologies of the visual areas. From a girl with abnormal vision and severe bilateral lesion of the primary visual areas at 3 weeks, after premature birth at 30 weeks, we obtained no ICoh response until 9 years. In control children visual stimulation increased occipital ICoh at 6-7 years, From a young man having suffered similar lesions when he was 9 months older than the girl, no consistent increase in ICoh could be obtained. In a 14-year-old girl with congenital visual agnosia, no visible lesions, but with a temporal-occipital epileptic focus, ICoh responses were evoked both by iso-oriented, and by orthogonally-oriented gratings. In a young man with bilateral parieto-occipital microgyria extending into the calcarine sulcus, visual stimuli increased ICoh as in normal individuals, but the response was weaker. These cases are discussed in terms of development of CC connections and point to a variety of plastic changes in the cortical connectivity of children. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Methods: The spectral parameters were calculated for the 7 main EEG bands: slow delta (0.7-2 Hz); fast delta (2-4 Hz); theta (4-8 Hz); alpha (8-12 Hz); sigma (12-16 Hz); beta1 (16-35 Hz); and beta 2 (>35 Hz). Results: Strong negative correlations were found between power in the fast delta and either the alpha or the beta bands and between slow delta and theta bands, whereas the two delta bands showed little correlation with each other. Conclusion: The possibility that theses different relationships of slow and fast delta components with other frequency bands might reflect the neocortical or the thalamocortical origin of the delta waves is discussed.

It allows us to respond in an adaptable and swift manner to environmental conditions. In the present study, we manipulate cognitive context, by means of response probability, to modify the degree of movement preparation in a delayed cueing task performed with the right hand, and evaluate the neural dynamics (EEG coherence) and behavioural output (reaction time). Task-related coherence was stronger over the contralateral hemisphere. In particular, coherence between the left sensorimotor area and frontal (C3-F3, C3-FC3) and parietal (C3-P3) regions was increased during right-hand movement preparation as compared to rest in the alpha frequency band (8-12 Hz). Reducing response probability diminished the degree of functional coupling between C3-F3 and C3-FC3, and was associated with a prolonged reaction time. These findings suggest an association between neural dynamics and behavioural performance and emphasize that response predictability biases information processing in goal-oriented behaviour.

Most experimental data implicate a hyperexcitable cortical generator of spike-and-wave activity, with the thalamus quickly recruited to sustain the generalized oscillations through a reverberating thalamocortical network. However, there is little clinical evidence to support the cortical generator hypothesis. We present video-EEG recordings of generalized tonic-clonic seizures in three patients with proven primary generalized epilepsy (PGE), all of whom showed a consistent pattern of lateralized seizure onset compatible with a focal frontal lobe generator. Methods : Among 300 patients referred for video-EEG monitoring for intractable epilepsy, three were found to have PGE with tonic-clonic convulsions. All had a positive family history for epilepsy and no other epilepsy risk factors. Epilepsy onset was during adolescence (2/3) or childhood (1/3). Patients were taking 1-4 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) at admission, none of which was valproic acid. Results : Interictal EEG showed very active, bilaterally synchronous generalized spike-and-wave or polyspike-and-wave discharges between 2.5-4.5 Hz, maximal over the midfrontal structures symetrically in all patients. Ictal EEG showed generalized rhythmic activity without lateralization at seizure onset. Surprisingly, in all 6 recorded tonic-clonic seizures there was a sustained (10-15 seconds), stereotyped, clinical lateralization at onset, which took the form of atonic "fencing posture" in one patient (two seizures) and forced head/eye/torso version in two patients (four seizures). Two patients became seizure-free shortly after switching to valproate monotherapy. One patient refused valproate but has improved more than 90 % with a change in AEDs to lamotrigine and phenobarbital (follow-up in all patients > 18 months). Conclusions : Tonic-clonic seizures are presumed to be generalized from onset in patients with PGE. However, video-EEG monitoring in these patients is rarely performed and the actual clinical features of the seizures may be underappreciated. The demonstration of sustained lateralization at onset in our patients, with features clinically indistinguishable from focal onset frontal lobe seizures, is compatible with the hypothesis of a focal region of cortical hyperexcitability situated in the frontal lobes of some patients with PGE. Whether this cortical generator is autonomous or "triggered" by ascending, possibly normal, thalamocortical volleys is unresolved.

Recent studies furthermore suggest that phase synchronization of induced gamma activity may represent a general mechanism enabling transient associations of neural assemblies and thus may play a central role in cortical information processing. Here, we describe findings indicating that synchronized gamma activity is moreover specifically involved in selective attention. While feature binding appears to depend primarily on induced gamma synchronization, attentional processes seem to involve both induced and evoked gamma oscillations. Yet it is still an open question, as to which top-down and bottom-up processes are associated with attentional modulation of gamma activity. A possible mechanism to project influences from attentional control structures to areas concerned with stimulus representation and vice versa, may be neuronal synchronization and the resulting firing rate changes of coincidence-detecting neurons in target areas.

Neural dynamics are determined by voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels. Coupling between the local networks is introduced via sparse excitatory connectivity. With modulation of this long-range synaptic coupling the system undergoes a transition from independent oscillations to chaotic synchronization. Between these states exists a 'weakly' stable state with epochs of synchronization and complex intermittent desynchronization. This may facilitate adaptive brain function by engendering a diverse repertoire of dynamics and contribute to the genesis of complexity in the EEG. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Specifically, one may determine whether a drug is active in the central nervous system (CNS) compared with placebo in humans, the dose effect (including nonmonotonic drug effects along the continuum range of concentrations) and the time effect (including time-dependant pharmacodynamic phenomena as tolerance and sensitization), as well as its activity in relation to the formulation and route of application. Methodological aspects arc introduced, discussing the usefulness of evaluating different treatments, doses, time points, states, target variables, electrodes and even different groups. Several issues are raised in relation to acute vs. repetitive administration, particularly those dealing with statistical comparisons when making conclusions about acute, repetitive or superimposed effects, and in relation to human psychotropic interactions, such as mechanistic drug-drug interaction descriptions, drug metabolites and enantiomers, as well as the importance of acquiring drug plasma concentrations, elapse of tune and topographic distributions to accurately identify its occurrence. PK-PD modeling is introduced as a tool to enlarge the scope of inferences that can be derived when using pharmaco-EEG. The examples presented in order to develop the arguments are mainly focused on anxiolytic compounds belonging to the different neurochemical groups, benzodiazepines and azaspirones. Questions that have yet to been resolved are also addressed. (C) 2002 Prous Science. All rights reserved.

In a recognition test, subjects indicated whether they consciously recollected the event in which a word was earlier presented (Remembering), or whether they recognized it on the basis that it was familiar in the absence of recollection (Knowing). An early EEG synchronization in the theta band predicted knowing, and a later remembering. Moreover, early and late event-related potentials were also found to predict knowing and remembering, respectively. The results indicate that the temporal dynamics of theta synchronization are related to the particular conscious experiences associated with memory retrieval. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Recently, in an in vitro preparation of the whole hippocampus, spontaneous delta rhythms similar to hippocampal EEG seen in behaving animals, have been recorded. Based on the experimental data and by using numerical simulations, we suggest a mechanism in which a dynamical feedback from populations of synchronized interneurons entrain an increasing and/or more synchronized activity in the pyramidal cell population. In this scenario, the number of the excitatory cells as well as the excitability of the interneurons determine the frequency and robustness of these slow rhythms. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Low voltage alpha (LVA), a heritable resting electroencephalogram (EEG) trait present in 7-14% of the population, has been shown to be associated with alcoholism and anxiety disorders. A few studies have demonstrated a modest correlation between pre-stimulus alpha power and P300 amplitude. We aimed to test this finding in community volunteers, hypothesizing that LVA would be associated with low P300 amplitude. Method: Digitized resting EEG was recorded at the central parietal site (Pz) from 85 male and 113 female community volunteers (120 unrelated). ERPs were elicited at Pz by auditory and visual oddball paradigms. All participants were interviewed with the Schedule for Affective Disorders, Lifetime Version (SADS-L) and assigned blind-rated psychiatric diagnoses according to the American Psychiatric Association DSM-III-R criteria. Results: LVA participants (including alcoholics and nonalcoholics) had significantly lower auditory and visual P300 amplitudes. Absolute alpha power was modestly correlated with auditory and visual P300 amplitude and was associated with 9.4% and 4.6% of the variance, respectively Conclusions: The association between LVA and low P300 amplitude, two distinct electrophysiological traits, suggests that, at least in individuals with the LVA trait, some aspects of resting, unstimulated brain activity and activated brain function in the form of attentional response may be fundamentally related.

Methods: This contribution was studied using a set of systematically varying experimental paradigms. Such a strategy enabled the demonstration of the variations in the event-related potentials and the event-related oscillations as task conditions and respective cognitive operations systematically changed. The study employed easy oddball, hard oddball, mismatch negativity and single stimulus paradigms and it was conducted on 42 healthy adults (age range 19-30 years, 26 females, 16 males) from the university student population. Data were analyzed with electrophysiological (selective averaging, amplitude frequency characteristics, digital filtering) and statistical methods (analysis of variance, multivariate step-down regression). Results: The data showed that the morphology of the ERP components for different experimental paradigms represented a specific pattern of superposition of the delta and theta oscillatory responses. Conclusions: The cognitive correlates of the oscillatory responses were discussed and the results were evaluated on the basis of the superposition principle and the theory of oscillatory neural assemblies.

We use wavelet analysis to study whether the fluctuations in the modulation of the p-wave amplitude related to an indirect measurement of alertness. We found that these fluctuations exhibit a power-law behavior. When the level of alertness dropped, the associated exponent was found to increase, reflecting the fact that long-range correlations grow rapidly within the system. We also studied the fluctuations of amplitude modulation for alpha and theta waves, for which we did not find a power-law behavior.

In the present study, electroencephalographic activity was measured while humans navigated through virtual mazes. Results confirmed previous findings that the frequency of theta episodes is directly related to the difficulty of maze navigation. We were also able to show that theta episodes occur most likely at points in a maze where new hallways come into view, or after navigational mistakes have been realized and are being corrected. This indicates that, just as in rodents, theta episodes in humans are related to the encoding and retrieval of spatial information.

We investigated the temporal pattern of ripple occurrence in relation to sleep phases following different types of waking. Amphetamine, the atypical wakening drug modafinil or non-pharmacological sleep deprivation lead to an increased ripple occurrence ("re-bound") during the subsequent SWS episode. Waking of the same duration evoked by amphetamine or sleep deprivation led to a ripple rebound of similar extent (approximately 200%). The mean intraripple frequency was also elevated by up to 20 Hz during SWS following all treatments. Ripple amplitude was significantly increased only in experiments with amphetamine. Ripple occurrence but not intraripple frequency clearly correlated with the antecedent waking duration independent of treatment. Recovery of ripple occurrence and frequency to the pretreatment level during SWS depended on SWS duration. At the end of the recovery period paradoxical sleep (PS) acted like waking, elevating ripple occurrence during subsequent SWS episodes. On the other hand, PS decreased ripple occurrence if recovery from the rebound was not yet complete. Thus occurrence and structure of ripple oscillations are regulated by the timing and duration of previous SWS, PS and waking episodes. (C) 2003 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: In two sessions separated by 25 days, 10 subjects were presented with tones being of short (200 ms) and long (400 ms) duration equiprobably; tones were of high-probability standard or of low-probability deviant frequency. In Distraction condition, subjects had to behaviorally discriminate short from long tones. In Ignore condition, subjects were reading a book. Behavioral performance and multichannel EEG were recorded. Results: Task-irrelevant frequency deviations prolonged reaction times in the duration discrimination task by more than 35 ms and elicited the MMN and P3a components of the event-related potential. The P3a was followed by a negative deflection called RON (reorienting negativity). P3a and RON were absent in Ignore condition. All effects were found to be highly stable between sessions (product-moment correlations between 0.76 and 0.90). SCD analysis suggested frontal generators for P3a and for RON. Conclusions: It is demonstrated that small frequency deviations may yield distinct distraction effects in a tone duration discrimination task on a behavioral and on an electrophysiological level. Results support the hypothesis that frontal areas are involved in the exogenous orienting of attention (P3a) and in the reorienting of attention (RON). Due to the high stability of the deviance-related behavioral and ERP effects, this distraction paradigm may be utilized for clinical research. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Such sharp wave-ripple complexes (SPW-R) have been implicated in memory consolidation. We have recently described a novel and unique method for studying SPW-R in naive slices of murine hippocampus. Here, we used this model to analyse network and cellular mechanisms of this type of network activity. SPW-R are usually generated within area CA3 but can also originate within the isolated CA1 region. Cellular synchronisation during SPW-R requires both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission as well as electrical coupling, the latter being particularly important for the high-frequency component. Extracellular and intracellular recordings revealed a surprisingly strong inhibition of most CA1 pyramidal cells during SPW-R. A minority of active cells, however, increases action potential frequency and fires in strict synchrony with the field ripples. This strong separation between members and non-members of the network may serve to ensure a high signal-to-noise ratio in information processing during sharp wave-ripple complexes.

Paired-comparison tests were performed to examine the subjective preference of a flickering light. Electroencephalograms (EEGs), were recorded from 7 electrodes (10-20 system) during presentations of the most preferred and the least preferred flickering-light conditions. From the initial delay range of the ACF, the effective duration (tau(e)) was determined to describe the temporal characteristics of the alpha waves. Results show that the preferred flickering light has a significant larger tau(e) than that of the least preferred flickering light especially at the occipital area. In addition, the maximum value of the CCF (\phi(tau)\(max)) between the alpha waves and its delay time were analyzed. Results show that the preferred flickering light has a significant larger \phi(tau)\(max) than that of the least preferred flickering light.

Methods: Polysomnographic data of two consecutive nights recorded in healthy subjects (n = 18), patients with insomnia (n = 19), snoring (n = 29) and obstructive sleep apnoea (n = 28) were analysed retrospectively by using an automatic sleep staging system and the EEG-derived SFx. The SFx data were related to the factor values of the sleep questionnaire SF-A. Results: It was possible to describe the sleep intensity and stability and to document clear differences between healthy, and disturbed sleep by means of the SFx. For all included subjects the time spent in middle deep sleep (SFx-range Z(D)) seemed to be of great importance for the subjective assessment (SF-A) of "sleep quality". A great variability within the range of light sleep was related to a negative assessment of "sleep quality" and "feeling of recovery after sleep", while greater "psychic balance in the evening" before sleep was related to a reduced variability in the range of light sleep. A sleep quality index derived from the SFx-values is described which correlates with the subjective estimation of disturbed sleep in insomnia and apnoea patients. Conclusions: The main advantage of this method in comparison to the visual sleep scoring system is that the depth of sleep is assessed objectively and described continuously.

With increasing the physostigmine dose from 0,05 to 0.5 or 1 mg/kg the averaged power of the theta-rhythm did not rise in the range of 3.6-4.9 Hz and was suppressed in the range of 5.7-11.9 Hz both in the hippocampus and neocortex. The maximal frequency shifted to the left (from 3.6-6.4 to 3.6-4.9 Hz). In contrast to this, the averaged power in the delta (1-1.5 Hz)-I and beta-2 ranges (20.3-26.5 Hz) significantly nonlinearly increased and that of the beta-1 substantially decreased. Scopolamine eliminated all extrema of the hippocampal and neocortical EEG spectra induced by physostigmine, which is indicative of the role of M-cholinoreceptors in these effects. The increased dose of physostigmine (1 mg/kg) produced inversion of the ratio between the averaged power of beta-2 in neocortex and hippocampus: it became significantly higher than in the neocortex. All these data suggest that the mechanisms of cholinergic modulation of the theta-and beta-rhythms are essentially different. We think that significant enhancement of the content of endogenous acetylcholine content produce a long-term tonic decay of the functional activity of the hippocampus and neocortex and play an important role in the mechanisms of dissociated states of memory and consciousness, contextual learning and conditioned switching.

Theoretically, the same basic neural circuitry supports refixation and correct anti-saccade performances, with additional activity in primarily dorsolateral prefrontal cortex circuitry supporting antisaccade-associated inhibitory processes. Analyses demonstrated that sensory registration of visual stimuli is similar for refixation and anti-saccade conditions. Increased frontal brain activity at 5 and 15Hz was observed preceding correct antisaccades when compared to refixation saccades. These analyses provide specific information suggesting that 160-60ms before saccade generation is the critical period for response inhibition.

To this end we took recordings from macroelectrodes (MEs) inserted into the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in eight awake patients following functional neurosurgery for Parkinson's disease. An EEG was also recorded, as were the signals from MEs in the globus pallidus interna (GPi) in two of the cases. Coherence between EEG and ME potentials was apparent in three major frequency bands, 2-10 Hz, 10-30 Hz and 70-85 Hz. These rhythmic activities differed in their cortical topography, although coherence was always strongest over the midline. Coherence between EEG and ME potentials in the 70-85 Hz band was only recorded in patients treated with levodopa. Cortical activity phase led that in the basal ganglia in those oscillatory activities with frequencies <30 Hz. In contrast, STN and GPi phase led cortex in the 70-85 Hz band. The temporal differences in the way in which cortical activity led or lagged behind that in STN/GPi were similar, around 20 ms, regardless of the overall direction of information flow and frequency band. We conclude that the basal ganglia may receive multiple cortical inputs at frequencies <30 Hz and, in the presence of dopaminergic activity, produce a high frequency drive back to the cerebral cortex, in particular the supplementary motor area (SMA).

Modeling demonstrates that phasic changes allow activation of an appropriate subset of interconnected neurons, resulting in better encoding of sequences in sparse networks. During retrieval, phasic changes in membrane depolarization allow sampling across a range of retrieval strengths, preventing insufficient or excessive retrieval activity. The phasic transition between dynamics dominated by entorhinal input and dynamics dominated by excitatory synapses arising in region CA3 prevents retrieval from interfering with encoding of new input from entorhinal cortex.

Based on the anatomy and physiology of natural olfactory systems, it consists of a pair of coupled modules, bulb and cortex. The bulb encodes the odour inputs as oscillating patterns. The cortex functions as an associative memory: when the input from the bulb matches a pattern stored in the connections between its units, the cortical units resonate in an oscillatory pattern characteristic of that odour. Further circuitry transforms this oscillatory signal to a slowly varying feedback to the bulb. This feedback implements olfactory segmentation by suppressing the bulbar response to the pre-existing odour, thereby allowing subsequent odours to be singled out for recognition.

Brains select and pre-process the information carried by sensory stimuli before they construct meaning, and they post-process cognitive meaning into informative commands that control appropriate action and express meaning. A grasp of the intervening process of perception by which meaning is created from information requires observation of neural activity in brains during meaningful behavior of humans and other animals. Measurement is followed by detailed analysis and modeling of the neural activity in order to deduce brain dynamics from brain operations. Unlike computer operation, brain function is hierarchical with many levels. Neurobiologists infer sensory and motor information by recording pulses of microscopic axons of neurons. They infer meaning by recording the local mean fields that are generated by the dendrites of neurons forming interactive mesoscopic and macroscopic populations. Neural populations express meaning in spatial patterns of amplitude modulation of electroencephalographic (EEG) waveforms in the higher frequency ranges of cortical oscillations. Improved theory is needed to understand how brains create meaning. The aim of the theory is to apply population neurodynamics to devise new ways to treat clinical brain disorders, and to devise new machines with capacities for autonomy and intelligence that might approach those of simpler free-living animals.

More and more research in humans by means of noninvasive electrophysiological recordings was stimulated by these studies. Here, research on evoked and induced gamma band activity in human EEG and MEG mainly in the auditory and visual modality is reviewed and their role in perceptual processes, feature integration and language processing is discussed. In addition, research on the attentional modulation of gamma band activity is reviewed. In contrast to evoked gamma band activity, which occurs right after stimulus onset, induced gamma band activity can be recorded with a latency of 200 to 400 ms and a frequency range of 30 to 95 Hz. Cumulative consistent experimental evidence allows us to conclude that gamma band activity in the human cortex is related to neuronal information processing and cognitive functions, e.g. memory processes. The findings are discussed in the light of different functional theories of induced gamma band activity.

Method: EEG was recorded from central (Fz, Cz and Pz) and temporal (T3 and T4) electrodes while ten very mild AD patients and ten controls performed a Sternberg-type memory scanning task with three levels of working memory load. Spectral power in delta (0-3 Hz), theta (3-5 Hz), lower alphal (5-7 Hz), lower alpha2 (7-9 Hz), upper alpha (9-11 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) was averaged for temporal and central electrodes. Coherence was averaged between central electrodes, between central and right temporal electrodes and between central and left temporal electrodes. Results: While behavioral performance of very mild AD patients did not differ significantly from that of normal controls, findings suggest that normal controls but not AD patients respond to memory demands by increasing upper alpha power over temporal cortex. When compared with normal controls, AD patients had reduced upper alpha coherence between central and right temporal cortex. Discussion: Results are consistent with previous research on the role of upper alpha in semantic memory and suggest that very mild AD may inhibit selective synchronization of upper alpha in temporal lobes. Reduced coherence between central and temporal cortex is discussed in light of a neurological model of AD that hypothesizes reduced electrocortical efficiency and a breakdown of neural network communication to temporal lobes possibly resulting from temporal lobe atrophy.

Here, we have examined the effects on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and sleep-wake state of basal forebrain administration of neurotensin (NT), a neuropeptide that has been shown in vitro to potently and selectively modulate the cholinergic cells. Microinjection of (0.1-3.0 mM) NT into the basal forebrain of freely moving, naturally waking-sleeping rats produced ka dose-dependent decrease in delta (similar to1-4 Hz) and increase in both theta (similar to4-9 Hz) and high-frequency gamma activity (30-60 Hz) across cortical, areas with no increase in the electromyogram. These EEG changes were accompanied by concomitant decreases in slow wave sleep (SWS) and transitional SWS (tSWS), increases in wake, and most remarkably, increases in paradoxical sleep (PS) and transitional PS (tPS), despite the virtual absence of SWS. The effects were attributed to direct action on cholinergic neurons as evidenced by selective internalization of a fluorescent ligand, Fluo-NT, in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactive cells and stimulation by NT of bursting discharge in juxtacellularly recorded, Neurobiotin-labeled, ChAT-immunoreactive neurons. We conclude that NT-induced rhythmic bursting of cholinergic basal forebrain neurons stimulates rhythmic theta oscillations and gamma across the cerebral cortex. With the selective action of NT on the cholinergic cells, their bursting discharge promotes theta and gamma independent of motor activity and thereby also stimulates and enhances PS.

Recent studies indicate that the hippocampus is affected in human depression, and antidepressant drugs induce hippocampal adaptive changes that are thought to be associated with their therapeutic action. In the present study, we investigated the action of various antidepressant drugs on the activity of the septo-hippocampal system, its oscillatory activity in particular. The acute effects of the norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibitors reboxetine and desipramine, and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine were evaluated. Extracellular single-unit recordings were performed from the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (MS/DBv), with simultaneous hippocampal EEG recordings of anesthetized rats. Systemic administration of reboxetine synchronized hippocampal EEG, resulting in a significant increase in power at theta frequency, and an increase in frequency and power of gamma-wave activity. Parallel to EEG synchrony, reboxetine induced or enhanced theta oscillation of MS/DBv neurons. Oscillatory frequencies of MS/DBv neurons were identical, and phase locked to the corresponding hippocampal theta frequencies. Under the same experimental conditions, reboxetine induced a two-fold increase in extracellular NE (but not serotonin) levels in the hippocampus as revealed by microdialysis. Desipramine, but not the serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine, evoked responses similar to those of reboxetine regarding septo-hippocampal theta activity. The present findings indicate that even though both NE and serotonin reuptake inhibitors are clinically effective antidepressant drugs, their action on the septo-hippocampal oscillatory behavior is different. It is presumed that selective NE reuptake inhibitors could modulate various cognitive processes associated with hippocampal oscillatory activity.

However, both ictal and interictal events are not equally affected by the different sleep states. Besides the well-known dichotomy between non-REM sleep (high activation) and REM sleep (low activation), epileptic phenomena are deeply sensitive to the ongoing level of arousal. Methods: During non-REM sleep the arousal level can be either unstable, as expressed by the repetitive sequences of the cyclic alternating pattern (CAP), or stable, as reflected by non-CAP. Phase A (arousal complex) and phase B (post-arousal rebound response) are the two basic components of the CAP cycle, which presents a 20-40 s periodicity. Three subtypes of A phases can be recognized: the A1 subtypes, which are thoroughly composed of K-complexes and delta bursts, and subtypes A2 and A3 dominated by moderate (A2) or prominent (A3) EEG desynchrony. Results: As a manifestation of unstable sleep, CAP offers a favorable background for the occurrence of nocturnal motor seizures that in most cases arise in concomitance with a phase A. In primary generalized epilepsy (PGE) and in lesional epilepsies with fronto-temporal focus, activation of interictal discharges is high during CAP reaching the climax during phase A and the strongest inhibition during phase B. A lack of modulation is observed instead in epilepsy with benign rolandic spikes. In PGE, the interictal bursts are mostly associated with the highly synchronized phase A1 subtypes. Conclusions: The analysis of sleep microstructure based on CAP parameters offers a sensitive framework for exploring the linkage between dynamic EEG events and epileptic phenomena.

Both phenomena are time-locked but not phase-locked to the event and they are highly frequency-band specific. The ERD is interpreted as a correlate of an activated cortical area with increased excitability and the ERS in the alpha and lower beta bands can be interpreted, at least under certain circumstances, as a correlate of a deactivated cortical area. Spatial mapping of ERD/ERS can be used to study the dynamics of cortical activation patterns. Examples from a movement task are reported. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In animal studies, alerting stimuli produce particularly marked skin vascular responses. We hypothesized that changes in skin vascular conductance would provide more sensitive markers of autonomic arousal during sleep compared to central cardiovascular response measures such as HR and PTT. Design: Cardiovascular responses to auditory-induced arousals were recorded during overnight sleep studies. Setting: Sleep disorders unit in a 270-bed teaching hospital. Participants: Eleven young healthy male subjects. Interventions: Throughout overnight sleep studies, auditory tones (5-second duration, 54-90 decibels, 22-56 per subject) were presented during non-rapid-eye-movement sleep. Beat-by-beat HR, PTT, laser-Doppler fingertip skin blood flow (SBF) and finger and ear photoplethysmogram pulse wave amplitudes (PWA) were measured in the 20 seconds preceding and 30 seconds following each tone and compared to control measurements obtained during 50-second periods of recording with no stimulus (no tone, 6-22 per subject). Electroencephalographic (EEG) arousals were scored according to standard criteria (American Sleep Disorders Association) into no discernible, 3- to 10-second duration, or 10- to 15-second duration arousals. Poststimulus cardiovascular measurements were expressed as a percentage of the prestimulus mean and response magnitudes quantified from peak responses and the area under the poststimulus response curve. The ability of each cardiovascular response measure to discriminate EEG arousals (EEG changes lasting more than 3 seconds) was assessed from the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Measurements and Results: There were no significant changes in any cardiovascular parameter during control recordings. In contrast to all other parameters, finger PWA and SBF decreased following tones that produced no discernible EEG arousal (P<0.05). A significant HR rise and decreases in all cardiovascular measures occurred with greater than 3-second arousals, with longer duration arousals generally exhibiting larger responses. Conventional EEG arousals (greater than 3 seconds) were relatively poorly detected from HR responses (ROC area HR rise 0.80+/-0.04) compared to changes in SBF (0.85+/-0.02), PTT (0.85+/-0.03) and finger PWA (0.90+/-0.01). Conclusions: Decreases in skin vascular conductance (finger PWA and SBF) provide sensitive markers of autonomic arousal during sleep. They are at least as sensitive as PTT for detecting conventionally scored EEG arousals and may be more sensitive in detecting "subcortical" arousals.

Unexpected findings from retrospective, cross-sectional, and prospective analyses	PAIN			English	Article						HIV infection; AIDS; migraine; tension-type headache; symptomatic headache	IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS INFECTION; TRANSIENT NEUROLOGICAL DEFICITS; HEMICRANIA CONTINUA; PAIN SYNDROMES; MIGRAINE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PROPHYLAXIS; DISEASE	Headache is one of the most important factors influencing the quality of life in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV). However, only symptomatic headache but not changes or primary headache types during HIV infection have been studied to date. Therefore, we aimed to determine the impact of an HIV infection on frequency and semiology of different primary headache types. Patients with confirmed HIV type 1 infection underwent a neurological examination, neuroimaging or EEG, and a standardized interview. Time pattern and symptoms of headaches (cross-sectional analysis), changes of headaches preexisting to their infection (longitudinal retrospective analysis), and changes of primary headaches during a 2-year follow-up (longitudinal prospective analysis) were evaluated as were the correlations between these headache patterns and different markers of HIV infection. One hundred thirty-one consecutive HIV-infected patients without evidence of a cerebral manifestation except mild encephalopathy were enrolled. The point prevalence of migraine was 16.0% (confidence interval (CI) 10.1-25.4%), of headache with a semiology of tension-type headache 45.8% (CI 33.7-62.2%), and of other headache types 6.1% (CI 3.0-12.5%). During the natural course of infection, the migraine frequency significantly decreased in the retrospective and in the prospective analyses, whereas the frequency of the headache with a semiology of tension-type headache significantly increased in all three analyses. In 20% of all patients, the tension-type headache could be considered as symptomatic due to the infection but not due to focal or general cerebral lesions. Changes of primary headache were significantly associated with different stages of the infection and with the presence of mild encephalopathy but not with antiretroviral treatment or CD4 cell count. HIV infection seems to be associated with a progressive decrease in migraine frequency and intensity which probably is related to the immunological state of the patients. Tension-type headache becomes more frequent during HIV infection. However, this can in part be related to secondary headache caused by the HIV in less than 50% of patients with tension-type headache. The progressing immunological deficiency of HIV-infected patients seems to influence pain processing of primary headache types in different ways.

J	Freeman, WJ				Freeman, WJ			Evidence from human scalp electroencephalograms of global chaotic itinerancy	CHAOS			English	Article							STATE TRANSITIONS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; OLFACTORY EEG; GAMMA-EEGS; PHASE; SYNCHRONIZATION; EXPLANATION; BEHAVIOR; CORTEX; ALPHA	My objective of this study was to find evidence of chaotic itinerancy in human brains by means of noninvasive recording of the electroencephalogram (EEG) from the scalp of normal subjects. My premise was that chaotic itinerancy occurs in sequences of cortical states marked by state transitions that appear as temporal discontinuities in neural activity patterns. I based my study on unprecedented advances in spatial and temporal resolution of the phase of oscillations in scalp EEG. The spatial resolution was enhanced by use of a high-density curvilinear array of 64 electrodes, 189 mm in length, with 3 mm spacing. The temporal resolution was advanced to the limit provided by the digitizing step, here 5 ms, by use of the Hilbert transform. The numerical derivative of the analytic phase revealed plateaus in phase that lasted on the order of 0.1 s and repeated at rates in the theta (3-7 Hz) or alpha (7-12 Hz) ranges. The plateaus were bracketed by sudden jumps in phase that usually took place within 1 to 2 digitizing steps. The jumps were commonly synchronized in each cerebral hemisphere over distances of up to 189 mm, irrespective of the orientation of the array. The jumps were usually not synchronized across the midline separating the hemisphere or across the sulcus between the frontal and parietal lobes. I believe that the widespread synchrony of the jumps in analytic phase manifest a metastable cortical state in accord with the theory of self-organized criticality. The jumps appear to be subcritical bifurcations. They reflect the aperiodic evolution of brain states through sequences of attractors that on access support the experience of remembering.

The advantages and limitations of iEEG recordings are introduced in detail, with an estimation of their spatial and temporal resolution for both monopolar and bipolar recordings. The contribution of iEEG studies to the general field of human brain mapping is discussed through a review of the effects observed in the iEEG while patients perform cognitive tasks. Those effects range from the generation of well-localized evoked potentials to the formation of large-scale interactions between distributed brain structures, via long-range synchrony in particular. A framework is introduced to organize those iEEG studies according to the level of complexity of the spatio-temporal patterns of neural activity found to correlate with cognition. This review emphasizes the value of iEEG for the study of large-scale interactions, and describes in detail the few studies that have already addressed this point. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

To determine if this phasic input has an impact on synaptic transmission within the hippocampus, we recorded evoked population excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSPs) during different phases of theta rhythm by using techniques similar to those described in Rudell and Fox. Synaptic potentials elicited by stimulation of region CA3 of the contralateral hippocampus were recorded in region CAI and CA3. In these experiments, the initial slope of evoked potentials showed a change in magnitude during different phases of the theta rhythm recorded in the dentate fissure, with individual trials showing an average of 9.5% change in slope of potentials, and the average across all experiments showing a change of 7.8%. Evoked potentials were maximal 18 degrees after the positive peak of the dentate fissure theta EEG. These potentials were also smaller by 18.2% during theta as opposed to non-theta states. Phasic changes in modulation of synaptic transmission could contribute to phase precession of hippocampal place cells and could enhance storage of new sequences of activity as demonstrated by computational models.

In the first experiment, subjects were exposed intermittently during an 8 h nighttime sleep episode and in the second experiment, unilaterally for 30 min prior to a 3 h daytime sleep episode. Here we report an extended analysis of the two studies as well as the detailed dosimetry of the brain areas, including the assessment of the exposure variability and uncertainties. The latter enabled a more in depth analysis and discussion of the findings. Compared to the control condition with sham exposure, spectral power of the non-rapid eye movement sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) was initially increased in the 9-14 Hz range in both experiments. No topographical differences with respect to the effect of RF EMF exposure were observed in the two experiments. Even unilateral exposure during waking induced a similar effect in both hemispheres. Exposure during sleep reduced waking after sleep onset and affected heart rate variability. Exposure prior to sleep reduced heart rate during waking and stage 1 sleep. The lack of asymmetries in the effects on sleep EEG, independent of bi- or unilateral exposure of the cortex, may indicate involvement of subcortical bilateral projections to the cortex in the generation of brain function changes, especially since the exposure of the thalamus was similar in both experiments.

Design: In the new method, an experimental neonatal rat and a yoked control neonatal rat were singly housed in a small plexiglass chamber which was divided into two separate units by a vertical wall. The floor of the housing chamber was attached to the platform of a standard laboratory test tube shaker. EEG and EMG electrodes were implanted by the soft head plug method which permitted continuous, long-term polysomnography. EEG and EMG signals were sent to a computer that was programmed to turn on the shaker for 5 seconds whenever the experimental rat entered REM sleep. Setting: NA Patients: NA Interventions: NA Results: The shaking of the chamber usually terminated REM sleep by entry to slow-wave sleep or wake. Amount of RSD depended on the shaker's oscillation speed. At higher speed the method reduced REM sleep by more than 80%. Conclusions: Thus, the new instrumental method of RSD can be used to study developmental functions of neonatal REM sleep. In particular, the instrumental method can test the hypothesis that in rats neonatal RSD produces the adult depressogenic effect of neonatally administered clomipramine.

Twenty healthy, right-handed male volunteers aged 22-35 years (mean age 27.2 years) served as subjects in this study. Methods: EEGs were recorded from disc electrodes placed at bilateral frontal, central, parietal, occipital, anterotemporal and poster otemporal (10-20 electrode system) sites using A1 + A2 for reference. Period-amplitude analysis was performed by the zero-crossing method using the Medilog Sleep Analyzing Computer. Results: Delta counts in the right frontal and central regions during all-night sleep were significantly greater than in those of the left; total delta counts of the right frontal region were greater than those of the left in 18 of the 20 subjects. There were no significant differences in delta counts between the left and right hemispheres in parietal, occipital, anterotemporal, and postero-temporal regions. Conclusions: These results suggest distinct laterality in the number of delta waves in the frontal and central regions, reflecting functional asymmetry of the brain during sleep.

With the present experiments, we characterized the anatomical targets that mediate the cortical-activating effects of histamine. Urethane-anaesthetized rats displayed continuous large-amplitude, low-frequency oscillations with a maximal spectral power in the delta (0.5-3.9 Hz) frequency band. Electrical (100 Hz) stimulation of the pontine-tegmentum suppressed slow, large-amplitude oscillations and induced ECoG activation. Application of histamine (1 mm) into the basal forebrain cholinergic complex by reverse microdialysis enhanced ECoG activation elicited by tegmental stimulation without changing resting ECoG activity. Ventrolateral or central thalamic application of histamine had no effect on resting ECoG activity, and ventrolateral thalamic application produced only a slight enhancement of brainstem-induced activation. Neocortical application of histamine in close proximity (< 500 mum) to the recording electrode reduced low-frequency delta power in the resting ECoG without affecting stimulation-induced ECoG activation. These data suggest that, under the present experimental conditions, histamine facilitates ECoG activation primarily by potentiating the excitatory influence of brainstem fibers at the level of the basal forebrain. Histamine release in some parts of the thalamus results in a minor enhancement of ECoG activation, and cortical histamine release produces a small but consistent suppression of slow delta oscillations in the resting ECoG. These concurrent subcortical and cortical actions probably permit histamine to effectively modulate cortical activation and excitability across different behavioural states.

J	Bijma, F; de Munck, JC; Huizenga, HM; Heethaar, RM				Bijma, F; de Munck, JC; Huizenga, HM; Heethaar, RM			A mathematical approach to the temporal stationarity of background noise in MEG/EEG measurements	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						magnetoencephalography; spatiotemporal covariance; temporal stationarity; alpha activity	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; DIPOLE SOURCE LOCALIZATION; COVARIANCE MODEL; EVOKED-RESPONSES	The general spatiotemporal covariance matrix of the background noise in MEG/EEG signals is huge. To reduce the dimensionality of this matrix it is modeled as a Kronecker product of a spatial and a temporal covariance matrix. When the number of time samples is larger than, say, J = 500, the iterative Maximum Likelihood estimation of these two matrices is still too time-consuming to be useful on a routine basis. In this study we looked for methods to circumvent this computationally expensive procedure by using a parametric model with subject-dependent parameters. Such a model would additionally help with interpreting MEG/EEG signals. For the spatial covariance, models have been derived already and it has been shown that measured MEG/EEG signals can be understood spatially as random processes, generated by random dipoles. The temporal covariance, however, has not been modeled yet, therefore we studied the temporal covariance matrix in several subjects. For all subjects the temporal covariance, shows an alpha oscillation and vanishes for large time lag. This gives rise to a temporal noise model consisting of two components: alpha activity and additional random noise. The alpha activity is modeled as randomly occurring waves with random phase and the covariance of the additional noise decreases exponentially with lag. This model requires only six parameters instead of 1/2J(J + 1). Theoretically, this model is stationary but in practice the stationarity of the matrix is highly influenced by the baseline correction. It appears that very good agreement between the data and the parametric model can be obtained when the baseline correction window is taken into account properly. This finding implies that the background noise is in principle a stationary process and that nonstationarities are mainly caused by the nature of the preprocessing method. When analyzing events at a fixed sample after the stimulus (e.g., the SEF N20 response) one can take advantage of this nonstationarity by optimizing the baseline window to obtain a low noise variance at this particular sample.

J	De Gennaro, L; Ferrara, M; Bertini, M				De Gennaro, L; Ferrara, M; Bertini, M			The boundary between wakefulness and steep: Quantitative electroencephalographic changes during the sleep onset period	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						wakefulness-sleep transition; electroencephalogram; spectral analysis; alpha band	EEG; TRANSITION	Microstructural electroencephalographic changes during the wake fulness-sleep transition have been investigated by comparing two definitions of sleep onset: the first occurrence of stage 1 and of stage 2. Power values were calculated across a 1-28-Hz frequency range in a 1-Hz bin resolution in the sleep recordings of 26 normal subjects. Quantitative changes were assessed after averaging individual time series, aligned with respect to the first occurrence of stage 1 or of stage 2. The time course of the single-Hz activity revealed a linear increase of power in the 1-6-Hz range and a linear decrease in the 9-12- and 16-28-Hz ranges during the stage 1 transition. During the stage 2 transition, electroencephalogram power linearly increased in the 1-7- and 14-15-Hz ranges and decreased in the 18-28-Hz range, while the 8-12-Hz range fitted a second-order polynomial curve. The two 'switch' points were also compared in their ability to differentiate Hz by Hz wakefulness from sleep: a lower mean power was found after stage 1 onset in the 9-11-Hz and 20-28-Hz bins and a higher one in the 1-5-Hz bins, while a higher power was found in the 1-8-Hz and 12-16-Hz bins and a lower one in 18-28-Hz bins after stage 2 onset. The time course of three electroencephalographic frequency ranges [delta/theta/sigma (1-7 and 12-16 Hz); beta (17-28 Hz); alpha (8-11 Hz)], grouped on the basis of a principal component analysis, fitted a first-order polynomial curve for the first two ranges, and a second-order polynomial curve for the last. with a progressive decrease curing wakefulness, a minimum point during stage 1, and a subsequent increase during stage 2. The uniformly increasing electroencephalographic power across the 1-16-Hz frequency range during stage 2 and the shift of functional meaning for the alpha power during stage 1 point to the start of stage 2 as a more reliable boundary between wakefulness and sleep.

So-called '40-Hz' activity in humans could reflect such a mechanism. We have presented here experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis, both in the visual and auditory modalities. However, different types of gamma activity should be distinguished, mainly the evoked 40-Hz response and the induced gamma activities. Only induced gamma activities seem to be related to coherent object representations. In addition, their topography depends on sensory modality and task, which is in line with the idea that they reflect the oscillatory synchronization of task-dependent networks. They can also be functionally and topographically distinguished from the classical evoked potentials and from the alpha rhythm. It was also proposed that the functional role of gamma oscillations is not restricted to object representation established through bottom-up mechanisms of feature binding, but also extends to the cases of internally driven representations and to the maintenance of information in memory.

Current views of the so-called binding problem, which considers hypothetical mechanisms of perception of sensory stimuli and formation of their corresponding Gestalts (internal images) are discussed. The mechanism of intensification of synchronized reactions of cortical electrucal activity in the gamma band frequence (30-80 Hz) is the basis of the most popular point of view of "binding". The article considers the evidence for the funcrional significance of the high-frequency components exceeding the gamma-range (to 200 Hz) obtained by the author, the origin of these oscillations, and conditions of their focal derivation. The problem of "binding" and stages of instrumental conditioning (a stimulus, perception of the stimulus, and its transformation into a signal) as well as significance of the context in learning and formation of tonic states ensuring the realization of phasic reactions is discussed. Forms of "binding" at the final stage of conditioning (selective attention) are considered. The question is posed as to whether "binding"' is exhausted only by the mechanisms of synchonization of activities of large neuronal populations and only in the frequencies of the gamma range.

Using this model, conditions for the occurrence of in-phase as well as anti-phase synchronized oscillations are investigated in terms of the parameters representing rising and decaying relaxation rates of synaptic couplings. Then, it is examined whether neuronal spiking of a system with excitatory or inhibitory synaptic couplings which occurs in the new model, is dependent on synaptic response. We will then compare our findings to previous results. In comparison to our previous study, we now suggest that occurrence of the synchronization phenomena depend on specific properties of neuronal firing dynamics.

In this study with human subjects, the evoked (time locked) and induced (not time locked) theta response is analyzed in a recognition task. The results show a strong evoked theta response during an early retrieval period of up to 400 ms. Only for good memory performers theta is strictly time locked, indicating that theta peaks appear in preferred time windows after a target is presented. This effect - which coincides with a large P3 - suggests that good performance requires a strict timing of different processing stages that correspond to cycles of theta activity.

Herein, we present a method for the extraction of a new waveform, namely the mean. induced potential (IP), which allows the identification of the spatiotemporal characteristics of induced EEG responses. The IP calculation was applied to the 20-Hz component of the sensorimotor rhythm in order to obtain a 20-Hz sensorimotor induced potential (20-Hz SIP). The spatiotemporal characteristics of the 20-Hz bursts seen after median nerve stimulation and self-paced finger movements were extracted by means of current source density reconstruction and synchronization analysis. A cortical network including the controlateral primary motor cortex, the supplementary motor area, and the controlateral supramarginalis gyrus was found to generate the 20-Hz bursts, and the various activated areas were found to be highly synchronized.

From these recordings, we have found gamma (30-150 Hz) [Neuroscience 90 (1999) 1149] and beta-1 (10-20 Hz) [NeuroReport 10 (1999) 3055] activities during wakefulness in human medial temporal lobe. In this paper, we will report changes of these frequencies across wake and natural sleep. Electrocorticograms during wake, slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep were subjected to fast Fourier transformation analysis. During wake two spectral enhancements, beta-1 and gamma, were consistently observed across subjects. In the raw signal, beta-1 was observed as a regular rhythmic oscillation. In slow wave sleep, the beta-1 peak disappeared but gamma remained, although slightly reduced in power. During REM sleep, beta-1 appeared again, but the peak frequency was significantly lower than during wake (mean frequency: wake=16.6, REM=12.8 Hz). The gamma peak was also present in REM sleep. It has been known that the rhythmic slow activity (RSA) or theta is observed in some animals. However, it is unclear whether the human hippocampus displays similar activity. Since human beta-1 appears during wake and REM sleep when RSA is observed in other species, and since beta-1 is also a regular rhythmic oscillation, we propose that beta-1 may be the functional equivalent of hippocampal RSA (theta) observed in some animals. Functional significances of the gamma activity should be further investigated. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science BN. All rights reserved.

However, the possibility of a stable relationship between waking mnemonic performance and sleep-dependent hippocampal electric activity is unexplored. Here we report a correlative analysis between sleep-dependent parahippocampal-hippocampal (pHip-Hip) electric activity recorded by foramen ovale (FO) electrodes and different types of memory performances in epileptic patients. Psychological testing was performed days or weeks before electrophysiological recordings. The relative spectral power of the slow activity (below 1.25 Hz) during deep non-REM (NREM) sleep at the right pHip-Hip region correlated positively with the visual memory performance according to Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (ROCFT). Along the posterior-anterior direction of the hippocampal formation a linear increasing of correlations was observed. The relative power of the activity below 1.25 Hz at the left pHip-Hip during phasic REM sleep correlated positively with verbal learning performance and mnemonic retention values according to ROCFT. It is concluded that the pHip-Hip structures' capacity of producing high amplitude and synchronized slow (< I Hz) oscillation during deep NREM sleep is related to the functional power of these structures. We hypothesize that the asymmetric (side-specific) propagation of ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) activity to the pHip-Hip region is related to the memory correlates of phasic REM sleep.

Epidemiologic research suggests that occupational exposure to power-frequency magnetic fields may be associated with autonomically mediated cardiac mortality. Results from our laboratory studies of humans exposed to 60-Hz magnetic fields overnight, however, are inconsistent. HRV is altered in some studies but not others. To clarify this, the pooled data from seven studies involving 172 men were analyzed to test specific hypotheses concerning this inconsistency After analysis, we excluded a) measurement drift or instability over time because HRV was stable under sham-exposed conditions across all studies; b) inadequate statistical power or failure to maintain double-blind controls; c) differences in field intensity (28.3 vs. 127.3 mu T) or exposure pattern (intermittent versus continuous) as main effects; or d) the inclusion of individuals sensitive to magnetic field exposure in some studies but not others. Four separate analytic techniques failed to identify a valid subpopulation of sensitive individuals. In some studies, however, hourly blood samples were collected using an indwelling venous catheter. HRV alterations occurred during intermittent exposure in these studies (p < 0.05) but nor in similar studies without blood sampling. This result suggests a field interaction with modest arousal or disturbance. Because HRV is tightly coupled to electroencephalographic activity during sleep, these results are physiologically plausible and suggest that HRV alterations during exposure to magnetic fields may occur when accompanied by increases in physiologic arousal, stress, or sleep disturbance.

Despite this experimental use of GHB, as well as its therapeutic use in narcolepsy and its increasing abuse, however, the precise cellular mechanisms underlying the different pharmacological actions of this drug are still unclear. Because sensory thalamic nuclei play a key role in the generation of SWDs and sleep rhythms, and because direct injection of GHB in the ventrobasal (VB) thalamus elicits SWDs, we investigated GHB effects on corticothalamic EPSCs and GABAergic IPSCs in VB thalamocortical (TC) neurons. GHB (250 muM - 10 mM) reversibly decreased the amplitude of electrically evoked EPSCs and GABA(A) IPSCs via activation of GABA(B) receptors; however, similar to 60% of the IPSCs were insensitive to low (250 muM- 1.0 mM) GHB concentrations. The putative GHB receptor antagonist NSC 382 applied alone had a number of unspecific effects, whereas it either had no action on, or further increased, the GHB-elicited effects on synaptic currents. Low GHB concentrations ( 250 muM) were also effective in increasing absence-like intrathalamic oscillations evoked by cortical afferent stimulation. These results indicate that low concentrations of GHB, similar to the brain concentrations that evoke SWDs in vivo, differentially affect excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents in TC neurons and promote absence-like intrathalamic oscillations. Furthermore, the present data strengthen previous suggestions on the GHB mechanism of sleep promotion and will help focus future studies on the cellular mechanisms underlying its abuse.

In vivo experiments with partial deafferentation of cat suprasylvian gyrus after extensive undercut of the white matter were conducted using multi-site EEG, extracellular unit and intracellular recordings. The amplitudes of EEG waves were much higher in the areas surrounding deafferented cortical fields as compared with control and with undercut cortex. In 40% of animals with undercut cortex, paroxysmal activity occurred 2-3 h after the undercut and was initiated in the relatively intact cortex, adjacent to the more disconnected one. The seizures that followed the undercut consisted of spike-wave/polyspike-wave complexes and fast runs, resembling the electrographic patterns of some clinical epileptic syndromes. An increased local synchrony in the relatively intact cortex evolved into paroxysmal activity that ultimately spread to the deafferented cortex. The electrographic seizures were found only in animals that showed a propagation of the slow sleep-like oscillation in control conditions. The increase of long-range synchrony within a given seizure was associated with seizure termination. These results indicate that alterations in neuronal synchrony following neuronal trauma can be a critical factor triggering electrographic seizures.

J	Salzedo, E; Duca, S; Gianelli, M; Mutani, R				Salzedo, E; Duca, S; Gianelli, M; Mutani, R			Quantitative MR (volumetry and relaxometry) in the study of temporal epilepsy	RIVISTA DI NEURORADIOLOGIA			Italian	Article						temporal epilepsy; hippocampal sclerosis; volumetry; relaxometry; MR	T2 RELAXATION-TIME; LOBE EPILEPSY; HIPPOCAMPUS; SENSITIVITY	The most common neuropathologic lesion in patients with temporal epilepsy is hippocampal sclerosis, present in 50-70% of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Diagnosis of hippocampal sclerosis is made by MR investigation. but despite the use of appropriate sequences for study of the temporal region, around 40% of MR scans are negative for this disease. The "quantitative MR" technique was introduced to enhance to sensitivity of MR by relaxometry and computerised volumetry techniques. We examined 14 healthy subjects and 32 patients with temporal epilepsy assessing seizure type, age at onset of epilepsy; duration, history of febrile convulsions, seizure frequency. drug resistance, secondary generalisation and EEG patterns. MR investigation was performed using a high field system (1.5 T) for target assessment of the temporal regional as well as sequences for relaxometry and volumetry of the hippocampus For relaxometry studies Ive performed monoslice multiecho T2-weighted sequences mapping hippocampal T2 relaxation times measured in milliseconds with coronal sections perpendicular to the largest axis of the hippocampus. Images for volumetric assessment of the hippocampus Ir ere obtained from T1 3D FFE coronal sequences 3 mm thick. The hippocampal surface was drawn manually and the total volume calculated by multiplying the surfaces obtained by the number and thickness of the sections in which the hippocampus was present. Statistical analysis of tire results was done using Pearson's correlation coefficient, Student's t test and the C2 test. Results showed that both hippocampuses were reduced in volume in the patients with temporal lobe epilepsy compared with the control group, whereas relaxometric analysis showed a significant change in T2 relaxation times of the hippocampus in temporal epilepsy patients only if the findings correlated with the EEG focus. Volumetric measurements allow accurate assessment of the size of the hippocampus, but tile firming of volumetric reduction of a hippocampus is based on comparison with tile controlateral hippocampus: volumetry alone is insufficient in assessing bilateral hippocampus sclerosis. Study of T2 relaxation times has the advantage of supplying absolute numerical values expressed in milliseconds which be compared with normal or pathological values described in die literature. In addition, this measurement does not require corrections or interpretation which could make investigation less objective. Instead, the disadvantage of this technique is that increased T2 relaxation time is air aspecific index, not necessarily linked to hippocampus sclerosis. Another limitation is that this measurement is made on a single 5mm thick sequence so that hippocampus signal changes not included in the section may be missed. As quantitative MR requires considerable technical and human resources and significantly longer MR examination times, this method should riot be applied in all patients with suspect hippocampus sclerosis, but confirmed to cases with negative qualitative e MR, those with suspect bilateral involvement of hippocampus structures and surgical candidates	Osped Gradenigo, Dipartimento Neurosci, I-10100 Turin, Italy; Osped Koelliker, Turin, Italy; Neurol Univ, Osped San Luigi, Orbassano, Italy										19	0	0	0	0	EDIZIONI CENTAURO	BOLOGNA	VIA DEL PRATELLO, 8, 40122 BOLOGNA, ITALY	1120-9976			RIV NEURORADIOL	Riv.

Steiger, H. Murck - Oral MG(2+) supplementation reverses age-related neuroendocrine and sleep EEG changes in humans, Pharmacopsychiatry, 35 (2002), 135-143	SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Editorial Material								Objectives: Magnesium (Mg) has been recognized as potentially affecting sleep and sleep-related neuroendocrine function and shown in prior work by these authors to alter EEG sleep characteristics. This study aims to determine if oral Mg supplement also improves sleep and related neuroendocrines, particularly in the elderly (age 60-80). Study design: Double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study. Study population: Healthy elderly subjects, age 60-80 (average 68.1, standard deviation 5.7), six women and six men. Methods: Two 20-day treatment periods, separated by 2 weeks, involved either a placebo or Mg administered as effervescent tablets given in a fixed escalation of the 10 mmol dose, first only in the morning for 3 days, then in the morning and noon for 3 days, and finally three times a day for the remaining 14 days of the treatment period. At the end of each treatment period a polysomnogram (PSG) was obtained for two nights, the first for accommodation without any actual recording and the second for the study data. Sleep was recorded from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. the next day. An indwelling intravenous cannula was used to obtain repeated blood samples every 30 min from 8 to 10 p.m. and every 20 min from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. for analyses of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, renin and aldosterone. Arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and angiotensin II (ATII) were measured from the blood samples taken every hour. The blood analyses of ACTH, cortisol, renin and aldosterone were evaluated using standard area under the curve calculated separately for samples from the first (11:00 p.m.-2:20 a.m.) and the second (2:20 - 7:00 a.m.) parts of the night. Results: The analyses of the PSG for Mg compared to the placebo treatment condition showed significantly more slow-wave sleep (averages - standard deviations: 16.5 +/- 20.4 vs. 10.1 +/- 15.4 min.), but no significant change in total sleep time or amount of wake time during the night. The spectral analyses of the sleep EEG during the Mg treatment showed greater power in the delta and sigma frequency ranges (differences in both of about 0.5 standard deviations) but no significant differences in the theta, alpha and beta ranges. The analyses of the nocturnal hormones for the Mg compared to the placebo treatment found significantly lower Cortisol and higher renin for the first part of the night and significantly higher renin and aldosterone for the second part of the night. Aldosterone was also higher for the Mg condition in the first part of the night, but the difference was not statistically significant (f = 2.8, n = 9 - blood analyses data were lost on three subjects). Serum analyses of Mg levels failed to show any significant difference between the treatment conditions. Adverse effects associated with the Mg treatment included soft stools for all subjects and slight edema in the extremities for one subject. Conclusions: The authors note that aging produces decreases in slow-wave sleep and in delta and sigma (spindle frequency) spectral power and that these three measures are improved with Mg treatment in their sample of older adults. Similarly, aging is associated with increased nocturnal cortisol release and with decreased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The latter is shown by decreased plasma renin not associated with high blood pressure as well as reduced aldosterone concentration. The Mg treatment reversed the aging effect on both of these measures. The authors note that the increase in aldosterone might account for the slow-wave sleep increase and for the changes in cortisol, both of which have been shown to occur with experimentally induced increases in aldosterone. It is noted, however, that the increase in aldosterone was only marginally significant for the first part of the night. The authors also suggest that the differences observed could have resulted from the Mg effects on both the glutamatergic and GABAergic systems. They further argue that the changes with aging partly reversed by Mg treatment match those for depression, and the Mg treatment might thus serve as a mood stabilizer. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Based on polysomnographic data from 12 healthy subjects, this study focuses on the spectral differentiation between phasic and tonic periods. Phasic PS periods exhibited decreased theta and alpha power in the posterior brain areas suggesting the interference of visual processing related to dream imagery. Phasic PS periods were also characterized by a shift from beta to gamma activity in frontal, central and occipital areas reflecting specific phasic related activation.

We explored SOBI's ability to help isolate underlying neuronal sources with relatively poor signal-to-noise ratios, allowing their identification and localization. We compare localization of the SOBI-separated components to localization from unprocessed sensor signals, using an equivalent current dipole modeling method. For visual and somatosensory modalities, SOBI preprocessing resulted in components that can be localized to physiologically and anatomically meaningful locations. Furthermore, this preprocessing allowed the detection of neuronal source activations that were otherwise undetectable. This increased probability of neuronal source detection and localization can be particularly beneficial for MEG studies of higher-level cognitive functions, which often have greater signal variability and degraded signal-to-noise ratios than sensory activation tasks.

Phase coupling of these activities has rarely been reported for areas far apart. Other forms of coupling are generally not detected by conventional measures. Here, we use amplitude envelope correlation (AEC), which can detect signal coupling without phase coherence, even among different frequencies. We apply it to subdural recordings from humans performing a visual delayed match-to-sample task and systematically compare it with spectral amplitude and coherence. The different measures often show divergent results. In particular, AEC reveals gamma-coupling completely missed by coherence. We argue that coherence and AEC are adapted to different cortical mechanisms of short- and long-range interactions, respectively. NeuroReport 11:1509-1514 (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Significant differences relating to emotional intelligence were observed in induced and event related band power in the theta (4.4-6.4 Hz), lower-2 alpha (8.4-10.4 Hz), and upper alpha band (10.4-12.4 Hz). High emotional intelligent individuals displayed less desynchronization in the upper alpha band, as well as more left hemispheric theta desynchronization. Further a significant positive correlation between the mean frequency and emotional intelligence was observed. The results are similar to those reported for verbal and performance components of general intelligence. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

We studied the effects of QiGong on brain function with modern neuromonitoring tools in two subjects. In a male QiGong master (extremely trained practitioner), the technique induced reproducible changes in transcranial Doppler sonography, EEG, stimulus-induced 40 Hz oscillations, and near-infrared spectroscopy findings. Similar effects were seen after the application of multimodal stimuli and when the master concentrated on intense imagined stimuli (e.g. 22.2% increase in mean blood flow velocity (v(m)) in the posterior cerebral artery, and a simultaneous 23.1% decrease of v(m) in the middle cerebral artery). Similar effects were seen in the female subject. Neuromonitoring during QiGong appears able to objectify accompanied cerebral modulations surrounding this old Chinese meditation exercise.

NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						theta oscillations; event-related desynchronization/event-related synchronization; emotion; hemispheric asymmetry	DESYNCHRONIZATION ERD; EMOTION; POTENTIALS; AROUSAL; EEG	Event-related desynchronization (ERD) and synchronization (ERS) in the theta frequency band was measured while subjects viewed stimuli with differing emotional content (from the International Affective Picture System). A significant valence by hemisphere interaction emerged only in the anterior temporal regions, showing relatively greater right hemisphere ERS for negative and left hemisphere ERS for positive stimuli. In turn, in the posterior brain regions affectively valenced vs neutral stimuli prompted larger extent of ERS against the background of the overall right hemisphere dominance in theta synchronization. The findings document that valence discrimination is associated with the early (200-500 ms poststimulus) time-locked synchronized theta activity as well as hemispheric asymmetries in anterior-posterior direction.

High intelligent individuals, as compared with average ones in both tasks displayed a lesser full width at half maximum (FWHM) volume-indicating the amount of spatial dispersion of the source. High and average intelligent individuals also differed in their source location. The source location of high intelligent individuals was in the inferior right hemispheric brain areas, whereas the source location of average intelligent individuals was in the superior left hemispheric brain areas.

Such homeostatic mechanisms are reflected by selective increases in the duration of a sleep stage, modifications to electrophysiological-metabolic brain patterns in specific sleep states, and/or reactivation to neuronal ensembles in subsequent sleep periods. Use-dependent sleep changes, apparently different from those changes caused by memory consolidation processes, are thought to reflect neuronal restoration processes after the sustained exposure to stimulation during the preceding wakefulness. In the present study, we investigated changes in the brain electrical activity pattern during human sleep after 6 hr of continuous auditory stimulation during previous wakefulness. Poststimulation nights showed a widespread increase of spectral power within the alpha (8-12 Hz) and sleep spindle (12-15 Hz) frequency range during slow-wave sleep (SWS) compared with the baseline night. This effect was mainly attributable to an enhanced EEG amplitude rather than an increase of oscillations, except for temporal (within alpha and sleep spindles) and parietal regions (within sleep spindles) in which both parameters contributed equally to the increase of spectral energy. Power increments were accompanied by a strengthening of the coherence between fronto-temporal cortical regions within a broad frequency range during SWS but to the detriment of the coherence between temporal and parieto-occipital areas, suggesting underlying compensatory mechanisms between temporal and other cortical regions. In both cases, coherence was built up progressively across the night, although no changes were observed within each SWS period. No electrophysiological changes were found in rapid eye movement sleep. These results point to SWS as a critical brain period for correcting the cortical synaptic imbalance produced by the predominant use of specific neuronal populations during the preceding wakefulness, as well as for synaptic reorganization after prolonged exposure to a novel sensory experience.

The oscillatory response has shorter latency from stimulus and earlier temporal evolution than the VERs, with different orientation of the source currents. These results suggest the activation of (partly) distinct generating neuronal assemblies with contributions to the development of the VER response. A functional role in stimulus-related cortical synchronization during early visual processing is further suggested and appears consistent with the results of single-unit/multiunit animal research.

The results show a phasic power increase in the theta frequency range, together with a phasic power decrease in the alpha frequency range, following the presentation of words in a sentence. These effects may be related to word processing, either lexical or in relation to sentence context. Most importantly, there is a slow and highly frequency-specific increase in theta power as a sentence unfolds, possibly related to the formation of an episodic memory trace, or to incremental verbal working memory load.

II. Numerical simulations, spectral entropy, and correlation times	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							PHARMACODYNAMICS; HIPPOCAMPAL	In our two recent papers [M.L. Steyn-Ross et al., Phys. Rev. E 60, 7299 (1999); 64, 011917 (2001)] we presented clinical evidence for a general anesthetic-induced phase change in the cerebral cortex, and showed how the: significant features of the cortical phase change (biphasic power surge, spectral energy redistribution, "heat capacity" divergence), could be explained using a stochastic single-macrocolumn model of the cortex. The model predictions were based on rather strong "adiabatic" assumptions which assert that the mean-field excitatory and inhibitory macrocolumn voltages are "slow" variables whose equilibration times are much longer than those of the input "currents" that drive the macrocolumn. In the present paper we test the adiabatic assumption by running numerical simulations of the stochastic differential equations. These simulations confirm the number and nature of the steady-state solutions, the growth of fluctuation power at transition, and the redistribution of spectral energy towards lower frequencies. We use spectral entropy to quantify these changes in the power spectral density, and to show that the spectral entropy should decrease markedly at the point of transition. This prediction agrees with recent clinical findings by Viertio-Oja and colleagues [J. Clinical Monitoring Computing 16, 60 (2000)]. Our modeling work shows that there is an inverse relationship between spectral entropy H and correlation time T of the soma-voltage fluctuations: H proportional to-(In T). In a theoretical analysis we prove that this proportionality becomes exact for an ideal Lorentzian process. These findings suggest that by monitoring the changes in EEG correlation time, it should be possible to track changes in the state of patient consciousness.

J	von Stein, A; Sarnthein, J				von Stein, A; Sarnthein, J			Different frequencies for different scales of cortical integration: from local gamma to long range alpha/theta synchronization	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						synchronization; oscillation; interaction; top-down; attention; imagery; memory; semantics	CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; ASSOCIATION CORTEX; ONGOING ACTIVITY; HUMAN BRAIN; RESPONSES; MEMORY; TIME; REPRESENTATION; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS	Cortical activity and perception are not driven by the external stimulus alone; rather sensory information has to be integrated with various other internal constraints such as expectations, recent memories, planned actions, etc. The question is how large scale integration over many remote and size-varying processes might be performed by the brain. We have conducted a series of EEG recordings during processes thought to involve neuronal assemblies of varying complexity. While local synchronization during visual processing evolved in the gamma frequency range, synchronization between neighboring temporal and parietal cortex during multimodal semantic processing evolved in a lower, the beta1 (12-18 Hz) frequency range, and long range fronto-parietal interactions during working memory retention and mental imagery evolved in the theta and alpha (4-8 Hz, 8-12 Hz) frequency range. Thus, a relationship seems to exist between the extent of functional integration and the synchronization-frequency. In particular, long-range interactions in the alpha and theta ranges seem specifically involved in processing of internal mental context, i.e, for top-down processing.

The visual, auditory, somatic, and olfactory cortices generate dendritic potentials that oscillate at frequencies from 1-100 Hz. These waves reveal macroscopic activity arising from synaptic interactions of millions of neurons. They share a spatially coherent oscillation as a "carrier", by which spatial patterns of amplitude modulation (AM) are transmitted in distinctive configurations, when subjects receive sensory stimuli they have learned to discriminate. These spatial AM patterns are unique to each subject, are not invariant with respect to stimuli. and cannot be derived from the stimuli by logical operations. The "carrier" is aperiodic, usually dispersed over a wide spectral range. Our simulations of the "carrier" indicate that its dynamics is chaotic, and that sequential patterns are freshly constructed during perception, because chaotic systems can create as well as destroy information. The entire experience of a subject, which is embedded in synaptic connections in cortex that were modified during learning, can be brought instantly to bear at each state transition by which a new construction is initiated. It is suggested that "feature binding" revealed by microscopic recording is related to the formation of a "chaotic construct" early in the process of perception.

Methods: We videotaped and analyzed 110 seizures from 18 patients with PCE, aged 3-81 months. All had a good prognosis after posterior epileptogenic zone removal. fetal events were categorized by behavioral, consciousness, autonomic, and sensory features, as well as motor patterns, which included myoclonic, tonic, clonic, unclassified motor seizures, and epileptic spasm. A time-scaled data sheet was developed to record each epileptic event as onset, very early, early, or late manifestation. Results: Patients had a high seizure frequency with less than or equal to100 attacks/day; one third of them showed a cluster tendency. The mean duration of seizures was 67 s. The most common seizure components were motor manifestations (with myoclonic and tonic seizures), but psychomotor (automotor), hypomotor attacks, and isolated auras also were frequently observed. Clinical seizure spread was frequent; auras and visual sensory signs were difficult to record in this age. Typical phenomena during seizures included behavioral changes, ictal vocalization, smile, flush, head nod, oculomotor features, and late-appearing oral automatisms, whereas hypermotor and secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures were not seen. Conclusions: Our results suggest that PCE in infants and young children is very heterogeneous but shows important age-related features. Compared with adults, children with PCE have shorter but more frequent seizures; they rarely report aura or visual sensory signs, only sporadically develop hypermotor and secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures, whereas ictal smile, flush, head nod, and behavioral change are typical features at this age. Because of frequent subtle ictal phenomena, long-term video-EEG monitoring is a useful diagnostic tool with infants and young children with PCE.

Here we investigate whether events are also reflected in momentary changes in the degree of synchronization between neuronal elements. We simultaneously recorded local potentials (LPs) from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and/or ipsilateral globus pallidus interna (GPi) or scalp EEG during voluntary movements of a hand-held joystick in six awake patients following neurosurgery for Parkinson's disease. Without medication the power within the STN and the coherence between the STN and the GPi were dominated by activity with a frequency of <30 Hz. This coupling was attenuated by movement. In the presence of exogenous dopaminergic stimulation, power within the STN and coherence between the STN and the GPi was dominated by activity at 70-85 Hz, which increased with movement. The movement-related changes in coherence between the STN and EEG showed a similar pattern of pharmacological dependence, as seen subcortically. Movement-related frequency-specific changes in synchronization occur in the basal ganglia and extend to involve subcortico-cortical motor loops. The dynamic organization of activities in the frequency domain might provide a means for temporal co-ordination within and across different processing streams in the basal ganglia. This organization is critically dependent on the level of dopaminergic activity.

About 10% of snorers worldwide suffer from OSA, unknown to them, nevertheless requiring medical attention; in Singapore, about 15% of the total population have been estimated to be affected by OSA [1]. The standard method of diagnosis of OSA, known as polysomnography (PSG), requires that the patients spend one full day in a hospital, wired to a multitude of instruments such as ECG/EEG recorders, chest bands, breathing detectors and microphones. PSG is inconvenient, expensive and severely time-consuming, constraining its use on only a tiny fraction of patients who really need such testing. In this paper, we investigate the use of acoustic features derived from snoring, a prominent symptom of OSA, as a method of simplifying the diagnosis procedure and to discriminate between benign (non-pathological) and apneic cases of snoring. We analyzed snoring sounds based on second-order and higher-order statistics, specifically its formants and bispectrum. Formants provide information on the resonance of the frequency components, while the bispectrum provides information about the nonlinearities in the snoring signal arising from nonlinear acoustical/structure properties of the vocal tract.

Sleep fragmentation in the form of multiple arousals is associated with daytime somnolence and cognitive impairment; however, manual scoring of arousal is time consuming and problematic due to relatively high inter-scorer variability. We have recently shown that automated analysis of in-lab recorded peripheral arterial tone (PAT) signal and the pulse rate derived from it can accurately assess arousals from sleep as defined by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM). In the current study we sought to extend these findings to the Watch_PAT100 (WP100), an ambulatory device measuring PAT, oximetry and actigraphy. Methods: Sixty-eight subjects (61 patients referred to the sleep lab with suspected obstructive sleep apnea and seven healthy volunteers, mean age 46.3 +/- 14.2 years) underwent a whole night polysomnography (PSG) with simultaneous recording of PAT signal by the ambulatory WP100 device. The PSG recordings were blindly manually analyzed for arousals based on AASM criteria, while PAT was scored automatically based on the algorithm developed previously. Results: There was a significant correlation between AASM arousals derived from the PSG and PAT autonomic arousals derived from the WP100 (R = 0.87, P < 0.001), with a good agreement across a wide range of values. The sensitivity and specificity of PAT in detecting patients with at least 20 arousals per hour of sleep were 0.80 and 0.79, respectively, with a receiver operating characteristic curve having an area under the curve of 0.87. Conclusions: We conclude that automatic analysis of peripheral arterial tonometry signal derived from the ambulatory device Watch_PAT100 can accurately identify arousals from sleep in a simple and time saving fashion.

By the use of temporal spectral evolution (TSE) analysis, the change in background cortical activity in relation to self-paced finger/wrist extension was compared among the SMA proper, S1 and M1, All three areas showed a decrease in the amount of activity for the frequency range between 10 and 40 Hz before the onset of movement [event-related desynchronization (ERD)]. The SMA proper showed earlier onset of ERD for 18-22 Hz activity (-3.4 +/- 0.5 s, mean +/- standard deviation) than M1 (-1.7 +/- 0.7 s) and S1 (-1.4 +/- 0.5 s), The degree of ERD in S1 was greatest for 10-14 Hz and that in M1 for 18-22 Hz, whereas in the SMA proper ERD was observed throughout the frequency bands from 10 to 40 Hz, Neither the degree nor the onset time of ERD in the SMA proper was lateralized to either the ipsilateral or the contralateral side with respect to the movement. A transient increase in activity after movement [event-related synchronization (ERS)] was observed in all three areas. In the SMA proper, two out of four subjects showed ERS for frequency bands below 40 Hz with both ipsilateral and contralateral movements. By contrast, in S1 and M1, ERS was recorded for frequency bands between 20 and 90 Hz, and was predominantly associated with the contralateral movement. The present study suggests that the background cortical activity in the SMA proper has a specific temporal pattern with respect to self-paced movement, and that the SMA proper is involved in motor preparation earlier than S1-M1 in a bilaterally organized manner.

Six young volunteers were instructed to extend briskly their dominant wrist as soon as possible after hearing a 2000 Hz sound. Two sequences of stimuli were presented to each subject, the first rhythmic at 1/6 s and the second with random intervals between 5 and 13 s. A time-frequency analysis of nonphase-locked activity in the 7-37 Hz range was performed on stimulus-centred EEG sweeps using wavelet filters and Gabor transforms. During the sequence of predictable rhythmic stimuli, stimulus-induced movements were accompanied by a decrease in beta activity that began contralaterally about 1 s prior to the stimulus and extended to both sides later on. This decrease was followed by a rebound after the end of the movement. In the alpha band, the decrease observed started just after the sound. During the sequence of non-predictable, random stimuli, stimulus-induced movements were accompanied by a shorter and smaller alpha and beta-ERD, that started after the stimulus. The presence of a pre-stimulus beta ERD only in the rhythmic predictable paradigm suggests that central pre-movement beta ERD may be an indicator of motor preparation, and could be used for objective evaluation of time estimation and motor timing. The minimal differences observed in the alpha changes in both paradigms suggest that alpha-ERD may not be linked to motor preparation.

Methods: Recordings were obtained from 74 patients with multilead electrodes in the frontal. parietal and temporal cortex. The motor task consisted of a self-paced fist clenching movement at approximately 10 s intervals. Events within a window extending from 4 s before to I s after movement EMG onset were analyzed. Results: (i) Spindle-like rhythmic activity at 6-9 Hz was observed in 29 patients. (ii) This activity was located in the inferior parietal and superior temporal areas. (iii) Enhancement of rhythmic activity occurred when patients were asked to perform the motor task. (iv) A striking tendency to phase-locking of rhythmic oscillations on consecutive trials was noted during the 3-2 s epoch before movement EMG onset. Conclusion: Whether this intracerebrally recorded 6-9 Hz rhythmic activity belongs to the mu-alpha class or is a special type of theta, and if it is related to the epileptic process or to drug treatment remain open to discussion, Motor-task related enhancement and phase-locking suggest that this activity may be one more indicator of movement preparation.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that VID and VEPs reflect different aspects of cortical activation. For this purpose, we determined whether VID and VEPs are differentially modulated by low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the occipital pole. Scalp EEG responses to visual stimuli (flashed either to the left or to the right visual field) were recorded for 8 min in six healthy subjects (1) before, (2) immediately following, and (3) 20 min after left occipital rTMS (1 Hz, 10 min). The parameters aimed to reduce cortical excitability beyond the end of the TMS train. In addition, simple reaction times to visual stimulation were recorded (left or right hand in separate blocks). In all subjects, VID was significantly and prominently reduced by rTMS (P = 0.0001). In contrast, rTMS failed to modulate early VEP components (P1/N1). A moderate effect was found on a late VEP component close to manual response onset (P = 0.014) but this effect was in the opposite direction to the VID change. All changes were restricted to the targeted left occipital cortex. The effects were present only after right visual field stimulation when a right hand response was required, were associated with a behavioral effect, and had washed out 20 min after rTMS. We conclude that VID and early VEPs represent different aspects of cortical activation. The findings that rTMS did not change early VEPs and selectively affected VID and late VEPs in conditions where the visual input must be transferred intrahemispherically for visuornotor integration (right visual field/right hand) are suggestive of rTMS interference with higher-order visual functions beyond visual input. This is consistent with the idea that alpha desynchronization serves an integrative role through a corticocortical "gating function." (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

Using intracranial recordings from 793 widespread cortical and subcortical sites in 10 epileptic patients undergoing invasive monitoring, we compared oscillatory power at frequencies ranging from 2 to 64 Hz as participants studied lists of common nouns. Significant increases in oscillatory power during encoding predicted subsequent recall, with this effect predominantly in the 4-8 Hz ( theta) and 28-64 Hz (gamma) frequency bands. Sites exhibiting increased theta activity during successful encoding were clustered in right temporal and frontal cortex, whereas those exhibiting increased gamma activity appeared bilaterally at widespread cortical locations. These findings implicate theta and gamma oscillatory activity, across a widespread network of cortical regions, in the formation of new episodic memories.

To further illuminate the relationship of gamma-band activity and selective somatic attention, we have studied the effects of direction of attention on the stimuli of somatosensory evoked potentials. Responses during focused attention to stimulation of the right median nerve and ignored stimulation at the right tibial nerve were compared with responses of ignored stimulation of the right median nerve but focused attention to stimulation at the right tibial nerve. Subtraction of the data demonstrated a significant predominantly right hemispheric event-related synchronization in the gamma-band by attention to the right median nerve in the time period between 280 and 325 ms post-stimulus. This finding implicates the involvement of a right temporoparietal network in selective spatial attention. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Reasoning by analogy, they seek to view hypnosis in terms of an action pattern that represents a self-contained behavioral program although not as rigid as seen in lower organisms. In humans, such a program develops within the context of a long developmental sequence emphasizing social connections, imitation of significant figures, and the use of linguistic symbols to regulate both internal and external processes and actions. In terms of a mechanism, the authors speculate on the involvement of the cingulate cortex in achieving in hypnosis the experience of autonomous actions or analgesic sensory processes. Finally, they point to the fact that hypnotizability is associated with an ability to reduce the experience of pain, modulate the immune system, and achieve greater benefits of psychosocial therapies as a functional significance of the hypnotic experience.

We used measures of phase locking and phase coherence in the scalp-recorded electroencephalogram to examine the synchronization of neural circuits in schizophrenia. Compared with matched control subjects, schizophrenia patients demonstrated: (1) absence of the posterior component of the early visual gamma band response to Gestalt stimuli; (2) abnormalities in the topography, latency, and frequency of the anterior component of this response; (3) delayed onset of phase coherence changes; and (4) the pattern of anterior-posterior coherence increases in response to Gestalt stimuli found in controls was replaced by a pattern of interhemispheric coherence decreases in patients. These findings support the hypothesis that schizophrenia is associated with impaired neural circuitry demonstrated as a failure of gamma band synchronization, especially in the 40 Hz range.

However, the precise cognitive and neurological mechanisms underlying weak central coherence are still unknown. We propose the hypothesis that the features of autism associated with weak central coherence result from a reduction in the integration of specialized local neural networks in the brain caused by a deficit in temporal binding. The visuoperceptual anomalies associated with weak central coherence may be attributed to a reduction in synchronization of high-frequency gamma activity between local networks processing local features. The failure to utilize context in language processing in autism can be explained in similar terms. Temporal binding deficits could also contribute to executive dysfunction in autism and to some of the deficits in socialization and communication.

Electroencephalographic narrow-band absolute and relative spectral powers were calculated for every 1 Hz of frequency from the recordings of 40 healthy male university students during emotional tasks. Sentences evoking positive, negative, and neutral emotional states were used as stimuli. Repeated multivariate analyses of variance were computed with IQ as covariate. The results showed only a few significant relations between absolute power and emotion. Relative power reflected better the differences determined by emotional states. The frequencies between 7.6 and 9.5 Hz showed differences between emotional states over the entire scalp with increased power during neutral state. Interaction between emotional states and cerebral regions revealed that all cerebral areas had an important role, especially frontal, parietal, and temporal regions. Hemispheric differences showed less power in the left hemisphere during positive emotional state (joy of love) in lthe 8.6 to 9.5 Hz band and in the right hemisphere during negative emotional state (frustration) in the 17.6 to 18.6 Hz band. Significant interaction between states, hemispheres, and electrode positions was observed in the frequency range of 17.6 to 19.5 Hz. As none of our results covered the range of any broad band, we may conclude that narrow-band calculations are more adequate for the study of emotions, because their use reduces the danger that frequency-specific effects go undetected or cancel each other.

Design: Open, observational trial with retrospective analysis of guideline performance. Data were analyzed from 1,552 adult patients receiving general anesthesia with surgical times of at least I hour and who were extubated by postanesthesia care unit (PACU) discharge. Staff were trained using a simple decision matrix, which integrated BIS titration goals with anesthetic management. Unmonitored patients were compared to either BIS-monitored patients or to performance subgroups based on BIS measurements recorded during anesthetic maintenance ("deep", BIS < 50; "target". 50-65; "light" >65). Setting: Large, urban academic/trauma renter. Measurements and Main Results: Demographic profiles Of all groups and subgroups were similar Anesthetic emergence, recovery times, and volatile drug use were significantly shortened or reduced only when BIS values were maintained between between 50 and 65 Extubation time from end of surgery decreased by 2.1 minutes from 5.7 +/- 7 (37%); OX exit time decreased by 2.2 minutes from 9.3 +/- 6 (24%); eligibility for phase 1 PACU discharge decreased by 4 minutes from 22 +/- 42 (23%); and actual PACU discharge decreased by 15 minutes from 130 +/- 78 (7%). PACU extubation frequency decreased from 6.9% to 2.6%. Modest decreases in total intraoperative drug use were noted with an increase in PACU analgesic administration. Conclusions: Routine application of BIS monitoring throughout an OX suite impacted clinical outcome only if guideline targets were met. BIS values within the last 30 minutes of surgery were not predictive of emergence or recovery. Hypnotic,maintenance at BIS < 50 did not confer. any clinical advantage over unmonitored cases. Anesthetic maintenance at BIS values between 50 and 65 was associated with shortened emergence and recovery from general anesthesia. (C) 2000 by Elsevier Science Inc.

It is difficult to establish the appropriate dose of general anaesthetic drugs in the morbidly obese patient. Moreover, there are conflicting data concerning adequate anaesthesia levels and the severity of postoperative pain. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the spectral edge frequency (SEF) during general anaesthesia and the severity of immediate postoperative pain following gastric banding surgery in morbidly obese patients. Methods: Seventy-one ASA 2 morbidly obese patients (BMI > 35%) undergoing elective laparoscopic gastric banding procedure were recruited for this study. Anaesthesia consisted of midazolam, fentanyl and thiopental for induction, vecuronium for muscle relaxation, N-2 O and isoflurane with additional fentanyl administrations, according to the clinical judgement of the anaesthesiologist, for maintenance. Continuous SEF monitoring was added to the standard monitors (SpO(2) , ETCO2 , ECG, NIBP, O-2 and isoflurane concentration), but the EEG monitor screen was hidden from the anaesthesiologist's sight. SEF postoperative analysis divided the patients into two groups: group 1, SEF-recommended target range of 8-12 Hz, more than 80% of the surgical time; and group 2, SEF-recommended target range of 8-12 Hz, less than 80% of the surgery duration. Pain intensity was assessed in the post anaesthesia care unit using a standard visual analogue scale (VAS) of 10 cm, when patients were awake enough to correct a deliberately given wrong own telephone or ID number. Intravenous morphine was administered for postoperative analgesia in 2-mg increments, every 3-4 min, until the patient felt comfortable. A recovery room nurse unaware of the SEF range recorded during surgery registered pain severity and morphine requirements. Results: The end-tidal isoflurane concentration was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (0.83 vs. 0.7 P = 0.016). The intensity of pain at admission into the recovery room and at discharge was significantly lower in group 1 than in group 2 (VAS 6.1 vs. 6.9-P = 0.0049, and 3.9 vs. 4.2-P = 0.00478, respectively). Conclusions: Keeping the SEF range between 8 and 12 Hz during anaesthesia for laparoscopic gastric banding for morbid obesity, both the immediate post operative pain intensity and morphine requirement, are significantly reduced.

The 21 cases were treated by deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy, and followed up for over 10 years. The stimulation sites were the mesen cephalic reticular formation (2 cases) and CM-pf complex (19 cases). Eight of the patients emerged from the PVS, and became able to obey verbal commands. However, they remained in a bedridden state. These 8 cases revealed a desynchronization on continuous EEG frequency analysis. The Vth wave of the ABR and N20 of the SEP could be recorded even with a prolonged latency, and the pain-related P250 was recorded with an amplitude of over 7 muV. The mean survival time of these 8 cases was 6.1 years, as compared to 3.1 years for the other 13 cases. Overall, 4 cases are alive after more than 10 years. DBS therapy may be useful for allowing patients to emerge from a PVS, if the candidates are selected according to neurophysiological criteria. The fact that 19% (4/21) of the PVS cases treated with DBS survived for over 10 years should be stressed in comparison with the usual survival period for the untreated PVS.

The subjects performed three visuomotor tasks, tracking a moving visual target with a joystick-controlled cursor; threading pieces of tubing; and pinching the fingers sequentially against the thumb. Control conditions were resting and active wrist extension. ECoGs were recorded at 14 sites in hand- and arm-sensorimotor area, functionally identified with electrical stimulation. For each behavior we computed spectral power of ECoG in each site and coherence in all pair-wise sites. In three out of six subjects, gamma-oscillations were observed when the subjects started the tasks. All subjects showed widespread power decrease in the range of 11-20 Hz and power increase in the 31-60 Hz ranges during performance of the visuomotor tasks. The changes in gamma-range power were more vigorous during the tracking and threading tasks compared with the wrist extension. Coherence analysis also showed similar task-related changes in coherence estimates. In contrast to the power changes, coherence estimates increased not only in gamma-range but also at lower frequencies during the manipulative visuomotor tasks. Paired sites with significant increases in coherence estimates were located within and between sensory and motor areas. These results support the hypothesis that coherent cortical activity may play a role in sensorimotor integration or attention. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recording intracranial field potentials from five amygdalas in four patients with chronically implanted depth electrodes, we analyzed responses in the gamma frequency range, a region of the power spectrum thought to reflect especially the contribution of neuronal activity to cognitive processes. Significant changes in the power amplitude of responses were obtained selectively to visual images judged to look aversive but not to those judged to look pleasant or neutral. Several possible confounds were addressed: all four patients had been carefully selected so that the amygdalas from which recordings were obtained were distal to epileptogenic foci, making it likely that we recorded from healthy tissue, and the observed responses could not be attributed to luminance or color differences between the stimuli. A further analysis of differences in power between the high and low gamma bands revealed an additional structure that discriminated those stimuli related to bodily injury from those related to disgust. Despite the increased power amplitude in the gamma range, there was no stimulus- locked phase coherence. The observed responses in the gamma frequency range may reflect the role of the amygdala in binding perceptual representations of the stimuli with memory, emotional response, and modulation of ongoing cognition, on the basis of the emotional significance of the stimuli.

Methods: Visual evoked potentials were recorded at F3, Cz, P3, and O1 in 12 young (20-30-year-olds) and in 10 middle-aged adults (50-55-year-olds). Slow (7-10 Hz) and fast (10-15 Hz) alpha frequency bands were analyzed. Three parameters of single alpha responses were assessed for the 0-300 ms period after stimulus: (i) maximal single-sweep amplitude; (ii) phase-locking with stimulus, and (iii) enhancement of post-stimulus relative to pre-stimulus alpha activity. Results: Ongoing alpha activity at anterior sites was larger in middle-aged subjects. Age differences in response amplitude depended on the anterior shift of ongoing alpha activity. Over fronto-central areas, the phase-locking of fast alpha responses was significantly increased, whereas the phase-locking of slow alpha responses was decreased in middle-aged compared to young adults, independently of amplitude. In contrast to slow alpha responses, frontal and occipital fast alpha responses were interrelated. Conclusions: These observations are in accordance with previous findings from the auditory modality implying that the age-related changes in frontal alpha oscillations are modality-independent. Slow and fast frontal alpha responses were affected differentially by the age, which might reflect the activations of functionally distinct alpha networks. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Evoked potentials were created by time-locking electroencephalography to the onset of electrical stimulation delivered through the lead implanted in the STN of patients who had previously undergone deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. The effect of different patterns of stimulation on the evoked response, including single- and paired-pulse as well as burst stimulation, was explored. Cortical evoked potentials to single pulses were observed with latencies as short as 1 to 2 msec after a single pulse of stimulation, with activity continuing, in some cases, for up to 400 msec. Paired-pulse experiments revealed refractory periods on the order of 0.5 msec, suggesting that stimulation of axons contributed to the generation of at least some portion of the evoked potential waveform. Evoked potentials were also present in response to 100-msec bursts of stimulation, with some evidence that the potential was initiated within the burst artifact. The potential implications of the types of responses observed as well as potential applications are discussed. (C) 2002 Movement Disorder Society.

The recent surge of interest in these macroscopic sigma-burst responses is energized by the prospect of monitoring noninvasively, highly synchronized and rapidly repeating population spikes generated in the human thalamic and cortical somatosensory system. Thus, analyses of spike-related sigma-bursts could uniquely complement conventional low-frequency EEG/MEG, reflecting mass excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials that potentially also incorporate subthreshold activities of undetermined functional relevance. Recent studies using spatiotemporal source analysis of multichannel recordings identified regional burst sources subcortically (near-thalamic) as well as cortically. At the primary somatosensory cortex, sigma-burst generators showed the well-established homuncular somatotopic ordering. Functionally, the 600-Hz burst appears to comprise multiple subcomponents with differential sensitivity to stimulus rate, intensity, sleep-wake cycle, tactile interference, subject age, and certain movement disorders. A plenitude of cellular candidates contributing to burst generation at different levels can already now be envisaged, including cuneothalamic and thalamocortical relay cells, as well as cortical bursting pyramidal cells and fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons. Although cellular burst coding might serve to relay information with high efficiency, concepts to link macroscopic sigma-bursts and cellular substrates call for additional study.

However, little is known about their topographical distribution in comparison to delta-waves and to K-complexes superimposed by spindles, Patients and methods: In this study, the topographical distribution of spontaneous K-complexes and delta-waves in S2 and delta-waves in stage 4 steep (S4) in 10 healthy young adults (aged 20 to 35 years, 7 female) was investigated. K-complexes with and without spindles in S2, delta-waves with and without spindles in S2, and delta-waves in S4 distributed all over the night were visually selected. EEG power maps and statistical parametric maps were calculated. Results: Absolute delta power of S2 K-complexes appeared to be significantly higher than of S2 delta-waves and delta power of S4 delta-waves was higher than of S2 delta-waves. In K-complexes and delta-waves, power was found to be highest over medio-frontal regions in the delta frequency band (0.5 - 4.0 Hz) with a second maximum occipitally in delta-waves, no matter whether superimposed by a spindle or not. Conclusion: K-complexes and delta-waves in S2 differ in topographical distribution. Even though in S2 delta-waves have less power, they have a similar topographical distribution in S2 and S4, supporting the hypothesis that delta-waves in S2 further develop towards delta-waves in slow wave sleep. The delta frequency components of K-complexes and delta-waves are unaffected by spindles.

Here we address this by determining which neural structures and rhythms lead to and participate in generalised discharges in the picrotoxin rat model of PGE. Methods: Rats with chronically implanted electrodes were infused with picrotoxin until a seizure occurred. This process we refer to as acute epileptogenesis. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded and spectral analysis applied off-line to determine changes in the spectral power of contributing frequencies in 13 brain regions. Results: Two types of generalised discharge occurred, spindles and seizure, which were present in all brain regions studied. None of the frecuencies (1-100 Hz) were significantly increased in background EEG before either spindles or seizure. Within the generalised discharges. power changes revealed significant increases in 6-8 Hz, most powerful in ventrolateral thalamus and neocortex, Gamma frequencies were increased significantly in neocortical structures during spindles with further increases in most structures,it seizure onset. 1 Hz was significantly increased in parietal cortex during spindles with differential increases at seizure onset. Conclusions: We conclude that gamma, 1 and 6-8 Hz frequencies do not appear to contribute to picrotoxin epileptogenesis but do play a role in generalised seizures. The distribution of these frequencies during discharges suggests that the spindles are thalamocortical events and that the seizure is a cortical event with downstream effects on other brain regions.

We observed a significant stimulus-aligned activity at the 40 Hz frequency band 100 ms after the appearance of the target only when that target was the end point for the subsequent eye movement (pro-saccade). This activity was most prominent over the central-parietal area of the right hemisphere. When the target indicated a movement to the opposite direction (anti-saccade) or indicated that no movement was required (no-move), this 40 Hz activity was nearly absent. This difference in activity between the pro-saccade and the other two tasks was evident in the single subject ERPs for four of the six subjects studied. In contrast, the movement-aligned 40 Hz activity for the pro-saccade and anti-saccade was almost identical. We speculate that this early stimulus-aligned 40 Hz activity might reflect a fast transformation of a visual stimulus to a motor response (eye movement) that can be performed for the pro-saccade task where stimulus-response compatibility is strong compared to the antisaccade and no-move tasks. The movement-aligned 40 Hz activity might be related to the motor response preparation per se. We conclude that this task specific transient oscillatory activity could be used as a probe in the study of the temporal dynamics of visuomotor transformations.

J	Gruber, T; Muller, MM; Keil, A				Gruber, T; Muller, MM; Keil, A			Modulation of induced gamma band responses in a perceptual learning task in the human EEG	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; BRAIN ACTIVITY; SHAPE-RECOGNITION; PHASE SYNCHRONY; IMPLICIT MEMORY; OBJECTS; OSCILLATIONS; IDENTIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; POTENTIALS	Fragmented pictures of an object, which appear meaningless when seen for the first time, can easily be identified after the presentation of an unfragmented version of the same picture. The neuronal mechanism for such a rapid perceptual learning phenomenon is largely unknown. Recently, induced gamma band responses (GBRs) have been discussed as a possible physiological correlate of activity in cell assemblies formed by learning. The present study was designed to investigate the modulation of induced GBRs in a perceptual learning task by using a 128-channel EEG montage. In the first sequence of the experiment, fragmented pictures from the Snodgrass and Vandervart inventory were presented. The fragmentation of the pictures was selected that subjects were unable to identify them. In the second experimental sequence-the perceptual learning sequence-half of the pictures were displayed in their unfragmented version. In the third sequence, all pictures were presented again in the fragmented version. Now, subjects had to rate whether or not they could identify the: images. Results showed an increase in spectral gamma power at parietal electrode sites for identified pictures. In addition, neural activity in the gamma band was highly synchronized between posterior electrodes. For pictures not presented in their complete version, we found no such pattern in the third sequence. From our results, we concluded that induced GBRs might represent a signatures of synchronized neural activity in a Hebbian cell assembly, activated by the fragmented picture after perceptual learning took place. No difference between identified and unidentified pictures was found in the visual evoked potential in tire sane time range and in the evoked GBR in the same frequency range as the induced response.

It pray also be evident in one quarter of those at high risk, based on a family history of depression. Methods: The present study evaluated temporal coherence of sleep electroencephalographic rhythms in 41 adolescent girls with a maternal history of depression (high risk) and 40 healthy controls (low risk). The entire sample was followed clinically every 6 months for 2 years. Results: Temporal coherence was significantly lower among the high-risk girls than in controls. Regression analyses predicted group from coherence values and correctly classified 70% of the high-risk group with a,false-positive rate of 5% among controls. Moreover, 54% of the high-risk girls were identified with extreme low coherence. On clinical follow up, 14 girls showed depressive symptoms, 9 in the high-risk group (22.5%) and 5 controls (12.2%). Six met DSM-IV criteria for first-episode major depressive disorder, five high-risk and one control. Most importantly, 41% of those identified as having the most abnormal coherence values either showed symptoms of depression or met diagnostic criteria upon follow rip. Conclusions: Low temporal coherence is evident in adolescent girls at high risk for depression. The more abnormal the coherence, the greater the risk of a first episode of major depressive disorder within 2 years of sleep study, approximately 10 times greater than in controls.

A SWD started with a large hyperpolarization, which was independent of the preceding firing, and decreased in amplitude but did not reverse in polarity up to potentials greater than or equal to -90 mV. This hyperpolarization and the slowly decaying depolarization that terminated a SWD were unaffected by recording with KCl-filled electrodes. The prolonged (up to 15 action potentials), high-frequency bursts present during SWDs were tightly synchronized between adjacent neurons, correlated with the EEG spike component, and generated by a low-threshold Ca2+ potential, which, in turn, was brought about by the summation of high-frequency, small-amplitude depolarizing potentials. Fast hyperpolarizing IPSPs were not detected either during or in the absence of SWDs. Recordings with KCl-filled electrodes, however, showed a more depolarized resting membrane potential and a higher background firing, whereas the SWD-associated bursts had a longer latency to the EEG spike and a lower intraburst frequency. This novel finding demonstrates that spontaneous genetically determined SWDs occur in the presence of intra-NRT lateral inhibition. The unmasking of these properties in the GAERS NRT confirms their unique association with spontaneous genetically determined SWDs and thus their likely involvement in the pathophysiological processes of the human condition.

To find out whether these effects are caused by direct anaesthetic actions on cortical structures, experiments were carried out on isolated neocortical brain slices. In these investigations an excellent correlation was observed between anaesthetic concentrations causing a half-maximal depression of action potential firing in neocortical brain slices and anaesthetic blood concentrations monitored during awaking from anaesthesia in humans. Furthermore, it could be shown that, at concentrations approximately one half the MAC-value, isoflurane decreases the frequency of auditory evoked 30-40 Hz oscillations in the neocortex by 50%. Similar quantitative effects were observed on spontaneously occurring high frequency rhythms in neocortical brain slices. However, not all aspects of cerebral anaesthetic actions can be explained by direct effects on cortical neurones. The EEG synchronisation and the amplitude reduction of mid latency auditory evoked potentials are probably related to the inhibition of thalamic neurones. Halothane, isoflurane, enflurane and propofol reduced action potential firing of cortical neurones by enhancing GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic inhibition. This molecular mechanism seems also to be involved in depressing painful stimuli-induced motor responses. Nevertheless, there must be a difference between relevant anaesthetic mechanisms on the cerebral and spinal revel. This follows from the observation that the relation between the concentration causing the loss of consciousness and the concentration that depresses movements considerably varies among different anaesthetic agents.

Beyond this rate, however, syncopation becomes unstable and subjects spontaneously switch to synchronization to maintain a 1:1 stimulus/response relationship. We used a whole-head magnetometer to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of neuromagnetic activity (MEG) associated with both coordinative patterns at eight different rates spanning the range 1.0-2.75 Hz. Timing changes in the event-related fields accompanied transitions from syncopation to synchronization and followed the placement of the motor response within each stimulus/response cycle. Decomposition of event-related fields into component auditory and motor brain responses revealed that the amplitude of the former decreased with increasing coordination rate whereas the motor contribution remained approximately constant across all rates. Such an interaction may contribute to changes in auditory-motor integration that cause syncopation to become unstable. Examination of event-related changes in high frequency bands revealed that MEG signal power in the beta band (15-30 liz) was significantly lower during syncopated coordination in sensors covering the contralateral sensorimotor area suggesting a dependence of beta rhythm amplitude on task difficulty. Suppression of beta rhythms was also stronger during synchronization preceded by syncopation, e.g., after subjects had switched, when compared with a control condition in which subjects synchronized throughout the entire range of rates.

However, the circadian modulation of REM density has not been thoroughly evaluated. Data from a forced desynchrony protocol, in which 20 consecutive sleep opportunities were systematically scheduled over the entire circadian cycle, were analysed. The REM density was evaluated from polysomnographically recorded REM sleep episodes, and analyzed as a function of time in the sleep opportunity and as a function of phase in the circadian cycle. The REM density showed a robust increase over the course of the sleep episode. This sleep-dependent increase was observed regardless of circadian phase, because data analyzed from different thirds of the circadian cycle exhibited a similar pattern. The REM density did not show a significant circadian-dependent modulation for data from the entire sleep opportunity. However, analysis of circadian modulation from separate thirds of the sleep opportunity revealed a significant circadian modulation in the last third of the sleep episode. Maximum REM densities were observed when the last third of the sleep episode coincided with the wake-maintenance zone, i.e. similar to8-10 h before the crest of the circadian rhythm of REM sleep propensity. These results confirm the dominant sleep-dependent modulation of REM density, and indicate that the density of REMs is greatest when sleep pressure is low, such as in the latter part of the sleep episode, at which time the circadian modulation of REM density is also appreciable.

To characterize the patterns of alpha electroencephalographic sleep and their associations with pain and sleep in patients with fibromyalgia. Methods. Pain and sleep symptoms of 40 female patients with fibromyalgia and 43 healthy control subjects were studied before and after overnight polysomnography, Blinded analyses of alpha activity in nonrapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep were performed using time domain, frequency domain, and visual analysis techniques. Results. Three distinct patterns of alpha sleep activity were detected in fibromyalgia: phasic alpha (simultaneous with delta activity) in 50% of patients, tonic alpha (continuous throughout non-REM sleep) in 20% of patients, and low alpha activity in the remaining 30% of patients. Low alpha activity was exhibited by 83.7% of control subjects (P < 0.01). All fibromyalgia patients who displayed phasic alpha sleep, activity reported worsening of pain after sleep, compared with 58.3% of patients with low alpha activity (P < 0.01) and 25.0% of patients with tonic alpha activity (P < 0.01). Postsleep increase in the number of tender points occurred in 90.0% of patients with phasic alpha activity, 41.7% of patients,vith low alpha activity, and 25.0% of patients with tonic alpha activity (P < 0.01). Self ratings of poor deep were reported by all patients with phasic alpha activity, 58.3% of patients with low alpha activity (P < 0.01), and 12.5% of patients with tonic alpha activity (P < 0.01). Patients with phasic alpha activity reported longer duration of pain than patients in other subgroups (P < 0.01). Additionally, patients with phasic alpha sleep activity exhibited less total sleep time than patients in other subgroups (P < 0.05), as well as lower sleep efficiency (P < 0.05) and less slow wave sleep (P < 0.05) than patients with a tonic alpha sleep pattern. Conclusion. Alpha intrusion during sleep can be of different patterns. Phasic alpha sleep activity was the pattern that correlated better with clinical manifestations of fibromyalgia.

The values of the EA spectral density in interstimulus intervals calculated with a resolution of 1 Hz were used for subsequent factor analysis (the standard principle component technique with varimax rotation), Twenty factors could explain about 80% of total variance, The groups of frequencies which were presented by comparatively narrow peaks (2-3 points) of high loads (more than 0.6) of single factors ("stable" factors) were taken into consideration, In the process of conditioning the factor organization of the EA became substantially complicated, the number of the "stable" factors increased, It was originally shown that the high lends of these factors divided the HF band in comparatively narrow frequency subbands, which appear to reflect the functional mosaics in the neocortex.

Here we present simultaneous intracortical recordings of neural signals and fMRI responses. We compared local field potentials (LFPs), single- and multi-unit spiking activity with highly spatio-temporally resolved blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI responses from the visual cortex of monkeys. The largest magnitude changes were observed in LFPs, which at recording sites characterized by transient responses were the only signal that significantly correlated with the haemodynamic response. Linear systems analysis on a trial-by-trial basis showed that the impulse response of the neurovascular system is both animal- and site-specific, and that LFPs yield a better estimate of BOLD responses than the multi-unit responses. These findings suggest that the BOLD contrast mechanism reflects the input and intracortical processing of a given area rather than its spiking output.

A one-dimensional projection of the spectrum is derived, as is the azimuthally averaged two-dimensional spectrum for isotropic and anisotropic cortices. The predicted spectra are found to consist of a low-k plateau followed by three regions of power-law decrease, which result from filtering of the electrical activity through physical structures at different scales in the cortex. The magnitude of the maximum theoretical power-law exponent is larger for the two-dimensional (2D) spectrum than for its 1D counterpart. The predicted spectra agree well with experimental data obtained from 1D and 2D recording arrays on the cortical surface, enabling the structures in the brain that are important in determining spatial cortical dynamics to be identified.

J	Breakspear, M; Terry, JR; Friston, KJ				Breakspear, M; Terry, JR; Friston, KJ			Modulation of excitatory synaptic coupling facilitates synchronization and complex dynamics in a biophysical model of neuronal dynamics	NETWORK-COMPUTATION IN NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article							MULTICHANNEL HUMAN EEG; CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; GENERALIZED SYNCHRONIZATION; NONLINEAR INTERDEPENDENCE; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; CHAOTIC SYSTEMS; RIDDLED BASINS; THALAMOCORTICAL SYSTEM; NEURAL DYNAMICS; LABILE BRAIN	In this paper, complex dynamical synchronization in a non-linear model of a neural system is studied, and the computational significance of the behaviours is explored. The local neural dynamics is determined by voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels and feedback between densely interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neurons. A mesoscopic array of local networks is modelled by introducing coupling between the local networks via weak excitatory-to-excitatory connectivity. It is shown that with modulation of this long-range synaptic coupling, the system undergoes a transition from independent oscillations to stable chaotic synchronization. Between these states exists a 'weakly' stable state associated with complex, intermittent behaviour in the temporal domain and clusters of synchronous regions in the spatial domain. The paper concludes with a discussion of the putative relevance of such processes in the brain, including the role of neuromodulatory systems and the mechanisms underlying sensory perception, adaptation, computation and complexity.

J	Bondarenko, VE				Bondarenko, VE			Control and 'anticontrol' of chaos in an analog neural network with time delay	CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS			English	Article							STOCHASTIC RESONANCE; SURROGATE-DATA; HUMAN EEG; NOISE; MODEL; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; DIMENSION; SYSTEMS; SERIES; BRAIN	The results of study of an analog neural network model with time delay which produces chaos similar to the human and animal EEGs are presented. It is round that the time delay plays an important role in the control of chaos and production of different chaotic and non-chaotic outputs. An increase in neural network asymmetry (increase of the neuron excitability) leads to the phenomenon similar to the epilepsy. Two cases of the chaos control by the action of the external low-dimensional chaotic force are considered: (1) on the neural network with developed non-chaotic activity (anticontrol); (2) on the neural network with developed low-dimensional chaos. In the first case, we obtained suppression of pathological non-chaotic activity at the optimal amplitude of external low-dimensional chaotic force. In both cases, the chaotic neural network demonstrates the phenomenon similar to a stochastic resonance for internal spontaneous oscillations under the action of external low-dimensional chaotic force instead of random noise, as studied previously.

Methods: CAP parameters were quantified in 10 normal healthy subjects (6 males and 4 females mean age 83 bears: range 6-10 years). All subjects underwent polysomnography recordings for two consecutive nights in a standard laboratory setting. Sleep data were stored on computer using a 16-channel polysomnography digital system. Sleep macrostructure was visually, scored according to the criteria by Rechtschaffen and Kales (Brain Information Service/Brain Research Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, 1968) CAP was visually scored following the criteria by Terzano et al. (Sleep Med 2 (2001) 537). Results: CAP rate showed a progressive increase with the deepness of sleep, with high values, during slow wave (SWS), CAP time showed its longest duration during non-REM (NREM) sleep stage 2 (S2), followed by SWS and sleep stage I (SI) No differences across NREM sleep stages were found for CAP cycle and phase B mean duration on the contrary, phase A showed longer duration during SWS than in S1 and S2. Phases A1 were the most numerous (84.45%) followed by A3 (9.14%) and by A2 (6.44%) The distribution of phases A subtypes across NREM stages showed significant differences for the A1 subtypes that occurred more frequency during SWS than in S2 and S1 (and during S2 than in SI). Subtypes A3 were more frequent during SI than SWS while no differences were found for subtype A2, The analysis of A1 interval distribution showed a log-normal-like distribution with a peak around 25 s for the A1 phases and no clear peak for A2-A3 phases. Conclusions: The analysis of CAP in school-age children is characterized by an increase of CAP rate during SWS and a high percentage of A1 phases. The distribution of interval between consecutive A I phases showed a peak around 25 s. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Theories explaining the AB assume that processing of T2 is more vulnerable to decay or substitution, as long as attention is allocated to T1. Existing models of the AB, however, do not account for the fact that T2 detection accuracy reaches the minimum when T2 is presented after about 300 ms and not immediately following T1, Therefore, a new, model is suggested, which is based on chronometrical considerations together with recent neurophysiological findings concerning the relation between the P3 event-related potential and the AB the interaction between P3 and gamma oscillations, and the significance of the earls evoked gamma band response, We hypothesize that suppression of the early gamma response to T2. accompanying the P3 related to T1, causes the AB.

Methods-Twenty five patients with Tourette's syndrome (mean age 29 (SD 7) years) and 11 control subjects (29 (5) years) were studied by polysomnography and simultaneous split screen video monitoring to record standard sleep variables as well as to evaluate movements to differentiate between ties and regular movements. Severity of Tourette's syndrome during the day was assessed with the Tourette's syndrome severity scale. Results-Sleep was significantly more disturbed in patients with Tourette's syndrome than in controls, with decreased sleep efficiency and slow wave sleep percentage, increased sleep latency, percentage of stage I, percentage of awakeness, number of awakenings, and sleep stage changes and more overall movements during sleep. Severity of Tourette's syndrome during the day correlated significantly and positive with number of awakenings and sleep stage changes and negatively with sleep efficiency. In addition to an increased number of regular movements patients had ties in all sleep stages. Tic frequency as well as frequency of regular movements was significantly higher in REM than in non-REM sleep which was also the case for regular movements of the controls. No disturbance of either REM sleep percentage or REM latency was found. Conclusion-Despite normal total sleep time and unaltered REM sleep variables patients with Tourette's syndrome have markedly disturbed sleep. Severity of the syndrome during the day is an important predictor of sleep alteration in patients. The increased rate of ties during REM sleep parallels the overall increased movement activity of patients during REM, as well as non-REM, sleep. The increased motor activity may be attributable to a state of hyperarousal rather than a disturbed cholinergic system.

The current study was designed to evaluate the accuracy of AEPindex for predicting depth of sedation and anesthesia during sevoflurane anesthesia. Methods. In the first phase of the study, a single end-tidal sevoflurane concentration ranging from 0.5 to 0.9% was assigned randomly and administered to each of 50 patients. The AEPindex and the Bispectral Index (BIS) were obtained simultaneously. Sedation was assessed using the responsiveness portion of the observer's assessment of alertness-sedation scale. in the second phase of the study, 10 additional patients were included, and the 60 patients who were scheduled to have skin incisions were observed for movement in response to skin incision at the end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations between 1.6 and 2.6%. The relation among AEPindex, BIS, sevoflurane concentration, sedation score, and movement or absence of movement after skin incision was determined. Prediction probability values for AEPindex, BIS, and sevoflurane concentration to predict depth of sedation and anesthesia were also calculated. Results: The AEPindex, BIS, and sevoflurane concentration correlated closely with the sedation score. The prediction probability values for AEPindex, BIS, and sevoflurane concentration for sedation score were 0.820, 0.805, and 0.870,respectively, indicating a high predictive performance for depth of sedation. AEPindex and sevoflurane concentration successfully predicted movement after skin (prediction probability = 0.910 and 0.857, respectively), whereas BIS could not (prediction probability = 0.537). Conclusions. Auditory evoked potential index can be a guide to the depth of sedation and movement in response to skin incision during sevoflurane anesthesia.

Design: Prospective cohort analysis. Setting: University teaching hospital medical-surgical ICU. Patients: Twenty critically ill (APACHE II [acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II] acute physiology store [APS], 10 +/- 5), mechanically, ventilated adults (male 12, female 8, age 62 +/- 15 years) with mild to moderate acute lung injury (lung injury score, 1.8 +/- 0.9) 10 +/- 7 days after admission to the ICU. Measurements and results: Patients were divided into three groups based on 24-h polysomnography (PSG) findings. No patient demonstrated normal sleep. In the "disrupted sleep" group (n = 8), electrophysiologic sleep was identified and was distributed throughout the day (6:00 AM to 10:00 PM; 4.0 +/- 2.9 h) and night (10:00 PM to 6:00 AM; 3.0 +/- 1.9 h) with equivalent proportions of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, Nocturnal sleep efficiency was severely reduced (38 +/- 24%) with an increased proportion of stage 1 NREM sleep (40 +/- 28% total sleep time [TST]) and a reduced proportion of REM sleep (10 +/- 14% TST), Severe sleep fragmentation was reflected by a high frequency of arousals (20 +/- 17/h) and awakenings (22 +/- 25/h), Electrophysiologic sleep was not identifiable in the PSG recordings of the remaining patients. These were classified either as "atypical sleep" (n = 5), characterized bu transitions from stage 1 NREM to slow wave sleep with a virtual absence of stage 2 NREM and reduced stage REM sleep, or "coma" (n = 7), characterized by > 50% delta or theta EEG activity with (n = 5) and without (n = 2) evidence of EEG activation either spontaneously or in response to deep painful stimuli, The combined atypical sleep and coma groups had a higher APS (13 +/- 4 vs 6 +/- 4) and higher doses of sedative medications than the disrupted sleep group. Conclusion: Sleep, as it is conventionally measured, was identified only in a subgroup of critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation and was severely disrupted. We have proposed specific criteria to select patients for future studies to evaluate potential causes of sleep disruption in this; population.

The BN is mathematically equivalent to the sine-circle map, and this equivalence relationship allowed us to apply the mathematics of one-dimensional maps to the design of BN networks. The study of symmetry in the BN revealed that the BN can be configured to exhibit bistability that is controlled by attractor-merging crisis. Also, the symmetry of the bistability can be controlled by the introduction of a sinusoidal fluctuation to the threshold level of the BN. These two observations led us to the design of the BN Network 1 (BNN-1), a chaotic pulse-coupled neural network exhibiting associative memory. In numerical simulations, the BNN-1 showed a better performance than the continuous-time Hopfield network, as far as the spurious-minima problem is concerned and exhibited many biologically plausible characteristics.

Here, we extend this work by estimating the time course of fMRI signal changes in the cortical and subcortical regions found to exhibit evidence for task-related activation. Our results indicate that there are separate loci of signal changes in the thalamus (dorsomedial and pulvinar) that exhibit notable differences in times of onset, peak and return to baseline of signal changes. The signal changes in the pulvinar demonstrate the slowest transients of all the cortical and subcortical regions we examined. Evaluation of cortical regions demonstrated salient differences as well, with the signal changes in Brodmann area 6 (BA6) rising, peaking, and returning to baseline earlier than those detected in other regions. We conclude that BA6 mediates early designation or refinement of search criteria, and that the pulvinar may be involved in the binding of feature stimuli for an integrated object memory.

However, the dynamics of functional coupling among different motor areas has not been fully clarified yet. Because it has been proposed that the functional coupling among cortical areas might be achieved by the synchronization of oscillatory activity, we investigated the electrocorticographic coherence between the supplementary motor and primary sensorimotor areas (SMA and S1-M1) by means of event-related partial coherence analysis in 11 intractable epilepsy patients. We found premovement increase of coherence between the SMA proper and S1-M1 at the frequency of 0-33 Hz and between the pre-SMA and S1-M1 at 0-18 Hz. Coherence between the SMA proper and M1 started to increase 0.9 sec before the movement onset and peaked 0.3 sec after the movement. There was no systematic difference within the SMA (SMA proper vs pre-SMA) or within the S1-M1, in terms of the time course as well as the peak value of coherence. The phase spectra revealed near-zero phase difference in 57% (20 of 35) of region pairs analyzed, and the remaining pairs showed inconsistent results. This increase of synchronization between multiple motor areas in the preparation and execution of voluntary movements may reflect the multiregional functional interactions in human motor behavior.

UNSOLVED PROBLEMS OF NOISE AND FLUCTUATIONS	AIP CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Unsolved Problems of Noise and Fluctuations in Physics, Biology and High Technology	SEP 03-06, 2002	NIH, BETHESDA, MD	NICHD, NINDS, NIDCD	NIH		STOCHASTIC RESONANCE; ACTION-POTENTIALS; DYNAMICS; MODEL; NOISE; EEG; RAT	All natural processes are accompanied by fluctuations, characterized as noise or chaos' Biological systems, which have evolved during billions of years, are likely to have adapted, not only to cope with such fluctuations, but also to make use of them. We investigate how the complex dynamics of the brain, including oscillations, chaos and noise, can affect the efficiency of neural information processing. In particular, we consider the amplification and functional role of internal fluctuations. Using computer simulations of a neural network model of the olfactory cortex and hippocampus, we demonstrate how microscopic fluctuations can result in global effects at the network level. We show that the rate of information processing in associative memory tasks can be maximized for optimal noise levels, analogous to stochastic resonance phenomena. Noise can also induce transitions between different dynamical states, which could be of significance for learning and memory. A chaotic-like behavior, induced by noise or by an increase in neuronal excitability, can enhance system performance if it is transient and converges to a limit cycle memory state. We speculate whether this dynamical behavior perhaps, could be related to (creative) thinking.

Previous research indicates that a large upper alpha power in a reference interval preceding a task is related to both large suppression of upper alpha power during the task and good performance. Here, we tested the hypothesis that rTMS at individual upper alpha frequency (IAF + 1 Hz) can enhance alpha power in the reference interval, and can thus improve task performance. Repetitive TMS was delivered to the mesial frontal (Fz) and right parietal (P6) cortex, and as sham condition with 90degrees-tilted coil (P6 position). The behavioural effect was assessed in a mental rotation task. Further control conditions were rTMS at a lower IAF (IAF - 3 Hz) and at 20 Hz. The results indicate that rTMS at IAF + 1 Hz can enhance task performance and, concomitantly, the extent of task-related alpha desynchronization. This provides further evidence for the functional relevance of oscillatory neuronal activity in the alpha band for the implementation of cognitive performance.

One group had a task-specific movement disorder (focal dystonia or musicians' cramp), while the other group did not (controls). There were no significant group interactions in the task-related power (TRPow) within the alpha range of 8-10 Hz (mu1). In contrast, there was a significant group interaction within the alpha range of 10-12 Hz (mu2); these latter frequencies are associated with task-specific sensorimotor integration. The significant group interaction included task (simple and complex) by hand (left, right, and both) by electrodes (10 electrodes over the sensorimotor areas). In the rest conditions, the alpha power (10-12 Hz) was comparable between the groups; during movement, however, compared to the controls, patients demonstrated the greatest TRPow ((10-12Hz)) over all conditions. This was particularly evident when patients used their affected hand and suggests that patients with musicians' cramp have impaired task-specific sensorimotor integration.

At the same time, sensory functions depend on reafferent and efference-copy information flow as imposed by motor actions. We studied how a specific oculomotor task influences afferent visual processing. Twenty healthy adults performed visually guided saccades. Between the offset of a fixation light and the onset of a new visual target a temporal gap of a duration of about 200 ms was introduced. This time structure is known from previous studies to elicit saccades at express latencies. In a control condition, 'no gap' was used. During eye movements one of four visual patterns with different orientations was presented, triggered by the horizontal electro-oculogram. We analyzed discrimination performance and the simultaneously recorded multichannel EEG activity. In the gap condition, shorter saccadic latencies were accompanied by significant more correct perceptual judgments. However, brain activity, as quantified by global field power, evoked component latency and topographical descriptors (centers of gravity or centroids) were not affected by the gap. This contrasts the notion that parieto-occipital areas are the most important sites of sensorimotor integration. Furthermore, the presence of a visual masking stimulus did not degrade discrimination performance, demonstrating that local retinal afterimages were not used for perceptual decisions. We conclude that intra-saccadic visual processing is influenced by pre-saccadic events. Under the short-time constraints prevalent in the saccadic task. fixation target cues are not only used for motor planning but also influence the visibility of visual patterns presented during the eye movement.

The BN is mathematically equivalent to the sine-circle map. and this equivalence relationship allowed us to apply the mathematics of one-dimensional maps to the design of a BN network. The study of the bifurcating diagram of the BN revealed that the BN, under a suitable condition, can function as an amplitude-to-phase converter. Also. being an integrate-and-fire neuron, it has an inherent capability to function as a coincidence detector. These two observations led us to the design of the BN Network 2 (BNN-2), a pulse-coupled neural network that exhibits associative memory of multiple analog patterns. In addition to the usual dynamical proper-ties as an associative memory, the BNN-2 was shown to exhibit volume-holographic memory: it switches to different pages of its memory space as the frequency of the coherent modulation changes, meaning context-sensitive memory.

The electroencephalographic spectrum when the system is driven by white noise is then calculated analytically in terms of physiological parameters, including the effects of filtering of signals by the cerebrospinal fluid, skull, and scalp. The spectral power at low frequencies is found to vary as f(-1) when awake and f(-3) when asleep, with a breakpoint to a steeper power-law tail at frequencies above about 20 Hz in both cases; the f(-1) range concurs with recent magnetoencephalographic observations of such a regime. Parameter sensitivities are explored, enabling a model with fewer free parameters to be proposed, and showing that spectra predicted for physiologically reasonable parameter values strongly resemble those observed in the laboratory. Alpha and beta peaks seen near 10 Hz and twice that frequency, respectively, in the relaxed wakeful state are generated via subcortical feedback in this model, thereby leading to predictions of their frequencies in terms of physiological parameters, and of correlations in their occurrence. Subcortical feedback is also predicted to be responsible for production of anticorrelated peaks in deep sleep states that correspond to the occurrence of theta rhythm at around half the alpha frequency and sleep spindles at 3/2 times the alpha frequency. An additional positively correlated waking peak near three times the alpha frequency is also predicted and tentatively observed, as are two new types of sleep spindle near 5/2 and 7/2 times the alpha frequency, and anticorrelated with alpha. These results provide a theoretical basis for the conventional division of EEG spectra into frequency bands, but imply that the exact bounds of these bands depend on the individual. Three types of potential instability are found: one at zero frequency, another in the theta band at around half the alpha frequency, and a third at the alpha frequency itself.

This finding applies to both benign epilepsy of childhood with rolandic spikes (BECRS), to symptomatic epilepsy of childhood strongly activated by sleep and to the Landau-Kleffner syndrome. These results are quite different from those found in adult partial epileptic patients where slow wave activity (SWA, 0.5-4.5 Hz) plays the main role in the modulation of IEDs during sleep. This finding could suggest that the activation of IEDs by spindle activities could be an age-related feature of epilepsy. In order to verify this hypothesis we studied a group of epileptic children performing a polysomnographic study on five patients with BEOP strongly activated by sleep. Methods: We performed overnight continuous EEG-polysomnographic studies in five patients (mean age 6.0 +/- 2.5). The IEDs count was performed on the most active occipital lead. The temporal series of SWA and SA values. derived from spectral analysis, were obtained fr om a spike-free central, controlateral lead. Relationships between SAI SWA and time series of IEDs were tested by means of correlation techniques after data normalization. Results: Our results revealed a significantly higher correlation between IEDs and SA with respect to SWA in all subjects, in total sleep time. When the analysis was limited only to NREM sleep the correlation between sigma and IEDs was even more impressive. Conclusions: Data suggest that also in BEOP the spindle generating mechanism modulates the IEDs during sleep. This mechanism seems to be an age-dependent phenomenon with no I elation whatsoever either with the type of epilepsy or with the brain region. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Subjects were three males and three females who were candidates for neurosurgical treatments of partial epilepsy. Subdural electrodes were attached to the medial and basal temporal lobe cortices, allowing ECoG and electroencephalogram from the scalp vertex (Cz EEG) to be recorded simultaneously during all night sleep. In one case, subdural electrodes were attached also on the parietal lobe. Fast Fourier transformation (FFT) analyses were performed on the ECoG and Cz EEG signals. No organized sleep spindles or sigma band (12-16 Hz) peaks in FFT power spectra were observed from the medial or basal temporal lobes of the non-epileptogenic hemispheres during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. In a case with parietal electrodes, organized spindle bursts were observed in parietal signals synchronized with Cz spindles. Although delta band (0.3-3 Hz) power from both the medial and basal temporal lobes fluctuated across each night as expected, sigma activity changed little. However, 14 Hz oscillatory bursts were observed in the medial basal temporal lobe of epileptogenic hemisphere in two cases and bilaterally in one case during not only NREM sleep but rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and wakefulness. From the present study we conclude that sleep spindle activities are absent in the medial and basal temporal lobes. Fourteen Hz oscillatory bursts observed from the medial or basal temporal lobe in some cases were not considered to be sleep spindles since they also appeared during REM sleep and wakefulness. These waveforms could have originated due to epileptic pathology, since they frequently appeared in epileptic regions.

J	Crowley, K; Trinder, J; Kim, Y; Carrington, M; Colrain, IA				Crowley, K; Trinder, J; Kim, Y; Carrington, M; Colrain, IA			The effects of normal aging on sleep spindle and K-complex production	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						sleep spindles; age; phasic events; K-complexes	SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; FREQUENCY ACTIVITY; EEG; BRAIN; AGE; YOUNG; OSCILLATION; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; AROUSAL	Objectives: Despite a relatively large body of literature describing the characteristics of sleep spindles and K-complexes in young adults, relatively little research has been conducted in older individuals. The general consensus from the few studies that have addressed this issue is that there is a progressive decrease in the number of spindles and K-complexes with age, although there is large intra-individual variation. Whether or not these changes are an inevitable consequence of the aging process can be addressed by studying healthy older adults who provide an example of the effects of age independently from those of disease. Methods: Fourteen young adults (mean age=21.4+/-2.5 years) and 20 older adults (mean age =75.5+/-6.3 years) participated in the study. All subjects were neurologically and medically healthy and were not taking any medications with a known effect on the central nervous system or sleep. For each subject, a number of characteristics were determined including the number, density (SS/min), amplitude and frequency of all spindles as well as the number and density of K-complexes (KC/min). Results: Spindle number, density and duration as well as K-complex number and density were all significantly lower in the elderly compared to the young adults. The EEG frequency within the spindles was significantly higher in the elderly, although the absolute difference was less than 0.5 Hz. Multiple regression analysis indicated that spindle duration and K-complex density were able to predict over 90% of the variance in age. Conclusions: The age-related decrease in sleep spindle and K-complex density is consistent with previous reports and may be interpreted as an age-related alteration of thalamocortical regulatory mechanisms.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether dyslexics show deficits in attentional control and/or semantic encoding. Method: The EEG was recorded while subjects were reading numbers, words and pseudowords and analyzed in a lower and upper alpha and two beta bands (spanning a range of about 8-16 Hz). A phasic response is measured in terms of a decrease in event related band power during reading with respect to a reference interval. Tonic power is measured in terms of (log) band power during a reference interval. Results: In the lower alpha band dyslexics show an increased phasic response to words and pseudowords at right hemispheric sites but a lack to respond to words at O1. The upper alpha band exhibits a highly selective phasic response to words at left frontal sites but fur controls only, whereas dyslexics show a general increase in tonic upper alpha power. Whereas the low frequency beta band (beta-1a) exhibits a rather diffuse pattern, a highly selective finding was obtained for the beta-lb band. Conclusions: Dyslexics have a lack of attentional control during the encoding of words at left occipital sites and a lack of a selective topographic activation pattern during the semantic encoding of words. Because only in controls reading of words is associated with a strong beta-lb desynchronization at those recording sites which correspond to Broca's area (FC5) and the angular gyrus (CP5, P3), we may conclude that this frequency band reflects the graphemicphonetic encoding of words.

Methods: Forty ASA Grade I-II female patients scheduled for gynaecological laparoscopy were randomly allocated to two groups. All patients received a continuous infusion of remifentanil (0.25 mugkg(-1) min(-1)) for 2 min. Then anaesthesia was induced with propofol 1% at 300 mL h(-1) until loss of consciousness. To guide the bispectral index between 40 and 60, Group I patients received propofol 10 mg kg(-1) h(-1) initially, which was increased or decreased by 2 mg kg(-1) h(-1) steps; Group 2 patients received sevoflurane, initially set at 2 vol.% and adjusted with steps of 0.2-0.4%. The time and quality of anaesthesia and recovery were assessed in two postoperative standardized interviews. Results: Patient characteristics, the propofol induction dose, the bispectral index and the haemodynamic profiles during induction of anaesthesia, and its duration, were similar between the groups. In Group 1, 7.55 +/- 1.75 mg kg(-1) h(-1) propofol and in Group 2, 0.20 +/- 0.09 mL kg(-1) h(-1) liquid sevoflurane were used for maintenance. The cost for maintenance, including wasted drugs, was higher when using propofol (E25.14 +/- 10.69) than sevoflurane (E12.80 +/- 2.67). Postoperatively, recovery profiles tended to be better with propofol; however, the day after discharge no differences were found. Conclusions: When applying the bispectral index to guide the administration of hypnotic anaesthetic drugs, propofol-based maintenance of anaesthesia was associated with the highest cost. A trend towards a better recovery profile was obtained with propofol. However, on the day after discharge, no differences in quality were observed.

Previous electroencephalographic (EEG) studies have shown: (1) that these wavelets are generated near the hand area of the primary somatosensory cortex and in deep fibers of thalamocortical afferences; and (2) that only the 600-Hz burst, but not the N20 is decreased during sleep. Since the thalamus is involved in regulating both, selective attention and arousal, the present study aimed at characterizing the effects of focused attention and slight arousal changes on the 600-Hz oscillations. A dipole-source analysis of 64-channel SEP re cordings after electric right-median-nerve stimulation allowed the comparison of brainstem, thalamic, and two cortical (one tangential, one radial) source activities in ten awake human subjects under two slightly different arousal states (eyes open vs. eyes closed), each tested for three conditions of focused attention (directed towards rare acoustic and right- or left-hand somatosensory target stimuli). While the N20 was not modified at all, the source strength of the high-frequency wavelet burst was significantly increased for eyes opened versus eyes closed. at the thalamic source site as well as for the tangentially oriented cortical source. In contrast, there were no significant differences between conditions with different attentional targets. This evidence for modulatory effects of increased arousal (eyes open) on both thalamic and cortically generated high-frequency SEP activity fits the hypothesis that the 600-Hz SEP burst at least partially represents an arousal-dependent signal generated at the thalamic level and transmitted to the primary somatosensory cortex.

The theta phase affects the nature of the plasticity induced in urethane-anesthetized rats and in the carbachol-treated in vitro slice preparation, but these oscillations are phenomenologically different from natural theta, and the effects of theta phase on plasticity under natural conditions have not been reported. We therefore examined the effects of theta phase on the magnitude of long-term potentiation (LTP) in awake rats running on a linear track for a food reward. Twelve adult and 10 aged F344 male rats were implanted with a stimulating electrode in the perforant path and a recording electrode in the hilus of the fascia dentata. Stimuli were delivered at the peak or trough of the hilar theta rhythm. In both adult and aged, memory-impaired rats, LTP lasting at least 48 h was induced when stimuli were delivered at the positive theta peak, whereas LTP was not induced when stimuli were delivered at the negative troughs. Consistent with the finding that the threshold for LTP induction is increased at this synapse in old rats, the magnitude of LTP induced at the peak of theta rhythm was significantly lower in old animals. These data confirm that LTP can be modulated by locomotion-induced theta, and that this modulation is at least qualitatively preserved across age. Hippocampus 2001;11:647-654.

Using an auditory dual-click paradigm, a number of studies have found that, compared with normal controls, patients with schizophrenia show impaired inhibition, or gating, of repeated stimulation as measured by the average P50 evoked response to the second click. Since responses to many trials are collected to study the average response, fluctuations in the timing of the P50 response from trial to trial may influence the differences observed. We present a computerized, objective procedure that evaluates temporal variability in brain responses of patients with schizophrenia. Methods: Ten normal controls and 10 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia were studied using the dual-click procedure. For each single trial, the temporal shift in P50 that yielded the best alignment with the average P50 response was used to derive a measure of P50 temporal variability from trial to trial and to form P50 averages corrected for temporal variability. Results: Patients with schizophrenia had significantly more temporal variability than normal controls. Correction for temporal variability in the P50 responses increased the size of P50 for both patients with schizophrenia and normal controls. Patients with schizophrenia had smaller P50 responses to the first click than controls and less inhibition to the second click before, but not after, correction for temporal variability. Conclusions: These findings suggest that temporal variability contributes significantly to the P50 response as measured using the gating procedure. The measure of temporal variability may provide a new index of inhibitory and attentional function in schizophrenia.

J	Janz, D				Janz, D			Epilepsy with grand mal on awakening and sleep-waking cycle	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						epilepsy; sleep; sleep-waking cycle	JUVENILE MYOCLONIC EPILEPSY; IDIOPATHIC GENERALIZED EPILEPSIES; SUSCEPTIBILITY LOCUS; CLASSIFICATION; CHROMOSOME-6; LINKAGE	Awakening epilepsy (AE) is an age related syndrome of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) characterized by generalized tonic clonic seizures (GTCS) occurring predominantly on awakening (independent of the time of day) or at leisure time (almost at evening). The GTCS can be the only symptom or they can be combined with the other subsyndromes of IGE in childhood or adolescence: The EEG shows the characteristics of IGE (generalized spike wave frequent, focal abnormalities rare, photosensitivity increased). The common denominator of external seizures precipitating influences is lack of sleep. The sleep habits of patients with AE who could roughly be characterized as late sleepers and late risers may dispose them to a chronic sleep deficit. Polygraphic studies indicated that their sleep is more unstable and subject to external influences. Microstructural sleep analysis confirms the presence of a disturbance of sleep stability in patients with IGE. Furthermore it clearly shows that in the prototype of AE, the juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, the epileptiform activity during non-REM sleep is correlated with the arousal phase of the so called cyclic alternating pattern indicating that even in the smallest sleep-waking oscillations awakening is the most sensitive part.

We continue by describing its basic physiological properties focusing on inhibitory influences which contribute to the (non-)linearity of the LGN cells. The sections on the LGN are concluded with a description of its dynamic response properties and how LGN cells change their behavior during different EEG states. This type of behavior is then traced into the visual cortex where receptive fields change in a state dependent way. In addition, one finds that the receptive field size shrinks during the first few hundred milliseconds of continuous stimulation. The last part of this chapter is therefore devoted to a neural field model which tries to explain the cortical receptive field shrinkage in a mathematical way. Intriguingly the model claims that cortical receptive field shrinkage does not require intracortical interactions but seems to be a process entirely dominated by the dynamic structure of the LGN activity described in the first part of this article.

We recorded human hippocampal single neuron activity in subjects implanted with depth electrodes required for medical diagnosis and quantitatively evaluated discharge activity from each neuron during episodes of wakefulness (Aw), combined stage 3 and 4 slow-wave sleep (SWS), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The mean firing rate of the population of single neurons was significantly higher during SWS and Aw compared with REM sleep (p = 0.002; p < 0.0001). In addition, burst firing was significantly greater during SWS compared with Aw (p = 0.001) and REM sleep (p < 0.0001). The synchronized state of SWS and associated high-frequency burst discharge found in human hippocampus may subserve functions similar to those reported in non-primate hippocampus that require burst firing to induce synaptic modifications in hippocampal circuitry and in hippocampal projections to neocortical targets that participate in memory consolidation.

We have based our model on coupled nonlinear oscillators, which resemble groups of mitral and granule cells as main building units. Odors evoke oscillatory activity in populations of excitatory and inhibitory cells of the proposed two-layer architecture with feedforward and feedback connections between them, and the system exhibits odor-specific adaptation. The output of a unit, representing the average firing rate within the corresponding population, is modeled as a sigmoidal function of the synaptic input. The system exhibits complex oscillatory behavior, simulating mammalian olfactory bulb. Simulations show that the dynamic behavior of the model is stable under the influence of noise. It is shown that the simulations depend on anatomical and physiological estimates of synaptic densities, coupling symmetries, synaptic gain, dendritic time constants, and axonal delays. The output pattern is not just a combination of on/off units, rather it is an array of amplitude oscillations and thus is a result of influences from all of the units. The model is able to reduce noise, allowing the pattern to emerge from incomplete and noisy input.

The latter observation seems to contradict previous statements on the role of gamma-synchronization for scene segmentation, We re-examine these findings by analyzing different coupling measures and frequency ranges of population activities potentially contributing to figure-ground segregation. Multiple unit activity (MUA) and local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded by parallel mu-electrodes in monkey V1 during stimulation by a grating in which an object was defined by a shifted rectangle. In contradiction to the conclusions in previous work, we find strong decoupling of population activity between figure and ground representations compared to the situation in which the object is absent. In particular, coherence of late gamma-LFPs is strongly reduced, while reduction is absent during the early epochs of high-amplitude transients for LFP- and MUA-coherence at all frequencies, and at low frequencies also in the subsequent epochs. Our results of decoupling in late LFP gamma-components among figure and ground representations suggest that these signals may support figure-ground segregation.

Our aim was to investigate changes of the spontaneous gamma activity and the SSR in the auditory cortex of cats in the background of an instrumental conditioning situation. Epidural electrodes were chronically implanted above the auditory neocortex. The presentation rate of the clicks varied between 20 and 65/s. Spontaneous EEG and SSR were collected in three behavioral states: in an indifferent environment, in the instrumental cage while the cat was waiting for the light CS, and when she stepped on the pedal and was waiting for the meat reward. Using different repetition rate clicks we determined which stimulus rate elicited the largest SSR in these three situations. In quiet animal the highest SSR appeared at 28-30/s. Before and during the CS the optimal stimulus rate shifted to 32-38/s. The frequency of the spontaneous gamma activity changed in parallel way depending on the situation. We conclude that both the SSR and the spontaneous gamma activity reflect resonant activity of the same neuronal circuit of the auditory cortex, and it is modulated by the motivational state of the animal.

Local field potential recordings were obtained in freely moving animals in the olfactory bulb (OB), anterior and posterior parts of the piriform cortex (APC and PPC respectively) and lateral entorhinal cortex (EC). Dynamic signal analysis detected changes in power during odour presentation for several frequency bands The results showed that in most cases odour presentation was associated with changes in a wide 15-90 Hz frequency band of activity in each olfactory structure. However, nutritional state modulated initial responses to food odour (FO) in the OB and EC selectively in the 15-30 Hz frequency band. Changes in nutritional state also modulated responses to repeated FO stimuli. Habituation was expressed differentially across structures with a clear dissociation between the two parts of the piriform cortex. Finally, systemic injections of scopolamine (0.125 mg/kg) selectively blocked expression of the nutritional modulation in the OB found in the beta band. These results suggest that internal state can differentially modulate odour processing among different olfactory areas and point to a cholinergic-sensitive beta band oscillation during presentation of a behaviourally meaningful odorant.

The expanded theory accounts for both the brief attention of locating and identifying objects and the sustained attention of preparation for and maintenance of attention to objects, attributes, and locations. It is proposed that sustained attention is expressed in a cortical column by repeated surges of current in the long apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons, which form a wave. When (he wave is sufficiently intense in a cluster of these neurons, it can be measured at the scalp as EEG oscillations. The wave of attention may or may not produce output pulses from the neuron. Selective attention may be expressed as enhanced processing of pulses arriving at the basal dendrites and leaving at the soma of these pyramidal neurons. It is also proposed that wave activity in the apical dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons generates subjective experience. When wave activity is produced by the attention circuit in a cortical area beyond the primary sensory areas, it generates our foreground experience of an object. When wave activity is produced in the primary sensory areas by signals from sensory receptors, it generates our background experience, or consciousness. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Miro, E; Cano-Lozano, MC; Buela-Casal, G				Miro, E; Cano-Lozano, MC; Buela-Casal, G			Electrodermal activity during total sleep deprivation and its relationship with other activation and performance measures	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						body temperature; correlations; electrodermal resistance; reaction time; sleepiness; total sleep deprivation	REACTION-TIME; EXERCISE; CAFFEINE; RATINGS; EEG	The present study analyses the variations of the skin resistance level (SRL) during 48 h of total sleep deprivation (TSD) and its relationship to body temperature, self-informed sleepiness in the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS), and reaction time (RT). All of the variables were evaluated every 2 h except for the SSS, which was evaluated every hour. A total of 30 healthy subjects (15 men and 15 women) from 18 to 24 years old participated in the experiment. Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with TSD days and time-of-day as factors showed a substantial increase of SRL, SSS, and RT, and a decrease in body temperature marked by strong circadian oscillations. The interaction between day by time-of-day was only significant for RT. Furthermore, Pearson's correlations showed that the increase of SRL is associated to the decrease in temperature (mean r =-0.511), the increase of SSS (mean r =0.509), and the deterioration of RT (mean r =0.425). The results support previous TSD reports and demonstrate the sensitivity of SRL to TSD. The non-invasive character of SRL, its simplicity, and its relationships with other activation parameters, widely validated by previous literature, convert SRL into an interesting and useful measure in this field.

Methods: Forty patients with schizophrenia and 40 age- and gender-matched controls were studied in a conventional auditory ERP oddball paradigm, We investigated sub-averaged Gamma activity based upon a simultaneous measure of electrodemal skin conductance response (phasic arousal) to differentiate novelty (large responses) from routinization (small or no responses). Both early Gamma (Gamma 1) and later induced Gamma (Gamma 2) activities were examined. Results: Patients with schizophrenia (compared with controls) had significantly reduced Gamma I amplitude in the right hemisphere for novelty processing and delayed Gamma 2 latency in the left hemisphere for both novelty and routinization. Overall, reduced Gamma I amplitude in patients with schizophrenia was also evident. Conclusions: These findings indicate that the normal laterality of Gamma activity is specifically disturbed in schizophrenia in response to novel, but not routine (familiar) stimuli. The distinct pattern of findings suggests a dysregulation of activation across left and right hemispheres during initial attention and preparatory phases of information processing, in particular, in patients with schizophrenia.

We studied sleep-wake behaviour during undisturbed conditions as well as after social stress. The exercising mice ran approximately 4 km/day, which affected their physical constitution, their spontaneous sleep-wake pattern and their endocrine and sleep responses to stress. When compared with the control mice, exercising animals had more muscle substance, less body fat and heavier adrenal glands. At baseline, exercising mice showed fewer, but longer-lasting, sleep episodes (indicating improved sleep consolidation) and less rapid-eye-movement sleep. In both control and exercising mice, mild social stress (elicited by a 15-min social conflict) evoked elevated plasma levels of adrenocorticotrophic hormone and corticosterone, an increase in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep, an enhancement of low-frequency activity in the electroencephalogram within non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (indicating increased sleep intensity) and a decrease in wakefulness. However, as compared with the control animals, exercising mice responded to social stress with higher corticosterone levels, but not adrenocorticotrophic hormone levels, suggesting an increased sensitivity of their adrenal glands to adrenocorticotrophic hormone. Moreover, in control mice, social stress increased rapid-eye-movement sleep in parallel to non-rapid-eye-movement sleep, whereas this stressor selectively decreased rapid-eye-movement sleep in exercising animals. Corticosterone is known to decrease rapid-eye-movement sleep. Therefore, changes in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis as a result of the long-term exercise may contribute to the observed differences in spontaneous and social stress-affected sleep. In conclusion, regular exercise appears to increase sleep quality and reverses the effects of mild social stress on rapid-eye-movement sleep.

It is not known when behavior problems begin in children with epilepsy. The purposes of this study were to: 1) describe the rates of behavior problems in children before their first recognized seizure, 2) determine the differences in behavior problems between children with a first recognized seizure and their healthy siblings, and 3) identify the seizure variables early in the course of the condition that are associated with behavior problems before the first recognized seizure. Methods. The sample was 224 children (4-14 years old) with a first recognized seizure and their 135 healthy siblings. As part of a larger study, computer-assisted structured telephone interviews were conducted with mothers to measure child and sibling behavior problems. Behavior problems were measured using the Child Behavior Checklist. Frequencies, t tests, correlational analysis, and multiple regression were used to analyze data. Results. Higher than expected rates of behavior problems in the 6 months before the first recognized seizure were found in the total seizure sample, with 32.1% being in the clinical or at-risk range. Rates were highest in children who had previous events that were probably seizures, with 39.5% in the clinical or at-risk range. Children with seizures had significantly higher Total, Internalizing, Attention, Thought, and Somatic Complaints problem scores than their nearest-in-age healthy siblings. Within the seizure sample, variables significantly associated with behavior problems after adjusting for research site, child sex, child age, and socioeconomic status (as represented by primary caregiver's education) were interactions of previously unrecognized seizures with gender and epilepsy syndrome/type of seizures. Conclusions. Children with previously unrecognized seizures are already at increased risk for behavior problems at the time of their first recognized seizure. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that in some children, epilepsy is a pervasive condition that includes both seizures and behavioral problems.

The other pattern consisted of a central trough in the cumulant density function, which was mostly accompanied by coherence around 10 Hz. When this was the case oscillations were usually observed in the cumulant density function with time lags of 100 ms. Both patterns could be observed in the same subject, but usually not at the same time. Coherence around 10 Hz associated with a central trough in the cumulant density function was less common during weak than during strong co-contraction. The central peak with coherence in the 15-35 Hz frequency band in contrast tended to be most common during weak contraction. There was a tendency for the 10-Hz coherence with central trough to occur when the contractions had been maintained for some time. Both patterns could be observed when sensory feedback in large diameter afferents was blocked by ischaemia. When a central peak with coherence in the 1535 Hz frequency band was observed for paired TA and Sol EMG recordings (10 out of 19 subjects), a coupling in the same frequency band was also observed between the EMG activities from the two muscles and the EEG activity recorded from the leg area of the motor cortex. When the central trough and the coherence around 10 Hz was observed for the EMG recordings (8 out of 19 subjects), no significant coherence was observed between EEG and EMG in 7 of the 8 subjects. In the last subject coherence around 10 Hz was observed. It is suggested that these findings signify the existence of two different central input systems to antagonistic ankle motoneurones: one input activates one muscle while depressing the antagonist and the other coactivates antagonistic motoneurones. The data suggest that at least the latter input depends on motor cortical activity.

Previous studies have shown long-term potentiation (LTP) to be preferentially induced with stimulation on the peak of local theta rhythm in region CA1 in anesthetized rats and with stimulation of the perforant path at the peak of theta in both anesthetized and behaving animals. We set out to determine the effects of tetanic burst stimulation in stratum radiatum of region CA1 in awake behaving animals, delivered during either the peak or the trough of the theta rhythm in the EEG. Bursts delivered to the peak resulted in an increase of 17.9 +/- 0.94% in potential slope. When identical stimulation bursts were delivered to the trough of local theta waves, the potential slope decreased 12.9 +/- 1.03%. This is the first report of LTP being preferentially induced at the peak of local theta rhythm in behaving animals in region CA1 and that LTD was found in response to tetanic stimulation at the trough of the local theta wave. The results are discussed within the framework of a recent theory that proposes that the theta rhythm sets the dynamics for alternating phases of encoding and retrieval (Hasselmo et al., 2002).

J	Cote, KA; Epps, TM; Campbell, KB				Cote, KA; Epps, TM; Campbell, KB			The role of the spindle in human information processing of high-intensity stimuli during sleep	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						event-related potentials; information processing; sleep spindles	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AUDITORY-EVOKED-RESPONSES; BINAURAL INTERACTION; BRAIN; ONSET; WAVE	Sleep spindles are 12-14 Hz oscillations in EEG, which are thought to inhibit or 'gate' information processing. Event-related potentials may be employed to probe the extent of information processing during sleep. Previous research indicates that event-related potentials elicited by moderate intensity stimuli show increased positivity (or further removal of negativity) when stimuli are presented concurrent with spindles. However, the effectiveness of spindles to inhibit the processing of much louder stimuli remains unknown. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the extent of this gating, by using a range of stimuli including those that are loud and intrusive. Eight good sleepers were recorded during a single night. Auditory stimuli were delivered randomly at 0, 60, 80 or 100 dB SPL. Trials were sorted off-line by sleep stage, stimulus intensity and spindle characteristic (i.e. spindle absent, spindle present). During the sleep-onset period, the often-reported changes in event-related potentials were observed - N1 decreased and P2 increased in amplitude. In Stage 2 sleep, P2 was affected by the presence of spindles, particularly when stimulus intensity was loud. Its amplitude was greatest when spindles occurred following the onset of the stimulus. Scalp-recorded spindles might, therefore, be a consequence of the prior thalamic inhibition of information processing, especially when confronted by loud, intrusive external stimuli.

Based on evidence from animal electrophysiology and human brain-imaging techniques, it is commonly held that short-term memory relies on sustained activity in a network distributed over sensory and prefrontal cortices. How does neural firing persist in such a distributed network in the absence of visual input? Hebb's influential but so far unproved proposal, developed more than 50 years ago, is that sustained activation in short-term memory networks is maintained by reverberating activity in neuronal loops. We hypothesized that synchronized oscillatory activity, proposed to provide a dynamic link between distributed areas, could not only coordinate activity in the network but also establish reentrant loops in the system to enable both sustained firing and temporal coincidence of inputs. We show in human intracranial recordings that limited regions of extrastriate visual areas, separated by several centimeters, become synchronized in an oscillatory mode during the rehearsal of an object in visual short-term memory. Synchrony occurs specifically in the beta range (15-25 Hz) and disappears in a control condition. These findings thus confirm experimentally the hypothesis of a functional role of synchronized oscillatory activity in the coordination of distributed neural activity in humans, and support Hebb's popular but unproved concept of short-term memory maintenance by reentrant activity within the activated network.

Tests of nonlinearity and a random shuffling routine revealed deterministic and nonlinear portions in the fetal ECoG. As common nonlinear measures are not applicable to nonstationary time series, we developed an algorithm to estimate the predictability of the ECoG in its time course by means of a point prediction error (PPE). The ECoG was recorded before and during VAS from the maternal abdominal surface in seven chronically instrumented fetal sheep at 0.8 of gestation. The PPE during REM sleep was significantly higher than during NREM steep. VAS in NREM sleep resulted in an abrupt increase of the PPE not reaching the level of REM sleep. The steep increase of the PPE at onset and its slow decrease after cessation of the stimulus were very similar to the dynamics of spontaneous sleep state transitions, suggesting the involvement of the same cortical activating mechanisms. In conclusion, the stage and the time course of fetal brain activation and deactivation patterns can be clearly shown by PPE techniques. The PPE is a useful complement to spectral analysis. Both techniques describe different properties of the ECoG.

To investigate the pathophysiology of this phenomenon, we examined its characteristics in patients with unilateral tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods: Movement duration and PMBS was measured after self-paced movement of the thumb at movement-reactive beta frequencies, over the supplementary motor area in 10 PD patients and 8 control subjects. Results: Movement duration in PD patients was longer than in controls. In left hand tremor patients, movement of the left hand was significantly longer compared to the right hand. When PD patients moved their non-affected hand, similarly to the controls, PMBS was higher contralateral to the movement. After movement of the tremulous hand, the contralateral PMBS decreased significantly and the contralateral preponderance disappeared. In the same hemisphere, PMBS was higher after contralateral to the non-affected hand movement, than after ipsilateral to the tremulous hand after movement. Conclusions: PMBS in PD is affected by the activity of tremor related neural networks, suggesting that both cortical and subcortical sources are responsible for its generation. Examination of PMBS in various neurological diseases might provide further data on its physiological significance. (C) 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

This study uses an in vitro slice preparation coupled with electrophysiological recordings to probe neuronal responses to acute ethanol exposure. Recordings were conducted in ferret and rat thalamic slices, since thalamic circuitry is an integral component of sleep/wake cycles and sleep spindles. A key mediator of spindle wave activity is the low-threshold calcium current (T-type current). The T-type current underlies burst responses in the lateral geniculate and thalamic reticular nuclei that are important in spindle propagation. Whole cell patch recordings in thalamic brain slices revealed that ethanol has a differential, dose-dependent effect on the native T-type current in thalamic relay cells. Low concentrations of ethanol (2.5, 5, and 10 mM) enhance T-type current ( n = 35), whereas higher concentrations of ethanol (20 and 50 mM) decrease T-type current ( n = 27). To address whether this dose-dependent effect was due to variation between cells, in a subset we verified the differential effect within the same cell ( n = 7). In an effort to examine whether the biphasic effects on the current were due to the order of ethanol exposures, we varied the order of high and low ethanol concentrations within the same cell. The ability of ethanol to perturb calcium currents in thalamic relay cells may provide a mechanistic framework for the well documented disruptions in sleep/wake behavior in subjects with ethanol exposure.

The striatum is part of a multisynaptic loop involved in translating higher order cognitive activity into action. The main striatal computational unit is the medium spiny neuron, which integrates inputs arriving from widely distributed cortical neurons and provides the sole striatal output. 2. The membrane potential of medium spiny neurons' displays shifts between a very negative resting state (down state) and depolarizing plateaus (up states) which are driven by the excitatory cortical inputs. 3. Because striatal spiny neurons fire action potentials only during the up state, these plateau depolarizations are perceived as enabling events that allow information processing through cerebral cortex - basal ganglia circuits. In vivo intracellular recording techniques allow to investigate simultaneously the subthreshold behavior of the medium spiny neuron membrane potential (which is a "reading" of distributed patterns of cortical activity) and medium spiny neuron firing (which is an index of striatal output). 4. Recent studies combining intracellular recordings of striatal neurons with field potential recordings of the cerebral cortex illustrate how the analysis of the input-output transformations performed by medium spiny neurons may help to unveil some aspects of information processing in cerebral cortex - basal ganglia circuits, and to understand the origin of the clinical manifestations of Parkinson's disease and other neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders that result from alterations in dopamine-dependent information processing in the cerebral cortex - basal ganglia circuits.

Information from each modality is continuously fractionated into distinct features, processed locally by different brain regions relatively specialized for extracting these disparate components and globally by interactions among these regions. Information is represented by levels of synchronization within neuronal populations and of coherence among multiple brain regions that deviate from random fluctuations. Significant deviations constitute local and global negative entropy, or information. Local field potentials reflect the degree of synchronization among the neurons of the local ensembles. Large-scale integration, or 'binding', is proposed to involve oscillations of local field potentials that play an important role in facilitating synchronization and coherence, assessed by neuronal coincidence detectors, and parsed into perceptual frames by cortico-thalamo-cortical loops. The most probable baseline levels of local synchrony, coherent interactions among brain regions, and frame durations have been quantitatively described in large studies of their age-appropriate normative distributions and are considered as an approximation to a conscious 'ground state'. The level of consciousness during anesthesia can be accurately predicted by the magnitude and direction of reversible multivariate deviations from this ground state. An invariant set of changes takes place during anesthesia, independent of the particular anesthetic agent. Evidence from a variety of neuroscience areas supporting these propositions, together with the invariant reversible electrophysiological changes observed with loss and return of consciousness, are used to provide a foundation for this theory of consciousness. This paper illustrates the increasingly recognized need to consider global as well as local processes in the search for better explanations of how the brain accomplishes the transformation from synchronous and distributed neuronal discharges to seamless global subjective awareness.

J	Oliveira, AJ; Zamagni, M; Dolso, P; Bassetti, MA; Gigli, GL				Oliveira, AJ; Zamagni, M; Dolso, P; Bassetti, MA; Gigli, GL			Respiratory disorders during sleep in patients with epilepsy: effect of ventilatory therapy on EEG interictal epileptiform discharges	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						epilepsy; sleep apnea syndrome; polysomnography; sleep disorders; ventilatory therapy	APNEA SYNDROME; WEIGHT-GAIN; SEIZURES	Objective: Sleep disorders are common and may coexist with a variety of diseases, including epilepsy, with important implications for the clinical management of the latter. Sleep fragmentation and deprivation, and hypoxia associated to sleep disordered breathing (SDB) may contribute to the occurrence of seizures. On the other hand, antiepileptic drugs may worsen SDB by reducing the muscle tone of the upper airways, and increasing the arousal threshold. There is evidence indicating that treatment of the SDB can reduce both frequency and intensity of seizures. This study aimed at further understanding the relationship between SDB and epilepsy, particularly the influence of SDB on epileptogenicity - as evaluated by a quantitative analysis of interictal epileptogenic activity. Methods: Eight consecutive patients affected by partial epilepsy associated to SDB (OSAS or an association between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - COPD - and snoring) underwent two nocturnal polysomnographies (PSG) - before and after ventilatory therapy with CPAP (in 6 patients with OSAS) or oxygen (in two patients with COPD and snoring). Spiking was quantified during the first sleep cycle in both PSG studies, and spiking rates were calculated both for the entire sleep cycle and for each separate sleep phase (NREM 1, NREM 2, NREM 3-4, REM and wake time after sleep onset - WASO). Results: In all patients, the improvement of the SDB after ventilatory treatment - as demonstrated by a reduction of the respiratory disturbances index (RDI) - was associated to a reduction of spiking rates, both in the entire cycle and in relationship to slow wave sleep. This reduction was particularly marked in patients with higher spiking rates in baseline conditions. Conclusion: Our data show that SDB treatment reduces the interictal epileptogenic activity, suggesting that SDB plays a role in increasing epileptogenicity. Further studies will be necessary to clarify the mechanisms whereby this reduction in epileptogenicity occurs, although improved sleep stability seems to play an important role.

Natl Acad. Sci. USA 91 (1994) 5033) was applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to test the hypothesis that C-N decreases when information processing in the brain is impaired, as is the case in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Methods: One hundred and fifty-one channel MEGs were recorded in 20 AD patients and 20 healthy age-matched controls in a resting condition with eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC). Artifact-free epochs of 117 channels were selected for analysis. C-N and D-2 were computed in different frequency bands, and correlated with the MMSE. Results: The Group X Frequency band interaction was significant for both C-N and D-2. C-N was higher in AD, as compared with controls, in the 2-4 and 4-8 Hz bands, and D-2 was higher in AD patients in the 14-20 and 20-30 Hz bands. The C-N was higher in the EC condition compared to the EO condition, whereas the D-2 was higher in the EO condition. Conclusions: The hypothesis of Tononi et al. (Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 91 (1994) 5033) that the neural complexity decreases in AD patients has to be rejected. However, both neural complexity and the correlation dimension did show differences between controls and AD patients which depended on frequency band.

Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), and/or antidromic responses were elicited by stimulating homotopic sites in the contralateral cortical areas. Differential features of EPSPs related to latencies, amplitudes, and slopes were detected in closely located (50 mum or less) neurons recorded in succession along the same electrode track. In contrast to synchronous thalamocortical volleys that excited most neurons within a cortical column, stimuli applied to homotopic sites in the contralateral cortex activated neurons at restricted cortical depths. Median latencies of callosally evoked EPSPs were 1.5 to 4 ms in various cortical cell-classes. Fast-rhythmic-bursting neurons displayed EPSPs whose amplitudes were threefold larger, and latencies two- or threefold shorter, than those found in the three other cellular classes. Converging callosal and thalamic inputs were recorded in the same cortical neuron. EPSPs or IPSPs were elicited by stimulating foci spaced by <1 mm in the contralateral cortex. In the overwhelming majority of neurons, latencies of antidromic responses were between 1.2 and 3.1 ms; however, some callosal neurons had much longer latencies, &LE;18.5 ms. Some neurons were excited mono synaptically through the callosal pathway and identified antidromically from appropriate thalamic nuclei, thus revealing a callosal-corticothalamic pathway. Data are discussed in relation to the commissural spread of fast and slow normal oscillations as well as paroxysmal activities.

However, aside from the deficits observed after lesioning this connection, little positive evidence indicates its function in bimanual tasks. In order to address this issue, we simultaneously recorded neuronal activity at multiple sites within the arm area of motor cortex in both hemispheres of awake primates performing different bimanual and unimanual movements. By employing an adapted form of the joint peri-stimulus time histogram technique, we discovered rapid movement-related correlation changes between the local field potentials (LFPs) of the two hemispheres that escaped detection by time-averaged cross-correlation methods. The frequency and amplitude of dynamic modifications in correlations between the hemispheres were similar to those within the same hemisphere. As in previous EEG studies, we found that, on average, correlation decreased during movements. However, a subset of recording site pairs did show transiently increased correlations around movement onset (57% of all pairs and conditions in monkey G, 39% in monkey P). In interhemispheric pairs, these increases were consistently related to the mode of coupling between the two arms. Both the correlations between the movements themselves and the interhemispheric LFP correlation increases were strongest during bimanual symmetric movements, and weaker during bimanual asymmetric and unimanual movements. Increased correlations occurred mainly around movement onset, whilst decreases in correlation dominated during movement execution. The task-specific way in which interhemispheric correlations are modulated is compatible with the notion that interactions between the hemispheres contribute to behavioural coupling between the arms.

This ventral hippocampus spontaneous synchronous activity (VHSSA) in CA1 stratum pyramidale consisted of positive potentials (similar to0.12 mV, 55 ms) occurring at a frequency of 2.8+/-0.2 Hz for hours without interruption. VHSSA was most frequently observed in slices taken 1-3 mm from the ventral end of hippocampus, and was absent in slices taken from tissue more than 4.5 mm away from it. Stimulation of Schaffer collaterals primed the appearance of potentials, which were similar to VHSSA and clearly distinguishable from excitatory postsynaptic potentials. In view of the known relative proneness of ventral hippocampus to epilepsy, we perfused ventral slices with high-[K+](o) medium (8 mM). Albeit reduced in amplitude, VHSSA persisted during the high-[K+](o) induced interictal-like epileptiform activity. We could not document any temporal relationship between the two phenomena. Low concentrations of the antagonist of gamma-amino-butyric acid receptors, type A, bicuculline (2-3 muM), which enhanced the high-[K+](o) induced epileptiform activity, reversibly blocked the VHSSA. We conclude that under standard in vitro conditions small circuits in the ventral hippocampus are most often and for long periods of time engaged in synchronous quasi-rhythmic low-frequency activity, generated locally by mechanisms substantially differing from those supporting epileptiform discharges.

The aim of the current study was to clarify the relation between electroencephalographic bicoherence and the isoflurane concentration. Methods: Thirty elective abdominal surgery patients (male and female, aged 34-77 yr, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II) were enrolled. After electroencephalogram recording with patients in an awake state, anesthesia was induced with 3 mg/kg thiopental and maintained with oxygen and isoflurane. Continuous epidural anesthesia with 80-100 mg/kg 1% lidocaine was also administered. Using software they developed, the authors continuously recorded the FP1-A(1) lead of the electroencephalographic signal and expired isoflurane concentration to an IBM-PC compatible computer. After confirming the steady state of each isoflurane (end-tidal concentration at 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, 1.3, and 1.5%), electroencephalographic bicoherence values were calculated. Results: In a light anesthetic state, electroencephalographic bicoherence values were low (generally less than or equal to 15.0%). At increased concentrations of isoflurane, two peaks of electroencephalographic bicoherence emerged along the diagonal line (f(1) = f(2)). The peak emerged at around 4.0 Hz and grew higher as isoflurane concentration increased until it reached a plateau (43.8 +/- 3.5%, mean SD) at isoflurane 0.9%. The other peak, at about 10.0 Hz, also became significantly higher and reached a plateau (32.6 +/- 9.2%) at isoflurane 0.9%; at isoflurane 1.3%, however, this peak slightly decreased. Conclusion: Changes in the height of two electroencephalographic bicoherence peaks correlated well with isoflurane concentration.

Neuromagnetic recordings were conducted in five subjects using a whole-head MEG system during tactile stimulation of the right index finger, with or without visual feedback, and while viewing another individual's index finger being Stimulated. Volumetric images of changes in source power relative to pre-stimulus baseline levels were computed with 2 mm resolution over the entire brain using a minimum-variance beamforming algorithm (synthetic aperture magnetometry). Onset of tactile stimulation produced a brief (200-300 ms) Suppression of mu band (8-15 Hz) and beta band (15-30 Hz) cortical activity in the primary somatosensory and primary motor cortex, respectively, followed by a bilateral increase ill beta band activity ('beta rebound') in motor cortex. This pattern of suppression/rebound was absent when subjects observed finger brushing or brushing motions without receiving stimulation. In contrast, these conditions resulted in bilateral increases in beta band activity in sensorimotor areas and decreased power in the alpha (8-12 Hz) band in primary visual areas. These results show that spatially filtered MEG provides a useful method for directly imaging the temporal sequence of changes in cortical rhythms during transient tactile stimulation, and provide evidence that observation of tactile input to another individual's hand, or object motion itself, can influence independent rhythmic activity in visual and sensorimotor cortex.

However, there is no systematic description about the occurrence of spindles in sequences in relation to time of night. The aim of the present study was to examine the temporal occurrence of periodic sleep spindles during the night. Sleep spindles of 19 healthy subjects were selected visually. A minimum of three consecutive spindles was required to form a spindle sequence. A 5-second upper time interval limit was applied as the longest duration between spindles belonging to a spindle sequence. The number of spindles and time occupied by spindle sequences increased from the first to the fourth non-REM (NREM) sleep episode. Within NREM sleep episodes, the number of spindles and spindle sequences dominated at the beginning. In the first two NREM sleep episodes with high slow-wave activity (SWA), there were few spindle sequences and they decreased with increasing SWA. In the third and fourth NREM sleep episode with less SWA, there were more spindle sequences and they were more evenly distributed. It is possible that in the first NREM sleep episodes, hyperpolarization of the thalamocortical cells deepens so rapidly that the NREM sleep level, where spindle sequences arise, is passed and spindle sequences are not formed. Spindle sequences could be regarded as markers of the evolution of the NREM sleep process and their lack or excess in relation to time of night and NREM sleep episode can hopefully be used to indicate changes in brain mechanisms behind NREM sleep.

K-complexes may be directly related to blood pressure changes or they may reflect central sympathetic activation. We analyzed the temporal relationship among K-complexes, heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) during sleep in eight healthy volunteers ( 3 men and 5 women, age 22-41 yr). Most K-complexes presented as single large complexes (56 +/- 20%), followed by single small complexes (15 +/- 14%) and as couplets or triplets (13 +/- 6%). Single large K-complexes were preceded by a baroreflex-mediated increase of MSNA in approximately one-half (55%) of the cases. Detailed analysis of HR, BP, and MSNA was possible in 63 (45%) large single K-complexes not disturbed by preceding baroreflex-related changes. Systolic and diastolic BP and MSNA increased significantly after single events (22.5 +/- 13, 5.2 +/- 2.1, and 6.5 +/- 3.0%). Mean sympathetic baroreflex latency was similar after the single large K-complexes compared with the mean value during stage 2 sleep (1,290 +/- 126 vs. 1,279 +/- 61 ms). The area under the burst was significantly increased after single large K-complexes (median 3.9 vs. 9.0 arbitrary units, P < 0.03). The results support the hypothesis that K-complexes express cortical activation leading to temporary facilitation of sympathetic outflow in a graded fashion. Their functional effects appear to be independent of baroreflex modulation of MSNA in &SIM;50% of the cases.

J	Kostopoulos, GK				Kostopoulos, GK			Spike-and-wave discharges of absence seizures asa transformation of sleep spindles: the continuing development of a hypothesis	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						epilepsy; absence seizures; spindles; spike and wave; thalamocortical; reticular nucleus	GENERALIZED PENICILLIN EPILEPSY; HIPPOCAMPAL SLICES; THALAMIC NEURONS; MUTANT MOUSE; RECURRENT INHIBITION; CELLULAR MECHANISMS; GABA(B) RECEPTORS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; RAT MODEL; EXCITABILITY	Objectives: This review aims to offer a critical account of recent scientific developments relevant to the hypothesis which Pierre Gloor proposed in the 1970s for the generation of spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of primary generalized absence seizures. Results: According to this hypothesis SWDs develop in the same circuits, which normally generate sleep spindles, by an initially cortical transformation of one every two or more spindle waves to a 'spike' component of SWDs, while the next one or more spindle waves are eliminated and replaced by a slow negative wave. This hypothesis was based on experiments in feline generalized penicillin epilepsy showing the possibility of transition from spindles to SWDs, when cortical neurons become hyper responsive to thalamocortical volleys, which normally induce spindles, and thus engage feedback cortical inhibition, rebound excitation, recurrent intracortical dissemination of excitation during the 'spike' and strong excitation of thalamus for further augmentation of a brain wide synchronous oscillation. In the 1980s, electrophysiological studies in vitro and in vivo revealed the basic features of spindle rhythm generation by neurons in nucleus reticularis thalami and thalamocortical-corticothalamic oscillatory reverberations. Conclusions: In the light of this knowledge, experimental studies in several genetic and pharmacological animal models of absence seizures, clinical observations and theoretical studies in computer models have considered, tested, modified and challenged this hypothesis. It may still be found useful in the era of dynamic digital EEG analysis of SWDs and its current sources. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Carpentier, P; Foquin, A; Dorandeu, F; Lallement, G				Carpentier, P; Foquin, A; Dorandeu, F; Lallement, G			Delta activity as an early indicator for soman-induced brain damage: A review	NEUROTOXICOLOGY			English	Article						soman; guinea-pig; rat; cynomolgus monkey; ECoG power spectrum; delta activity; seizure activity; neuropathology	STATUS-EPILEPTICUS; SEIZURE ACTIVITY; LONG-TERM; INTOXICATED RATS; NEUROPATHOLOGY; LESIONS; EEG; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; MK-801; SARIN	The organophosphorus (OP) compound soman is known to produce long-lasting epileptic seizure activity and associated brain damage. The present paper reviews the findings of five recent studies that tentatively established correlations between the development of soman-induced neuropathology and some subtle changes in the electrocortigraphic (ECoG) power spectrum. It is important tot note that the reported experiments have been performed independently by three different teams (France, The Netherlands, USA) in various animal models (rat, guinea-pig, cynomolgus monkey) through different protocols of intoxication, pharmacological environments, and methods for ECoG spectral analysis. Despite there disparities, the five studies show that a sustained shift of ECoG power toward the lowest frequency range, i.e. the delta band, occurs within the first hours of soman-induced seizures. This early ECoG spectral change is concurrent with the first neuropathological changes in brain and is almost constantly followed, days or weeks later, by at least minimal neuropathology. Moreover, the relative contribution of delta activity to the ECoG power spectrum still remains abnormally high for 1-3 days after seizure onset, i.e. within the phase of damage maturation. On the other hand, soman-induced neuropathology was not observed in non-seizuring animals in which the delta activity was not increased above the pre-soman baseline. Similarly, no brain damage was ever shown in seizuring subjects in which the initial delta change eventually normalized after the curative administration of efficient anticonvulsant drugs such as the non-competitive antagonists of the NMDA receptor. These results, in agreement with previously published observations, strongly suggest that an increase of the relative power in the delta band might be a real-time marker of the ongoing development of soman-induced, seizure-related cerebral lesions and a reliable predictor for the final neuronal losses to come. Therefore, the monitoring of delta activity during the 24-72 h period that follows soman exposure may potentially be a useful tool to follow "on-line" the progression of brain damage and to control the neuroprotective activity of a medication. Moreover, since the method is non-invasive in man and since the above-presented results have been partly found in primates, the applicability to spectral analysis as a prognostic means in human OP poisoning ought to be seriously considered.

J	Maquet, P				Maquet, P			Functional neuroimaging of normal human sleep by positron emission tomography	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Review							CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; NUCLEUS BASALIS MAGNOCELLULARIS; LOCUS COERULEUS STIMULATION; DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS; CENTROMEDIAN-PARAFASCICULAR COMPLEX; LESS-THAN-1 HZ OSCILLATION; BRAIN ENERGY-METABOLISM; REM-SLEEP; GLUCOSE-UTILIZATION	Functional neuroimaging using positron emission tomography has recently yielded original data on the functional neuroanatomy of human sleep. This paper attempts to describe the possibilities and limitations of the technique and clarify its usefulness in sleep research. A short overview of the methods of acquisition and statistical analysis (statistical parametric mapping, SPM) is presented before the results of PET sleep studies are reviewed. The discussion attempts to integrate the functional neuroimaging data into the body of knowledge already acquired on sleep in animals and humans using various other techniques (intracellular recordings, in situ neurophysiology, lesional and pharmacological trials, scalp EEG recordings, behavioural or psychological description). The published PET data describe a very reproducible functional neuroanatomy in sleep. The core characteristics of this 'canonical' sleep may be summarized as follows. In slow-wave sleep, most deactivated areas are located in the dorsal pons and mesencephalon, cerebellum, thalami, basal ganglia, basal forebrain/hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, precuneus and in the mesial aspect of the temporal lobe. During rapid-eye movement sleep, significant activations were found in the pontine tegmentum, thalamic nuclei, limbic areas (amygdaloid complexes, hippocampal formation, anterior cingulate cortex) and in the posterior cortices (temporo-occipital areas). In contrast, the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, as well as the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, were the least active brain regions. These preliminary studies open up a whole field in sleep research. More detailed explorations of sleep in humans are now accessible to experimental challenges using PET and other neuroimaging techniques. These new methods will contribute to a better understanding of sleep functions.

J	Tesche, CD; Karhu, J				Tesche, CD; Karhu, J			Theta oscillations index human hippocampal activation during a working memory task	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article							NEURONAL POPULATION ACTIVITY; ENDOGENOUS POTENTIALS; NONINVASIVE DETECTION; SERIAL POSITION; GUINEA-PIG; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; NETWORKS; SIGNALS; RHYTHM	Working memory (WM) is the ability to retain and associate information over brief time intervals. Functional imaging studies demonstrate that WM is mediated by a distributed network including frontal and posterior cortices, hippocampus, and cerebellum. In rodents, the presentation of stimuli in a WM task is followed by a reset of the phase of hippocampal theta. In this paper we report the observation of a similar phenomenon in normal human subjects. Neuromagnetic responses were recorded during presentation of a set of digits and a subsequent probe of the retained items. All stimuli were presented with a fixed temporal pattern. We observed phase reset of approximate to 7 Hz theta in left hippocampus approximate to 120 ms after probe stimuli, whereas reset of theta in right hippocampus was visible approximate to 80 ms prior to these anticipated stimuli. The duration of stimulus-locked theta increased with memory load, with a limiting value of approximate to 600 ms for 5-7 retained items. We suggest that, as in rats, stimulus-locked theta may index involvement of human hippocampal networks in the cognitive processing of sensory input. The anticipatory phase reset of theta indicates involvement of hippocampus in right hemisphere and cerebellar timing networks. Hippocampal structures are essential for orientation to perturbations in the sensory scene, a function that requires use of a context established by a constellation of stimuli, We suggest that the initiation and maintenance of stimulus-locked hippocampal theta observed here may facilitate processing of potentially salient and/or novel input with respect to a context established by the contents of WM.

Methods: Eight healthy male subjects (mean age = 23.4 years) participated in the experiment: they slept in the laboratory for 3 nights (one adaptation, one baseline, one recovery); baseline and recovery night were separated by a period of 40 h of continuous wake. Results: One night of total sleep deprivation caused a doubling of slow-wave sleep (SWS) amount, an increase of sleep efficiency and a reduction of the latencies of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stages during the recovery night. These effects were accompanied by a significant reduction in spindle density in the first sleep cycle of the recovery night. Mean KC density did not change as a result of total sleep deprivation, while KC density and inter-KC intervals showed linear trends across the first 4 sleep cycles, respectively decreasing and increasing. Finally, a clear evidence of an antagonist relationship between spindle and KC changes across sleep cycles was provided. Conclusions: The present study further supports the existence of a reciprocal relationship between SWS and sleep spindles, but fails to show an increase of KC density after total sleep deprivation. The opposite time courses of spindle and KC density across sleep cycles points to an antagonist relation between the two main phasic events of NREM sleep. The latter result, together with the increase of inter-KC distance and the decrease of KC density across subsequent sleep cycles, is consistent with the hypothesis of a role of the spontaneous KC as the "forerunner" of delta waves.

J	Ma, JY; Leung, LS				Ma, JY; Leung, LS			Metabotropic glutamate receptors in the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens are involved in generating seizure-induced hippocampal gamma waves and behavioral hyperactivity	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						hippocampus; nucleus accumbens; gamma waves; theta rhythm; mGluR; temporal lobe seizures; postictal behavior	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; COMPLEX PARTIAL SEIZURES; FREELY MOVING RATS; IN-VIVO; DENTATE GYRUS; THETA-RHYTHM; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; BLOCKS INDUCTION; ACTIVATION; CA1	The involvement of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) subtypes in the generation of hippocampal EEG (30-100 Hz) and behaviors induced by a hippocampal afterdischarge (AD) was examined in freely behaving rats. A hippocampal AD induced an increase in gamma waves (30-100 Hz) for 20 min, accompanied by behavioral hyperactivity. Bilateral intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of (RS)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG), a group I and 11 mGluR antagonist, 30 min before a hippocampal AD, significantly suppressed both the increase in gamma waves and the behavioral hyperactivity. The hippocampal theta rhythm, the spontaneous hippocampal gamma waves, and evoked field potential oscillations of similar to 40 Hz were not affected by MCPG. Pre-infusion (i.c.v.) of (2S)-alpha-ethylglutamic acid (EGLU; a group 11 mGluR antagonist), but not (RS)-1-aminoindan-1,5-dicarboxylic acid (AIDA; a group I mGluR antagonist), suppressed the postictal increase of both hippocampal gamma waves and behaviors. MCPG was infused locally into different brain structures in order to specify its target sites. Intra-hippocampal infusion of MCPG, or EGLU, blocked the increase in both gamma waves and behaviors. Infusion of MCPG into the nucleus accumbens suppressed the postictal behavioral hyperactivity without affecting the increase in hippocampal gamma waves. MCPG injected into the medial septum blocked neither postictal gamma activity nor behavioral hyperactivity. It is suggested that the group 11 mGluRs in the hippocampus are involved in generation of the postictal hippocampal gamma waves, while behavioral hyperactivity is partly mediated by mGluRs in the nucleus accumbens. However, spontaneous gamma and theta waves in the normal hippocampus are not mediated by mGluRs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A closed-loop anesthesia system was built using BIS as the control variable, a proportional-integral-differential control algorithm, and a propofol target-controlled infusion system as (lie control actuator. Closed-loop performance was assessed in 10 adult patients. Methods: Ten adult patients scheduled to undergo elective hip or knee surgery were enrolled. An epidural cannula was inserted, and 0.5% bupivacaine was used to provide anesthesia to T8 before general anesthesia was Induced using (lie propofol target-controlled infusion system under manual control. After the start of surgery, when anesthesia was clinically adequate, automatic control of anesthesia was commenced using the BIS as the control variable. Adequacy of anesthesia during closed-loop control was assessed clinically and by calculating the median performance error, the median absolute performance error, and the mean offset of the control variable. Results: The median performance error and the median absolute performance error were 2.2 and 8.0%, respectively. Mean offset of the BIS from the set point was 0.9. Cardiovascular parameters were stable during closed-loop control. operating conditions were adequate in all patients but one, who began moving after 45 min of stable anesthesia. No patients reported awareness or recall of Intraoperative events. hi three patients, there was oscillation of the measured BIS around the set point. Conclusions: The system was able to provide clinically adequate anesthesia in 9 of 10 patients. Further studies are required to determine whether control performance can be improved by alterations to the gain factors or by using an effect site-targeted, target-controlled infusion propofol system.

In the present paper, the electrical activity in the brain corresponding to different types of sleep spindles was estimated by means of low-resolution electromagnetic tomography. In its new implementation, this method is based on realistic head geometry and solution space is restricted to the cortical gray matter and hippocampus. In multichannel all-night electroencephalographic recordings, 10-20 artifact-free 1.25-s epochs with frontally, parietally and approximately equally distributed spindles were marked visually in 10 normal healthy subjects aged 20-35 years. As a control condition, artifact-free non-spindle epochs 1-3 s before or after the corresponding spindle episodes were marked. Low-resolution electromagnetic tomography demonstrated, independent of the scalp distribution, a distributed spindle source in the prefrontal cortex (Brodmann areas 9 and 10), oscillating with a frequency below 13 Hz, and in the precuneus (Brodmann area 7), oscillating with a frequency above 13 Hz. In extremely rare cases only the prefrontal or the parietal source was active. Brodmann areas 9 and 10 have principal connections to the dorsomedial thalamic nucleus; Brodmann area 7 is connected to the lateroposterior, laterodorsal and rostral intralaminar centrolateral thalamic nuclei. Thus, the localized cortical brain regions are directly connected with adjacent parts of the dorsal thalamus, where sleep spindles are generated. The results demonstrated simultaneously active cortical spindle sources which differed in frequency by approximately 2 Hz and were located in brain regions known to be critically involved in the processing of sensory input, which is in line with the assumed functional role of sleep spindles.

The authors investigated the effect of altering central cholinergic transmission, by physostigmine and scopolamine, on unconsciousness produced by propofol. Methods: Propofol was administered to American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1 (n = 17) volunteers with use of a computer-controlled Infusion pump at increasing concentrations until unconsciousness resulted (Inability to respond to verbal commands, abolition of spontaneous movement). Central nervous system function was assessed by use of the Auditory tory Steady State Response (ASSR) and Bispectral Index (BIS) analysis of electrooculogram. During continuous administration of propofol, reversal of unconsciousness produced by physostigmine (28 mu g/kg) and block of this reversal by scopolamine (8.6 mu g/kg) were evaluated. Results: Propofol produced unconsciousness at a plasma concentration of 3.2 +/- 0.8 (+/- SD) mu g/ml (n = 17). Unconsciousness was associated with reductions in ASSR (0.10 +/- 0.08 mu V [awake baseline 0.32 +/- 0.18 mu V], P < 0.001) and BIS (55.7 +/- 8.8 [awake baseline 92.4 +/- 3.9], P < 0.001). Physostigmine restored consciousness in 9 of 11 subjects, with concomitant Increases in ASSR (0.38 +/- 0.17 mu V, P < 0.01) and BIS (75.3 +/- 8.3, P < 0.001). In all subjects (n = 6) scopolamine blocked the physostigmine-induced reversal of unconsciousness and the increase of the ASSR and BIS (ASSR and BIS during propofol-induced unconsciousness: 0.09 +/- 0.09 mu V and 58.2 +/- 7.5, respectively; ASSR and BIS after physostigmine administration: 0.08 +/- 0.06 mu V and 56.8 +/- 6.7, respectively, NS).

A cardinal symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) is poverty of movement (akinesia). Current models of PD thus hypothesize that increased inhibitory pallidal output reduces firing rates in frontal cortex, including MI, resulting in akinesia and muscle rigidity. We recorded the simultaneous spontaneous discharge of several neurons in the arm-related area of MI of two monkeys and in the globus pallidus (GP) of one of the two. Accelerometers were fastened to the forelimbs to detect movement, and surface electromyograms were recorded from the contralateral arm of one monkey. The recordings were conducted before and after systemic treatment with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), rendering the animals severely akinetic and rigid with little or no tremor. The mean spontaneous MI rates during periods of immobility (four to five spikes/sec) did not change after MPTP; however, in this parkinsonian state, MI neurons discharged in long bursts (sometimes >2 sec long). These bursts were synchronized across many cells but failed to elicit detectable movement, indicating that even robust synchronous MI discharge need not result in movement. These synchronized population bursts were absent from the GP and were on a larger timescale than oscillatory synchrony found in the GP of tremulous MPTP primates, suggesting that MI parkinsonian synchrony arises independently of basal ganglia dynamics. After MPTP, MI neurons responded more vigorously and with less specificity to passive limb movement. Abnormal MI firing patterns and synchronization, rather than reduced firing rates, may underlie PD akinesia and persistent muscle rigidity.

Appropriate retrieval is warranted if motor programmes are only activated if necessary and are, probably more often, inhibited if required by the context of a given situation. It is unknown how this type of inhibition is accomplished in the brain. We studied context-dependent modulation of motor memory traces in 18 volunteers and six patients with focal dystonia. Cortical function was assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation over the primary motor cortex (M1) and with task-related analysis of oscillatory EEG activity. An activation (ACT) and inhibition (INH) condition were compared. In both, visual cues were presented at 1/s. In ACT, subjects had to respond to these cues with individual finger movements as learned in a preceding training session. In INH, subjects had to observe the cues without retrieval of motor responses. During INH, inhibitory control of the motor memory trace was confirmed by significant amplitude reduction of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) compared with baseline. This was accompanied by a significant increase of 11-13 Hz oscillatory activity over the sensorimotor areas during INH. During active retrieval of the motor memory traces, the reverse was true (increased MEP amplitudes, decreased oscillatory 11-13 Hz activity). In a small sample of dystonic patients (n=6), the increase of 11-13 Hz oscillatory activity during INH was consistently absent. The present data demonstrate for the first time cortical correlates of appropriate, context-dependent inhibition of motor memory traces. We propose that focal increases of oscillatory activity are instrumental for inhibitory control at the cortical level. This concept is supported by the preliminary observations in dystonic patients who are known to have deficits of inhibitory motor control and in whom these context-dependent focal increases of oscillatory activity were absent.

The purpose of this study was to compare cardiovascular responses (heart rate, skin blood flow, and pulse transit time, a non-invasive measure of arterial wall stiffness) to auditory induced arousal from stage 2 sleep under conditions of normoxia and overnight mild hypoxia. Design: Randomised crossover. Setting: Sleep Disorders Unit in a 270-bed teaching hospital. Participants. Eleven healthy male subjects. Interventions: Subjects slept wearing a facemask and breathed room air (one night; SaO(2) similar to 98%) or an hypoxic gas mixture (two nights; SaO(2) similar to 92%). Once in stage 2 sleep, subjects were administered one of 10 auditory tones (500 Hz, range 54-90 dB, 5-sec duration) via earphones or a sham tone (recording with no tone). Measurements and Results: Cardiovascular responses were examined beat-by-beat for 20 seconds before and 30 seconds after auditory tones associated with arousals (3-10 second EEG changes) and after sham tones. Sleep efficiency and the percentage of sleep spent in each stage were not different between hypoxia and normoxia nights. Baseline heart rate was elevated on hypoxia nights compared with normoxia nights (59.5 +/-1.7 vs. 54.4 +/-1.6 b.min(-1), p=0.007). Heart rate, pulse transit time, and skin blood flow showed significant changes after arousal consistent with rapid parasympathetic withdrawal and sympathetic nervous system activation. No changes were observed after sham tones, There were no differences in time course or magnitude of cardiovascular responses between hypoxia and normoxia nights. Conclusions: We conclude that while mild hypoxia stimulates autonomic activity it does not augment the cardiovascular response to arousal from stage 2 sleep in normal subjects.

We aimed to investigate whether maturation of REM or NREM sleep generating structures leads to the development of distinct sleep states. The electrocorticogram (ECoG) was recorded from five unanaesthetised chronically instrumented foetal sheep in utero and was analysed every 5th day between 115-130 dGA by two different non-linear methods. We calculated a non-linear prediction error which quantifies the causality of the ECoG and applied bispectral analysis which quantifies non-linear interrelations of single frequency components within the ECoG signal. The prediction error during REM sleep was significantly higher than during NREM sleep at each investigated age (P < 0.0001) coincidental with poor organisation of the rhythmic pattern in the ECoG during REM sleep. At 115 dGA, organised sleep states defined behaviourally were not developed yet. The prediction error, however, showed already different stales of electrocortical activity that were not detectable using power spectral analysis. The prediction error of the premature NREM sleep ECoG decreased significantly during emergence of organised sleep states between 115 and 120 dGA and continued to decrease after the emergence of distinct sleep states (P < 0.05). The prediction error of the premature REM sleep ECoG did not change until 120 dGA and began to increase at 125 dGA (P < 0.05). Using bispectral analysis, we showed couplings between delta waves (1.5-4 Hz) and frequencies in the range of spindle waves (4-8 and 8-12 Hz) during NREM sleep that became closer during development. The results show that maturation of ECoG synchronisation mediating structures is important for the development of organised sleep states. The further divergence of the prediction error of NREM;I and REM sleep after development of organised sleep states reveals continuous functional development. Thus, complementary application of non-linear ECoG analysis to power spectral analysis provide new insights in the collective behaviour of the neuronal network during the emergence of sleep states.

J	Freeman, WJ				Freeman, WJ			A neurobiological interpretation of semiotics: meaning, representation, and information	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article							CHAOS; NOISE	The branch of semiotics called semantics deals with the relation between meanings and representations, widely known as the symbol grounding problem. The other branches of semiotics, syntactics which deals with symbol-symbol relations as in a dictionary, and pragmatics which deals with symbol-action paradigms as in traffic signs, are well done by computers, but semantics has eluded computer simulation. In: my view? this is because computer programmers have neglected that aspect of Shannon's definition by which information has no meaning; computers process information, whereas brains create meaning. Brains obtain information about the world through the consequences of their own embodied actions. The information thus obtained is used in constructing meaning and is then discarded. One kind of information in the world consists of representations made by other brains for social communication. Computers use representations for information processing and symbol manipulation. However, brains have no internal representations. They deploy dynamic neural operators in the form of activity patterns, which constitute and implement meaning but not information, so:that the problem of symbol grounding does not arise. Brains construct external representations in the form of material objects or movements as:their means for expressing their internal states of meaning, such as words, books, paintings, and music, as well as facial expressions and gestures in animals and humans, but even though those material objects are made with the intent to elicit meaning in other brains,: they have no meanings in themselves and do not carry meanings as if they were buckets or placards. Meanings can only exist in brains, because each meaning expresses the entire history and experience of an individual. It is an activity pattern that occupies the entire available brain, constituting a location in the intentional structure of a brain. It is the limited sharing of meanings between brains for social purposes that requires reciprocal exchanges of representations, each presentation by a transmitting brain inducing the construction of new meaning in the receiving brain. EEG data indicate that neural patterns of meanings in each brain occur in trajectories of discrete steps, which are demarcated by first-order state transitions that enable formation of spatiotemporal patterns of spatially coherent oscillations. Amplitude modulation is the mode of expressing meanings. These wave packets do not represent external objects; they embody and implement the meanings of objects for each individual, in terms of what they portend for the future of that individual, and what that individual should do with and about them.

J	Glassman, RB				Glassman, RB			Topology and graph theory applied to cortical anatomy may help explain working memory capacity for three or four simultaneous items	BRAIN RESEARCH BULLETIN			English	Review						association; cortex; combinatorial; column; module; planar	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; RADIAL-ARM MAZE; SPATIAL MEMORY; VISUAL-CORTEX; GAMMA; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; RHYTHMS; RATS; REPRESENTATIONS	Cognitive experimentation suggests that at any single instant only three or four items ("chunks") are simultaneously prominent as a working memory (WM) trace, if we disregard the rehearsal component of WM. The reason for small WM capacity may concern combinatorial manageability. How might the neural representations of these few coactive chunks occupy a spatially distributed set of areas of the sheet-like cortex, while providing both order and flexibility to associate items in WM? Each attribute of each simultaneously active WM item must have broad access to the representational facilities of the cortical sheet, comprising tens of thousands of modular "cortical columns." The two hypothesized neural levels of WM during any moment of cognition comprise (a) "binding" together of many distributed attribute representations within each respective WM chunk, and (b) combinatorial play among three or four WM chunk-representations. Anatomical and functional evidence of cortical unity through its depth suggests that cortex may be viewed as essentially planar in its distribution of activations. Thus, a moment's WM is hypothesized here to reside in myriad activated cortical planar "patches," each subdivided into up to four amoeboid "subpatches." Two different lines of topological reasoning suggest orderly associations of such representations. (1) The four-color principle of map topology, and the related K-4 is planar theorem of graph theory, imply that if a small cortical area is dynamically subdivided into no more than four, discretely bounded planar subareas, then each such segment has ample free access to each of the others. (2) A hypothetical alternative to such associative adjacency of simultaneously active cortical representations of chunk-attributes is associative overlap, whereby, in dense cortical neuropil, activated subpatches behave like Venn diagrams of intersecting sets. As the number of Venn-like coactive subpatches within a patch increases, maintaining ad hoc associativity among all combinations requires exponentially proliferating intersections. Beyond four, serpentine subpatch shapes are required, which could easily lead to pathologies of omission or commission. As hypothesized by many researchers, the binding of the widely distributed cortical modules that represent a given chunk may involve synchrony or coherence of a single EEG frequency. Elsewhere, I have conjectured that such a binding frequency for a single chunk may bear a harmonic relationship with the additional EEG frequencies that are simultaneously binding the other WM chunks. Other possible mechanisms of binding have also been hypothesized. Whatever the mechanism, the many attributes of a moment's complement of three or four WM chunks must generally have an accidental relationship with the spatial distribution of the cortical feature analyzers that must be activated to represent those attributes. Therefore, the cortex may need, and have, comprehensive anatomical connections of each of its modules for representing an attribute (or of small redundant module groupings) with every other. If such whole-part cortico-cortical connections are somehow exploited not only to fully represent each cognitive chunk in its bound-together attributes, but also to bring the major business of intensive WM information processing down to the level of local circuits, in the sorts of topological patterning hypothesized here, there may be two adaptive results: (1) Time and other economies would be achieved in the reduction of activity in distant cortico-cortical connections to lower-energy global orchestration, or binding processes. (2) The piecemeal local topological limit to four subpatches would be writ large, across the entire cortex, preventing an unconstrained combinatorial explosion of associations among all attributes of all three or four simultaneously active chunks. Such hypothetical convergence to foci in local subpatch interactions might take place primarily in association cortex, and/or it might involve temporary shifts in response properties in some cortical subpatches. Quantitative studies of the densely packed cortical fine structure, by Braitenberg and Schuz, and others, seem potentially consistent with this vision of cortical function in cognition.
